    <title>How to watch Microsoft’s Windows 11 event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2wbc7b8rA19wjKXtXlEG_i11B8U=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497805/RWF5uB.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XCm3vF"&gt;Microsoft is hosting a special Windows event later today where we’re expecting the company to unveil Windows 11. Microsoft has been teasing a “next generation” of Windows for months, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu"&gt;leaked copy of Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; suggests we’re going to see a number of changes during Microsoft’s event today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDu2FZ"&gt;Microsoft is expected to focus on new UI improvements to Windows, including a new Start menu, rounded corners, and more simplifications to using Windows 11. We’re also expecting to hear more about a new Windows store that will offer better access to apps, and some multitasking and gaming improvements to Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gOLRnC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What to expect from Microsoft’s Windows 11 event","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543253/microsoft-windows-11-event-date-time-what-to-expect-rumors"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Mk2DaD"&gt;The event should run for around 45 minutes, which gives Microsoft enough time to talk through the important aspects of Windows 11 ahead of a deep dive for developers later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lu9iPJ"&gt;WHEN DOES THE WINDOWS 11 EVENT START?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GEHGpB"&gt;It starts at 11AM ET / 8AM PT / 4PM BST. Following the event, a special developer session will also be available to watch online at 3PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aFoXcC"&gt;WHERE CAN I WATCH THE WINDOWS 11 EVENT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="j0z316"&gt;We’ll embed the event livestream up top once it’s available. Otherwise, head to these links below for more:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beeple and the founder of Pitchfork are launching an NFT site where you can buy moments in time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A box containing a digital display, which shows an image of Andy Murray kissing a trophy after winning Wimbledon in 2013." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-xNMonweQnR03-w_3DlUiXBbTTA=/0x114:2732x1935/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497818/WENEW_Physical_Artifact_On_Display_3.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some sales include a digital display showcasing the moment being purchased.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Wenew&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z8dBgH"&gt;After selling an NFT &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;for $69 million&lt;/a&gt; in March, Beeple is making his next big move in the digital art space: he’s launching an NFT platform that’ll sell “iconic” moments in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjqWeV"&gt;The platform, called &lt;a href="https://we.new/"&gt;Wenew&lt;/a&gt;, is co-founded by Beeple and some longtime collaborators. They’re also bringing on Ryan Schreiber, the founder of &lt;em&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/em&gt;, as Wenew’s editor-in-chief. Schreiber will help curate the moments sold on the platform, which will include highlights from the careers of athletes and artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gJyxP"&gt;“We’re definitely looking at this as sort of immortalizing these moments of human achievement for collectors,” Schreiber told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The same display and box as above but presented on a shelf." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H_IUcPoGKPG0rr29dX1ocJTVjSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22676612/WENEW_Physical_Artifact_6.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wenew&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wenew calls the digital displays “physical artifacts.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ufzu1T"&gt;Wenew’s first NFT series catalogs Andy Murray’s journey to winning Wimbledon in 2013. You’ll be able to buy his emotional runner-up speech from 2012, some of Murray’s best shots from 2013, and his eventual victory speech, among others. Or to be more specific, you’ll be able to buy a limited-edition digital file &lt;em&gt;representing &lt;/em&gt;those moments since that’s all an NFT really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHimeQ"&gt;The NFTs will be priced from $49 to $4,999 each, and some of the more expensive ones will come with actual memorabilia — a signed poster, tickets to Wimbledon 2022, a replica trophy, or a digital display. At the very high end, Wenew will be auctioning off an NFT commemorating Murray’s game-winning point, and the buyer will also get 30 minutes to play tennis with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcS1yi"&gt;“A lot of things in the NFT world feel like a cash grab right now, and we wanted to put storytelling first,” Michael Figge, a Wenew co-founder, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ivhe5t"&gt;NFTs face a few perpetual questions — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;starting with, simply, “why?”&lt;/a&gt; — but Wenew at least tries to answer the question of “what are you actually buying?” The initial buyers get something real out of the purchase, in addition to the nominal bragging rights that typically accompany an NFT purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oRn58"&gt;The format is similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;NBA’s Top Shot&lt;/a&gt; platform, which turns game highlights into virtual trading cards (albeit without any IRL extras). They’ve been a huge success for the NBA so far, with more than $500 million in sales in just its first six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="KG1OwQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The potential to actually be able to make what they deserve to make”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iPebZu"&gt;Wenew wants to expand on that idea by reaching back in time and across different disciplines. The company plans to move into the music space, too, which is part of why Schreiber is on board. His job is to find major athletes and artists and build story arcs around them, identifying where NFTs can be sold along the way. The NFT sales will be accompanied by feature-length stories from journalists meant to explore why these events mattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UUYdS"&gt;There’s also the outstanding question of how many musicians Wenew can get on board. NFTs have been controversial in music spaces — “I don’t want people to bet on me like a racehorse,” Zola Jesus &lt;a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/article/11-indie-musicians-on-how-theyre-navigating-the-nft-wave/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last month — and broadly criticized by artists for their energy use and climate impact. Schreiber sees them as a way to “redefine” the relationship between artists and their benefactors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VEbi4O"&gt;“It offers them the potential to actually be able to make what they deserve to make, frankly, off of their work,” Schreiber said. Figge said the platform will include a carbon offset fee that “more than offsets that NFT’s transaction costs to the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PL0U6U"&gt;Wenew’s website launches today, and its first NFT sales begin on July 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ransom notes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-gI0yiEPC9ldpKFsIJ4b9qDKM-w=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497861/acastro_210616_4635_0001.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro and Grayson Blackmon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Ransomware funds more ransomware, so how do we stop it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4ZCXnv"&gt;Pretend, for a moment, that you are the president. This ransomware thing is escalating. Like, hackers screwed with the gas supply on the East Coast — nightmare! You’re going to have to make some policy decisions to make these attacks end because that’s the scale of the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDfoIB"&gt;Let’s begin with the obvious, uncontested fact: the number of ransomware attacks is going up because companies are paying the ransoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="viDYBB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The number of ransomware attacks is going up because companies are paying the ransoms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l47fo9"&gt;The Colonial Pipeline hack is a case in point. The company spent $4.3 million to unlock its computers. Ransomware is just extortion, after all. As the DarkSide collective put it in their &lt;a href="https://www.databreaches.net/we-are-apolitical-darkside-threat-actors/"&gt;weirdly corporate apology&lt;/a&gt; for shutting down Colonial Pipeline, “Our goal is to make money.” Major &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/inside-evil-corp-a-100m-cybercrime-menace/"&gt;cybercrime gang Evil Corp&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8835987/mr-robot-usa-pilot-rami-malek-christian-slater"&gt;&lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;branding btw — &lt;a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2019/12/12/the-fsb-s-personal-hackers"&gt;reportedly likes sick Lambos&lt;/a&gt;. Stopping ransomware is simple in that way: all you have to do is cut off the cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZ5StG"&gt;The question is &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;, and none of the choices are very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWCfWC"&gt;You could require the immediate disclosure of ransoms. You could ban paying ransoms outright. You could ban cryptocurrency, which is how most ransoms are paid. You could increase regulation around cryptocurrency and perhaps ban certain kinds of exchanges or transactions. You could try being better friends with Vladimir Putin, in the hopes that he might sacrifice some threat actors. Your Department of Defense has also probably come up with some separate terrible ideas, which I am frightened even to contemplate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCGxon"&gt;Every choice here hurts, at least in the short term. But let’s go through them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5bzMM5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immediate disclosure of ransom payments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="tVp51T"&gt;Legislators have been trying to get ransom disclosures done already, without much success. That’s probably because the public disclosure of a hack damages a company’s reputation. So right now, we actually don’t know the true extent of the ransomware problem because a lot of companies keep hacks quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dv1tNv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“And there goes my hopes for the leverage”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PQGGhb"&gt;Immediate disclosure would at least give us a better sense of what’s going on, but there would be a cost: hackers would get more leverage. Like, hackers create leverage &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; by making a hack’s existence public, which creates pressure on the company to get things back to normal — by paying up. Cybercriminals create leverage in uglier ways, too: emailing and calling employees or clients of the victim company to tell them about the hack, says Ali Arateh, managing director of Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EU8fT9"&gt;In early June, security researcher Kevin Beaumont tweeted that he’d send out a thread of the biggest ransomware and extortion victims — then he decided against it since some of the hacks weren’t public. “And there goes my hopes for the leverage,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GottMannus/status/1400234844777484289"&gt;tweeted back Mannus Gott&lt;/a&gt;, one of the ransomware groups in question, which had evidently been hoping for a public disclosure of their hack in order to better pressure the victim. “Yours was one I was looking at, at the time,” Beaumont replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="E35XLu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ban ransom payments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="K0HKbp"&gt;Right now, it is legal to pay ransom: it’s even tax-deductible, and the money often comes from a company’s cyber insurer. Banning ransoms in the US would cut off the cash supply for the criminals — probably getting them to change their focus to other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9i8uo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_advisory_10012020_1.pdf"&gt;This policy is in place already&lt;/a&gt;, in a piecemeal way. The leaders of Evil Corp were &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845"&gt;criminally sanctioned&lt;/a&gt; to prevent people from paying them ransom, not because Russia would extradite them. Similarly, the North Korean nationals &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287578/doj-fbi-north-korea-hack-wannacry-sony-pictures-the-interview"&gt;behind the Sony hack&lt;/a&gt; are beyond the US’s reach, though I’m sure law enforcement would be happy to pick them up if they took a vacation in a country with a US extradition treaty. If a company pays a sanctioned actor — or a sanctioned crypto wallet — it can put itself in legal jeopardy. But some still pay! About 15 percent of all ransomware payments, or about $50 million in cryptocurrency, were subject to sanctions liability, &lt;a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/ransomware-sanctions-risk-2021"&gt;according to Chainalysis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="7GmEWN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;About 1 in 4 companies that receive ransom demands actually pay&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4XGj7H"&gt;This piecemeal ban is also part of the reason we’ve seen the rise of affiliates — a banned actor like Evil Corp can sell its software product to a group that isn’t sanctioned in return for a cut of the ransom. &lt;em&gt;That &lt;/em&gt;group then carries out the hack and demands ransom, and the company pays a non-sanctioned wallet. It’s ransomware-as-a-service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jR2EdX"&gt;Still, making all ransom payments illegal &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; cut down the number of companies that hand over their money. Right now, about 1 in 4 companies that receive ransom demands actually pay, according to &lt;a href="https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/Gated-Assets/white-papers/sophos-the-state-of-ransomware-2020-wp.pdf"&gt;security firm Sophos&lt;/a&gt;. “In the long term, stopping ransom would probably halt this, but in the short term it would be very painful,” says Tom Robinson, the founder and chief scientific officer of Elliptic, a company that tracks cryptocurrency transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NtZO8w"&gt;It would be painful for the same reason that companies often pay the ransom: they might go out of business otherwise. Many hackers deliberately target companies’ backups, says Joshua Motta, co-founder and CEO of Coalition, a cyber insurer. If the company’s backups aren’t segmented away from the rest of the network, they may be vulnerable, he says. “It’s devastating,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNZTGL"&gt;And as if that weren’t enough, a lot of hacks double-dip — they steal data as well as encrypting systems. The data can then be sold for other attacks if the ransom isn’t paid, and it may include such sensitive information as Social Security numbers lifted from payroll data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaoGOy"&gt;It might also increase cyber insurance underwriting costs, though this is debatable. According to the Sophos survey, paying the ransom actually makes hacks &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; expensive because companies still have to do some pretty serious work to fix their systems and lock them down &lt;em&gt;on top of&lt;/em&gt; paying the ransom money. It’s unclear whether that would still be true if more companies have no choice but to rebuild their computer systems from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="l4Bq7Y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ban cryptocurrency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nlzy5l"&gt;Cryptocurrency’s role in the ransomware ecosystem has led some to call for &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ban-cryptocurrency-to-fight-ransomware-11621962831"&gt;banning cryptocurrency altogether&lt;/a&gt;. Others have suggested &lt;a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/how-start-disrupting-cryptocurrencies-mining-money-transmission"&gt;regulating cryptocurrency mining&lt;/a&gt; as money transmitters to make it more difficult to process ransom transactions. “I think it’s time for a whole-of-government ‘regulate it to death’ strategy, based on existing regulation,” says Nicholas Weaver, a computer security specialist at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California, in an email. This would also be a painful route to take — not only would it blow up people’s cryptocurrency investments, but it would nuke entire companies based on cryptocurrency, such as Coinbase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PCNdey"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ransomware as we know it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; heavily dependent on cryptocurrency&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="daAvOu"&gt;It’s also not clear that banning cryptocurrency would work; most cryptocurrency is decentralized. Banning it within US borders would remove a lot of the more above-board players who are currently compliant with know-your-customer measures, while the shadier exchanges based outside the US would continue operating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6rDWv"&gt;But ransomware as we know it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; heavily dependent on cryptocurrency. Ransom demands in traditional currency require banks or payment processors to be involved in the process, and they can intervene to halt payment. This was functionally what ended “screen lockers,” which demanded a credit card payment to unlock the victim’s computer, according to Ryan Olson, the VP of threat intelligence at Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42. Crypto doesn’t have the same oversight, and it also makes it easier to quickly move money across borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3S7c8"&gt;Right now, ransom payments are usually made in Bitcoin, though Samantha Levine, senior vice president at CAC Specialty’s cyber practice, tells me she’s also seen payments made in Ethereum and even Dogecoin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9K5ss"&gt;There is one silver lining to cryptocurrency as a ransomware payment method: public blockchains make cryptocurrency traceable. Some cryptocurrencies, called privacy coins, are harder to track. For instance, the DarkSide group responsible for the Colonial Pipeline hack &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-new-targeted-ransomware-demands-million-dollar-ransoms/"&gt;also would have accepted ransom in Monero&lt;/a&gt;, a privacy coin, but Monero doesn’t change hands as often as Bitcoin. That makes it difficult for companies to quickly acquire Monero to pay ransom. Instead, Colonial Pipeline paid 75 Bitcoin, or about $4.3 million. The FBI followed the transactions through the public blockchain to seize and recover $2.3 million in funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wG2FR8"&gt;If cryptocurrency is banned outright, a lot of the privacy initiatives in that world may suddenly get a lot more important. For instance, there are &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-new-targeted-ransomware-demands-million-dollar-ransoms/"&gt;services called mixers&lt;/a&gt; that let people &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocurrency-mixers-and-why-governments-may-want-to-shut-them-down"&gt;move their identified cryptocurrency to mingle with other transactions of roughly the same amount of money&lt;/a&gt;, ideally obfuscating the transaction history. Right now, most cryptocurrency players don’t use them — but if cryptocurrency becomes illegal, their use may very well rise. Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocurrency-mixers-and-why-governments-may-want-to-shut-them-down"&gt;has even suggested creating a mixer on the Ethereum chain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GW8eud"&gt;Another way to obscure transactions is to use a privacy wallet, such as Wasabi, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/europol-bitcoin-privacy-wasabi-wallet"&gt;with built-in capabilities&lt;/a&gt; to make transactions hard to follow. Driving all cryptocurrency use to these kinds of wallets would make it even more difficult to trace ransom payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="S5WvHD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stronger cryptocurrency regulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9O85RQ"&gt;At some point, criminals need to move out of cryptocurrency and back into traditional currency since that’s generally how one pays for Lamborghinis. Within the borders of the US, cryptocurrency is already regulated; reputable exchanges comply with know-your-customer laws aimed at preventing money laundering, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sb1pgX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;DarkSide, the group that was responsible for the Colonial Pipeline, “doesn’t eat in Russia”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IHZWdX"&gt;But not every exchange is based in the US, and some aren’t engaging in strict know-your-customer practices. More money associated with criminals went through the Binance exchange than any other, according to Chainalysis. Now the US government is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/binance-probed-by-u-s-as-money-laundering-tax-sleuths-bore-in?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;investigating it for money laundering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MT50b6"&gt;While ransomware players can be anywhere in the world, there are a few places where they cluster. DarkSide, the group that was responsible for the Colonial Pipeline, “doesn’t eat in Russia,” Brett Callow, an analyst at Emsisoft, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0afb53f0-f382-442a-9a32-02824ce8bb70"&gt;told the&lt;em&gt; Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Its ransomware software “checks the language used by the system and, if it’s Russian, it quits without encrypting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4YRJj"&gt;One way to dodge exchanges altogether is to make arrangements on darknet markets, such as Hydra. Someone might, for instance, bury rubles in a specific location — and then, when the threat actors hand over their bitcoin, they receive the coordinates to go dig the fiat currency up, says Robinson. But it’s hard to see what people are doing on Hydra — it’s also possible that some cybercriminals might buy tools they can then use in other attacks, effectively reinvesting in their business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="74bplu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International diplomacy and coordination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wg2PJ3"&gt;You could combat ransomware through international cooperation — after all, many hackers’ names and locations are known. They’re just not extraditable. But because hackers don’t target certain Eastern Bloc countries, those countries do not view ransomware as a serious problem, says Adam Meyers, Crowdstrike’s senior vice president of intelligence. “These people are paying taxes,” Meyers says. “I think there’s people protecting them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61OhbH"&gt;The Biden / Putin summit on June 16th underscores this difficulty. One of the outcomes of that meeting was to create meetings of cybersecurity experts who might decide certain kinds of infrastructure is “off-limits” to attacks, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/biden-putin-summit/2021/06/16/c2592718-ced4-11eb-9b7e-e06f6cfdece8_story.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But this is not the same thing as banning ransomware outright, or being able to pursue hackers, like those of Evil Corp, within Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAivEJ"&gt;In order to do that, it’s possible Putin will ask for significant concessions, such as lifting some US-imposed sanctions or otherwise making deals that benefit Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AtiLhc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="RZAQVC"&gt;So where does that leave you, the president? Nowhere good. But you’re going to have to put on your decision aviators because the hacks are increasing. Even cyber insurers can fall prey to ransomware. Cyber insurer &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/cna-financial-paid-40-million-in-ransom-after-march-cyberattack"&gt;CNA was hacked&lt;/a&gt; in March and paid a ransom of $40 million. The Asia division of cyber insurer &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4443da60-6d90-4d27-b300-b0896425f99f"&gt;Axa was hacked&lt;/a&gt; in May.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMyIiY"&gt;“We called 2020 the year of ransomware, and I’m wondering if I have to call 2021 the year of ransomware, too,” says Kim Grauer, director of research at Chainalysis. “We’re basically on track to surpass 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ByE57y"&gt;The trends she’s seen include asks for bigger ransoms and an increase in the average payments going to known ransomware wallets. And scarily, there’s more money being moved between ransomware strains and illicit service providers, says Grauer. Business is good, and the hackers are reinvesting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and Jio collaborate on ‘ultra-affordable’ JioPhone Next </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P5FA_zA0gVCFfN2dhM5-qxRqubM=/1x0:835x556/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497788/jiophone_next_google.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The JioPhone Next.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Jio Platforms&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kebl8C"&gt;Indian tech giant Jio Platforms has collaborated with Google on a new affordable smartphone called the JioPhone Next, Jio’s parent company Reliance announced today. The Next is aimed at helping the roughly 300 million users in India who are currently on 2G networks upgrade to 4G, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/google-and-jio-platforms-announce-worlds-cheapest-smartphone-jiophone-next/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. It will be released in India on September 10th, before coming to other markets at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMwfM7"&gt;Reliance chairman Mukesh Ambani said the JioPhone Next would be an “ultra-affordable 4G smartphone,” but didn’t reveal exact pricing or full specs for the device. However, the company did say it will include voice assistant support, translation features, and a camera with support for augmented reality. The phone is running on an optimized version of Android OS designed specifically for the device, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/new-android-smartphone-and-5g-partnership-jio/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/jiophone-next/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; has spotted&lt;/a&gt; that it appears to be using the Go-version of the Google Camera app, which indicates it shares some similarities with Google’s low-powered Android Go operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ML21zZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s running an optimized version of Android&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BmOZCA"&gt;Google and Jio first announced they were working together on an affordable smartphone last year, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325343/google-reliance-jio-investment-india-4-5-billion-dollars-7-percent-facebook"&gt;Google invested $4.5 million&lt;/a&gt; in Jio Platforms. Today, Google says its work with the company is also expanding thanks to a new partnership that will see Jio Platforms parent company Reliance make use of Google’s Cloud platform, shifting its core retail business onto Google’s infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuDM5G"&gt;The JioPhone Next is part of Google’s multi-year attempt to bring Android and its services to lower-powered, more affordable devices. It announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/26/5845562/android-one-google-the-next-billion"&gt;Android One initiative in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15649380/google-budget-android-phone-program-announced-io-2017"&gt;followed this up with Android Go&lt;/a&gt; three years later in 2017. It’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17513036/google-kaios-investment-feature-phones-firefox-os-apps-services-strategy"&gt;invested in KaiOS&lt;/a&gt;, an operating system designed for feature phones, in order to make its services available on even more basic devices. As more and more of the developing world comes online, Google is making a big effort to ensure it’s there to meet them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft needs to show Windows 11 is more than just Windows 10.5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-A4ae0FSSnuOh_RBV1YzFeeqVjg=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497680/windowslogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft Design (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNXa8X3Hf7v/?utm_medium=share_sheet" target="_blank"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new version of Windows is coming today&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GhKqsu"&gt;Microsoft is about to unveil Windows 11 this morning, the company’s next major operating system. While a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu"&gt;leak of Windows 11 has provided an early look&lt;/a&gt; at some of the design changes, I’m expecting to see a lot more today. A new Start menu, rounded corners, and a general UI overhaul have been expected for months, but Microsoft will need to show some big changes to Windows 11 to prove it’s more than just Windows 10 with a paint job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDbKso"&gt;A lot of what we’ve seen so far was already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230554/microsoft-windows-10x-leak-chrome-os-chromebooks-hands-on"&gt;planned for Windows 10X&lt;/a&gt;, a version of Windows that was originally going to ship with dual-screen devices. Windows 10X included a new Start menu that acted more like a launcher, which was centered on the taskbar. 10X also featured many simplifications to the UI, and general usability improvements to Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jA6dUF"&gt;After the pandemic hit, Microsoft quickly attempted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246561/microsoft-windows-10x-single-screens-windows-usage-demand-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;rework Windows 10X for laptops&lt;/a&gt;, to offer a more simplified version of its OS for devices that were suddenly in high demand for remote work and schooling. The Windows 10X attempt to simplify Windows and its app model didn’t work out. Sources familiar with the situation tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Microsoft had been struggling to hit an acceptable level of app compatibility with 10X over the past couple of years, after the company had originally planned to run every app in a special container to improve the security and performance of devices running the new OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xI6k5xCoGk3Cjzg7J2LDyTDIdXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22671569/windows11main.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Windows 11 Start menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mLNBX2"&gt;Containers would have been a significant change to Windows, especially for developers, and there’s no sign in the leaked Windows 11 build that Microsoft plans to implement containers any time soon. Instead, Windows 11 appears to be adopting most of the UI changes that were part of Windows 10X. The leaked Windows 11 build also includes some changes to multitasking, improved support for multiple monitors, and some possible performance improvements – particularly for PC gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHutKY"&gt;The most significant change in Windows 11 could be Microsoft’s approach to the apps it allows in the Windows store. The leaked version of Windows 11 doesn’t include the new store, but Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393655/microsoft-windows-app-store-overhaul-apps-games-rumor"&gt;rumored to be opening its store up to any Windows app&lt;/a&gt;. That means Chrome, Adobe Creative Suite, and many other apps that don’t exist in the Windows store will suddenly be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4Ylxw"&gt;Perhaps more significantly, Microsoft is also expected to allow devs to bypass its payment system for store apps. That means developers won’t have to give Microsoft a cut of their revenue for in-app purchases, if they decide to use their own payment systems. This would be a huge change, and one that would put even more pressure on Apple’s App Store, just after Microsoft has helped Epic Games argue that iPhones are general purpose devices just like PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mREKXnfTjMMzdbrBDYOJkjzA5RU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660603/win11snap.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Windows 11 multitasking UI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aSRhis"&gt;Beyond the store, I’m hoping to see Microsoft differentiate Windows 11 from Windows 10 with a focus on daily users of the OS. Productivity is a key part of this, as is making Windows easier and more reliable for the millions who use it to study and work each day. Apple impressed us earlier this month with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;, a simple way to use a keyboard and trackpad on a Mac to control an iPad. It makes dragging and dropping content between those devices really simple, and improves productivity if you’re using multiple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k189Ez"&gt;There are some hints in the leaked version of Windows 11 that there could be some multitasking improvements on the way. A new control appears on the maximize buttons in Windows 11 allowing you to quickly snap apps into place. These snap features have existed in Windows for years, though, so I’m hoping we’ll see even more changes to help Windows users improve their daily workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQczNZ"&gt;Beyond productivity, Windows is also used for PC gaming. A bigger effort to improve Windows 11 for gaming would be welcome news to the millions that use PCs instead of game consoles. The Xbox Game Bar and new Xbox app have been good additions, but the reality is that PC gaming is dominated by Steam and Discord. I’d like to see Microsoft recognize that, instead of trying to force Xbox-like experiences onto PC players. I think the Xbox Game Bar is a good step in the right direction, but there’s still much more Microsoft could do in Windows 11 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QoaCCDqFkXtfMPPSFuw9NtdI76c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21901326/twarren_rtx3080_2_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC gaming needs to be a Windows 11 focus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rci6rx"&gt;I’m hoping Microsoft improves its Game Mode in Windows 11. The mysterious feature simply “optimizes your PC for play,” but the reality is that it does very little. When you run a game with Game Mode enabled, it suppresses Windows Update from installing drivers or trying to reboot your PC, and mysteriously “helps achieve a more stable frame rate depending on the specific game and system.” It doesn’t go far enough to limit other apps from hogging your CPU or even GPU resources, though. PC gamers often disable services, limit apps, and play with the registry instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhEkqL"&gt;Beyond these key areas, I’d also like to see Microsoft improve some of the fundamentals in Windows 11. I still have to dig into the registry to flip the direction of my mouse scroll wheel. While some mice include drivers that will change the direction, Windows doesn’t. It’s a bizarre omission, and there are many examples across Windows where Microsoft could do a better job of cleaning the OS up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdQ3cH"&gt;One of those is Settings, where I’m often thrown into the ancient world of the Control Panel to adjust settings. Microsoft keeps Control Panel around for its impressive legacy support, but it should be something you really need to dig for, not an area you randomly stumble upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pfKLdqjUXFh6HSgFzTiybO1-gs4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19986222/windowslinux.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 will likely include some big dev changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AGPUKi"&gt;I’m expecting Microsoft to have some surprises for Windows 11 that prove it’s not just a Windows 10.5, too. Microsoft employee Miguel de Icaza &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/23/windows-11-what-to-expect.html"&gt;teased on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that the company will discuss something he’s spent years pushing for, before later deleting the tweet. It’s a mysterious tease for such a big event. De Icaza co-founded Xamarin, a tool for building mobile apps that can work across iOS and Android. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/24/11109942/microsoft-xamarin-acquisition-mobile-app-development"&gt;acquired Xamarin back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has been improving its developer support in Windows ever since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onyE9c"&gt;We’re bound to hear about improvements for Windows developers in Windows 11, and perhaps even some changes to Microsoft’s Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396018/microsoft-windows-10-linux-gui-apps-task-manager-app-throttling-features"&gt;Linux GUI apps are on the way to Windows&lt;/a&gt;, and Microsoft is also holding a separate Windows developer-focused event today, so there’s likely to be a significant dev announcement coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="su1zyl"&gt;Microsoft’s Windows 11 event will run for around 45 minutes start at 11AM ET today, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all the news live as it happens.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rembrandt’s Night Watch uncropped by AI 300 years after it was trimmed  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E5aK20j5oPm0cZ-rqSrd9kb0A2s=/88x0:1038x633/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497668/ZHZ3Zc2e0p.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Margins from all four sides were removed decades after the painting was completed. &lt;/em&gt; | Video: Rijksmuseum&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2utOcb"&gt;A mixture of artificial intelligence and painstaking research has allowed researchers to restore Rembrandt van Rijn’s &lt;em&gt;The Night Watch &lt;/em&gt;to its original size, the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-lifestyle-travel-technology-arts-and-entertainment-d9312050e505c720b8870f0ad0608609"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, centuries after it was trimmed down to fit in a smaller wall. The work was conducted as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/whats-on/exhibitions/operation-night-watch/story/missing-pieces"&gt;Operation Night Watch project&lt;/a&gt;, and the results are being exhibited in the Honor Gallery in Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum, which sees the original painting flanked by printed strips filling in the lost sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvoiEa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Night Watch&lt;/em&gt; was originally completed in 1642, after which it was hung in the club house of the civil militia it was based on. But 70 years later it was moved to a new location, where there wasn’t space for the whole painting and it was unceremoniously cropped to fit. A significant portion was removed from its left-hand side, along with slivers of its top, bottom, and right.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Euuc7kq41AFG8S1e9_HHOzv1uWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22678621/msedge_nsSP57pniz.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Rijksmuseum&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The painting, with its missing sides restored.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TpZ9lG"&gt;Although the missing pieces of canvas have never been recovered, &lt;em&gt;AP &lt;/em&gt;reports that researchers were able to reconstruct them thanks to a smaller copy of the original painted at the time by Gerrit Lundens. Over the course of nearly two years, scans, X-rays and 528 digital exposures were taken of Rembrandt’s original painting to train an AI model to imitate Rembrandt’s style and fill in the blanks based on Lundens’ copy. “Rembrandt would have definitely done it more beautifully, but this comes very close,” museum director Taco Dibbits said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdkeEL"&gt;It means that when visitors are able to view the restored painting over the coming months at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, they’ll be able to see new details in the margins of the painting. There are two new faces present on its left, where there’s also a small child which can be seen leaning on a railing, rather than simply running out of frame. The work sheds new light on the painting, over three hundreds years after the Dutch masterpiece was unceremoniously mangled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YMu8VM"&gt;If you’re not able to make it to Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum to view the work in person, the museum recently put out a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/5/12/21255917/rembrandts-night-watch-high-res-painting-scan-released-rijksmuseum"&gt;high-resolution scan&lt;/a&gt; of the (cropped) painting, which is detailed enough that you can see its individual brushstrokes and cracks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="E1SnOd"&gt;In an era before multitouch displays, the iPod’s click wheel was the king of music playback control. Now, a new project from frontend software developer Tanner Villarete has attempted to emulate its classic controls &lt;a href="https://tannerv.com/ipod/"&gt;as a web app&lt;/a&gt;, complete with support for your Spotify and Apple Music library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrKaLi"&gt;It’s fantastically simple, using your mouse or finger on a touchscreen to emulate the classic controls. You’ll need to sign in using an Apple Music or Spotify Account, and then it’s a simple case of using the virtual click wheel to select and listen to a selection of your most listened-to artists. It even supports the iPod’s classic “Cover Flow” interface, letting you to flip through album covers like a jukebox. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hP_hg_8nKMgRMrqrUd8Flpzsp80=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22678584/msedge_qAYmQ76Ggy.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: tannerv.com/ipod&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And yes, it totally has a built-in Brick Breaker clone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BPYGOk"&gt;Now, obviously there’s a reason why modern apps don’t use click wheel interfaces. Using the touch-sensitive wheel via a phone’s web browser feels ok, but on desktop having to drag a mouse around a virtual circle feels &lt;em&gt;inefficient&lt;/em&gt; at best. It’s at its worst when loading up the virtual iPod’s built-in Brick Breaker game clone (which, sidenote, also rips). But as a nostalgic trip down memory lane? Perfection. The project is &lt;a href="https://github.com/tvillarete/ipod-classic-js"&gt;on GitHub here&lt;/a&gt; if you want to have a poke around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pp7NO"&gt;Apple killed off the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/4715274/ipod-classic-discontinued-a-visual-history"&gt;classic iPod design in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. It now sells just one iPod branded device, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18656480/apple-ipod-touch-7th-generation-2019-update-review"&gt;iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt;, which in terms of hardware is effectively a dated iPhone with no cellular connectivity, biometric authentication, or other modern features. We’d love to see the classic design return, but according to Apple CEO Tim Cook, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/28/7082095/tim-cook-says-apple-killed-the-ipod-classic-because-it-couldnt-get"&gt;simply couldn’t get the parts anymore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZCPJd"&gt;Let’s just hope Apple doesn’t kill the project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21024729/apple-rewound-app-iphone-ipod-click-wheel-web-android-not-available"&gt;like it did Rewound&lt;/a&gt;, the music player app that &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; attempted to bring back the iPod’s classic control scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will now consider letting your video, music or book app evade its 30 percent cut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hbvV9itQN-i2gylIp5LutflNPgA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497430/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yxID6C"&gt;Google is &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/continuing-to-boost-developer-success.html"&gt;opening up applications to a new program&lt;/a&gt; for developers of media apps that lets them keep more of what they earn — paying a lower 15 percent commission to Google in exchange for supporting certain platforms and features (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/06/23/google-play-media-experience-program/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rk8Ocm"&gt;The Play Media Experience Program is another way to get around the company’s 30 percent service fee, and it’s also an admission that the Google had already been cutting deals with some developers behind the scenes; Google is positioning it as the global expansion of a program that was previously invite-only, though it doesn’t seem to have mentioned it before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFXAkZ"&gt;If that sounds familiar, you might be thinking of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206400/apple-tax-amazon-tv-prime-30-percent-developers"&gt;how Amazon managed to evade Apple’s App Store tax&lt;/a&gt;. Apple, too, explained that it had an “established” program for premium video apps, despite having never mentioned its existence publicly. But Google’s system does have some key differences, like how it also seems to be designed to push developers to better support multiple Google platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xq8Q4l"&gt;While Google tells us it isn’t exactly forcing developers to support Google TV, Wear OS, Android Auto and the like, it’s asking them to support the following features and platforms where it makes sense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="cWzq4d"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Video: &lt;/strong&gt;Developers for living room-first video services are encouraged to build apps for Android TV, Google TV, and Google Cast, with “cross device playback” and sign-in integrations. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="meVzaT"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Audio: &lt;/strong&gt;Developers for premium music and audio content via subscriptions are encouraged to build apps for Wear OS, Android Auto, Android TV, and Google Cast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sa31QE"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Books: &lt;/strong&gt;Developers offering premium books, audiobooks, and comics should make tablet and foldable device optimizations, integrate with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420405/google-entertainment-space-announced-android-tablets"&gt;Entertainment Space&lt;/a&gt;, and for audiobook services, build apps for Wear OS and Android Auto.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="hge8CF"&gt;Google also lists &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/console/about/mediaprogram/"&gt;specific eligibility requirements on its site&lt;/a&gt; that may disqualify many smaller developers, like requiring over 100,000 monthly active installs, and a good rating in the Play Store. Also, despite what Google told us, it does publicly list some of its platforms as “required integrations,” and Google is ultimately still making the final call on which companies are approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YXJcA"&gt;It’s not clear whether these apps will be able to skirt Google’s in-app billing system, something Apple’s program allows. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21472139/google-android-12-app-store-installation-payment-fees"&gt;Last year, Google set a deadline of September 30th, 2021&lt;/a&gt; for all developers to adopt Google in-app purchases if they sell digital goods. Netflix and Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/technology/google-play-store-30-percent.html"&gt;had reportedly already been evading Google’s 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; by directly accepting credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPJ9Ux"&gt;Google has mirrored other Apple olive branches to developers as well. The company announced in March that developers’ first $1 million in revenue every year would be eligible for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;a lower 15 percent commission&lt;/a&gt;. Apple offers a similar 15 percent fee arrangement for developers that apply to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;. Both companies already reduce their 30 percent cut to 15 percent when it comes to subscription services, as long as any given customer has been subscribed for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0S83fn"&gt;While all these offers seem good for developers, they also show that things haven’t exactly been equal for a while. Both companies still wield the ultimate power, and if you’re too big to ignore, you may have already gotten a better deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nle8pM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Nord CE 5G review: stripped down, stripped back</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Gain a headphone jack, lose some unnecessary cameras  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="EJ3x77"&gt;One year after OnePlus loudly stepped into the midrange and entry-level phone market with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;OnePlus Nord&lt;/a&gt;, it’s back with the OnePlus Nord CE 5G. That “CE” at the end of its name stands for “Core Edition.” OnePlus claims the new phone strips back some of its predecessor’s less necessary features to focus on offering its “core” features at a more affordable price, similar to what Samsung offers with its “FE” (fan edition) devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6Cb6R"&gt;First and foremost that means the Nord CE comes with a more affordable &lt;a href="https://onepluscom.pxf.io/c/482924/1086811/12532?sharedid=VergeOnePlusNordCE5gReview062121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fuk%2Foneplus-nord-ce-5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;£299&lt;/a&gt; / €329 starting price, down from £379 / €399 for last year’s phone. It keeps the 1080p 90Hz OLED display, and even adds a headphone jack, but it’s got one fewer camera on both the front and the back, and a less premium design with a plastic rear panel instead of glass. Alongside the £299 model, which gets you 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, there’s also a £369 / €399 model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. I’ve been using the 12GB version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLoKhg"&gt;Like the original Nord, the OnePlus Nord CE is only getting a release in Europe and India, while US buyers instead have the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22533723/oneplus-n200-5g-price-specs-availability"&gt;Nord N200&lt;/a&gt; coming later this month. The question for all of them is whether OnePlus has stripped back one feature too many or has it found the right balance of price and performance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lmEqkb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10616763"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fGclCO"&gt;Look at the Nord CE next to last year’s phone and it’s clear they’re cut from the same design cloth. Both have an edge-to-edge OLED display on the front with minimal bezels, selfie cameras in a hole-punch to the top left of their screens, and a rear camera bump that arranges their sensors into a line. Like the original Nord, there’s no official IP rating for dust and water resistance, and no wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VodIGf"&gt;Peer closer, however, and the differences become more obvious. For starters, there’s now only one selfie camera on the phone: the original Nord’s secondary ultrawide camera is gone, while the main selfie camera’s resolution has been bumped down from 32 megapixels to 16. On the back the main camera’s resolution has increased from 48 to 64 megapixels, and there’s still an 8-megapixel ultrawide, but the 5-megapixel depth and 2-megapixel macro sensors are gone, replaced with a single 2-megapixel monochrome sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hpT64"&gt;The Nord CE is a slender device to hold. OnePlus claims this is the thinnest phone it’s made since the OnePlus 6T, and at 170g (6oz) it feels relatively light considering its 6.43-inch screen. It’s tempting to claim that heavier devices feel somehow higher quality, but I think there’s something to be said for a device that’s thin and light enough that you can forget about it when it’s sitting in your pocket. Despite its thinness, the Nord CE includes a headphone jack, which was absent on last year’s phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-OHTjlnf_R4R8ZL60fPR5LOuR6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674753/jporter_210621_4640_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus claims this is its thinnest phone since 2018’s 6T.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/btYOSU4eH0zb5wGpMUVPwhme5II=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674752/jporter_210621_4640_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It might have one fewer cameras, but otherwise the Nord CE’s design is very similar to the original Nord. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YHXo6J"&gt;The Nord CE’s battery is also technically bigger than last year’s Nord at 4,300mAh. But in my testing its battery life worked out a little worse in everyday usage. While the original Nord got upward of eight hours of screentime, the Nord CE was closer to six and a half in my experience. That was still enough to get me through a day’s use of Twitter, Slack, and WhatsApp with some battery to spare, and after a weekend of lighter usage, the phone lasted me until the middle of Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6HxI5"&gt;For charging, the OnePlus Nord CE 5G uses the Warp Charge 30T Plus fast-charging standard, so you won’t see the kinds of ultra-fast charging speeds we saw with the 65W-compatible OnePlus 8T and 9. Warp Charge 30T Plus is still fast enough to charge the Nord CE from 0 to 99 percent in an hour. In my testing it hit 32 percent after 15 minutes, 64 percent after 30, and 88 after 45. That should be fast enough for all but the most demanding of users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UntEOG"&gt;Similar to battery life, which came out slightly worse despite ostensibly having better hardware, the overall performance of the Nord CE was a little more sluggish than last year’s phone. The CE is powered by a Snapdragon 750G processor. As you might guess from its name, the new processor technically sits further down Qualcomm’s range than the 765G in last year’s phone. But because it’s a more modern chip, OnePlus claims it’s actually faster, with 20 percent better CPU performance and 10 percent better GPU performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DmERc4Aay8stUGcMFS3CeJ1YFZg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674755/jporter_210621_4640_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biometric security is handled with an in-display fingerprint sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mYnHAYx-Mcd_O5MfvwQynpBLii4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674754/jporter_210621_4640_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nord CE’s camera bump.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xlNYX8"&gt;The switch has addressed one of my quibbles with the original Nord, which was that its display would hitch slightly when quickly scrolling through an app like Twitter, impacting the otherwise silky smoothness of its high refresh rate display. But the Nord CE’s performance just didn’t feel as snappy overall. Hopping between apps would occasionally cause the interface to hitch slightly or stutter as the system keyboard loaded in. That’s not an unusual tradeoff at this price (we observed similar performance with last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;, for example), but it’s worth mentioning in light of OnePlus’ claims about performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Izfsu"&gt;For the most part I think OnePlus has made some smart decisions with how to approach cameras on the Nord CE, even though, unfortunately, OnePlus’ much advertised partnership with Hasselblad with the recent OnePlus 9 hasn’t brought any benefits here. Three rear cameras is a more reasonable amount of cameras compared to the overkill of four on the original Nord. OnePlus has still allowed itself one useless rear camera on the Nord CE — a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor — but it’s easy to ignore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WlsE3"&gt;Personally, I would have loved to see the ultrawide selfie camera return from the first Nord. It might not have been the most useful feature on an everyday basis, but it’s always great to have around when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EzBtfw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10616455"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FKLu4G"&gt;Otherwise, I generally liked the photos I got out of the Nord CE. Daytime shots are bright and vibrant, even if the phone tends to lose some detail in shadows. In particular, colors are handled accurately when it comes to landscapes, with my only complaint being a slightly over-processed look I got when photographing trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDXMdX"&gt;But it’s in the edge cases where the Nord CE’s cameras stumble. Trying to take close-up shots of flowers left the phone struggling to make things look crisp and sharp, and faces had an unnatural smoothness to them. It can also struggle with detail in low light, like in the shot above of an apartment block where many of the individual railings aren’t discernible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ip1c0lYu2ROrdrRmmiLPCb8r0nQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674751/jporter_210621_4640_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, it has a headphone jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eaKYVx8ertnorwQrSk3xZ4tjZps=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674750/jporter_210621_4640_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available colors include blue (pictured), black, and silver.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kDGQwh"&gt;On paper, there shouldn’t be any competition between the OnePlus Nord CE 5G and the original OnePlus Nord. It’s the less expensive phone that still offers a high-refresh rate OLED display, 5G, plus improvements like a headphone jack, a higher resolution main camera, a bigger battery, and a faster processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1OAZD"&gt;But in practice the Nord CE just doesn’t feel as polished as the original Nord did. Its battery might be bigger, but you don’t get any more usage out of it, and its processor is technically faster but still leaves the phone hitching in heavy usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AB7stW"&gt;Those might be reasonable compromises considering the price difference, but as of this writing the original OnePlus Nord is available at a discounted £299 (about $418) price point &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/OnePlus-SIM-Free-Smartphone-Camera-Warranty/dp/B08BPGX4B2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Amazon UK&lt;/a&gt;. At that price, the original Nord feels like the better option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="5X1eHz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10620114"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Lenovo made a wireless charger for your laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sew8VjSvFkcnV0hCLzVP0e8_0LE=/0x0:2100x1400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497384/Screenshot_2021_06_24_at_15.18.45.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bg2Y7S"&gt;Lenovo has announced a new product called the Go Wireless Charging Kit, which lets you retrofit wireless charging functionality to a wide variety of laptops. It makes use of “Power by Contact” technology from Energy Square, rather than the more common Qi standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzneP1"&gt;The kit consists of a 3.2mm-thick brushed metal charging mat that you plug into the wall and leave at your desk, as well as a long wireless charging receiver that attaches to the base of your laptop and connects over USB-C. Once set up, Lenovo says it should charge most 13-inch to 14-inch “non-touch notebooks of up to 65W” with efficiency of 93 percent, and it’ll work with both Windows and macOS devices. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i30wzLO4H8xfFUsRUHss8S0dojQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22678555/02_Lenovo_Go_USB_C_Wireless_Charging_Kit_Mat_Dongle_Hero_Front.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x6zjKJ"&gt;Wireless charging on laptops is pretty rare. Dell released what it called the world’s first wirelessly charging 2-in-1, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/11/15955350/dell-latitude-7000-price-availability-wireless-charging"&gt;the Latitude 7285&lt;/a&gt;, in 2017, although it was more of a tablet that could be charged through a keyboard base. Intel also made efforts to integrate the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/20/5430310/a4wp-wireless-ultrabook-charging-dell-joins"&gt;Rezence&lt;/a&gt; magnetic resonance charging standard into its laptop specifications, but nothing was ever released commercially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vx2meT"&gt;Lenovo will release the Go Wireless Charging Kit in October for $139.99. It’s part of a new range of Go-branded mobile accessories including a Qi-equipped power bank, wireless mice, headphones, and keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
