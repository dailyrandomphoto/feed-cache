    <title>Uber teaming up with Rosetta Stone to offer free language courses to drivers </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RQFz5C"&gt;Uber is teaming up with popular language service Rosetta Stone to provide free classes to drivers and couriers, the company announced Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnF2lz"&gt;The deal is being extended to drivers and delivery workers in select markets where Uber operates. Rosetta’s digital language learning programs, which cover 24 languages, will be fully integrated into the Uber app used by its workers. And the company is working with Rosetta on developing language skills directly related to their work as ride-share drivers and delivery workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tgHMC"&gt;Drivers have previously been able to take English-language courses as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/1/18047746/uber-driver-high-performing-earnings-free-college-tuition-pro"&gt;Uber Pro&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s rewards program for drivers. The new language services are part of a broader effort by the ride-hailing company to improve relations with its drivers, as well as offer incentives to sign on to the platform amid a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371850/uber-lyft-driver-shortage-covid-bonus-stimulus"&gt;nationwide shortage of Uber drivers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="W0jKtU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Part of a broader effort to address a nationwide shortage of drivers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ij2Brw"&gt;In many cities, a majority of the people who drive for Uber are immigrants. In London, 82 percent of drivers are immigrants, while the number in New York City is 90 percent. Uber says it wants to give its workers the ability to learn a new language on the job, which could help them secure more full-time employment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkHdJ5"&gt;To further help drivers in finding a new job, Uber is offering letters that describe the work they’ve done while working for the company. The letter, which will be on Uber’s letterhead, will include details such as when they first signed up to use the app, the number of trips or deliveries they’ve done, their average customer rating, and top feedback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMk87n"&gt;But naturally, Uber would prefer people stay logged on to its app, and the company is offering cash payments as an added bonus. Earlier this year, the company said it would spend $250 million on a “stimulus” for drivers in the hopes of luring COVID-wary workers back to the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9zeyk"&gt;Language services are certainly one piece of this effort; Uber’s head of driver operations told &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-lyft-sweeten-job-perks-amid-driver-shortage-lofty-fares-11625223601"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; recently&lt;/a&gt; the company would fund education and career-building programs for drivers in an effort to address the shortage of workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzZJIi"&gt;Uber drivers are independent contractors who lack many of the benefits and protections of salaried employment. The company argues this gives drivers the flexibility to work at their leisure and be their own boss, but some drivers feel as if they’re at the mercy of Uber’s algorithm. US-based drivers seeking to be reclassified as employees have been stymied by &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-02-03/california-supreme-court-throws-out-prop-22-challenge"&gt;the courts&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;the ballot box&lt;/a&gt;, but some are still seeking better protections. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The children of tech’s guest workers are pushing for immigration relief</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x6B9reJsgkzffx2kNfFhvez12VA=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69649699/VRG_4679_TechWorkers_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘Documented Dreamers’ have few good options after aging out of dependent visas&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="9qFiD0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="uZqmaP"&gt;As a kid, Naga Sreeram would spend all his time at his friend’s garage in San Jose, California, building Lego machines and coding them for his school robotics team. In high school, he taught himself web development and created apps that won competitions. But despite his passion for computer science and presence in Silicon Valley, his dream of working in the global tech hub remains on shaky ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7aJ3v"&gt;Sreeram came to the United States from India in 2007, at age seven. He was accompanying his father, who had obtained an H-1B work visa, as foreigners employed in the U.S. tech industry often do. Now, at 21, Sreeram has aged out of his dependent visa and has no clear pathway to citizenship. His only options are to “self-deport” and return to a country he no longer knows, or scramble for legal ways to stay that are neither easy nor guaranteed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36Iauo"&gt;“I’m scared that I will have to leave the country without ever even working in Silicon Valley,” he says, “and that would be a huge disappointment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9nSddI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No one seems to understand how it’s possible to grow up in this country with a documented status, but still have no clear path to citizenship.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mXUDGg"&gt;An estimated 200,000 children of foreign workers are in the same situation: They grow up in the United States but fall through the cracks of a broken immigration system. Realizing that they’re facing a dead end, many of these young people have banded together to work for lasting change in the immigration system, putting new pressure on Congress and the White House for a path forward. It’s not at the center of anyone’s immigration reform plan — but for this cohort of young people, it’s a political fight that will shape the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TX16l"&gt;Sreeram and others in this demographic call themselves “documented dreamers,” positioning themselves similarly to undocumented activists who came here as children, called “Dreamers” after a bill first drafted in 2001 that sought to provide them relief. While conceding that they may be better off in some ways, “documented dreamers” argue that they, too, are the victims of an unfair system and should be included in any existing and future fixes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4G0XmW"&gt;“No one seems to understand how it’s possible to grow up in this country with a documented status, but still have no clear path to citizenship,” says Lakshmi Parvathinathan, 18, a sophomore at Drexel University majoring in biological sciences. Parvathinathan first came to the United States with her H-1B holder parents when she was three years old. “Everyone kind of just assumes, like, ‘Oh, you’ve been here for your whole life, you’re set,’” she says. “But unfortunately, that’s not the case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6bZyGM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A critical mass of young people with similar experiences&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XFzi4z"&gt;Both Parvathinathan and Sreeram have joined advocacy efforts at “Improve the Dream,” a coalition of young people hoping to garner more attention for this issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqzyKJ"&gt;The group was started by Dip Patel, who was born in India but naturalized in Canada. His parents came on an E-2 investor’s visa around 15 years ago, which allowed them to start a small business — a convenience store in southern Illinois. But it soon became clear to him that he was approaching the end of the line as far as immigration was concerned. When Patel was in high school in 2010, a version of the DREAM Act passed the House, but it &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2010/12/dream-act-dies-in-senate-046573"&gt;failed in the Senate&lt;/a&gt;. He was crestfallen because he had wrongly assumed that he, too, qualified for relief under that legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ioUfB4"&gt;In 2012, the Obama administration launched the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initiative, offering the temporary ability to stay and work for certain eligible undocumented immigrants. Again, Patel found that the protection did not apply to him. “Improve the Dream” was born in 2017 as a culmination of these incremental realizations that the policy solutions out there did not extend to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wX5khZ"&gt;Over the years, Patel has brought together a critical mass of young people with similar experiences through digital outreach. One of the first online platforms where he connected with other “documented dreamers” was a Facebook group meant for their parents. Later, through WhatsApp networks, Patel shared &lt;a href="https://www.improvethedream.org/survey"&gt;surveys&lt;/a&gt; to gather data on the experiences of such immigrants. Now, there’s a Slack with over 300 young immigrants working together on awareness campaigns and sharing information. Many — from India, Zambia, Mexico, Colombia, and South Korea — feature prominently on the group’s website, telling their stories. Others contribute behind the scenes as well; Sreeram, for example, helped code the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="o14LJd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We must not leave these young people and their valuable contributions to our communities behind.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sr8rvR"&gt;Congress alone can implement permanent fixes, which is why Patel and the others have been sending emails, making phone calls, and holding in-person and virtual meetings to educate congressional staff for years. This year, these efforts have borne fruit: the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ImproveTheDream/status/1367274089153495041"&gt;American Dream and Promise Act of 2021&lt;/a&gt;, the latest version of DREAM legislation, protects not just undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children, but also those who came on temporary visas. It passed the House &lt;a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2021/03/18/house-passes-immigration-bill-to-help-dreamers/"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;. The White House endorsed the legislation, &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/18/statement-by-president-biden-on-the-american-dream-and-promise-act-of-2021/"&gt;calling it&lt;/a&gt; a “critical first step in reforming our immigration system.” Despite the fact that the Senate version of the bill does not yet include children of visa holders, this was a big win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jQZ1M"&gt;Then, in April, for the first time, the issue was the &lt;a href="https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=112515"&gt;subject of a House Judiciary Committee hearing&lt;/a&gt;. In July, a bipartisan group of House representatives introduced &lt;a href="https://ross.house.gov/media/press-releases/representatives-ross-miller-meeks-krishnamoorthi-kim-introduce-bipartisan"&gt;separate legislation&lt;/a&gt; specifically addressing children of visa holders.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The $3.5 trillion reconciliation agreement on infrastructure between the Democrats and the White House in July will also include language from H.R. 6, the House version of the American Dream and Promise Act, according to the office of Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), although it’s not clear how much Republican support that package will lose as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78bylC"&gt;The easiest and quickest stopgap measure, however, could come through the Biden administration. Tweaking the language of the DACA guidelines so that children of visa holders could also apply is the top recommendation some House Democrats have made in &lt;a href="https://ross.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/ross.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Documented%20Dreamers%20Letter%20to%20DHS%206.25.21.pdf"&gt;a recent Congressional letter&lt;/a&gt; to the Homeland Security secretary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6Mf0M"&gt;Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California whose district includes Silicon Valley, signed on to the letter and says he’ll continue to push the issue in Washington. “Immigrants have brought to Silicon Valley and communities across America transformative ideas that are helping to change the world,” Khanna told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Documented dreamers are no exception, and like traditional Dreamers, Documented Dreamers know America as their only home, but are not eligible for protection under DACA. We must not leave these young people and their valuable contributions to our communities behind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzEKfQ"&gt;Around 70 percent of the 500-plus “documented dreamers” Patel surveyed are children of H-1B workers, stuck in a &lt;a href="https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/immigration-wait-times-quotas-have-doubled-green-card-backlogs-are-long"&gt;decades-long employment-based green card backlog&lt;/a&gt; with their parents. In 2020, over &lt;a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/employment-based-green-card-backlog-hits-12-million-2020"&gt;1.2 million&lt;/a&gt; applicants were in this queue — a majority of them from India and China, according to an analysis by David Bier, a research associate at the libertarian Cato Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIJGPz"&gt;When they “age out” at 21, kids of these green card holders are ejected from the queue. To stay, they have to apply for other types of temporary visas, each with its own set of complications. If they spring for a student visa, they have to prove “&lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/isso/travel-visas/apply-for-a-visa/initial-visa-application/intent/"&gt;nonimmigrant intent&lt;/a&gt;” — meaning they have to demonstrate they want to return to their country of citizenship. Apart from being a cruel twist of irony, this is a tall order, as these applicants are often deeply rooted in the United States. If they apply for the H-1B, these young people have to face an unpredictable annual lottery through which the visa has been doled out in recent years. Even if they get lucky in this lottery, they’re doomed to walk in their parents’ footsteps, potentially ending up in the green card backlog again many years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KG1CTc"&gt;While they navigate this Sisyphean mountain of paperwork, these young immigrants lose money, time, certainty, and opportunities. They are often disqualified from in-state tuition, jobs, and fellowships. Parvathinathan remembers how the full weight of the restrictions on her future hit her in high school, and none of the adults around knew how to help. “It was just really a stressful time, growing up, because my future in this country wasn’t guaranteed,” says Parvathinathan, who lived outside of Philadelphia at the time. “And it didn’t seem like there was anything that I could do to make it guaranteed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qtbPQ6"&gt;Congress hasn’t passed significant immigration legislation since the 1990s, and one of the many consequences is the legal limbo that young people like Parvathinathan find themselves in. “What it shows about the legal immigration system is that it is incredibly constrained and woefully outdated,” Bier says. “And much of the many problems in the immigration system are products of neglect, rather than conscious design.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This is Beast Canyon, the evolution of Intel’s modular mini gaming PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LDQ3RODbacggp73sYtyGsVLd1PA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69649707/shollister_210727_4681_0033_3x2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;This 8-liter desktop upgrades in a snap&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QxEiue"&gt;Building your own gaming PC is a labor of love. It’s not something that needs to be “easier,” exactly. But from the moment I set a screwdriver to Intel’s new NUC 11 Extreme, aka “Beast Canyon,” I couldn’t help marveling at how brilliant a eight-liter gaming machine can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4iBJwj"&gt;Beast Canyon is Intel’s fourth attempt to design a more compact gaming PC than most gamers could dream of building on their own, and paradoxically, it’s Intel’s biggest chassis yet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21051879/intel-pc-nuc-9-extreme-ghost-canyon-element-hands-on-teardown-ces-2020"&gt;Like last year’s Ghost Canyon&lt;/a&gt;, it’s attempting to change the way mini-PCs are built with its Compute Element cartridges, which contains a miniaturized motherboard, CPU, memory, storage, and ports you can swap all at once. That way, you can theoretically upgrade your entire system just like you’d upgrade a graphics card, right down to plugging it into a PCI-Express slot. (As I’ll explain, the truth may be a little more complicated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="1BwlMt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10675233"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VNws3a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NUC 8, “Hades Canyon”","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/14/17346234/intel-nuc-8-pc-gaming-amd-vega-review"},{"title":"NUC 9 Extreme, “Ghost Canyon”","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21051879/intel-pc-nuc-9-extreme-ghost-canyon-element-hands-on-teardown-ces-2020"},{"title":"NUC 11 Enthusiast, “Phantom Canyon”","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231244/intel-nuc-11-pc-announcement-includes-mini-gaming-computer"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VyfdU5"&gt;Where Ghost was a 5-liter rounded rectangular prism that barely fit an 8-inch-long graphics card, Beast lives up to its name with room for 12 inches of GPU power and an included 650-watt 80+ Gold power supply. It was enough to let me &lt;em&gt;easily &lt;/em&gt;fit and sufficiently power one of the most powerful GPUs on the market, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founder’s Edition, and it instantly takes this box’s gaming cred far beyond Intel’s previous attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhyWWx"&gt;That extra room and power is important, because the upgrade options for a smaller 5-liter box like the Ghost haven’t been looking that hot. While some of Nvidia and AMD’s most powerful cards in prior years have shrunken down to fit tiny cases, the latest batch of RTX 3000 and AMD 6000 series GPUs have gone the opposite direction, with most OEMs opting for oversized cards even compared to Nvidia’s own Founder’s Editions. Last I checked, the most powerful card that will fit the Ghost is EVGA’s RTX 3060 Ti, but the Beast can hold practically every dual-slot graphics card up to a 350W TDP, which just so happens to be where the RTX 3080 Ti tops out anyways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="iiNlF3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10675221"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4kMyog"&gt;That might make this 8-liter box one of the smallest competent 4K gaming PCs you can buy — in benchmarks with a pre-production sample of the Core i9-11900KB, I saw the Beast post numbers within a stone’s throw of those my colleague Tom Warren saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22463608/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-review-test-benchmarks"&gt;when he reviewed the 3080 Ti with his full-size desktop&lt;/a&gt;. I can’t call today’s article a full review without lots of testing on a full production board, but based on the numbers I’m seeing in demanding games like &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; (which fell just short), most other titles should average over 60 frames per second at 4K with maximum settings sans raytracing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8VNlf"&gt;And while you could probably build a more satisfying, less plasticky and skull-laden rig with boutique cases like the 8.2-liter Louqe Ghost S1 and 7.2-liter Dan A4, most prebuilt mini gaming rigs are far larger, like the 12-liter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/8/18216789/corsair-one-i160-gaming-pc-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Corsair One&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps more importantly, I doubt any of them are as effortless to work inside. (I love my 12.7-liter Ncase M1, but even it’s a squeeze sometimes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0anr18"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10675223"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hxH9CS"&gt;It’s not just the fact that Intel’s modular Compute Element cards let you theoretically swap a bunch of components at once. The internal layout also just &lt;em&gt;makes sense. &lt;/em&gt;Instead of having to pivot-pivot-pivot your GPU in and out of the system (or physically remove part of the case, like Intel’s Ghost) you can flip up the entire top of the Beast, triple-fan-array and all, to easily swing a full-size graphics card in and out of the machine. The whole top pivots on a hinge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UosrsU"&gt;The Beast also has perfect-length power cables for its fully modular SFX power supply, special wire channels for its Wi-Fi antennas and fan cables to go just they need to be, and spring-loaded screws with their own retaining clips. It’s not the prettiest build, inside or out, but there’s loads of utility. Also, you can turn off the LED lighting with a dedicated hardware button on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MPqE8dFmrwpczlX4O_6Ws3pF67w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22747179/shollister_210727_4681_0034.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The extra-long 110mm PCIe NVMe Gen 4 drive slot, and a button to turn off the LED lighting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5TGOe7"&gt;Like previous Intel NUCs, there’s above-average connectivity and expandability, too. Ports include eight full-size USB 3.1 plus additional headers inside the case, two Thunderbolt 4 ports, 2.5Gbps Ethernet, HDMI 2.0, an UHS-II SD card slot, a 3.5mm audio jack, Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2. I just wish one of those USB-C ports was on the &lt;em&gt;front&lt;/em&gt; of the case for easier access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ymm2y"&gt;Oh, and there’s room for up 64GB of DDR4 memory and &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; full-length M.2 slots for your stick SSD storage — three M.2 2280 slots inside the Compute Module and a rare 110mm long M.2 slot with Intel Optane support on the bottom of the case. Two of them can do PCIe NVMe Gen 4 storage, the other two offer your choice of Gen 3 NVMe or SATA 3. Also, the entire NUC chassis is five PCIe slots wide instead of four, giving you room for an additional single-slot card — or the included CPU fan shroud for better ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="JopsMH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10675185"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JubGUQ"&gt;Despite all this goodness, I’m not sold on Intel’s Beast, and it comes down to three things: 1) I’m a cheapskate who knows I can generally get more for my money if I don’t lock myself to a single brand, 2) finding &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; graphics card is an exercise in frustration right now, much less a dual-slot, and 3) I still don’t trust Intel, or anyone, to keep pumping out modules for as long as I’d like to upgrade such a computer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Abv2Vc"&gt;To be fair, Intel’s doing better than most in that regard. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited"&gt;While Alienware broke its upgradable promise entirely with the Area-51m&lt;/a&gt;, Intel says the 11th Gen Compute Element &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;work in last year’s Ghost Canyon — kinda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQwM7S"&gt;The new module “will be able to technically plug into the NUC 9 Extreme Kit, but Intel will not be providing interactive support for that usage model,” a rep tells me, adding that “There were some design decisions necessary that remove certain features such as front panel audio and PCIe Gen4 is also not a certain guarantee.” It’s also not guaranteeing any support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055164/cooler-master-nc100-enclosure-intel-modular-gaming-pc-nuc-price-ces-2020"&gt;Cooler Master’s NC100&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309439/razer-tomahawk-mini-gaming-pc-for-sale-shipping"&gt;Razer Tomahawk&lt;/a&gt;, both of which used an NUC Compute Element as their brains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVznnP"&gt;In case you’re wondering, the Compute Element from my Beast Canyon wouldn’t even power on in the Ghost Canyon, something Intel proactively warned us about, and says will be fixed in production. It fits fine physically, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="goimEw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10675229"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="M4FM5J"&gt;In a more perfect world, maybe Intel, AMD, and other PC giants would join forces to turn this kind of PC into a new industry standard, a replacement for the 20-year-old Mini-ITX motherboard layout that dominates small-form-factor PCs today. That’s what I’d like to see. And maybe a larger, better window to show off my graphics card, instead of &lt;a href="http://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69649060/shollister_210727_4681_0033_3x2.0.jpg"&gt;mesh with an odd array of square cutouts&lt;/a&gt; underneath.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nothing Ear 1 earbuds review: almost something</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Standout design, noise cancellation, and wireless charging for $99&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="88KQhG"&gt;There’s a lot riding on the Ear 1 wireless earbuds, which are the first product to come from Nothing — a new company created by OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei. Backed with investment from GV, Tony Fadell, and influential creators like Casey Neistat, Nothing is aiming to build out an entire family of products that follow the design ethos debuting with the Ear 1. Transparency is at the heart of that: the Ear 1s have a clear “stem” that lets you peer at their internal components, and the unconventional charging case has a transparent lid to keep the buds in view at all times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzPGaQ"&gt;Pei has said his motivation for starting Nothing was a consumer tech industry that felt stale, unimaginative, and awash in gadgets that all feel very same-y. I don’t really buy into that viewpoint; sure, AirPods clones are everywhere, but the best earbuds from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465651/google-pixel-buds-a-series-earbuds-review-features-price"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and other big players are all visually distinct. Regardless, Nothing doesn’t see itself as “an audio company,” according to Pei, but the booming true wireless earbuds market seemed like an advantageous place to start. He’s also aiming to capture the same price-to-performance magic that was associated with OnePlus in its early days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AHScYa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10674787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TLb4Jn"&gt;At $99, the Ear 1s include active noise cancellation, wireless charging, IPX4 water resistance, and smaller conveniences like in-ear detection — features that cost anywhere from $150 to $300 from Nothing’s big brand competitors. Their sound has been tuned by Teenage Engineering, a company well versed in audio electronics. They’ll go on sale widely starting August 17th, but you can grab a pair early from Nothing’s website on July 31st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVLlJK"&gt;Like all transparent tech, the Ear 1s are fun to examine up close. On the outward-facing part of the stem, you can see the voice / ANC microphones, touch sensors, and a dot — red (right) or white (left) — to indicate which ear that bud is for. On the side facing your ear, there’s some circuitry, magnets, and the pins where the earbuds connect to the charging case. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k7WK0eaW7d1xhkIr1MKHtDYydsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746907/DSCF4391_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The outside of the Ear 1 casing reveals microphones, touch sensors, and a dot to indicate which ear that earbud is for.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ke5V59"&gt;Nothing says it was so obsessive over small details (like polishing the magnets) that some manufacturing plants turned the startup away. Finding the right glue to bond the two sides of transparent casing together without leaving any ugly remnants behind was also apparently quite a challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L7055hWzYH9hYKZUtxwp0LzFNLM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746903/DSCF4362_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From some angles, the Nothing Ear 1s really are quite striking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Da4L4W"&gt;The Ear 1s definitely look &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt;, but do they come off as radically different? I’m not seeing it. If the clear stem were opaque white instead, these earbuds would look just like Apple’s AirPods Pro or any number of competitors. Nothing’s early concept images &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320915/nothing-true-wireless-earbuds-teenage-engineering-concept-1"&gt;showed a more unorthodox design&lt;/a&gt;, but the final product looks mostly normal with a dash of unique style — and maybe that’ll be enough to sell some people on them. Not reinventing the wheel makes for good comfort, at least. Three sizes of silicone tips come in the box, and I found that the Ear 1s have a similar in-ear feel to the AirPods Pro. They fit snugly, feel airy light (each earbud is 4.7 grams), and didn’t come loose during runs or while I was eating, which are two scenarios where true wireless buds sometimes get dislodged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/weIkNSF-iGIznfNqCXShjTrtlQ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746904/DSCF4370_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting a glimpse at all the internals takes some direct lighting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O6UISkdmgr8rJ8jTEitKinCt9BA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22747162/DSCF4404.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ear 1s are very light and comfortable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="myID1q"&gt;The charging case is where Nothing definitely gets more out there with design. It’s a squished-down square with rounded corners that opens and closes with satisfying spring tension. There’s a USB-C port for wired charging, and you also get Qi wireless charging; that’s always nice to see at this price. But for all the visual flair, it feels like I’m doing more work to seat the Ear 1s back in their case compared with other earbuds I’ve got around. The magnetic hold isn’t particularly strong, and laying the earbuds flat instead of plopping them into deep charging cradles takes more direct attention. The big dimple in the top of the case helps keep the earbuds in place, with a side effect of turning the case into a fun thing to fidget with and twirl around in your fingers. Still, I think Nothing could’ve come up with something more efficient and compact. This case is form over function and obviously intended to showcase Nothing’s transparent aesthetic. Just don’t expect it to stay pristine: my review unit has already collected scratches on the case’s bottom, and it’s only a matter of time before the top picks up some, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s9Jr9X3Imygh7eNOCIm6UQgfIZc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746902/DSCF4331_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From afar the stem looks mostly black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SlD4yh"&gt;In terms of sound, the Ear 1s and their 11.6-millimeter drivers don’t pull off any huge upsets against more premium competition. But they also don’t sound &lt;em&gt;bad &lt;/em&gt;or “budget.” They’ve just got some weaknesses that earbud enthusiasts will pick up on. The treble and high end — particularly on acoustic-driven tracks — can occasionally come off as excessively sparkly. I listened through John Mayer’s 1980s-influenced &lt;em&gt;Sob Rock&lt;/em&gt; and while Nothing’s earbuds punched slightly above what I’d expect for $99 and had good clarity and a nice thump-y bass riding beneath everything, their warmth and detail don’t measure up to earbuds in the $200-300 range. But they’re still an enjoyable listen in many cases, which came through when I switched over to “Stop Making This Hurt” by Bleachers. The Ear 1s presented well with good stereo separation and nothing sounding muddled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Twn0c-dBoERdfppSqd1NX8_jGMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746960/DSCF4386_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The earbuds lay flat in the charging case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DPnh21"&gt;Nothing’s companion mobile app is available for both Android and iOS and has simple EQ adjustments for “more treble,” “more bass,” and “voice,” but you can’t take full control over the sliders yourself. You might find yourself turning to that bass boost now and then. Nothing has said it and Teenage Engineering aimed for a natural, balanced sound signature, but don’t confuse that with flat or colorless. The earbuds support AAC and SBC Bluetooth codecs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hkxgmo"&gt;Noise cancellation is… passable. On the “max” setting, it could eliminate low-frequency hums inside my local coffee shop, but I never really forgot about my surroundings. Overall noise isolation was solid thanks to the good seal I got from the ear tips, and I’d reach for these before the $99 Pixel Buds A-Series, which require me to crank the volume to overcome nearby noise. But Nothing isn’t on the same level as the similarly priced Amazon’s Echo Buds 2 when it comes to noise cancellation — not a surprise since this is the company’s first swing at it. Transparency mode is adequate, but doesn’t match the natural feel of the Echo Buds or Apple’s AirPods Pro. Nothing does include some nice tricks; if you take one earbud out, the other will switch into transparency mode until both are back in your ears. And they’ve got auto-pause / resume when an earbud is removed, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y4sFsOb4_3pT2MfnSOA3_mMhvi4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746906/DSCF4377_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The earbuds have small vents to alleviate ear pressure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KQ7GC-rLuBx_sHQWlKqT5JR--n0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22747169/DSCF4407_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The case has a USB-C port, pairing button, and wireless charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ojMLGO"&gt;Despite having three microphones and algorithms meant to help isolate your voice from background noise, the Ear 1s were a disappointment for voice calls. My voice came through muddled and warbly even in a quiet room when recording to voice memos, and people I called had difficulty hearing me clearly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tOVru"&gt;Nothing says the Ear 1s can last for four hours of continuous playback with ANC on, and the case has enough for 24 more hours. If you leave ANC off, those numbers increase to 5.7 hours and 34 hours, respectively. The battery estimates for listening time have seemed on point in my tests so far. The earbuds use tap controls for most functions: you tap twice to play / pause, three times to skip forward or go back to the previous song (depending on side), hold to toggle NC modes, and so on. But there’s also a swiping gesture up or down the stem to adjust volume, which has worked reliably and feels intuitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVgG8Q"&gt;Nothing is still working on the Ear 1s as they approach release. In my time testing them, I’ve certainly encountered bugs and sporadic issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="24TNLm"&gt;Transparency mode has gone on the fritz from time to time. Sometimes it activates unexpectedly when I’m on a call. In other, stranger instances, I’ve heard brief boosts of ambient sound when turning my head. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5oRkki"&gt;I’ve noticed the earbuds seemingly switching modes between NC on and off on their own. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="76GEx5"&gt;Android Fast Pair isn’t yet functional. Nothing says this will be working by the time the Ear 1s ship to customers in mid-August. I’ll update the review once that happens. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Fha2eA"&gt;I encountered odd charging behavior with the case, where the LED wouldn’t reflect that anything was happening. A recent firmware update seems to have cleared this up for the most part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="lqlAdZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10674672"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fpQT7CfT9FwmZzy0mKv08NvJYdA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22747060/DSCF4365_20Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nothing has said its future products will look at home next to the Ear 1s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x3UAD6"&gt;Nothing has already pushed out a couple firmware updates during my review period, and I’d expect more before the Ear 1s arrive to buyers. But these are my impressions as of the company’s late-July review embargo; I’ll update to mention any changes or improvements when the earbuds ship in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="YgD6h9"&gt;With their full potential unrealized and performance still on the buggy side, it’s difficult to conclude whether the Ear 1s are putting Nothing on the right track as a new consumer tech brand. These earbuds offer an ambitious bundle of features for $99, and they’re inevitably going to get buzz and attention thanks to their transparent design (even if they resemble AirPods in other ways) and presence in swanky fashion storefronts like &lt;a href="https://kith.com/"&gt;Kith&lt;/a&gt;. The Ear 1s are the new hypebeast earbuds and have a fun air of freshness. But right now, their individual parts — sound quality, noise cancellation, etc. — fall short of excellence and leave plenty of reason for sticking with one of those “boring” established players.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s P50 announced with Snapdragon 888 and HarmonyOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uhlp_KVEO3mqB6bLNXG4pspHF2o=/0x0:1350x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69649677/msedge_IURr7pZvgC.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Huawei P50 Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Huawei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9n20KE"&gt;Huawei has announced its latest flagship phones for the Chinese market, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fcn%2Fphones%2Fp50%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F29%2F22598135%2Fhuawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;P50&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fcn%2Fphones%2Fp50-pro%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F29%2F22598135%2Fhuawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;P50 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. They’re the company’s first major phones to launch with HarmonyOS, the company’s own branded mobile operating system, which pairs with Huawei’s typically well-specced cameras and hardware that includes Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 888 processor in some models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="enbexA"&gt;The launch of the P50 series has come a little later in the year than the P40 did in 2020, thanks to US sanctions which have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/9/21360598/huawei-chips-us-sanctions-trump-china-privacy-smartphone"&gt;seriously impacted&lt;/a&gt; Huawei’s ability to produce new phones and restricted its ability to buy chips and other components from companies using US tech. When he first teased the phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464776/huawei-p50-phone-camera-periscope-telephoto-leica-harmonyos"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, Huawei’s consumer business CEO Richard Yu said that a launch date hadn’t been set at the time “for reasons you are all aware of.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YV6Wqz"&gt;These sanctions mean that like other recent Huawei phones, the P50 series won’t include Google’s apps and services if it ever releases outside of China. In fact, according to Huawei, the P50 doesn’t run Android at all, thanks to its own HarmonyOS software. The extent to which HarmonyOS is actually distinct from Android is a &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/huaweis-harmonyos-will-rollout-to-100-android-models-over-the-next-year/"&gt;point of some contention&lt;/a&gt;, however, following reports that it’s effectively a fork of Android’s open-source code.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Huawei P50.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dOdWfF"&gt;US sanctions have meant that not every P50 uses Huawei’s own Kirin chips. The P50 and one version of the P50 Pro use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 processor, according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fcn%2Fphones%2Fp50%2Fspecs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F29%2F22598135%2Fhuawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fcn%2Fphones%2Fp50-pro%2Fspecs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F29%2F22598135%2Fhuawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sheets&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s site. Qualcomm was granted permission to sell chips to Huawei &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/14/21565185/us-qualcomm-license-4g-chips-huawei-ban-china-phones"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also a version of the P50 Pro shown with Huawei’s own Kirin 9000 processor. Both phones are listed as 4G, with no mention of 5G support. The P50 Pro is available with either 8 or 12GB of RAM with up to 512GB of internal storage, while the P50 is available with 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OawPTQ"&gt;The P50 Pro has a 6.6-inch 120Hz 1228p OLED display, while the P50 has a slightly smaller 6.5-inch 90Hz 1224p OLED display. The P50 Pro has a 4,360mAh battery, compared to a 4,100mAh battery in the P50. Both can be fast charged wired at 66W, and the P50 Pro can be wirelessly charged at 50W. There’s an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPtL2p"&gt;If Huawei’s recent flagships are anything to go by, it’s the P50 series’ cameras that’ll be their most interesting feature. Housed within two circular camera bumps, the P50 Pro has four rear cameras — a 50-megapixel main, 64-megapixel telephoto with a 3.5x optical zoom, a 40-megapixel monochrome, and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide. The P50 has a similar camera bump, but it has one fewer camera lens. It has a 50-megapixel main camera, a 12-megapixel telephoto with a 5x optical zoom, and a 13-megapixel ultrawide. Both have 13-megapixel selfie cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cb7QyT"&gt;The P50 Pro starts at 5,988 yuan (around $927) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and will go on general sale in China on August 12th. The P50 starts at 4,488 yuan (around $695), also with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and will go on sale in September. It’s unclear if or when they’ll receive a release outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s M1 MacBook Air is at its lowest price ever at Best Buy today</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ycd1hm"&gt;Apple’s latest MacBook Air with the M1 processor is an excellent, lightweight productivity laptop for school or work. It has excellent performance, stellar battery life, and runs completely silently, thanks to its fanless design. At Best Buy, you can save &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747531561997035408#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;up to $250 off the price of the 8GB RAM / 256GB storage model&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to just $750, the lowest price we’ve seen yet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kfbHT"&gt;To get the best deal, you need to be signed into a My Best Buy account (free) and then toggle the option for the limited time student deal, which knocks another $100 off the discounted $850 price. If you need more storage, the 512GB version is getting the same discount, bringing its price down to $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w6DfUn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LUXN3F"&gt;In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/4/18168565/amazon-alexa-devices-how-many-sold-number-100-million-dave-limp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon claimed&lt;/a&gt; to have sold more than 100 million Alexa devices. It’s a massive number, and while we haven’t heard more recent sales figures since, that number has surely only grown with the arrival of devices like the fourth-gen Amazon Echo. Even today, the spherical smart speaker remains a great entry point into the smart speaker realm, allowing you to play music, control your smart home, and carry out a million other hands-free tasks that once required you to make use of an abundance of apps. The latest Echo also produces robust, room-filling sound, with a surprising amount of bass and clarity. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1LEXb"&gt;If you haven’t opted for a smart speaker yet — or would like to upgrade from a previous-gen device — you can purchase a &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo--4th-gen----smart-home-hub-with-alexa---charcoal%2F-%2FA-80770246%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pair of 2020 Amazon Echos at Target for $120&lt;/a&gt;, nearly $80 off the typical retail price. To take advantage of the deal, simply add both speakers to your cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ca4ONh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10674178"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wCrMwX"&gt;In recent years, a steady internet connection has become more vital, whether due to streaming or the new, WFH-friendly approach many companies are continuing to adopt. Luckily, there’s also been no shortage of devices meant to combat shoddy Wi-Fi. Eero’s latest networking gear is a prime example, and it will work with Wi-Fi 6 and internet speeds of up to 500MBps. The bundle, which is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-eero-6-3-pack/dp/B085WSCTS4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $223&lt;/a&gt;, includes two extenders and a router, one featuring dual ethernet ports and an integrated Zigbee smart home hub. It’s an easy way to expand your network and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21185759/wi-fi-work-at-home-how-to-router-mesh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;boost your home’s Wi-Fi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lsdIoE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603441"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XqIiM3"&gt;Despite the fact many of today’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best gaming mice&lt;/a&gt; offer wireless functionality and ample customization, there’s nothing wrong with picking something that excels when it comes to the fundamentals, like Razer’s DeathAdder V2. The wired mouse is one of the best you can currently buy, with a comfortable design, a basic assortment of buttons, and a 20,000 CPI sensor that allows for plenty of precision when you need it most. As part of its ongoing back-to-school promotion, GameStop is currently &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fpc-gaming%2Faccessories%2Fmice-and-mouse-pads%2Fproducts%2Fdeathadder-v2-black-wired-optical-gaming-mouse%2F11100292.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering the DeathAdder V2 for $40&lt;/a&gt;, the lowest price we’ve seen on Razer’s budget-friendly mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uku9rj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10674248"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s next hardware launch will be its Ray-Ban ‘smart glasses’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Ray-Ban Stores as EssilorLuxottica SA Commits to $8.7 Billion GrandVision Deal" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IA0fos8QNGe5e_VYOtSSQK1RHnQ=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69649392/1233731883.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What exactly the glasses will look like or how they will function is unclear. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yooLrx"&gt;Facebook’s next hardware launch will be its long-awaited Ray-Ban ‘smart glasses,’ CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed on an &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4442353-facebook-inc-fb-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript"&gt;earnings call&lt;/a&gt; this week. When exactly the glasses will arrive is unclear. We least heard they were launching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;some time in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but the pandemic has changed a lot of companies’ plans, and Zuckerberg did not comment on a time frame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9JFX9"&gt;“Looking ahead here, the next product release will be the launch of our first smart glasses from Ray-Ban in partnership with EssilorLuxottica,” said the Facebook CEO. “The glasses have their iconic form factor, and they let you do some pretty neat things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCqRGJ"&gt;We don’t know what those “neat things” are, though Facebook has previously confirmed that the glasses will not have an integrated display and are not classified as an augmented reality device. Will they be able to make voice calls? Will they have access to a smart assistant? It’s not clear. Though without an integrated display, they will presumably rely on a paired smartphone app for controls, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20951783/snap-spectacles-3-review-snapchat-glasses-price-specs-features"&gt;Snap Spectacles&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20883917/amazon-echo-frames-smart-glasses-preview-hands-on-photos-alexa"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Frames&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8LCfHqyUr5d2ys49hWeZHlEW6-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21885703/facebook_aria_prototype_1.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s prototype Project Aria AR smart glasses (no relation to the upcoming Ray-Ban frames). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YZNZQp"&gt;Zuckerberg framed the launch of the Ray-Ban glasses as part of Facebook’s “journey towards full augmented reality glasses in the future.” The company has been working on such a device for a long time, channelling efforts though its &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/announcing-project-aria-a-research-project-on-the-future-of-wearable-ar/"&gt;Project Aria&lt;/a&gt; research unit and even producing prototype AR spectacles, seen above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elM2ts"&gt;Augmented reality glasses are a key part of Facebook’s new plans to build the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;metaverse”&lt;/a&gt; — a multi-modal technology platform that is supposed to blend virtual and physical spaces, and be used for shopping, work, and socializing. Facebook, of course, will use it to sell more advertising. As Zuckerberg noted on the same earnings call this week: “[A]ds are going to continue being an important part of the strategy across the social media parts of what we do and it will probably be a meaningful part of the metaverse too.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTXZGH"&gt;That’s something to remember when you start wearing a Facebook-designed computer on your face every day. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The summer Intel fell behind</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B1zSd5qjwtUKrHiEtcl3jhl4jz0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69649284/acastro_210728_4683_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Looking back a year later at Intel’s worst summer, and how it’s been fighting its way back since&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8CYyU1"&gt;In the summer of 2020 Intel seemed poised for triumph. Then it all went wrong. “To put it briefly: Intel blew it,” explains Glenn O’Donnell, a research director at Forrester Research. Intel was forced to announce to the world that it’d be delaying its next major manufacturing milestone for its chips for another few years, an admission that, once again, Intel was falling behind the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dja50b"&gt;After years of misplaced bets, manufacturing delays, and changing leadership, the previously undisputed chip-making king has found itself faced by competition the likes of which it hasn’t faced in decades — while simultaneously finding itself at what could be the company’s nadir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0SbtMG"&gt;In 2020, Intel was forced to admit that it would be severely delaying its 7nm node, recently rebranded as Intel 4. This precipitated an exodus of leadership and the admission that Intel might have to face the unthinkable and outsource its own manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E8f3uf"&gt;Intel managed to survive its last summer hell, at the cost of being forced to dramatically rethink its business from the top down. Now it has a new CEO, a new plan, and a market hungry for more chips. It’s set ambitious goals, revealing its most detailed process roadmap and a bold promise to jump ahead and reclaim processor leadership by 2025, if it can avoid the familiar pitfalls of the past decade. The coming years will be a make-or-break moment of redemption that will either right the course — or send Intel into what might be its final tailspin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOgNq2"&gt;“It wasn’t something that just happened suddenly. These things build, they build and build over time until something happens that causes the whole thing to kind of crumble,” says O’Donnell. Things have been headed in a downward trajectory for Intel for years, yet it was last summer — and the delay on 7nm — when the cracks in Intel’s facade started to look a lot more like canyons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kkJsLZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It wasn’t something that just happened suddenly.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pHqqN9"&gt;“For all of its history, until recently, manufacturing was one of the magic things that was going on at Intel — part of the secret sauce of Intel was the manufacturing innovations, and that’s why 7nm was such a big embarrassment,” O’Donnell says. “It was a huge hit, psychologically, across the company, but also across the market because that meant Intel no longer had that secret sauce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="wDXeYM"&gt;The fact that Intel still makes its own chips today is a rarity in the industry. The vast majority of tech companies are fabless, meaning that they outsource the fabrication of their chips — even if they design them themselves — to other companies. AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Apple, MediaTek, and Broadcom are some of the leading examples of fabless companies today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUB798"&gt;Intel is one of the few computer chip firms that still designs &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; manufactures its own hardware — it can design every part of the process to its own specifications and purposes, and it has an unmatched control over the actual manufacturing of its products. It actually &lt;em&gt;owns&lt;/em&gt; its own fabs, and it’s the only major company still making chips in the US right now. &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/semiconductor-chip-shortage-60-minutes-2021-05-02/"&gt;Manufacturing has been one of Intel’s biggest strengths for decades&lt;/a&gt;. But the fact that the company missed its projections for 7nm, coming after years of 10nm delays that it was only just recovering from, was a huge blow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="dQMThw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10673391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lcYJI3"&gt;Last year started well for Intel. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21408718/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-cpu-processor-announcement-laptops-fall"&gt;announced its Tiger Lake chips&lt;/a&gt; (technically the company’s third-generation 10nm designs) which also saw the debut of the company’s long-gestating Xe GPU architecture, giving it an exciting new wave of processors with prowess in an area (graphics) that had long been one of Intel’s weaknesses. The chips offered great performance, even though — much like their own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20748224/intel-first-10nm-ice-lake-11-cpu-processor-laptop-decoder-ring"&gt;long-delayed Ice Lake predecessors&lt;/a&gt; — they were limited to only lower-powered laptops. The wait for 10nm and Intel’s new graphics turned out to have been worth it: the new chips outpaced AMD’s in single-core performance &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21440302/intel-tiger-lake-hands-on-tests-core-i7-1185g7-processor-release"&gt;when they were released&lt;/a&gt;, and they actually lived up to the hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJYAhu"&gt;There was still more to do: Intel had only released 10nm chips for its weakest laptop products; if you were buying a thin-and-light computer, it’d be better than ever, with all the performance and power efficiency improvements that the new architecture node brought with it. But it took the company almost a full year before it released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"&gt;more powerful H-series Tiger Lake chips&lt;/a&gt; for beefier laptops designed for gaming and video editing, which are only just starting to see those benefits. And it still has yet to move its desktop chips to 10nm (to the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/desktopc-pc-intel-newest-processors/"&gt;potential detriment&lt;/a&gt; of this year’s chips, which tried to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22325460/intel-11th-gen-desktop-chips-rocket-lake-s-faster-speeds-cores-gaming"&gt;fuse 10nm designs on 14nm architectures&lt;/a&gt; to mixed results). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5CP1aA"&gt;After years of manufacturing delays, Intel almost seemed to maybe, possibly, be heading back on track. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="2XMPiI"&gt;But when June rolled around, Intel’s troubles started back up again. Seasoned engineer Jim Keller announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/12/21288938/jim-keller-leaves-intel-chip-designer-executive-silicon-amd-tesla-apple"&gt;he was leaving the company&lt;/a&gt; for “personal reasons.” &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/13048/an-anandtech-exclusive-the-jim-keller-interview"&gt;Keller is the Mr. Fixit of the chip design world&lt;/a&gt;: he helped Apple with its in-house A-series chips, AMD with its Zen architecture, and Tesla with its Self-Driving Computer chip. &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/12689/cpu-design-guru-jim-keller-joins-intel"&gt;Intel brought Keller on board in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and while the company didn’t publicly define his role beyond leading Intel’s silicon engineering team for “system-on-chip (SoC) development and integration,” his job was clear: as the leader of Intel’s 10,000-person semiconductor engineering team, &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/longform/microchip-designer-jim-keller-intel-fortune-500-apple-tesla-amd/"&gt;he was to get Intel back on track&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKABh9"&gt;Keller is known for short stints at companies — he often comes in, sets things in motion, and leaves before the fireworks start. But his less than two years at Intel and his abrupt departure marked one of his shortest tenures yet, and an inauspicious start to Intel’s summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56f9TE"&gt;But there was more bad news waiting for Intel just a few days later, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;Apple announced at WWDC 2020&lt;/a&gt; that it would be making the switch to its own Arm-based chips, away from the Intel processors it had been using for over a decade. The reasoning was similar to when Apple first switched from PowerPC to Intel in 2005: &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-09/apple-plans-to-announce-move-to-its-own-mac-chips-at-wwdc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the Mac maker weighed and measured Intel’s roadmaps, already riddled with recent delays, and found it wanting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xsu6GI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/05/02/apple-macbook-pro-macbook-air-delay-intel-arm-release-date-specifications/?sh=29249ced7922"&gt;Apple’s Q2 2019 earnings report&lt;/a&gt; goes even further, straight up blaming a dip in Mac sales that quarter on processor supply issues with Intel. “We believe that our Mac revenue would have been up compared to last year without those constraints,” CEO Tim Cook noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ywy0IW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To Apple, leaving Intel behind was a necessary choice to let the Mac leap forward&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FNpSxk"&gt;At least one former Intel engineer corroborates those frustrations: &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-skylake-why-apple-left/"&gt;outspoken principal engineer François Piednoël told &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the switch was at least partially due to poor quality assurance with the company’s Skylake chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxmS1C"&gt;But the switch to Arm chips wasn’t just an announcement that Apple was fed up with Intel’s delays — it was a declaration to the world from one of tech’s most influential companies that Intel’s chips just weren’t up to snuff anymore. “When we make bold changes, it’s for one simple yet powerful reason: so we can make much better products,” Cook said at the announcement — to Apple, leaving Intel behind was a necessary choice to let the Mac leap forward. And sure enough, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple’s first M1 chips&lt;/a&gt; exceeded expectations on every front, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;upending our concept of laptop performance&lt;/a&gt; when they arrived later last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CNElxU"&gt;But all that was still a prelude to Intel’s biggest looming disaster: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/23/21336356/intel-7nm-chips-next-gen-delay-q2-2020-earnings-amd-10nm-tiger-lake-desktop-laptop-cpu"&gt;an announcement&lt;/a&gt; on its Q2 2020 earnings call that the company had identified a “defect mode” in its 7nm process, derailing progress by at least a year. The next-generation chip, &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-process-tech-lag-competitors-late-2021-leadership-5nm"&gt;originally set for a late 2021&lt;/a&gt; release and a crucial part of Intel’s strategy to get its production back on track and to catch up to other silicon producers like TSMC, were now delayed until early 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4VEfY"&gt;And that’s a big problem for Intel. As Natalie Enright Jerger, a professor in computer engineering and leading researcher in computer architectures explains, there are two main ways that chipmakers can improve performance: new designs, like putting more cores or new AI accelerators onto chips; and adding more transistors, which primarily come from new and smaller architectures. “Without being able to shrink the node they’re losing out on one of the two key drivers of performance. They’re still able to innovate … but they’re not able to get that additional win of more transistors that AMD has.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xiKdS"&gt;AMD is also a beneficiary of TSMC’s more advanced production: its Ryzen chips have been on 7nm since 2019, and it could be poised to leapfrog Intel again when its 5nm Zen 4 chips ship in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZQ2mhc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel has been competing with one hand tied behind its back&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4e2bKi"&gt;Intel is effectively competing with one hand tied behind its back. The fact that it’s keeping up at all is a testament to the advantages its in-house production offers, and the innovations in things like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/21285821/intel-3d-stacked-lakefield-chips-hybrid-core-atom-arm-processor"&gt;unique Foveros packaging technologies&lt;/a&gt; — all of which is the aforementioned “secret sauce”— but the continued delays to new architectures show it’s the kind of trick that Intel can only keep up for so long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ByUul7"&gt;The fallout from the summer’s events came quickly. Shortly after the 7nm news hit, Venkata “Murthy” Renduchintala, the company’s former hardware chief, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21340993/intel-hardware-chief-venkata-murthy-renduchintala-leaving"&gt;left his position&lt;/a&gt;. And Intel’s former CEO Bob Swan — previously Intel’s chief financial officer before taking the top spot — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228702/intel-ceo-bob-swan-pat-gelsinger-technical-financial"&gt;was replaced by Pat Gelsinger&lt;/a&gt;, a former Intel engineer best known for helping pioneer some of Intel’s earliest innovations in the 1980s and serving as the company’s first chief technology officer. Gelsinger was a hire meant to help right the ship, a sign to both employees and the world that Intel wanted to get serious about chips and play to its strengths again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aIVv9B"&gt;Gelsinger has wasted no time, already announcing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;new “IDM 2.0” strategy&lt;/a&gt; for Intel that will see the company outsource some of its production to other players like TSMC and Samsung, work to establish Intel as a chipmaker for other companies through a new Intel Foundry Service business, and create an ambitious goal to return Intel to the forefront of cutting-edge chip designs by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P11clg"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594074/intel-acclerated-new-architecture-roadmap-naming-7nm-2025"&gt;newly announced roadmap&lt;/a&gt; — the most detailed look at its future products that Intel has shared in some time — and the renaming of its technology nodes to better contextualize them with competitors is part of that strategy; a major declaration from the company that it has a plan to make its way back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mVANX"&gt;In a comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Intel executive vice president Michelle Johnston Holthaus said that “We have a solid foundation in place, and an exciting, strategic vision ahead of us,” highlighting the company’s new investments and roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZbxaM"&gt;But it’ll be a challenge to get there. Intel — the company once known for being the untouchable leader of CPU making — is undeniably behind. While some of its new announcements, like the $20 billion it is investing into new factories in Arizona, sound impressive, they’re bets that will take years to pay off. They also pale in comparison to competitors &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-23/behind-samsung-s-116-billion-bid-for-chip-supremacy"&gt;like Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, which announced a decade-long $116 billion investment in semiconductor production in 2019, or TSMC, which has announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/tsmc-to-invest-100-billion-over-three-years-to-grow-capacity"&gt;invest over $100 billion in expanding capacity&lt;/a&gt; over the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6Cprh9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ball’s in Intel’s court&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="cMrzpJ"&gt;Even Intel’s new roadmap is not guaranteed for the future. There are a lot of ambitious goals there, including launching its long-delayed 7nm Intel 4 chips in 2023, and next-generation transistor architecture with Intel 20A in 2024. But Intel is coming off its recent 10nm and 7nm struggles and will need to make sure that its aggressive annual pace it’s setting here doesn’t hit similar snags that could cascade through the PC industry. And competitors like Samsung and TSMC are &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16639/tsmc-update-2nm-in-development-3nm-4nm-on-track-for-2022"&gt;already gearing up&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; generation of chips with higher transistor density and more advanced technologies, meaning that newly reinvigorated competitors like AMD and Qualcomm will be waiting to pick up any of Intel’s slack. As O’Donnell explains, “‘They’ve got to leapfrog now — simply catching up is insufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZBT95"&gt;Last summer was a wake-up call for Intel, a clear sign that the years of delays and missed opportunities were a buck that it could no longer continue to pass. The changes that Intel’s made in the year since are the right ones: &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-skylake-chip-architect-returns-shlomit-weiss-gelsinger?_ga=2.117341702.1430922208.1627475975-482687162.1627330714"&gt;bringing back experienced leaders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-bulks-up-engineering-roster-with-returning-technologist-sunil-shenoy"&gt;hardware designers&lt;/a&gt;, and focusing on getting its semiconductor business back on track. Intel will have to regain trust and rebuild its reputation as a leader that OEMs and customers can rely on and show that it can still compete on the bleeding edge of chips. The last year was a good first step, and the ball’s in Intel’s court. But now, it needs to deliver. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s first PS5 software beta arrives with M.2 SSD support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vQkgYjXl2TjNHMvN0-6PKcec71Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69649239/vpavic_4278_20201030_0292.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EF8n3w"&gt;Sony’s PS5 system software beta program is starting to roll out today, and it include access to the long-awaited M.2 SSD slot. The first PS5 beta is available for select users in the US, Canada, Japan, UK, Germany, and France. The beta includes some new UX enhancements and customizations, but the biggest addition is M.2 SSD expansion support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NomTWN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd/#min"&gt;Sony notes&lt;/a&gt; you’ll need an M.2 SSD that’s PCIe Gen4 and has read speeds of 5,500MB/s or faster. That’s largely what we were expecting, and it means a variety of Gen4 drives will be supported — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21444428/samsung-pc-980-pro-ssd-solid-state-drive-storage-price"&gt;Samsung’s 980 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507807/western-digital-wd-first-pcie-4-0-nvme-ssds-sn850"&gt;Western Digital’s SN850s&lt;/a&gt;, and many other modern M.2 SSDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wTApH"&gt;You may need to consider the cooling requirements for using an M.2 SSD in a PS5, though. “Using an M.2 SSD with your PS5 console requires effective heat dissipation with a cooling structure, such as a heatsink,” explains Sony. “You can attach one to your M.2 SSD yourself, either in a single-sided format, or double-sided format.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung 980 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BcP6g1-igKslcs5bopN1oo2pJCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21894230/980pro2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll need the latest Gen4 M.2 SSDs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GaPzcr"&gt;While Sony notes that read speeds on Gen4 drives of 5,500MB/s or faster are recommended, it “cannot guarantee that all M.2 SSD devices meeting the described specifications will work with your console.” Playing games from this expandable storage may not have the “exact same performance” provided by the PS5’s internal drive, even if read speeds exceed 5,500MB/s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZwYDS"&gt;Aside from M.2 SSD support, this latest PS5 beta software also includes 3D audio support for built-in TV speakers. This will be available in the sound menu in the PS5’s console system settings, and the feature uses the DualSense controller to measure the acoustics of a room to apply a 3D audio setting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="DualSense" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/utAOabKTqZcrBHeiYICw_FzgmNo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21990362/vpavic_4261_20201023_0028.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony is using the DualSense to intelligently enable 3D audio for TV speakers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CUCCuY"&gt;Sony is also improving other areas of its PS5 software. The Control Center interface will now  include more personalization options for rearranging or choosing controls, and PS5 users will be able to view and write messages to friends and parties from the Game Base in the Control Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4tNzX"&gt;The Friends tab in Game Base is also being updated with better management options, and the ability to see how many friends are online. Sony is also addressing some of the confusing aspects of PS4 or PS5 versions of games. Different versions will now appear separately in the home screen and game library, and each game’s title will also now include whether it’s PS4 or PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abSP9d"&gt;This new PS5 beta will also include a trophy tracker that lets players quickly access up to five trophies per game through the Control Center. Sony is also adding options to pick between 720p and 1080p for its PlayStation Now service, and enabling a new automatic video clip for PS5 players that compete in challenges for high scores in games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is kicking ‘sugar dating’ apps out of the Play Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QPDtQrjI9-xa6c9riX4KGHJ_Uho=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69649143/acastro_180507_1777_android_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LxqE0s"&gt;“Sugar dating” apps will not be allowed on the Android Play Store from September 1st, Google has announced as part of a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9934569?hl=en-GB"&gt;series of policy changes&lt;/a&gt; for the platform. The change, which was &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/28/google-bans-sugar-daddy-apps-from-play-store/"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, specifically prohibits apps relating to “compensated sexual relationships.” Other changes coming to the platform include a new crackdown on inactive developer accounts, &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/07/announcing-policy-updates-to-bolster.html"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hRY4sM"&gt;Traditionally, sugar dating relationships involve older, wealthier individuals dating and showering younger partners with gifts. As &lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;notes, there’s no shortage of apps on the Play Store designed around setting up “sugar daddy” relationships. None of them explicitly say that older men are expected to compensate younger women for their affection, but many emphasize the wealth of the men on their services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gymfLL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Inactive developer accounts also face removal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A9gFES"&gt;Google’s Play Store policies &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9878810?hl=en-GB#:~:text=encourages%20bestiality.-,Apps%20that%20promote%20sex-related,Apps,-that%20degrade"&gt;already prohibit&lt;/a&gt; apps that promote “services that may be interpreted as providing sexual acts in exchange for compensation.” But the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10808976#:~:text=encourages%20bestiality.-,Apps%20that%20promote%20sex-related,Apps,-that%20degrade"&gt;updated wording&lt;/a&gt; expands this definition to explicitly include “compensated dating or sexual arrangements where one participant is expected or implied to provide money, gifts or financial support to another participant (‘sugar dating’).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dC1t8"&gt;Google’s announcement doesn’t explicitly say why the apps are being banned now. But it comes amidst a crackdown on online sex work by platforms following the introduction of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17223720/trump-signs-fosta-sesta-sex-trafficking-section-230-law"&gt;FOSTA-SESTA legislation&lt;/a&gt; in the US in 2018, which removes Section 230 protections for content that “promotes or facilitates prostitution.” A representative from Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZnkVJ"&gt;Beyond the dating app rule changes, the search giant is also introducing a new policy which will see it delete developer accounts if they’ve remained inactive for a year. Google says it will make exceptions for accounts behind apps with over a thousand installs or with recent in-app purchases, but if a developer hasn’t uploaded an app or signed into the Google Play Console over the course of 12 months, their account is at risk of deletion. In a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhtKIZPfZMs"&gt;video outlining the change&lt;/a&gt;, Google says it will notify developers of an impending deletion 60, 30, and 7 days before it takes place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="My7izd"&gt;The policy updates also offer more information on Google’s previously announced changes regarding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22411560/google-play-store-listings-scammy-emoji-deals-misleading-assets-guidelines-policy"&gt;Play Store spam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466531/google-android-ad-traking-advertising-identifier-id"&gt;opting-out of the use of advertising IDs&lt;/a&gt;. It’s updating its store listings and promotion policy on September 29 to ban “spam text and graphics in app titles, icons and developer names” and its ads policy is being updated to reflect the advertising ID changes on October 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
