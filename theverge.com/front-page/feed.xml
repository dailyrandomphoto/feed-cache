    <title>Chrome 94 beta tests some next-gen tech for gaming in your browser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FpRqPy"&gt;Google’s &lt;a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/08/chrome-94-beta-webcodecs-webgpu.html"&gt;Chrome Beta 94 announcement&lt;/a&gt; mentions that Google is implementing some new web standards that could make browser-based gaming experiences even better. The soon-to-be-released &lt;a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5669293909868544"&gt;WebCodecs&lt;/a&gt; could help make cloud gaming easier and faster, while the experimental &lt;a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6213121689518080"&gt;WebGPU&lt;/a&gt; could make it easier for developers of games that run in the browser to tap into your computer’s power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXFLFF"&gt;WebCodecs is &lt;a href="https://web.dev/webcodecs/"&gt;an API designed to give developers better access&lt;/a&gt; to the video encoding/decoding codecs that are already bundled with your browser, which figure out what to do with video streams. While there are already methods of getting video to play in Chrome, they’re not necessarily designed for things like cloud gaming, which is best when it’s as low-latency as possible. WebCodecs is built to avoid overhead, making it easier to get the incoming video stream onto your screen as fast as possible, potentially with the help of hardware decoding. This will also, in theory, make it perform better than it currently does on slower machines (which are the kinds of computers where cloud gaming is most desirable anyhow). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RvC725"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Both technologies simplify and streamline things that technically could’ve been done before&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zYWAuv"&gt;The newer, &lt;a href="https://web.dev/gpu/"&gt;more experimental WebGPU&lt;/a&gt; gives web developers better access to your computer’s graphics horsepower, by letting them hook into your computer’s native graphics API (similar to Apple’s Metal, Microsoft’s DirectX 12, or Vulkan). In simpler terms, it makes it easier for web developers to talk to your graphics card in a language it understands, without having to go through other layers that could slow things down. It’s &lt;a href="https://webkit.org/blog/7380/next-generation-3d-graphics-on-the-web/"&gt;meant to be a next-generation version of WebGL&lt;/a&gt;, which lets developers tap into the (now reasonably out of date) OpenGL framework. In the future, the tech should make it easier for developers to make graphically intense games that run in the browser, tapping into the full power of current-generation GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1UEOg"&gt;Both technologies have their place outside of gaming too. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/nhTxJBgTywc?t=505"&gt;In a July 2020 talk&lt;/a&gt;, Google mentioned that Zoom was interested in using WebCodecs for videoconferencing, and &lt;a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/explainer/#use-cases"&gt;WebGPU could be used&lt;/a&gt; to render 3D models in the browser or to accelerate machine learning models. It makes sense that they’d show up in Chrome, as these are all areas Google plays in, from cloud gaming with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18654632/google-stadia-price-release-date-games-bethesda-ea-doom-ubisoft-e3-2019"&gt;Google Stadia&lt;/a&gt;, to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22638696/google-meet-echo-warning-text-alert"&gt;own video conferencing apps&lt;/a&gt;. Both pieces of tech are open standards though, developed by the W3C, and other browser makers have &lt;a href="https://caniuse.com/webgpu"&gt;begun testing them as well&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7NZRXF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Developers will still have to make their apps work with WebCodecs, and look into WebGPU&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g3ym3j"&gt;Of course, we probably won’t be seeing experiences powered by WebCodecs or WebGPU for a little while. While WebCodecs is actually getting close to release (it’s expected to be turned on by default in the upcoming Chrome 94), developers will still have to make their apps work with it. As for WebGPU, it’s currently in its experimental trial phase, which &lt;a href="https://web.dev/gpu/"&gt;Google expects to end&lt;/a&gt; in early 2022. Whether it’ll end up as a feature at that point depends on how the trial goes, if the specification is done, and if enough people are interested in using it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lrh0Uv"&gt;While these technologies may not make things that were impossible possible, they’re exciting nonetheless. When things are easier, or more flexible, it lowers the barrier of entry for developers. For gamers looking to play on the web, either through streaming or native games, the time developers save on figuring out how to get frames onto your screen is time they can spend making other parts of the experience better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max and YouTube are now on Spectrum TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9yYe3IWlOEY5tkKqF3AjjiOjOQI=/295x0:1210x610/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69794872/HBO_Max_in_Apps_Menu.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Spectrum TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T6a5MI"&gt;Two of the biggest players in streaming, &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeHBOMaxYoutube083021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; and YouTube, have officially arrived on Spectrum TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykoa4Y"&gt;It’s the first time the apps have been supported on Spectrum TV, Charter’s digital cable provider and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629518/spectrum-tv-app-roku-channel-store"&gt;live TV app&lt;/a&gt;, and users will be able to access content from both apps through the platform’s guide on channels 2004 for HBO Max and 2003 for YouTube. Users will also be able to find them by searching the guide or from the guide’s apps menu. (A subscription to HBO Max, which costs $10 per month with ads or $15 to go ad-free and unlock same-day theatrical releases, will still be required to access the content.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WjnVvu"&gt;The two apps are huge additions to Spectrum’s platform. &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeHBOMaxYoutube083021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, which launched well over a year ago, offers more than 13,000 hours of premium content from brands that include HBO, DC, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Studio Ghibli, and Max Originals, among others. The service also made Warner Bros.’ entire 2021 film slate available on its premium tier the same day those films debut in theaters at no additional cost. While a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168881/denis-villeneuve-christopher-nolan-anger-hbo-max-streaming-att"&gt;controversial move&lt;/a&gt; and one that’s caused WarnerMedia quite a few headaches, it’s a tremendous value for anyone uncertain about returning to theaters just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhFspw"&gt;A spokesperson noted that the guide channels offer an additional method for customers to access the HBO Max and YouTube apps. Together with Netflix, they’re the first three streaming apps to be accessible directly through the Spectrum Guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PMRGJ"&gt;“As the video landscape continues to change, we are evolving our products and making it easier for our customers to watch what they want by providing access to streaming apps from convenient launch points within the Spectrum TV experience,” Elena Ritchie, Spectrum’s group vice president of video experience, said in a statement. “We look forward to growing this library and expect to launch more streaming video apps in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM temporarily stops making the Chevy Bolt after latest recall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P1rxJ2BMzB34OOJ_fVTF7eMFyQc=/0x0:5700x3800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69794866/2022_Chevrolet_BoltEUV_013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Chevrolet&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yIlq0v"&gt;General Motors is halting production of the Chevy Bolt EV after a number of battery fires prompted a massive recall that has already cost the company nearly $2 billion. The automaker won’t resume making the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/14/22280449/chevy-bolt-ev-euv-super-cruise-range-price-specs"&gt;2022 Bolt and Bolt EUV&lt;/a&gt; until at least mid-September. It had initially stopped production last week because of the global chip shortage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLwSka"&gt;The recall repair process is also on hold, as GM is still waiting to get new battery modules from its supplier, South Korean conglomerate LG, that it is confident are free of defects. “We will not resume repairs or restart production until we are confident LG is producing defect free products for us,” GM spokesman Daniel Flores said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwK9TP"&gt;It’s the latest blow to one of the most capable and competitively priced electric vehicles on the market, and it comes as GM is getting ready to dramatically increase the number of EVs in its lineup. Those new EVs will also be powered by batteries from LG, which makes the cells that GM identified as the cause of the fires in the Bolt. GM CEO Mary Barra told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; late last week, though, that the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-26/gm-ceo-touts-multiple-battery-options-while-affirming-lg-deal?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;recall will not affect companies’ plan to keep collaborating on EV batteries&lt;/a&gt; — despite GM saying it plans to make LG pay for the recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuiMLJ"&gt;GM &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;first recalled 2017–2019 Chevy Bolts&lt;/a&gt; in November 2020 after a handful of fires had been reported. But it wasn’t until May 2021 that the company explained it would attempt to prevent future fires by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417634/chevy-bolt-recall-fire-fix-software-update"&gt;installing new software on those older Bolts&lt;/a&gt; as well as on all new models being made. That fix didn’t work, though, as at least two more Bolts caught fire by July that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577757/gm-chevy-bolt-fires-recall-fix-software-update-not-working"&gt;had the new software&lt;/a&gt;. GM &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590210/chevy-bolt-new-recall-battery-defect-fire-risk-fix"&gt;issued a second recall&lt;/a&gt; and also finally started to share that it believed certain defects in the cells were causing the fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5pCYi"&gt;Then, on August 20th, just days after a 2020 Bolt caught fire, GM issued a third recall for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634721/gm-recall-chevrolet-bolt-battery-fire-fix-problems"&gt;all Bolt EVs ever made&lt;/a&gt; — some 140,000 — including the two new 2022 versions that launched this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pzGFIr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Srslhl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izV0Jv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Shape-shifting storms like Ida are cities’ worst nightmare</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Ida Batters Louisiana, Cutting Off All Power For New Orleans" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n31TwvUnqZIiJOJzcMXWqytnVgU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69794798/1234964690.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;First responders prepare to launch rescue boats to transport residents out of floodwater left behind by Hurricane Ida in LaPlace, Louisiana, U.S., on Monday, Aug. 30, 2021 | Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2mB73i"&gt;With less time to act as climate change churns up &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08471-z"&gt;more rapidly intensifying storms&lt;/a&gt; like Hurricane Ida, coastal communities might have to rethink how they prepare for future storms. They could be forced to make tough decisions before a threat even fully materializes. Or they might take cues from how cities prepare for other types of disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dz4zJy"&gt;Ida &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647037/hurricane-ida-rapid-intensification-louisiana-storm"&gt;grew monstrous overnight&lt;/a&gt;. In less than a day, its wind speed jumped from 85 to 150 miles per hour, making it the fifth strongest storm to land in the mainland US. After Ida pummeled Louisiana for hours over the weekend, “virtually no one” had electricity in the state Monday morning, Gov. John Bel Edwards said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LouisianaGov/status/1432340549940490248"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; posted to Twitter. Some places are under boil water advisories with water treatment systems out of commission. “We have tremendous damage to homes and businesses, we know that individuals are out there waiting to be rescued,” Edwards said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QIYBGG"&gt;Ida’s rapid intensification outpaced authorities’ abilities to get everyone in the storm’s path out of the way. And shape-shifting storms like Ida make it more difficult for forecasters and officials to convey just how much risk residents face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6l5JC6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Rapid intensification is a nightmare, maybe the worst nightmare”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xufHnV"&gt;“Rapid intensification is a nightmare, maybe the worst nightmare for emergency management and local state and federal government, because you don’t have a lot of time to prepare and it’s a moving target,” says John Knox, undergraduate coordinator of the Atmospheric Sciences Program at the University of Georgia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="igtu2G"&gt;New Orleans, which suffered a near-direct hit from Ida, only ordered mandatory evacuations of parts of the city outside of its protective levee system. Many residents hunkered down and braced for the impact of the hurricane. There wasn’t enough time to organize contraflow from the heart of the city, turning traffic so that it only heads out of New Orleans, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PaIpx7"&gt;It might take 72 hours to evacuate the city before a hurricane makes landfall, according to one estimated &lt;a href="https://ready.nola.gov/plan/hurricane/"&gt;timeline&lt;/a&gt; the city posted online. Ida strengthened from a depression to a tropical storm on &lt;a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2021/al09/al092021.update.08262116.shtml?"&gt;August 26th&lt;/a&gt;, just about three days before it made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 4 storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5uHZB"&gt;“It takes longer to evacuate a city than it takes to build a destructive hurricane,” Kelly Hereid, director of catastrophe research &amp;amp; development at Liberty Mutual Insurance, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KellyHereid/status/1431969128882053131"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. She points to lessons that could be learned from tsunami response when she says there might be only 10 to 30 minutes of warning in advance. In that scenario, some cities plan for “vertical evacuation.” Instead of leaving the area, people find shelter in structures built to withstand the catastrophe, she writes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cq509N"&gt;“Maybe planning large-scale emergency shelters to safely stay in place is part of the answer. Maybe it’s not,” Hereid writes. “But I know the answer is not: hope that *this time* we’ll have enough time to get everyone out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bq2Mmr"&gt;Still, knowing that New Orleans was in the path of the storm was fair warning for officials, according to James Marshall Shepherd, director of the Atmospheric Sciences Program at the University of Georgia. How much power a storm will pack is still hard to assess because it requires peering into the inner mechanics of a storm, but forecasting &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; a storm will hit has gotten incredibly precise, thanks to better computer models.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sxd9Gs"&gt;“I feel that there was time for public officials to do some more aggressive evacuations and to get people out of harm’s way,” Shepherd says, and it’s been “gut-wrenching” for him to watch the storm and its aftermath unfold. People just might need to be prepared for storms to pack a heavier punch than a simple category rating might suggest, he said. (Hurricanes are &lt;a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php"&gt;sorted into categories&lt;/a&gt; based on wind speed, with 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest. Categories don’t take into account other dangers like rainfall or storm surge.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDtVZq"&gt;“A lot of people go to bed saying, ‘A Category 2 or Category 3 storm, I can kind of deal with that.’ And then they wake up to a Category 4, borderline Category 5 storm,” says Shepherd. Some people might not respond as urgently to a storm with a lower category rating than they would for one with a higher rating, Shepherd says, even though there’s still “danger inherent in both scenarios.” Officials might consider lowering the bar for cities to act, Shepherd wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2021/08/30/do-officials-need-a-new-evacuation-playbook-for-rapidly-intensifying-hurricanes/?sh=69e5ca0458ec"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="M6oyQs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We all had a sense of dread”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dab6Hy"&gt;While Ida strengthened faster than other storms, the way it picked up steam was “textbook,” according to Knox. “For me and for my friends who are meteorologists, we all had a sense of dread because it seemed inevitable that it was going to rapidly intensify,” Knox said. They watched as warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico supercharged the storm, which feeds off heat energy. At the same time, there was a lack of wind shear to knock the growing hurricane down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Sxmog"&gt;While that’s a familiar pattern, climate change &lt;a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/08/climate-change-is-causing-more-rapid-intensification-of-atlantic-hurricanes/"&gt;speeds up the timeline&lt;/a&gt; and makes storms &lt;a href="https://news.sciencebrief.org/cyclones-mar2021/"&gt;more intense&lt;/a&gt; as it raises ocean temperatures. Disaster planners might need to act more preemptively if future storms continue to outpace existing response plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2NiFDc"&gt;“You have to get people to act before it’s actually in existence, almost,” says Knox. “To mobilize the public in particular about something that doesn’t even exist yet — because [Ida] wasn’t a monster, until the morning of when it hit — that’s the really hard part,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHNqp8"&gt;There were other complicating factors in New Orleans this time around. COVID-19 added a layer of risk to mobilizing people en masse, and the city’s hospitals struggled to find beds in other parts of the state for their patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCJezX"&gt;There are also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28748777/"&gt;losses&lt;/a&gt; — measured in both lives and dollars — each time a community is forced to evacuate, which can, at times, take a bigger toll than the weather if the storm fizzles out. Evacuations for Hurricane Rita in 2005, for example, led to 100 of at least 119 deaths linked to the storm. Luckily, since forecasters have gotten much better at predicting where a storm will pass, there’s less risk of panicking people unnecessarily, according to Knox. But with storm intensity still somewhat of a wildcard and the peak of this year’s hurricane season still ahead, city leaders will have more hard decisions to face.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="B9KmDa"&gt;Apple’s upcoming show starring Jon Stewart, &lt;em&gt;The Problem with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;, will debut on Apple TV Plus on September 30th, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-announces-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-is-set-to-make-its-global-debut-thursday-september-30-on-apple-tv%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F30%2F22648861%2Fapple-tv-plus-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-show-premiere-debut-date-podcast" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-announces-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-is-set-to-make-its-global-debut-thursday-september-30-on-apple-tv%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F30%2F22648861%2Fapple-tv-plus-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-show-premiere-debut-date-podcast" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;describes the show&lt;/a&gt; as a “multiple-season, single-issue series, taking a deep dive on the issues affecting us most.” It will also have &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-problem-with-jon-stewart/id1583132133"&gt;a companion podcast&lt;/a&gt;, which will “extend the conversation from each episode.” New episodes of the TV show will premiere every other week, while new episodes of the podcast will be released weekly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Za6UJQ"&gt;Apple released &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBMqejibrGg"&gt;a short teaser&lt;/a&gt; to promote the premiere date that features Stewart wondering, “what the hell happened to my face?” You can also listen to a &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-problem-with-jon-stewart/id1583132133?mt=2&amp;amp;ls=1&amp;amp;itscg=80085&amp;amp;itsct=pod_show_appletv_tpwjs"&gt;teaser of the podcast right now&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s only 15 seconds long and doesn’t give us a great idea of what the podcast will actually be like. In July, Stewart promoted the upcoming show with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585674/jon-stewart-apple-tv-show-skit-roasting-space-billionaires-jason-alexander"&gt;an odd video skewering the billionaire space race&lt;/a&gt; that starred Jason Alexander as Jeff Bezos.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You’ll have to tell Instagram your birthday to keep using the app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing the process of adding your birthday to Instagram, as well as the messages that can appear." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nUS2fMwkAsBSy-8G0c0RytzGE0E=/85x0:2128x1362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69794031/Screen_Shot_2021_08_30_at_9.55.11_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RxqgAl"&gt;If you haven’t given Instagram your birthday, it’s &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/asking-people-for-their-birthdays"&gt;about to start asking for it a whole lot more&lt;/a&gt; — and it’ll eventually be required for you to use the app. Instagram started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20995331/instagram-new-user-birthdate-account-create-age-younger-users"&gt;requiring that new users add their birthdates in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but if you had an older account, it was possible to skate by without providing that info. Now it seems that’ll become increasingly more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VjbVc6"&gt;According to the press release, Instagram will ask you for your birthday when you open the app, if you haven't already added it to your profile. You’ll be able to ignore it, but only up to a certain point — eventually, Instagram says, you’ll have to add your birthday if you want to keep using the app. Instagram also says that if it doesn’t have your birthday, it’ll ask for it before showing you posts that are marked as sensitive. It’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/23/15035738/instagram-post-blurring-sensitive-content"&gt;blurring sensitive content for years&lt;/a&gt;, but now if you want to see it, your birthday will have to be on file with Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JzDKIG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Instagram says this is to help protect kids&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVXHJQOVKG_g1bja24N6r8hqm7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22815091/240595306_517898755937685_7019118104931207586_n.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instagram will also ask your age before showing you sensitive content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tIkhzn"&gt;The company says these efforts are part of its work to make the platform safer for young people. In May, the company formally announced that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338911/facebook-instagram-kids-privacy-coppa"&gt;working on a version of Instagram for people younger than 13&lt;/a&gt; — a feature that would obviously require the platform to know people’s ages. It’s also been working on other age protections, like making it so adults &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/continuing-to-make-instagram-safer-for-the-youngest-members-of-our-community"&gt;couldn’t DM minors who weren’t following them&lt;/a&gt; or by making accounts for people &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/giving-young-people-a-safer-more-private-experience"&gt;younger than 16 private by default&lt;/a&gt;. Instagram’s &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/2387676754836493"&gt;birthday support page&lt;/a&gt; also says it uses it to moderate ads. (For instance, people under 21 won’t get ads for alcohol.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YBXRUh"&gt;The company says, in the future, it’ll use its age detection AI to sniff out people who are lying about their ages. In July, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/age-verification/"&gt;Facebook had a blog post about this tech&lt;/a&gt;, saying it was analyzing comments on your birthday posts, such as “happy 21st” or “happy Quinceañera.” According to its press release, if someone says they’re above a certain age like 13 or 18, but the AI says otherwise, Instagram will have them verify their age using a variety of methods (though it doesn’t say exactly what this will look like). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VXjQoo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sometimes companies knowing your personal info can be a surprise&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NOjZJN"&gt;Social networks have long asked you for your birthday, but having them required speaks to the growing need to make sure that kids are safe online and the feeling of invasiveness that can come with that. Snapchat users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608129/snapchat-born-astrology-information"&gt;recently got a taste of the strangeness&lt;/a&gt; that can come when social networks have information you might not remember handing over: they discovered that the app knew the time and location they were born because they had given the info to Snapchat’s astrological profile feature — and then seemingly forgot that they’d done so. For Instagram users, though, this likely won’t be an issue. It’s going to be hard to miss the birthday information requests.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Invest at PayPal could compete with Robinhood and Square’s retail stock trading </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/95LhtFgjDZOk78w-1mo88pNXGkM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793919/acastro_180410_1777_payapl_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dlZLgc"&gt;The next platform to host a rush on stocks like GameStop and AMC could be PayPal, as &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/30/paypal-is-looking-to-launch-a-stock-trading-platform-for-its-customers.html"&gt;CNBC reports the company hired a brokerage industry vet to lead the effort&lt;/a&gt;. CNBC points out that Rich Hagen served as Ally Invest president after that company acquired a startup he co-founded called TradeKing, and now &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richjhagen/"&gt;his LinkedIn page&lt;/a&gt; lists him as the CEO of Invest at PayPal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYeBM1"&gt;The meme stock trading action of the last year may have convinced PayPal it can’t let Robinhood or Square take over the market of retail investors who want to easily trade individual stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrBmPm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557419/robinhood-finra-fine-70-million"&gt;Regulatory slaps on the wrist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574133/robinhood-meme-trades-dogecoin-ipo"&gt;financial nihilism&lt;/a&gt; haven’t stalled activity on those apps. However, it may be a while before PayPal is a tool in the arsenal of r/WallStreetBets. PayPal’s CEO told CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the company has plans for additional financial services in the future, including investment capabilities, while at least one anonymous source told the outlet it’s “unlikely” the feature will be available this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DrLupo is the latest streamer to move from Twitch to YouTube Gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Off Court At The 2019 Australian Open" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/veCQMEfVqzSvuTtWRbEluv9TszQ=/0x0:4976x3317/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793846/1124891630.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Matt King / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cw4ys3"&gt;Streamer Ben “DrLupo” Lupo has signed a deal to stream exclusively on YouTube Gaming, following in the footsteps of other well-known streamers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948315/twitch-jack-courage-dunlop-youtube-live-exclusive-deal-fortnite-100-thieves"&gt;Jack “CouRage” Dunlop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063683/valkyrae-twitch-youtube-100-thieves"&gt;Rachell “Valkyrae” Hofstetter&lt;/a&gt; in moving from Twitch to YouTube. Lupo’s first YouTube Gaming stream will take place on August 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64PoLQ"&gt;Lupo already has a sizable presence on YouTube, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNF0LEQ2abMr0PAX3cfkAMg"&gt;with more than 1.7 million followers&lt;/a&gt;. But in switching to the Google-owned platform, he’s moving on from his large audience on Twitch, &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/drlupo"&gt;where he has 4.5 million followers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSIH1d"&gt;A Loaded PR representative declined to comment on the terms of Lupo’s YouTube Gaming deal. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004943/twitch-timthetatman-drlupo-lirik-exclusive-deal-sign"&gt;In December 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Lupo signed a deal with Twitch that was reported to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1204448185785208833"&gt;worth millions of dollars per year&lt;/a&gt;. The Amazon-owned streaming service acknowledged Lupo’s departure &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1432395635488174080"&gt;with a tweet&lt;/a&gt;, saying that “we wish you nothing but the best in everything that comes next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hj1lqf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As a creator, a gamer and a father, you’re many things to many people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Above all, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrLupo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DrLupo&lt;/a&gt;, you’re someone who works hard to put good into the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We wish you nothing but the best in everything that comes next. &lt;a href="https://t.co/pkUCoX1dWe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/pkUCoX1dWe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1432395635488174080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSDTjy"&gt;While big-name streamers aren’t signing splashy exclusivity deals quite as often as they used to in the wake of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750393/ninja-mixer-exclusive-twitch-fortnite-streaming-gaming-announcement"&gt;Tyler “Ninja” Blevins’ defection from Twitch to Mixer&lt;/a&gt;, that’s likely in part because Mixer was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299032/microsoft-mixer-closing-facebook-gaming-partnership-xcloud-features"&gt;shut down by Microsoft in June 2020&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the potential number of places to go is one platform fewer. (Blevins, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430767/ninja-twitch-homecoming-return-mixer-shroud"&gt;has returned to streaming exclusively on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V60daE"&gt;Both Dunlop and Hofstetter have seen success since moving exclusively to YouTube. However, Twitch sees vastly more hours watched than both YouTube Gaming and Facebook Gaming combined, making up nearly 75 percent of total hours watched across all three platforms in the first quarter of this year, according to a &lt;a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-stream-hatchet-q1-2021-live-streaming-industry-report-eaba2143f492"&gt;Streamlabs report&lt;/a&gt;. That means Lupo may not see as much viewership on YouTube Gaming as he does on Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EuuqmiqAdW7tPWqmcx5C6neInFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22814729/1_4lFFUZbSZuCWgetM2PbBng.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QByCTJ"&gt;But in signing this exclusivity deal, it seems Lupo sees opportunity with Google’s platform. And in a statement, he suggests the platform will also help him as he “expand[s] my brand through other entertainment initiatives,” so perhaps there’s more that YouTube is offering Lupo we just aren’t aware of yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9LdCB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 30th, 1:33PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added tweet from Twitch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s the best student laptop? We asked students</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BVcaADlGztrbR5iNL_kFd3rebG0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67232292/akrales_200421_3975_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops for high school and college students.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tsQK0e"&gt;Shopping for a laptop can be stressful — doubly stressful if you or your children will be learning online for the first time. Kids of different ages have a range of different laptop use cases and different needs. And as the choices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; evolve, so do students’ needs. So I spoke to some experts on the subject: students themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9ZW8b"&gt;My recommendations here are meant to accommodate a variety of preferences and price ranges. But they’re a jumping-off point rather than an exhaustive list: every student is different. Before making a decision, you’ll want to make sure you read reviews and try out devices yourself if you can. I’ll do my best to keep this article up to date with items that are in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Best laptop for students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;aside id="7m4BUq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"},{"title":"The best Chromebooks to buy in 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4lsvuf2NE7Upsw5uiVfjINO_Jhk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19315989/vpavic_191023_3755_0159.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixelbook Go has solid battery life and a rippled base that’s easy to grip, making it a good choice for kids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uaaUWw"&gt;Best laptop for elementary school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wdF0Hl"&gt;For younger students, a touchscreen device is easier to use than a keyboard and touchpad, says Michelle Glogovac. Glogovac’s five-year-old son uses an iPad for Webex meetings with his kindergarten class. He’s gotten the hang of it; Glogovac says he’s already learned how to mute and unmute himself, “a skill that many adults aren’t familiar with.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEF087"&gt;That said, it may be worth investing in a keyboard case if you go the tablet route. Glogovac has to type her son’s meeting codes and passwords for him, which can be cumbersome on the iPad’s flat screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxdcbE"&gt;As kids get older, their best laptop choice will vary depending on their needs. As a parent, it’s important that you and your child are in sync about how they intend to use it and the size of the programs they want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sTP9p"&gt;Kristin Wallace purchased a budget HP laptop for her daughter, Bella, but didn’t realize how quickly the nine-year-old would fill up 32GB of storage. “It is really slow and has no space for games. I need a computer with more storage space,” said Bella, who uses the laptop to Zoom with friends and take virtual guitar lessons and math enrichment classes. Wallace plans to buy Bella a better device in the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwTXVL"&gt;Audio quality is an important consideration for kids’ laptops. Lisa Mitchell, an elementary library media specialist, says her students use their devices to watch YouTube videos in addition to their online classes. Battery life is also a plus, even for distance learners who may not be far from a wall outlet. Bella likes to use her laptop all around the house and doesn’t want to bring the cord with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaeV8B"&gt;Durability is also worth paying for, according to Mitchell. If you’re using a tablet, get a protective case. “If a reasonably-priced insurance or replacement policy is available, it’s usually worth the extra expense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlnxQa"&gt;Check out:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is just $289, but it can run plenty of tabs and apps with no problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;h2 id="dE2ANJ"&gt;Best laptop for middle school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="r5kOKS"&gt;The middle school students I spoke to don’t use their laptops for much more than web-based schoolwork and browsing. Don’t be too concerned about power — prioritize a machine that’s comfortable and easy for your child to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9OvOd"&gt;“We just got the most basic Chromebook and it is totally perfect,” says Gabrielle Hartley, an &lt;a href="http://gabriellehartley.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;attorney&lt;/a&gt; and mother of three children who take a mix of in-person and online classes. “The most basic Chromebook serves all the needs of the basic middle schooler.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user types on the Acer Chromebook Spin 713." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0hMEh9WTjBjXAQF5Bh8xq8l2ng0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21698818/mchin_181029_4126_0017.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chromebooks, like this one from Acer, are a good choice for students who use Google Classroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fP2U74"&gt;Hartley’s son Max, who is in eighth grade, agrees. “I would really like a gaming PC or gaming laptop that can plug into a monitor and run video games with 120fps, but I really don’t need that,” Max says. “Most eighth graders aren’t going to be running any video games on their laptops or any software that requires a lot of power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpOfaD"&gt;Max mostly uses his laptop for Google Classroom applications, including Gmail, Slides, Google Docs, and Google Sheets. They’re very easy to use on his device, which he describes as “a run-of-the-mill Samsung Chromebook.” That said, if your child is starting middle school this year, it could be worth checking with their teachers to see what operating system is most compatible with their workflow. Caspian Fischer Odén, a ninth grader from Sweden, told me he has trouble with his Chromebook because his school has blocked downloading apps from the Google Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eUtDq"&gt;Even kids with more demanding hobbies think a budget device can get the job done. Sam Hickman, an eighth grader from the UK who uses his laptop for photo and video editing, says, “For most middle schoolers, any processor developed within the last two years will be able to handle any tasks they can throw at it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4fFLe"&gt;So, what &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;worth paying for? A comfortable keyboard, several students told me. Many middle school kids aren’t used to typing for long periods of time. You should also look for a device that’s compact and easy for them to carry around, particularly if they’re preparing for in-person school. Shoot for an 11- to 13-inch model — certainly nothing larger than 15 inches. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Laptop 4 is a capable, no-nonsense laptop — just what many high schoolers want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SKuVFA"&gt;Best laptop for high school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OHE9ce"&gt;High schoolers’ laptop needs can vary based on their interests, but most don’t need powerful machines with lots of bells and whistles — especially if they come with glitches or serious downsides that could interfere with schoolwork. Miles Riehle, a student at Laguna Beach High School, has a high-end Surface Pro 7 but finds it overwhelming. “There is so much other stuff that I don’t use very often,” he said. “Something simpler might be a little more straightforward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toVK5y"&gt;The best operating system may depend on what your child is used to. Aryan Nambiar, a student at Barrington High School in Illinois, has an iMac at home and enjoys using an iPad for his schoolwork. Riehle says he would prefer a Chromebook because he has an Android phone and often uses Google services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taD6O0"&gt;But almost every student I spoke to agreed that the most important feature of a high school laptop is portability. Kids attending in-person classes may be carrying their device around for much of the day with a stack of other books. Look for a 13- or 14-inch screen, or a lighter 15- to 17-inch model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9koeX"&gt;Students also recommend something sturdy. “Most high schoolers I’ve seen will throw their laptop in their bag without too much care,” says Moses Buckwalter, a student at Penn Manor High School. Backpacks can be jostled in the hallway as well. Distance learners can still run into trouble at home. “Anything can happen,” says Aadit Agrawal, a high school student from India. “My own brother scratched my laptop with his nails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wo7j0d"&gt;Battery life is another key feature. “It can be a real struggle to find a place to charge while in class,” says Cas Heemskerk, a sophomore from the Netherlands. Unlike college students, many high schoolers don’t have frequent breaks to juice up their devices, so try to find something that can last a full day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMbdD6"&gt;Many students recommend a touchscreen with stylus support. Nambiar uses the feature for his biology class, where he does a lot of visual modeling. “The touchscreen is always a bonus for drawing diagrams, whereas if you’re using a laptop it’d be a whole process to submit a diagram you drew,” Nambiar says. Riehle uses a Surface Pen to fill out school forms and annotate PDFs. Agrawal finds it useful to take notes on the same screen as his online lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7t3Wu"&gt;Depending on the broadband situation in your area, you may also want a laptop with multiple connectivity options. Agrawal’s online classes are sometimes interrupted by powercuts, so he recommends an LTE model. Matej Plavevski, a junior at Yahya Kemal College in North Macedonia, recommends looking for an Ethernet port in case slower connections disrupt meetings. That’s hard to find on smaller laptops, but there’s a slew of affordable dongles and docks to consider. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For college students seeking an affordable laptop, HP’s Envy x360 performs just as well as some expensive competitors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QKVW4e"&gt;Best laptop for college &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sqoQtB"&gt;College kids are justified in spending a bit more money than other age groups. Some (especially in STEM courses) can expect to do some fairly demanding work. Assad Abid, an electrical engineering undergrad from Pakistan, needs to run simulation software for his assignments. Aakash Chandra, a student at New Horizon College of Engineering in India, does a lot of coding, in addition to creative work in Premiere Pro and Photoshop, and gaming. Students also noted that it’s worthwhile to pay for a laptop that will last for a few years after graduation. That means you won’t have to worry about finding and financing your next device until you’re (hopefully) settled into a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNtiDo"&gt;But among high-end, capable devices there’s still a wide range of options. Students stressed that a college laptop should be light. Expect to bring it between classes, meals, meetings, the library, and other locations on campus. “It’s a boon that I can carry my laptop as well as some notebooks without feeling like I’m carrying too much for six hours a day,” says Haseeb Waseem, a senior at Villanova University. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ntrjko32oDlmo53mASwptA-kbCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19897864/mchin_200413_3971_0010.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 has a variety of configurations. Students with light workloads may prefer the base model, while gamers and creatives can add a GPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gsQLLb"&gt;Another universally-lauded feature: battery life. Waseem, who uses an HP Spectre, says the all-day juice gives him “the flexibility to study in a bunch of different locations, and even outside.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PevA8"&gt;Speakers and webcams are often overlooked, even in top-end devices. But students say it’s worth looking for good ones if you’re starting college this year. Zoom will be a large part of university life this semester: many kids will be attending virtual classes, while others will still be meeting with clubs, study groups, and professors as well as hanging out with friends online. Waseem isn’t satisfied with his laptop’s audio and picture quality, which he says has made it difficult to pay attention in class and to engage with other students.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqglEH"&gt;Many students will need to invest more in areas tailored to their interests and schoolwork needs. Chandra’s dream laptop would include a stylus and touchscreen for his creative work as well as a high-end GPU. Waseem, who uses his laptop for a hodgepodge of activities, including streaming, coding, social media, video chatting, and Microsoft Office work, would prefer to prioritize a large screen to keep track of his multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple buys classical music streaming service Primephonic</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fQCZ9Gr0fjFTQSuVqmTBjYhnLmA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793751/acastro_180927_1777_apple_music_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ZMern"&gt;Apple Music is pushing more extensively into classical music. Today, Apple announced that it has acquired &lt;a href="https://www.primephonic.com/"&gt;Primephonic&lt;/a&gt;, a service that specializes in streaming the classical genre, and will incorporate the app’s functionality and playlists into Apple Music. The result will be “a significantly improved classical music experience,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-acquires-classical-music-streaming-service-primephonic%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F30%2F22648604%2Fapple-acquires-primephonic-classical-music-streaming-service" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. There will also be a standalone Apple Music classical app coming sometime in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YBTHxN"&gt;Effective immediately, Primephonic is no longer accepting new customers, and the service as it exists today will shut down on September 7th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X85KIJ"&gt;Apple says Primephonic’s playlists and “exclusive audio content” will be first to be integrated into Apple Music. Down the line, it’ll add “the best features of Primephonic, including better browsing and search capabilities by composer and by repertoire, detailed displays of classical music metadata, plus new features and benefits.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn9ZSb"&gt;In a show of how serious Apple is about appealing to classical fans, the company says “a dedicated classical music app” will launch next year that will use Primephonic’s “classical user interface that fans have grown to love.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZrAiO"&gt;Primephonic launched three years ago, and its team says this deal is about scale and reaching more listeners. “As a classical-only startup, we can not reach the majority of global classical listeners, especially those that listen to many other music genres as well,” the company wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.primephonic.com/"&gt;a note on its webpage&lt;/a&gt;. “We therefore concluded that in order to achieve our mission, we need to partner with a leading streaming service that encompasses all music genres and also shares our love for classical music.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JPDEw"&gt;According to Primephonic’s FAQ, customers with an active subscription will receive a prorated refund. They’ll also be getting a code to redeem six free months of Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfbxSn"&gt;As I wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;my early review of Apple Music’s spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, classical lends itself extremely well to Dolby Atmos mixes — so I’m looking forward to the service evolving into a better home for the genre.&lt;/p&gt;
