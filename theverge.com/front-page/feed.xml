    <title>The best after-Christmas deals from Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and more</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1o8JeUhHfiMm1w7npjGbU907HvI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70328194/DSCF4084_Edited.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s&amp;nbsp;WF-1000XM4, the best true wireless earbuds you can buy, are still on sale for $248.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6xcfAv"&gt;Whether you’ve got a stack of gift cards burning a hole in your pocket or ended up with two air fryers that you don’t have room for, there are still plenty of deals to help you stretch your spending before the new year. Below we’ve outlined some of the best tech deals, sales, and promotions from a variety of retailers across a number of categories to make sure you don’t end up with two stand mixers when you didn’t even need one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YN2oEA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Know the holiday shipping and return policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570161/holiday-shipping-return-policy-apple-google-microsoft-amazon"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="z66VpO"&gt;Smart home deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hVEvua"&gt;While they certainly aren’t for everyone, the usefulness of Amazon’s Echo devices makes them an excellent value, especially if you have an older model to trade in. Currently, many Echo devices — including the standard fourth-generation Echo, the Echo Show 5, and Echo Show 8 — are selling for the same prices we saw on Black Friday. If you pair that with the potential 25 percent discount you'll receive when you trade in an older Echo device tied to your account, you’ve got a great way to upgrade your home automation setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCMryz"&gt;Amazon’s Echo devices are available at a variety of retailers for the same price, but note that if you’re planning to trade in an older device, you can only do so through Amazon directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="wCqWAh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873822"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wxld6d"&gt;Google’s lozenge-shaped Nest Mini is $25 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgiOFJDXDV4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, half off the original price tag. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3lLvjm"&gt;The $179.99 Facebook Portal 10-inch smart display has dropped to $79.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgiNQLNJZ6e" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20913653/facebook-portal-10-inch-2019-review-price-specs-features-whatsapp-video-calling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5qbGDz"&gt;The myQ Chamberlain Smart Garage Control is selling at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GD3D9YJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $19.98 instead of $29.98.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AYkX0C"&gt;The latest Nest Doorbell is back down to its Black Friday pricing at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgiNUjcCgyE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, discounted from $179.99 to $129.99. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710545/nest-doorbell-battery-cam-battery-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0Jk9co"&gt;Yeedi’s no-frills $199.99 K650 robot vacuum is selling for $111.99 when you apply the $68 coupon at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yeedi-XXL-Size-Compatible-Boundary-Self-Charging/dp/B08BJ315DM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RJxYv6"&gt;A single Eero 6 dual-band mesh Wi-Fi router costs $83 instead of $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eero-6-Router/dp/B085VM9ZDD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ibui8A"&gt;The Eufy RoboVac 11S is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079QYYGF1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $154.99 instead of $229.99.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dgy5Qt"&gt;Gaming deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kPftvS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop’s year-end sale&lt;/a&gt; is worth checking out, especially if you don’t have any problems with physical copies of preowned games. Currently, all preowned games are buy two, get one free. Buying preowned titles is a great way to save a modest amount on titles that would otherwise be full price, and GameStop often has games that are barely a month old with preowned stickers attached to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MjoiYE"&gt;Even if you’re not keen on buying preowned titles, many new titles have been discounted by as much as 50 percent off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9deWBU"&gt;We understand that most games take the shape of a download code these days, but if you have a little extra shelf space or want to clear out some older titles to free up some real estate, these promotions are worth looking into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wDWwVa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"8 great games for your new PlayStation 5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22825859/ps5-best-games-playstation-5-sony-2021"},{"title":"8 great games for your new Xbox","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22825913/xbox-series-x-s-best-games-microsoft-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LtuOQE"&gt;If you were lucky enough to get an Oculus Quest 2 as a gift for the holidays, you’ll likely want some accessories. The protective &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Carrying-Lightweight-Portable-Protection/dp/B08F5VCNCY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus Quest 2 Carrying Case&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Elite-Enhanced-Support-Comfort/dp/B08F5TZW2J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap&lt;/a&gt; can really elevate your overall experience with this flagship VR headset. Thankfully, these little extras are still enjoying modest discounts at several retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="FWP5rl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10949359"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="TFmyXw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Quest Store has a very good New Year’s sale going on","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22857159/quest-store-new-year-sale-2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MnN2GO"&gt;Two of the most popular outlets for PC games are currently hosting their annual winter sales. &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Steam Winter Sale&lt;/a&gt; is taking place until January 5th and &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Epic Games’ Winter Sale&lt;/a&gt; will be available until January 6th. While there are exclusive titles for both stores, we’d recommend checking the Epic Game Store first, simply because the sale includes an additional $10 discount on any title that costs more than $14.99. This discount applies not just to full-price titles but games that are already discounted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TEUOI0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"10 great games for your new gaming PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22803171/gaming-pc-computer-best-games-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="JBnJRu"&gt;Headphone and earbud deals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li id="49JgNA"&gt;If there’s a Micro Center retail store near you, you can get the best price on Apple’s new AirPods Pro that offers MagSafe charging.

While you can reserve a set online, note that you’ll have to pick them up in store. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Fortnite told players they ‘don’t have permission to play’ just before the servers went offline</title>

  &lt;p id="lwqJZ8"&gt;We have bad news if you’re on winter break and hope to play some &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, as Epic Games has confirmed its battle royale shooter is down — and this time it’s not &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/13/20909812/fortnite-down-black-hole-chapter-2-the-end"&gt;to help expand the game’s lore&lt;/a&gt;. According to a tweet from its own &lt;a href="https://status.epicgames.com/incidents/gfv5zzrn0nv4"&gt;status page&lt;/a&gt;, “&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is currently unavailable and players are unable to log-in while we investigate an issue. We’ll provide more info when we have a solution to bring services back online.” A &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1476284634971484163"&gt;follow-up tweet at 3:10PM ET&lt;/a&gt; from the team says they are “continuing to work on a fix that will bring &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;back online and appreciate everyone’s patience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="Vub9FT"&gt;

&lt;p id="yzn5kW"&gt;Our own senior entertainment editor Andrew Webster &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/A_Webster/status/1476220645801447433"&gt;has been struggling with the platform&lt;/a&gt;, which was telling many players, “You do not have permission to play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;.” The company started investigating this issue a couple of hours ago and players have reported spotty connections ever since, but now it appears that logins are unavailable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8PPa0"&gt;When the servers initially went down, the Epic Games launcher wouldn’t even start &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, showing the servers were offline, but now it will try to launch the game. Unfortunately, after launching, as many players have reported and we experienced in a test, it simply places you in a queue for ten minutes or so, then fails to connect fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxmanM"&gt;Around the same time the issue started, the Epic Games Store was also having problems, where some players said they couldn’t log in or even access their games for offline play. Now at least the Epic Games desktop launcher is working so you can still play other games on your PC. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xiaomi 12 Pro’s main camera is absolutely massive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vqET6mS4OiiBEOijUcVP034qUG0=/0x67:686x524/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70328001/23b7af4f9dcbdb453c205e6c51479e5a.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even for Xiaomi, the 12 and 12 Pro offer huge main camera modules.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Xiaomi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qN0wZM"&gt;Xiaomi is at it again — putting another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356660/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-camera-bump"&gt;fantastically huge camera&lt;/a&gt; on a flagship phone. This time, it’s the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mi.com%2Fglobal%2Fdiscover%2Farticle%3Fid%3D2603&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F29%2F22858529%2Fxiaomi-12-pro-camera-specifications-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xiaomi 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt; with a 50-megapixel main sensor and f/1.9 standard wide lens. It’s not the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; biggest sensor Xiaomi has used in a phone, but the combination of a wide aperture lens and sizable imaging chip makes it... well, just look at the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dag6Sd"&gt;On the technical side, it’s a Sony IMX707 chip, which Xiaomi says it’s the first to use in a mobile device. &lt;a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/12/25/xiaomi-12-pro-confirmed-to-use-sony-imx707-sensor-for-primary-camera/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmochina&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt; that the 707 appears to be a very light refresh of the IMX700, which makes that claim a little less exciting. Either way, it’s a large 1/1.28-inch type sensor. Sony combines its 1.22μm pixels, which are already fairly large for a mobile camera sensor, to create even larger 2.44μm “4-in-1” pixels for better low-light photos. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FfOub_Vp8H8dJkV5FgIx3hD-JCk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132629/xiaomi.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vwrq8U"&gt;The 12 Pro includes two more 50-megapixel rear camera sensors: an ultrawide and a telephoto. The Xiaomi 12 features a slightly smaller 1/1.56-inch type sensor, a 13-megapixel ultrawide, and a 5-megapixel “telemacro.” In addition to impressive hardware, the 12 and 12 Pro include camera software improvements like reduced shutter lag, burst shooting improvements, and subject tracking for human and animal faces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9W9QxH"&gt;On the non-camera side, the 12 Pro and its 12 sibling have all the trimmings of a modern flagship with Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipsets and 120Hz OLED panels. The Xiaomi 12 offers a 6.28-inch screen and a 4,500mAh battery; the 12 Pro includes a 6.73-inch screen with 1,500 nit peak brightness and a 4,600mAh battery with 120W fast charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yE8DPs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xiaomi Mi 11 review: undercutting Samsung","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DZCM8N"&gt;If you’d like to become the proud owner of a really, really big smartphone camera, both go on sale in China on December 31st. The 12 Pro starts at RMB 4,699 (about $737) for 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and the Xiaomi 12 starts at RMB 3,699 (about $580) for the same 8GB / 128GB configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>James Webb Space Telescope’s fuel expected to last more than 10 years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="james webb space telescope" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rxndwWJKs2pNhgPo97r4zlhfx2Y=/24x0:1077x702/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70327880/mirror44_lg.1419965238.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;james webb space telescope&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="92xgi8"&gt;Following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/25/22850167/james-webb-space-telescope-jwst-launch-mission-success"&gt;revolutionary and successful launch&lt;/a&gt; of the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, into space on Christmas day, NASA announced some &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2021/12/29/nasa-says-webbs-excess-fuel-likely-to-extend-its-lifetime-expectations/"&gt;unexpected news&lt;/a&gt; about the telescope’s future: its science mission is likely to last “significantly more” than 10 years — more than double the minimum time for the mission.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TjXrd"&gt;Initially, JWST was projected to be operational for 5 to 10 years, but NASA’s latest analysis &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2021/12/29/nasa-says-webbs-excess-fuel-likely-to-extend-its-lifetime-expectations/"&gt;released today&lt;/a&gt; found that the telescope will likely have enough propellant to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;support scientific operations for even longer. According to NASA, the extra propellant is thanks to the precision of the Ariane 5 rocket that the JWST was on when it was launched into space. It is also due to the precision of the first and second &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2021/12/27/more-than-you-wanted-to-know-about-webbs-mid-course-corrections/"&gt;mid-course correction maneuvers&lt;/a&gt; —&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;small trajectory tweaks that the spacecraft has completed in the days since launching, setting it on a path toward its destination &lt;a href="https://webb.nasa.gov/content/about/orbit.html"&gt;a million miles from Earth&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cWgiQ"&gt;According to NASA, the precision of these maneuvers leaves the spacecraft with more propellant it can use to maintain its final position for observing the cosmos. The space agency warns, however, that “many factors” could ultimately affect JWST’s lifespan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vA7U21"&gt;The potential extension of scientific research is reminiscent of the Hubble telescope, which is widely considered JWST’s predecessor. NASA initially projected the Hubble telescope would last about 15 years, but it’s still operating today, more than 30 years later. A key difference between the two is that the Hubble Space Telescope was able to serviced by astronauts while JWST is not. JWST, which collects infrared light, is capable of imaging objects &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22789561/nasa-jwst-james-webb-space-telescope-priorities-astronomy-astrophysics-exoplanets"&gt;10 to 100 times fainter&lt;/a&gt; than what Hubble can see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5DYZ8h"&gt;The launch trajectory’s accuracy also allowed JWST to deploy its solar array a bit early. Following separation from the Ariane 5 rocket, deployment of JWST’s solar array was set to begin about 33 minutes after launch. But it actually happened about 29 minutes after launch because JWST was at the correct position after the separation, NASA said in its press release. However, unlike the solar array deployment which was automatic, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzGLKQ7_KZQ"&gt;future deployments&lt;/a&gt;—including the spacecraft’s sunshield and segments of its primary mirror—are going to be human controlled, NASA says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2021 was the year clean energy finally faced its mining problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lithium And Geothermal Power Projects In California’s Imperial Valley" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kPt1Dlh4gK387mkwvmwpH80E-mw=/0x0:4929x3286/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70327216/1237268708.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A drill rig at Controlled Thermal Resources’ (CTR) Hells Kitchen Lithium and Power project in Calipatria, California, U.S., on Wednesday, Dec. 15, 2021.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6M42J5"&gt;This year, the clean energy sector finally started grappling in earnest with one of its biggest challenges: how to get enough minerals to build solar panels, wind turbines, and big batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage. Figuring that out will be critical for escaping fossil-fueled ecological disaster. It’ll also be crucial for policymakers and industry to move forward without throwing certain communities under the bus in the transition to clean energy.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJvzAM"&gt;Instead of cutting through landscapes with oil and gas wells and pipelines, clean energy industries and their suppliers will open up the Earth to hunt for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and copper. Compared to a gas-fired power plant, an onshore wind turbine requires nine times more mineral resources, &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary"&gt;according to the International Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;. Building an EV requires six times more minerals than a gas-powered car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Fv0SxW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Move forward without throwing certain communities under the bus &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tWnP4B"&gt;It’s about time to scrutinize what that hunger for minerals might cause, given the recent boom in pledges from countries and companies alike to &lt;a href="https://eciu.net/analysis/reports/2021/taking-stock-assessment-net-zero-targets"&gt;reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt;. Digging up the necessary minerals is already proving to be a minefield. Protests are popping up at proposed mines that no one really wants in their backyard. The conflicts that cropped up in 2021 are just the beginning of a challenging road ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="902lud"&gt;In May, the International Energy Agency (IEA) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421081/critical-minerals-climate-change-goals-clean-energy"&gt;issued a warning&lt;/a&gt;: the world isn’t mining enough of the minerals that are the building blocks of a clean energy future. And supply chains for many critical minerals are vulnerable, according to the IEA’s report. “Left unaddressed, these potential vulnerabilities could make global progress towards a clean energy future slower and more costly – and therefore hamper international efforts to tackle climate change,” Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, said in a statement at the time. “This is what energy security looks like in the 21st century.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0T26B"&gt;The cobalt used in EV batteries, for example, mostly &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/20/world/china-congo-cobalt.html"&gt;comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt;. A majority of the world’s rare earth minerals, used in EV motors and wind turbines, are produced and processed in China. So if anything rattles production in those countries, the whole world might feel the effects. On top of that, the concentration of power over vital resources in specific countries and companies creates the potential for environmental and human rights abuses, which have plagued supply chains for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/16/apple-and-google-named-in-us-lawsuit-over-congolese-child-cobalt-mining-deaths"&gt;cobalt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hir.harvard.edu/not-so-green-technology-the-complicated-legacy-of-rare-earth-mining/"&gt;rare earth minerals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.raid-uk.org/sites/default/files/report_road_to_ruin_evs_cobalt_workers_nov_2021.pdf"&gt;Investigations&lt;/a&gt; into cobalt mines that are essential suppliers to the EV battery industry have already found widespread labor abuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Re3Hnk"&gt;To make things harder, the COVID-19 pandemic has put &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22785274/clean-renewable-energy-supply-chain-crisis-climate-mining-manufacturing"&gt;even more pressure&lt;/a&gt; on clean energy supply chains. Rising shipping and commodity prices could delay or even cancel solar projects slated for 2022, according to research firm &lt;a href="https://www.rystadenergy.com/newsevents/news/press-releases/most-of-2022s-solar-PV-projects-risk-delay-or-cancelation-due-to-soaring-material-and-shipping-costs/"&gt;Rystad Energy&lt;/a&gt;. Soaring metal prices could slow down the entire transition to renewable energy throughout the decade, says the &lt;a href="https://blogs.imf.org/2021/11/10/soaring-metal-prices-may-delay-energy-transition/"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="eOwunw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;where labor abuses are a big problem&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3NFFF8"&gt;Regardless, Joe Biden has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22394366/joe-biden-pledge-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2030"&gt;committed&lt;/a&gt; the US to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22396522/us-climate-change-commitment-paris-agreement-joe-biden"&gt;halving its emissions from peak levels&lt;/a&gt; this decade. Longer term, he’s pushing for a clean-energy grid by 2035 and net zero emissions by 2050. In order to reach those goals, the US will need large quantities of minerals, which is why the Biden administration has made securing them a priority since stepping into office this year. By June, Biden had &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/08/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-supply-chain-disruptions-task-force-to-address-short-term-supply-chain-discontinuities/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a “whole-of-government” effort to shore up domestic supply chains, with a big focus on critical minerals and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421081/critical-minerals-climate-change-goals-clean-energy"&gt;advanced batteries&lt;/a&gt; used for renewable energy and electric vehicles. As the administration sees it, domestic supply chains can help the US wean itself off dirty fossil fuels, while also minimizing its reliance on mining in other countries — especially where labor abuses are a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Members of the the San Carlos Apache Nation pray outside the US Capitol while protesting a land swap included in the National Defense Authorization Act that “threatens the sacred Apache Leap site with environmental damage from nearby high-risk copper” July 22nd, 2015 in Washington, DC. Oak Flat is home to centuries of Apache traditional coming-of-age ceremonies and acorn gathering customs, had been under federal protection for over 55 years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FCMG5e"&gt;But even in the US, clean energy-related mining can come with costs, and it’s already looking like Native Americans and other marginalized groups might bear a disproportionate burden of those costs. One high-profile tussle is building up at Nevada’s &lt;a href="https://grist.org/protest/native-opposition-to-nevada-lithium-mine-grows/"&gt;Thacker Pass&lt;/a&gt;, the site of the largest lithium resource in the country. If a proposed lithium mine moves forward, it will dig up a potential gravesite that’s sacred to members of the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribes and other local tribes. Residents are also &lt;a href="https://www.sierranevadaally.org/2021/05/20/people-of-red-mountain-statement-of-opposition-to-lithium-nevada-corps-proposed-thacker-pass-open-pit-lithium-mine/"&gt;worried&lt;/a&gt; about how the mine might harm wildlife and use up water in a state suffering a historic drought. The Nez Perce Tribe in Idaho faces the prospect of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=Climate+news%3A&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TDC+Daily"&gt;a new mining project tearing up their landscape&lt;/a&gt; to produce gold, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/23/17270960/electronic-waste-urban-mining-materials-recycling"&gt;key ingredient&lt;/a&gt; for many electronics, and antimony, that could be used in futuristic batteries. Then there’s the proposed copper mine at Oak Flat in Arizona that would &lt;a href="https://www.azcentral.com/in-depth/news/local/arizona/2021/08/18/oak-flat-apache-sacred-resolution-copper-mine/7903887002/"&gt;desecrate lands sacred to members of the San Carlos Apache Nation&lt;/a&gt; and other Indigenous peoples in the region. Copper is widely used across the grid and for solar and wind energy technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9syz8c"&gt;Around the world, the race is on to find new sources of the minerals needed for clean energy. Mining companies are now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/3/16398518/deep-sea-mining-hydrothermal-vents-japan-precious-metals-rare-species"&gt;eyeing patches of the seafloor&lt;/a&gt; that contain polymetallic nodules rich in cobalt, rare earth elements, and other metals. While companies argue that mining the seafloor is one way to avoid polluting communities near land-based mines, their eagerness to bring heavy industry to a largely unexplored environment has alarmed hundreds of marine scientists, who published a &lt;a href="https://www.seabedminingsciencestatement.org/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; in September saying such activity could irreparably hurt deep-sea ecosystems. Despite their concerns, the International Seabed Authority (ISA), which oversees activities on the high seas, is seemingly &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com./magazine/2022/01/03/mining-the-bottom-of-the-sea"&gt;poised&lt;/a&gt; to push through new rules that could &lt;a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2021/12/deep-sea-mining-regulators-latest-meeting-on-rules-only-muddies-the-water/"&gt;open up the world’s oceans&lt;/a&gt; for deep sea-mining after convening earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7cNVGZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt; Tribes are entitled to “free, prior, and informed consent”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MjgS8u"&gt;There are ways to get the minerals the clean energy revolution needs while minimizing the impact on people and the planet. Startups are figuring out how to get better at recycling lithium batteries. Joe Biden campaigned on a promise to create millions of clean energy jobs while defending workers’ right to unionize, which might offer workers in US mines more protections. Tribes are entitled to “free, prior, and informed consent” to any project that might affect them or their territories, under the &lt;a href="https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/ipeoples/freepriorandinformedconsent.pdf"&gt;United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples&lt;/a&gt;. We can also boost energy efficiency, use more public transit, and consume less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FD7hik"&gt;As renewable energy starts to outpace fossil fuels, it will need to avoid the ways coal, oil, and gas bulldozed through communities at great costs to people and the environment. And if decision-makers can chart a path for a just transition to renewable energy, they might be able to heal more than the damage our demand for energy has inflicted on the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTWjwg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This Apple Watch Series 7 sale arrived just in time for New Year’s resolutions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="There are a few Series 7 exclusive features in WatchOS 8, including a keyboard." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HC69BQhTCWgBeu633i5tU2gLQws=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70326652/vpavic_211006_4796_0053.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 45mm GPS version of the Apple Watch Series 7 is down to $379, an all-time low.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4Cdjhp"&gt;If getting fit is one of your New Year’s resolutions, or if you, like me, are ending the holiday season feeling so bloated you can barely carry your own weight from all of that food (true story), today’s Apple Watch Series 7 discount couldn’t have arrived at a better time. Both sizes of the Series 7, Apple’s latest model that boasts a larger display than its predecessor, are discounted at Amazon. At the moment, the retailer is selling the 45mm, GPS-equipped model with a blue aluminum case and a blue Sport Band for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HDYYXGX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$379&lt;/a&gt; instead of $429. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5Njgd"&gt;Have a smaller wrist or prefer a smaller watchface? The 41mm, GPS-only version is currently selling for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HF1DC1J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$349&lt;/a&gt; in select styles (normally $399), meaning there’s a way to save no matter the size you’re after. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D31nfF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10933315"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="MV0I20"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jjTV6I"&gt;For Samsung fans, the flagship Galaxy Buds Pro earbuds are now selling at a new all-time low. Amazon is currently offering the earbuds, which offer active noise cancellation, for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Resistant/dp/B08MWWNGYG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$124.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $199.99 in all available colorways. In his review published earlier this year, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;reviewer Chris Welch praised these comfortable, water-resistant earbuds for their good quality audio, both in and out of phone calls. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dp9hwx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6g8vx4"&gt;If you’re in the market for a powerful Windows tablet that can transform into a laptop (and includes the keyboard at no extra cost), you can save over $1,000 right now on various configurations of Lenovo’s ThinkPad X12 Detachable. Typically $2,219, Lenovo, for example, is selling the version that we reviewed, outfitted with 16GB RAM, a 512GB SSD, and an 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1130G7 processor, for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpadx%2Fx12-detachable-g1%2F20uw0012us&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F12%2F29%2F22856873%2Fapple-watch-series-7-samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-lenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable-gamestop-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$989.10&lt;/a&gt; when you use the promo code &lt;strong&gt;CLEAR10 &lt;/strong&gt;(the code may automatically apply itself in some cases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JZOrg"&gt;In our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22376272/lenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable-review"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted how the X12’s processor and 3:2 aspect ratio display impressed us. While the specs aren’t meant for gaming, what the X12 can deliver should be more than enough for everyday productivity work. And it’s a better value in terms of specs than its rivals, the Surface Pro 7 Plus and Surface Pro 8. As a bonus perk, the accessories you probably need to get work done, like a stylus and keyboard cover, are included in the price, whereas Surface Pro owners need to pay around $100 extra for such accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qTPnBN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10951143"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dWX8zO"&gt;If Lenovo’s ThinkPad X12 is out of your budget, the company’s Chromebook Duet is also currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgiPxC345kc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $249 instead of $299. While this isn’t its lowest price, it matches the discount we saw during Cyber Monday. This Duet model has 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a detachable keyboard included. In her &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Monica Chin praised the Chromebook’s 11-hour battery life and ultra-portable design.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scientists find unexpected trove of life forms beneath Antarctic ice shelf  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nS58RqSsYOy7lWudwh2fobPkoeE=/199x0:1338x759/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70326551/Bryozoan_fragments_dated_1536x759.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Bryozoans found in the habitat | Image: British Antarctic Survey&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2PyMCc"&gt;A team of researchers from the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany has discovered a whopping 77 seafloor-dwelling species beneath an Antarctica ice shelf&lt;strong&gt; —&lt;/strong&gt; a hint that this mysterious realm may be far more biologically rich than scientists realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SaWOmb"&gt;Little is known about the environment beneath Antarctica’s floating ice shelves,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the seaward extensions of the continent’s glaciers that span 1.6 million square kilometers. It’s a harsh, cold environment shrouded in continuous darkness, and previous studies of life beneath the ice have only documented a few dozen hardy life forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lL88wJ"&gt;The new research, published &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982221015396?dgcid=author#bib4"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;, identified more species in a single spot than had previously been documented across all the ice shelves of the frozen continent.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;After drilling two holes through the Weddell Sea’s Ekström Ice Shelf, the researchers collected seabed specimens in 2018. They found the biodiversity on this patch of seafloor to be “richer than many open water samples found on the continental shelf where there is light and food sources,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bas.ac.uk/media-post/abundance-of-life-discovered-beneath-an-antarctic-ice-shelf/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from the British Antarctic Survey. Four of the species studied experienced yearly growth rates “comparable with similar animals” in open water habitats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qmjq9r"&gt;The sea creatures the researchers identified included colony-forming invertebrates called bryozoans and serpulid worms. These organisms are suspension feeders, meaning they sit in one place on the seafloor, snatching bits of organic matter that float by. The researchers suspect they are eating algae carried beneath the ice shelf by currents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwsZxe"&gt;“This discovery of so much life living in these extreme conditions is a complete surprise and reminds us how Antarctic marine life is so unique and special,” lead study author David Barnes said in a press release. “It’s amazing that we found evidence of so many animal types, most feed on micro-algae yet no plants or algae can live in this environment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ki3Tln"&gt;Another surprise for the researchers was how ancient this icy ecosystem appears to be. Using a technique called carbon-dating, the researchers discovered that fragments of dead animals they collected were up to 5,800 years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QekNGW"&gt;However, just because animals have been living beneath the Antarctica’s ice shelves for thousands of years doesn’t mean they’ll survive the coming centuries: the British Antarctic Survey noted in a press release that climate change and the accelerating collapse of ice shelves means that “time is running out to study and protect these ecosystems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0030"&gt;“It may be cold, dark and food-scarce in most places but the least disturbed habitat on Earth could be the first habitat to go extinct as sub-ice shelf conditions disappear due to global warming,” the researchers wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLOzjP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuE2s3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ljFYRe"&gt;The fan-favorite bounty hunter has long lurked in the margins of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;’ history: his brief introduction in an animated short during the infamous &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Holiday Special&lt;/em&gt;; and his rocketing to popularity thanks to his iconic armor (practically designed to sell action figures) despite his brief appearances in &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fen-gb%2Fmovies%2Fstar-wars-the-empire-strikes-back-episode-v%2FiqtDTZAewwYl&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBookOfBobaFett122921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Empire Strikes Back&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fen-gb%2Fmovies%2Fstar-wars-return-of-the-jedi-episode-vi%2F6QGKo5mjDBS8&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBookOfBobaFett122921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Return of the Jedi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, his shoehorned backstory in &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fen-gb%2Fmovies%2Fstar-wars-attack-of-the-clones-episode-ii%2FmgpYHGnzZW6N&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBookOfBobaFett122921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attack of the Clones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and a half-baked arc in &lt;em&gt;The Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt;. For all that, Fett himself has been an enigma, a blank slate of badassery that’s never been filled in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ke1sHj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fett has spend decades as a blank slate of badassery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qpg8Lp"&gt;But after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/24/17392020/star-wars-boba-fett-james-mangold-logan"&gt;years of rumors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/4/8548365/boba-fett-star-wars-anthology-origin-story"&gt;of a solo film&lt;/a&gt;, an aborted history in the (since excised from canon) Expanded Universe books, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188516/boba-fett-disney-plus-show-2021-release-date-mandalorian-finale"&gt;surprise resurrection in the second season of T&lt;em&gt;he Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Boba Fett is finally taking center stage in his own spinoff series, &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;. It has the potential to be an interesting look at a new corner of the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; universe beyond the titular interstellar battles for galactic supremacy or the machinations of the Jedi and the Sith — but right now, there are still a lot of blank pages that the show doesn’t seem to be in any rush to fill in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSi3rP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: Spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, episode one ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VfaCx4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJfr0N"&gt;A Boba Fett show once seemed like the sort of thing that would practically write itself. A bounty hunter, clinging to his sense of honor and unique moral code as he takes on odd jobs hunting the galaxy’s most wanted criminals and getting tangled in the wider machinations of the Empire and the New Republic alike — it seems like the perfect pitch for a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; TV series. The problem, of course, is that Lucasfilm already made that show: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/star-wars/2020/10/30/21517931/the-mandalorian-news-reviews-disney-plus-star-wars-baby-yoda"&gt;it’s called &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it starred a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; armored Mandalorian hero that very much isn’t Boba Fett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YnimGG"&gt;So where does that leave the original masked bounty hunter in his own series? Well, as &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;’s first episode shows, somewhere old and somewhere new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOtN3c"&gt;The show starts by filling in some of the gaps in history between when fans last saw Fett (Temuera Morrison) disappearing into the mouth of the almighty sarlacc living in the Great Pit of Carkoon, finding “a new definition of pain and suffering” as he “was slowly digested over a thousand years,” and his return in &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;(set five years after &lt;em&gt;Return of the Jedi&lt;/em&gt;). We see how he escaped (an almost pedestrian combination of durable Mandalorian armor and his wrist-mounted flame thrower), how he lost his armor (Jawas), and his capture and adoption by the enigmatic Tuskens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RJMY7V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fett has a lot to learn about being a crime lord&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dX0Y75"&gt;It then jumps ahead to after &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%2Fthe-mandalorian&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBookOfBobaFett122921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorain&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;/a&gt; second season post-credit scene: when Fett and his partner, the assassin Fennec Shand (Ming-Na Wen), kill Jabba’s former majordomo, Bib Fortuna, and lay claim to the infamous Hutt’s crime empire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPxBdq"&gt;Barring a Baby Yoda-level twist in the coming weeks, &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; seems like it’ll be spending the next six episodes telling both of these stories: filling in his missing years with the Tuskans (because if there’s one thing &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; hates, its leaving literally any piece of backstory unexplained) and his rise as a new kind of power in Tatooine’s political and criminal world, like a sci-fi version of &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; with the edges sanded off to be more family friendly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e745Cg"&gt;Fett is still a man of few words — the episode goes a good ten minutes before a single line of dialogue is spoken — but he’s determined to try to run things differently in Mos Espa than Jabba did. “Jabba ruled through fear; I intend to rule through respect,” he growls, eschewing Jabba’s habit for elaborate litters carried through the street and attending meetings in person rather than sending minions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNCVXI"&gt;The problem is that Fett is almost charmingly bad at being a crime lord. He and Shand are utterly unable to understand a visiting vassal; he gets shown up by the mayor, whose unctuous lackey demands that &lt;em&gt;Fett&lt;/em&gt; pay tribute instead; and he gets ambushed almost immediately on his first visit to Mos Espa. If Boba is going to fill Jabba’s metaphorical boots (I’m assuming Hutts don’t wear shoes), he’s going to need to get better at this, fast.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="quvVkS"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; also has a much bigger task than a new crime empire or some expository backstory: filling in Fett’s conspicuously missing character and motivations. Right now, the show’s ostensible hero is still a blank slate. Despite appearances in two films and more than one episode of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;his most defining moment is still a decades-old warning from Darth Vader that disintegrations are off the menu for his chase of Han Solo. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/psleTcwpXZ6GpU-gida54NOcoEk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131943/BUC_048740_R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Francois Duhamel / Lucasfilm Ltd&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fK9qHI"&gt;What is Boba Fett actually doing here? Tatooine isn’t a particularly fun place to live. (As Luke Skywalker once described it, “If there’s a bright center to the universe, you’re on the planet that it’s farthest from.”) Why does Fett, the galaxy’s most infamous bounty hunter, want to fill Jabba’s shoes and be a mob boss on a backwater desert? Is it just about the money? A cozier retirement plan than chasing down ne’er-do-wells? Some (already hinted at) pity for the poor moisture farmers suffering under Jabba’s empire’s boot? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cX5gUK"&gt;In short, &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; needs to show us what Boba actually cares about, other than looking like a badass (which, admittedly, he does very well). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odwI52"&gt;Boba Fett has had a reputation for decades as one of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;’ coolest-looking characters. But if &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; is going to succeed, it needs to do more than talk the talk: it’s time for Fett to walk the walk of the towering reputation that he supposedly has and let us learn more about the man inside the armor. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Solar recycling is broken, but there’s a plan to fix it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rhJkKFRzFsFN1GrTCYLKGQDN6Eo=/2x0:5321x3546/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70326519/1237414171.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iU6MIE"&gt;A new Department of Energy-funded research project seeks to solve one of the biggest challenges with solar power — what to do with solar panels after they die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9cwgv"&gt;Solar energy is key to solving climate change, but for the technology itself to be sustainable it needs to be recyclable. Unfortunately, when a solar panel dies today, it’s likely to meet one of two fates: a shredder or a landfill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSHoWI"&gt;Arizona State University (ASU) researchers are hoping to change that through a new recycling process that uses chemicals to recover high-value metals and materials, like silver and silicon, making recycling more economically attractive. Earlier this month, the team &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/amo/articles/department-energy-partnership-remade-institute-awards-over-16-million-23-projects"&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; a two-year, $485,000 grant from the DOE’s Advanced Manufacturing Office to further validate the idea, which they hope will lay the groundwork for a pilot recycling plant within the next three years. Matching funds are being provided by ASU and energy company &lt;a href="https://www.firstsolar.com/"&gt;First Solar&lt;/a&gt;, which is serving as an industrial adviser on the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MP0IWT"&gt;If all goes well, a cleaner and more cost-effective solar recycling process could reach the market right as the first wave of solar panels &lt;a href="https://grist.org/energy/solar-panels-are-starting-to-die-what-will-we-do-with-the-megatons-of-toxic-trash/"&gt;hits the waste stream&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vqU2CR"&gt;“As we’re ramping up clean energy manufacturing, producing more clean energy tech, thinking about recycling at the end of life becomes even more important,” says &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/person/diana-bauer"&gt;Diana Bauer&lt;/a&gt;, acting deputy director of the Advanced Manufacturing Office at DOE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqoek2"&gt;While relatively few solar panels have reached the end of their life already, experts suspect most of those that have are winding up in landfills, where valuable metals and materials inside them are lost. Meng Tao, a solar sustainability researcher at ASU who’s leading the new recycling effort, &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/2162-8777/abd377"&gt;has estimated&lt;/a&gt; that the world could face supply shortages of at least one of those metals, silver, long before we’ve built all the solar panels needed to transition off fossil fuels. Solar-grade silicon, meanwhile, takes tremendous amounts of energy to make, and using it more than once is important for keeping the solar industry’s electricity demands — and its carbon footprint — down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="It7v1Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;New solar recycling processes could improve the economics considerably&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ii29Xw"&gt;Even when solar panels are recycled today, these materials are rarely recovered. Instead, recyclers typically remove the aluminum frame holding the panel together, strip the copper wiring off the back, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFy7YQBDeRs"&gt;shred the panel itself&lt;/a&gt;, creating a solar hash that’s sold as crushed glass. Those three products — aluminum, copper, and crushed glass — might fetch a recycler $3 per panel, Tao says. Companies Tao has spoken with say it costs up to $25 to recycle a panel, after decommissioning and transit costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oFCtH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-020-0645-2"&gt;New solar recycling processes&lt;/a&gt; that recover more metals and minerals could improve the economics considerably. Tao and his colleagues are proposing one such process, in which the &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-photovoltaic-cell-basics"&gt;envelope-sized&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;silicon cells&lt;/a&gt; inside solar panels are first separated from the sheets of polymers and glass surrounding them using a hot steel blade&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; A patent pending chemical concoction developed by Tao’s recycling startup &lt;a href="https://www.tg-companies.com/"&gt;TG Companies&lt;/a&gt; is then used to extract silver, tin, copper, and lead from the cells, leaving behind silicon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwyLfx"&gt;While the recycling process uses harsh chemicals, Tao says those chemicals can be “regenerated and used again and again,” reducing the amount of waste that’s created — a feature of his recycling method he believes to be unique. Tao adds that by recovering lead, the process also has the potential to eliminate an environmental hazard that would otherwise wind up in recycling waste or landfills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gj266K"&gt;Tao claims TG Companies has already developed technology to recover 100 percent of the silver, tin, copper, and lead in solar cells. The new DOE grant will allow his team to further optimize the recycling process for solar panels and verify whether silicon can be recovered at a high enough purity to manufacture new cells without going through an energy-intensive purification step known as the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/siemens-process"&gt;Siemens process&lt;/a&gt;. If all goes well over the next two years, the next step will be to attract private investors to finance a pilot plant that can use the process to recycle around 100,000 solar panels a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jx39AS"&gt;Karsten Wambach, the founder of solar panel recycling nonprofit &lt;a href="https://pvcycle.org/#Choose-your-country"&gt;PV CYCLE&lt;/a&gt;, says that a “green chemistry approach” like Tao and his colleagues are proposing has a “large potential to recover valuable secondary materials and contribute to protection of the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HNfqPC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This high-tech trash could become treasure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SyrSit"&gt; But Wambach notes that recovering all of the silver and other trace metals in solar panels “might not be fully achievable” due to losses during the process of separating silicon cells from polymers and elsewhere. In a commercial version of this process, he says, the amount and quality of recovered metals will be “optimised according to the downstream user’s specifications and cost savings potential in the treatment processes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGVbg2"&gt;Cost savings will be key. Depending on the price of silver, Tao thinks his process could recover $10-15 of materials per panel. But that could change, Wambach warns, if manufacturers &lt;a href="https://resourceworld.com/how-much-silver-is-needed-for-the-solar-panel-industry/#:~:text=The%20cost%20of%20silver%20has,milligrams%20between%202007%20and%202016."&gt;continue using less silver&lt;/a&gt; in solar panels over time. And even $15 per panel is unlikely to cover the full cost of decommissioning and recycling the panels, meaning &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/environment/topics/waste-and-recycling/waste-electrical-and-electronic-equipment-weee_en"&gt;supportive policies&lt;/a&gt; may be needed to scale up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7f6wJZ"&gt;A final hurdle, Wambach says, is that there just aren’t that many solar panels being pulled off rooftops today. But while &lt;a href="https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2016/IRENA_IEAPVPS_End-of-Life_Solar_PV_Panels_2016.pdf"&gt;less than half a million tons&lt;/a&gt; of solar waste existed globally in 2016, the International Renewable Energy Agency has projected that by 2030, that figure could rise to 8 million tons. By 2050, we could be throwing out 6 million tons of dead solar panels every &lt;em&gt;year&lt;/em&gt;, nearly as many as we’re installing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUSHIZ"&gt;Based on those projections and data on the value of metals and minerals inside each panel, Tao and his colleagues have estimated that by 2028, solar e-waste will contain over a billion dollars’ worth of harvestable materials. For anyone who is able to crack the recycling challenge, this high-tech trash could become treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0ykxe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES 2022 will introduce HDMI 2.1a, another confusing new spec</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="HDMI cable shutterstock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TP7H6isr4XeNavtd_LaEr0_AhfU=/0x2:1000x669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70326439/shutterstock_123837283.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xk4auF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/24/22193437/vergecast-podcast-interview-hdmi"&gt;The HDMI standards&lt;/a&gt; are a mess. &lt;a href="https://www.hdmi.org/spec/hdmi2_1"&gt;HDMI 2.1&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, is a uniquely frustrating mess, with haphazard support among TV manufacturers, cable makers, and devices that make setting up, say 120Hz gaming on a PS5 or Xbox Series X a uniquely harrowing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUlgcU"&gt;Fortunately, the HDMI Forum is swooping in ahead of CES with its latest revision to the HDMI specification stack, HDMI 2.1a, which is here to make everything better and simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcJ18x"&gt;... I’m kidding, of course. It’s gonna make things more complicated. It’s a new HDMI standard, what on earth did you expect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="U4dHtv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What on earth did you expect? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vd2wmf"&gt;Let’s start with the good: HDMI 2.1a is an upcoming revision to the HDMI 2.1 stack and adds a major new feature, Source-Based Tone Mapping, or SBTM. SBTM is a new HDR feature that offloads some of the HDR tone mapping to the content source (like your computer or set-top box) alongside the tone mapping that your TV or monitor is doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzwPEi"&gt;SBTM isn’t a new HDR standard — it’s not here to replace HDR10 or Dolby Vision. Instead, it’s intended to help existing HDR setups work better by letting the content source better optimize the content it passes to the display or by removing the need to have the user manually calibrate their screens for HDR by having the source device configure content for the specific display. Other use cases could be for when there’s a mix of content types, like for streamers (who could have an HDR game playing alongside a window of black and white text), displaying each area of content &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zt2hhZ"&gt;The HDMI Forum does note that it’ll be possible for set-top box, gaming companies, and TV manufacturers to add support through firmware updates for HDMI 2.1a and its source-based tone mapping “depending upon their design.” Given the usual trajectory of TV spec updates, though, it seems virtually guaranteed that in the majority of cases, users won’t be getting the new features until they buy a new TV that supports HDMI 2.1a right out of the box (which, as of now, is precisely zero of them, given that the spec has yet to be fully released).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ziQaCl"&gt;Now here’s the bad: like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22833233/hdmi-2-1-fake-marketing-brand-frl-vrr-allm-bandwidth"&gt;&lt;em&gt;every other unique HDMI 2.1 feature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including variable refresh rates, automatic low latency connections, and the bandwidth necessary to offer things like 10K resolution or 120Hz refresh rates, SBTM will be an &lt;em&gt;optional&lt;/em&gt; feature that manufacturers can support — but not something that they’re required to support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RyQaf3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Don’t buy a monitor or TV just for HDMI 2.1 — read the fine print or you might get fooled","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22833233/hdmi-2-1-fake-marketing-brand-frl-vrr-allm-bandwidth"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KZZqz3"&gt;That’s because the HDMI Forum and HDMI Licensing Administrator (the two organizations that define and license out HDMI standards, respectively) run the standards as a set that contains all the previous standards. &lt;a href="https://tftcentral.co.uk/articles/when-hdmi-2-1-isnt-hdmi-2-1"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;TFTCentral&lt;/em&gt; explains&lt;/a&gt;, according to the HDMI Licensing Administrator, now that HDMI 2.1 exists, there is no HDMI 2.0 standard anymore: all new HDMI 2.0 ports should be lumped into the HDMI 2.1 branding, despite not using any of the new features included in the “new” 2.1 standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6Xjpe"&gt;HDMI 2.1a will function in a similar manner: once the standard is released, by the HDMI Licensing Administrator’s rules, all new ports will, in theory, be labeled HDMI 2.1a — but they won’t have to offer the new SBTM or even any HDMI 2.1 features. The HDMI Forum’s argument is that this is always how its standards have worked, and that optional features allow manufacturers to have flexibility in what functionality they offer (an entry-level set, for example, probably doesn’t need ports that support 8K 120Hz VRR gaming). And the group says companies are required to list what features their hardware supports so that it's clear to customers what their hardware is capable of, beyond the number expectation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XPyzy"&gt;That argument doesn’t really hold up, though. The whole point of standards is that they’re meant to simplify this sort of thing by, you know, &lt;em&gt;standardizing&lt;/em&gt; it across devices — if you have to dig into a spec sheet to figure out if the specific refresh rate feature you want is supported on a new TV, why bother with the HDMI 2.x branding in the first place? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mbDCrG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Customers are expected to check for specific features, not just HDMI spec numbering&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g3Wx6R"&gt;Even better,&lt;em&gt; TFTCentral&lt;/em&gt;’s report notes that most manufacturers &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; following the HDMI licensing recommendations for port labeling. At least for now, TV companies have for the most part still listed HDMI 2.0 ports as “HDMI 2.0” and reserved the HDMI 2.1 labeling for ports that actually support the newer features. But the crucial issue is that under the rules of the organization that licenses out the standard, these companies don’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to do this — and technically, shouldn’t be labeling things like this, despite the fact that it’s more helpful to customers. This means that there is a chance less scrupulous (or simply more ignorant) companies could start to market HDMI 2.1 ports that don’t actually offer any 2.1 or 2.1a features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxyKCl"&gt;That leaves the upcoming HDMI 2.1a standard and its new SBTM feature in much the same place as the rest of HDMI 2.1 and its feature set: a potentially helpful new feature that could make the content you watch and play look better, but that will likely require buying new hardware and cables, and which may not even be actually supported by devices that claim to have “HDMI 2.1a” ports. That means that as CES 2022 and its slew of TV announcements are about to arrive, the only way to make sure that you’re getting the HDMI features that you want is to — as always — make sure to read the fine print. &lt;/p&gt;
