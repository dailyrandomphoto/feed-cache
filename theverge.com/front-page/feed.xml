    <title>Verge readers can grab two years of PlayStation Plus for $56</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d0Z921"&gt;If your PlayStation Plus membership is about to expire or you want to extend the subscription for another two years, Eneba is offering an exclusive deal to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers. You can purchase &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two one-year PlayStation Plus subscriptions for only $56&lt;/a&gt; when you enter the discount code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEFEB&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout, while supplies last. This is a great deal — the usual price for one year of PlayStation Plus is $60, so purchasing two one-year subscriptions for less than the price of one is a real bargain. If you want just one year, you can buy it for $29. (No code needed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Av6RZ"&gt;This works for both PS4 owners and early adopters of the PS5; the subscription is compatible with both consoles. So if you own a PS4 but are lucky enough to then get hold of a PS5, you do not have to double-dip on PlayStation Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LIi3G"&gt;If you are planning to take advantage of this exclusive deal, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, these codes are region-locked, so you will need a US PlayStation Network account to redeem the membership. Secondly, &lt;strong&gt;the promotion is valid until all the keys are sold&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;I do not expect the deal to last very long, so don’t wait to buy. Lastly, this promotional code will only work if you have two PlayStation Plus one-year subscriptions in your cart (no more, no less).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3ic3YB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nArLqw"&gt;This month is a great time to be a PlayStation Plus subscriber. Sony unveiled the &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/01/27/destruction-allstars-control-ultimate-edition-and-concrete-genie-are-your-playstation-plus-games-for-february/"&gt;February 2021 lineup of free games&lt;/a&gt; PlayStation Plus users can claim. And PS4 and PS5 owners with an active PlayStation Plus subscription will have a chance to redeem &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252475/control-free-date-ps-plus-playstation-ps5-ultimate-edition"&gt;a free digital copy of &lt;em&gt;Control Ultimate Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; beginning February 2nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdjaWp"&gt;Additionally, PS5 owners will have the option to redeem &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt;, a game originally slated as a launch title for Sony’s next-gen console, before Sony decided to first release it for free as part of its online subscription service. Free copies of digital games aside, PS5 owners with a PS Plus subscription also receive access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a digital library of “generation-defining” first- and third-party games released on the PS4, such as &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Persona 5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s weather frog spotted on smart displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eRgHwhSKCCbYv-G7em2cw3ZGwmk=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68750144/msedge_8TpZwdPl6q.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users are reporting seeing Froggy as a screensaver option on their smart displays.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwV-AHvAgeM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank"&gt;Jay Boromeusz&lt;/a&gt; / YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lL84QO"&gt;Google is testing a new background for Assistant smart displays that shows a cartoon frog enjoying, or coping with, the weather in real-time. The character, Froggy, has previously been a fixture in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/8/24/21399517/google-weather-frog-mascot-mask-android-covid-19"&gt;Google’s weather search results&lt;/a&gt;, and has also moonlighted as a &lt;a href="https://google-doodles.fandom.com/wiki/Froggy#:~:text=Froggy%20(AKA%3A%20Google%20Weather%20Frog,as%20one%20of%20Momo%27s%20classmates.&amp;amp;text=Froggy%20appears%20in%20Google%27s%2019th,one%20of%20the%20party%20hats."&gt;minor character in several Google Doodles&lt;/a&gt;. Now &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/30/google-nest-hub-weather-frog/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the critter is randomly cropping up as a new “Photo Frame” option for the smart displays for users on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/kyy3m4/weather_frog/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/l8cnmq/anyone_has_gotten_that_weather_frog_fotophrame/glhb5vz?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=frog%20smart%20display&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=live"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, where it appears alongside existing backgrounds like images displayed from your Google Photos account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIFC7N"&gt;The software describes the screensaver as “a lovable frog to bring you an animated weather experience.” When enabled, the display shows the current weather, a two-day weather forecast, and an animation of Froggy in the current conditions. &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes that these animations include Froggy sunbathing when the weather’s good, or hiding under a plant pot when it’s raining. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ieu3JB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cwV-AHvAgeM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xlPSbp"&gt;Froggy has been appearing on smart displays since &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/cwV-AHvAgeM"&gt;at least September&lt;/a&gt; last year. When available more widely, the background will appear as an option in response to the “Hey Google, change photo frame” voice command. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google begins rollout of tab groupings in Chrome for Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fcq6QrxU5oONV6Ah16K9TBHUZ1E=/0x0:3192x2128/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68749910/Screenshot_20210201_092541.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new interface shows tabs in a grid layout, and includes the option to group them.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Chrome&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AuWYMe"&gt;Chrome’s Android app is being updated with a new interface for switching tabs, and a new tab grouping feature to help organize open web pages, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/28/google-chrome-grid-tab-groups/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The new interface and functionality has reportedly been appearing for some users after the release of version 88 of Chrome last month, but doesn’t appear to be live for everyone just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GalxDr"&gt;The grid layout replaces the previous interface consisting of a vertical list of tabs, and is similar to Chrome’s existing iOS tab interface. Around six tabs are shown onscreen at a time, and these can be swiped to the left or right to close them. Incognito tabs can be accessed via a small icon on the top of the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ubno-9qufrBVgur3ej5Tv_QfzYQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22272693/Screenshot_20210201_092601.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Chrome&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When browsing a tab that’s part of a group, shortcuts to switch to other grouped tabs appear at the bottom of the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T8dNf1"&gt;Tab groups, meanwhile, are similar to a feature that’s been available on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21257446/google-chome-tab-grouping-feature"&gt;Chrome’s desktop version since last year&lt;/a&gt;, and offer a more convenient way to organize your tabs. Grouping tabs also gives you a new shortcut to hop between tabs in the same group via a menu that appears at the bottom of the app. On Android you can organize tabs into groups from the grid layout screen by dragging them onto one another, and there are also options to form tab groups in the overflow menu, as well as the context menu that opens when you long-press to open a new tab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZHS7w"&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes that the features started rolling out last week, they don’t appear to be available for every Chrome user just yet. However, you can manually enable them via Chrome’s experimental flags. We found we were able to get them to appear by navigating to chrome://flags in the address bar, and then searching and enabling the “Tab Grid Layout,” “Tab Groups,” “Tab Groups Continuation,” and “Tab Groups UI Improvements” options. We found we had to restart Chrome twice to get the new interface to appear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo raises Switch sales forecast after monster holiday quarter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5L5hL-m9moJTOOHTDg2LJv2NBpI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68749758/akrales_190820_3597_0345.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qS6sl9"&gt;Nintendo has posted earnings for a huge holiday quarter in which the Switch sold more consoles than ever. 11.57 million consoles were moved in total, bringing the Switch close to 80 million sold since its 2017 launch. Nintendo has increased its forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31st to 26.5 million Switch units, also boosting its net profit estimate 33 percent to 400 billion yen, or about $3.82 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5Clca"&gt;The Switch has now outsold the 3DS in terms of lifetime sales, with the older handheld reaching a total of 75.94 million units before production was ended. Only 730,000 3DS games were shipped during the last quarter, underlining that the platform really is dead at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6s9UXT"&gt;It was also a massive quarter for Nintendo in terms of software sales, with nearly 76 million units sold. &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; both crossed the 30 million mark for the first time, while &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Sword/Shield&lt;/em&gt; have now sold more than 20 million each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6CEtVY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Super Mario 3D World will launch in February alongside a new Nintendo Switch color","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226787/super-mario-3d-world-release-date-price-new-color-switch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6XzSWu"&gt;Nintendo already raised its fiscal year forecast to 24 million Switch units from 19 million &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550621/nintendo-earnings-q2-2020-switch-sales"&gt;three months ago&lt;/a&gt;, citing increased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But with more than 12 million consoles shipped already at that point in the year, it was still a fairly conservative prediction; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21114839/nintendo-earnings-q3-2019-switch-lifetime-sales"&gt;last year’s holiday quarter&lt;/a&gt; saw Nintendo ship almost 11 million consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GszSxv"&gt;The biggest Switch title coming in the next quarter is likely to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218627/monster-hunter-rise-preview-demo-release-date"&gt;Capcom’s &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22250703/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-nintendo-switch-hands-on-preview"&gt;expanded Wii U port &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is also coming later this month. Both games will be offered as part of Switch hardware bundles, which could further boost Switch sales for the rest of the fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple releases Chrome extension for iCloud passwords</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JPJOzakE-NFQSD-3FVRTS26v3AM=/0x0:750x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68749506/chrome.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nimR0D"&gt;Apple has released an official extension for the Windows and Mac versions of Chrome that lets you use passwords stored in your iCloud Keychain. For anyone who uses Chrome as their browser and iCloud Keychain in lieu of a dedicated password manager, this could make bouncing between Windows and Mac computers much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxkLPn"&gt;The release of the extension means that if you’ve used Safari to automatically generate strong passwords on other platforms, those can now be available to you in Chrome when you’re prompted for a login. Passwords created in Chrome for Windows will also sync back to iCloud so they’ll be available on Apple devices as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHwDIq"&gt;The extension is called iCloud Passwords and is &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icloud-passwords/pejdijmoenmkgeppbflobdenhhabjlaj"&gt;available now&lt;/a&gt; in the Chrome Web Store. Details of the functionality were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252825/apple-icloud-keychain-windows-google-chrome"&gt;prematurely revealed&lt;/a&gt; last week in an update for the iCloud Windows 10 app, which listed “Support for iCloud Passwords Chrome Extension” as a new feature, despite the extension not having been released or otherwise announced.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: The Map of Tiny Perfect Things, Ginny &amp; Georgia, Young Rock and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L0_TbwGgVGhfOrZ54r8bkkAs_74=/0x0:1318x879/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68748244/dwayne_johnson.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Dwayne Johnson in Young Rock | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMGdV2RehDk&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheRock" target="_blank"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QabVm4"&gt;I think I’m in &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; withdrawal, you guys; no other shows are quite working for me since I finished it. I just started season 2 of &lt;em&gt;Servant&lt;/em&gt;, though, thinking maybe I needed a genre-switch. &lt;em&gt;Servant&lt;/em&gt; is still creepy, and Lauren Ambrose’s Dorothy is still both totally unlikeable and totally sympathetic at the same time, which is a marvelous bit of character development. We’ll see how things go, but chances are I’m just going to re-binge Ted again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOB57O"&gt;This week’s trailers are a nice mixed bag of comedy, teen romance, and spy thriller. Also The Rock!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uYQBFt"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZOxsfKQWrUg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GcM5Yf"&gt;The Map of Tiny Perfect Things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E8UzeF"&gt;So the trailer gets the obvious out of the way early on— it’s about is a teenager stuck in a repeating time loop a la “&lt;em&gt;Groundhog Day&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Edge of Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;,” as lead character Mark tells his friend— but I got a very &lt;em&gt;The Fault in Our Stars&lt;/em&gt; vibe here. Mark meets Margaret, also stuck in the time loop and they try to find all the tiny things that make the day perfect. There’s a twist, according to the official description (I mean there always is), and I hope it’s not that their love is somehow doomed because they’re really adorable. Kathryn Newton and Kyle Allen star in &lt;em&gt;The Map of Tiny Perfect Things&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to Amazon Prime Video February 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRHmzv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LezUsp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1d8xJ15aQ1E?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3DXd73"&gt;The Courier&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="oKlWTk"&gt;Benedict Cumberbatch stars in this movie based on the true story of British businessman Greville Wynne, who helped MI6 and the CIA infiltrate the Soviet Union’s nuclear program during the Cold War even though he had no prior experience as a spy. Love it, I need me some good spy action, TV just hasn’t been the same since &lt;em&gt;The Americans &lt;/em&gt;ended. &lt;em&gt;The Courier&lt;/em&gt; is due in theaters March 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ttdCwi"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="ZmLhUA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QsacpJwXCO8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7XTSKg"&gt;Ginny &amp;amp; Georgia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5cPrsq"&gt;I so appreciate when shows and movies get all meta and tell you “yes, we know this reminds you of that other thing but bear with us, we are different.” &lt;em&gt;Ginny &amp;amp; Georgia&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a quirky former teenage mother and her shy, quiet daughter who move to a small town in New England. Their names are not Lorelai and Rory, though; Brianne Howey who plays Georgia (the mom) flat out says “we’re like the Gilmore Girls but with bigger boobs.” Oh-kay? The trailer actually reminded me more of &lt;em&gt;Little Fires Everywhere, &lt;/em&gt;because there are definitely some bad shenanigans in Georgia’s past. Antonia Gentry also stars in &lt;em&gt;Ginny &amp;amp; Georgia, &lt;/em&gt;which debuts on Netflix February 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="u7ggus"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="svHe27"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aMG9hfaBsdM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Rx9jgg"&gt;Young Rock&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dcPRGt"&gt;Is there anyone more charismatic than Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson? I mean wrestling fans used to cheer for him even when he was the heel! I think it’s the eyebrow, tbh. &lt;em&gt;Young Rock&lt;/em&gt; is the story of the wrestler/actor/athlete in his early years (his dad was also a wrestler?!), as he runs for president in the year 2032 (I mean, why not?). Uli Latukefu, who plays The Rock as a teenager, bears an uncanny resemblance to the man himself. &lt;em&gt;Young Rock&lt;/em&gt; also stars Johnson, Stacey Leilua, and Adrian Groulx. It premieres February 16th on NBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afgRDo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OatBvv"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nr9YeB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA delays moon lander awards as Biden team mulls moonshot program</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Views of full moon from behind the snowy hills in Van" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nX9q7vSLNtI5V9mEhSH7hi79KH0=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68747582/1230866756.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KnlpoH"&gt;NASA last week quietly delayed its plan to award two high-profile crewed lunar lander contracts, moving the finish line back two months for a crucial program under the Trump administration’s hasty timeline to get astronauts on the moon in 2024. With short funding from Congress and a new administration focused on more pressing national issues, the move was expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsbVhy"&gt;Elon Musk’s SpaceX, a team of aerospace giants led by Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, and Leidos-owned Dynetics &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242837/nasa-spacex-blue-origin-dynetics-human-lunar-landers#:~:text=NASA%20has%20chosen%20SpaceX%2C%20Blue,man%20to%20the%20lunar%20surface."&gt;won a combined $967 million&lt;/a&gt; in seed funding from NASA last year to develop rivaling concepts for a human lunar landing system. It’s the space agency’s first effort to spend money on astronaut moon landers since the Apollo program in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77SFvt"&gt;Last Wednesday, NASA told the three contractors that an extension to their development contracts “will be required,” picking a new award date of April 30th. Under the Trump administration’s timeline, the agency had planned to pick two of the three bidders in late February, giving a stamp of approval for two systems that would inevitably carry humans to the moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vIFwUR"&gt;The delay was all but certain: The spending bill Congress passed in December gives NASA $850 million for the Human Landing System program, far short of the $3.2 billion it needed to stick with the 2024 timeline. But NASA remained committed to the February award date and, similarly, the 2024 moonshot. A delay was also expected as Biden’s team holds off on releasing any space policy and focuses more on climate change and curbing the pandemic, keeping the long-term fate of NASA’s Artemis program uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UZx9I5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Delay gives companies more time to “seamlessly transition” from development&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LRFmK3"&gt;Now, NASA says the delay is designed to give it more time to evaluate the bidders’ proposals and to “preserve the ability to seamlessly transition” from the development phase, but added it may not need the full extension period and could award the lander contracts earlier. The extension also gives the companies more time to design and develop their lander systems, NASA said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8NlPn"&gt;SpaceX’s lunar lander pitch to NASA is Starship, a roughly 16-story-tall fully reusable vehicle the company has been launching and landing in short, suborbital test flights — called “hops” — in Boca Chica, Texas. The company’s chunk of development funds was $135 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOI0yf"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin got the largest award, $579 million, to develop its Blue Moon lander. The company announced a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20925382/blue-origin-moon-lunar-lander-bezos-lockheed-martin-nasa-artemis-northrop"&gt;National Team&lt;/a&gt;” in 2019 comprised of Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper to work on the project. Dynetics got $253 million for its lander and has partnered with Sierra Nevada Corp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RyjpU"&gt;The Biden administration has yet to pick its NASA administrator or release any space policy objectives, but is expected to slow down the Artemis program’s sprint to the moon by 2024 — a date widely viewed as unrealistic. This month, the administration &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-science/biden-names-geneticist-lander-for-new-cabinet-level-post-elevating-role-of-science-idUSKBN29K2JD"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its team for the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy, picking pioneering geneticist Eric Lander as Biden’s top science adviser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpUugD"&gt;Trump’s NASA chief Jim Bridenstine &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240908/jim-bridenstine-nasa-chief-transition-artemis"&gt;left office on inauguration day&lt;/a&gt; after serving since 2018 and spawning the Artemis program. He handed the agency’s control to his No. 2, Steve Jurczyk as acting administrator.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Ring now reportedly partners with more than 2,000 US police and fire departments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V48SlN_y0jD3n8x8XoHjKbCffbY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68747534/dseifert170808_1901_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DDzn7O"&gt;All but two US states — Montana and Wyoming— now have police or fire departments participating in Amazon’s Ring network, which lets law enforcement ask users for footage from their Ring security cameras to assist with investigations, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61968b3b-c093-4c4a-a7b7-29b565bc0bc0?desktop=true&amp;amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;, Figures from Ring show more than 1,189 departments joined the program in 2020 for a total of 2,014. That’s up sharply from 703 departments in 2019 and just 40 in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxsU0q"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt; reports that local law enforcement departments on the platform asked for Ring videos for a total of more than 22,335 incidents in 2020. &lt;a href="https://blog.ring.com/2021/01/20/law-enforcement-information-requests-in-2020/"&gt;The disclosure data from Ring&lt;/a&gt; also shows that law enforcement made some 1,900 requests — such as subpoenas, search warrants, and court orders— for footage or data from Ring cameras even after the device owner has denied the request. Amazon complied with such requests 57 percent of the time, its figures show, down from 68 percent in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Cbiyb"&gt;Privacy advocates have raised concerns about how Ring data is used by and made available to law enforcement. Ring’s Neighbors app, which allows Ring users to share videos with others nearby &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/7/18528014/fear-social-media-nextdoor-citizen-amazon-ring-neighbors"&gt;has been criticized&lt;/a&gt; for containing &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvyvzd/amazons-home-security-company-is-turning-everyone-into-cops"&gt;racist comments and reports&lt;/a&gt;. And a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/cute-videos-little-evidence-police-say-amazon-ring-isn-t-n1136026"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last February found that Ring footage wasn’t all that helpful for solving crimes. When it was useful, the Ring footage was mostly used for low-level non-violent property crimes (like the theft of a Nintendo Switch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6knL7"&gt;Ring began adding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22225716/ring-end-to-end-encryption-video-launch"&gt;support for end-to-end encryption&lt;/a&gt; on its cameras earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WrY24U"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The people wanted Lego bike lanes, and Lego is finally listening</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/50NW7tJGGIQwkwew2LI3t0PkIlY=/0x318:2048x1683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68747447/red_bike_bbdc99c6_d4fd_4e4b_a5d9_7e941d27f36e.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/bicycles-40313" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The quest to get one of the most popular toymakers in the world to make a little space for bicycles&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="pDwnpu"&gt;A thousand years ago, back in 2019, a regional councilor in the Netherlands named Marcel Steeman undertook a seemingly impossible challenge: convince the makers of one of the most popular toys in the world to do something a little different.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RiLlg6"&gt;He wanted Lego, the toy production company based in Billund, Denmark, to add bike lanes to their tiny, brick-made cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6lQRv6"&gt;For years, the streets in Lego’s city sets — once called base plates — had space for cars, people, even tiny storm drains, but no designated lanes for zero-emission, human-powered vehicles like bikes. Even worse, it appeared that &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Straight-T-Junction-60236-Building/dp/B07GVR2H1L/ref=sr_1_1?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=1&amp;amp;imprToken=babba76d-1982-b9ef-d96&amp;amp;keywords=lego%20street&amp;amp;qid=1582303483&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D20911069%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lego’s streets&lt;/a&gt; had become more hostile toward pedestrians and cyclists over time. As compared to Lego sets from years ago, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fietsprofessor/status/1209476779947253760"&gt;the cars seem to have grown larger&lt;/a&gt; — evolving from four- to six-studs wide — and the roads appeared to be getting wider, while the sidewalks were &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fietsprofessor/status/1230865170097897473"&gt;getting more and more narrow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="R2Z7Pp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The cars seem to have grown larger, and the roads appeared to be getting wider&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JxJoIy"&gt;“It really stood out that Lego City is such a car centered city,” Steeman told me in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9QSaOv"&gt;Steeman posted his bike lane proposal to &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/"&gt;Lego’s “Ideas” website&lt;/a&gt;, where enthusiasts can share and vote on each others’ ideas. Really popular ideas can get the chance to ascend up the ladder and become part of an official Lego set — though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22241339/metroid-lego-set-voting-process-ideas-nintendo"&gt;only 33 have actually been produced in the program’s 13-year history&lt;/a&gt;. The ideas range from the elegant, like this &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/93089744-0830-43bf-97e9-44bded257903"&gt;incredibly accurate looking violin&lt;/a&gt;, to the idiosyncratic, like this &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/e7429dc6-4b91-4a6d-8c79-b7eb3bda8927"&gt;map of JRR Tolkien’s Middle Earth&lt;/a&gt;. Others have garnered enough support to graduate to full-fledged Lego sets, like this &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/188afa42-fca3-49f9-afe9-00bd9f33725f"&gt;recreation of Sesame Street’s famous brownstones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFZ0uG"&gt;Steeman’s idea caught the attention of Marco Te Brömmelstroet, a professor in urban mobility futures at the University of Amsterdam who tweets under the name &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fietsprofessor"&gt;Cycling Professor&lt;/a&gt;. And one of Te Brömmelstroet’s tweets caught my attention, prompting me &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21147028/lego-city-street-bike-lane-car-culture-steeman"&gt;to write a story&lt;/a&gt; that asked the question, “Where are the bike lanes in Lego world?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHuw3k"&gt;But as the idea gained more traction on social media, Lego stayed frustratingly silent. And Steeman’s posts to Lego’s Ideas site kept getting rejected. “I’ve tried several times,” he said. “Sometimes [they were rejected] without reason, one time with the reason it was just a political statement and not a set, and that really confused me.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZPIQM4WUAfTt0oZyoacQw-rWG-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268903/eqfOw68y.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Rendering by Marcel Steeman&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;﻿Imagining what Lego bike lanes could be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BpLRhu"&gt;Several people who were supportive of Steeman’s idea of adding bike lanes to Lego’s streetscape tried contacting the company, but to no avail. (A spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comment to my original story, nor to this most recent one.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dukVqB"&gt;Meanwhile, Steeman and Te Brömmelstroet  continued to dig into Lego’s history and discovered that back in the 1980s and 90s, the company did produce street plates with small bike lanes painted green. But eventually the lanes vanished, and in the years to follow the roads got bigger, and the Lego cars grew from four-studs wide, to six studs, to eight studs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="J7F90t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the absence of bike lanes may have something to do with Lego’s supply chain&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tstsxd"&gt;Not only that, but they learned that the absence of bike lanes may have something to do with Lego’s supply chain. Thalia Verkade, a journalist who was collaborating on &lt;a href="https://www.bol.com/nl/f/goede-reis/9200000111958141/"&gt;a book about mobility&lt;/a&gt; with Brommelstroet, discovered that Lego used a subcontractor for the road plates, which were among the last pieces that were made by a company other than Lego itself. According to Verkade, Lego was trying to buy out the contract to return production of the street plates to their own facilities, Steeman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SD2vaV"&gt;Around the same time, Matthew Ashton, an official Lego Master, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/matthew__ashton/status/1209073210030985217"&gt;hinted in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; that some new form of roads would be coming to Lego’s city sets “in the not too distant future.” “A cliffhanger,” Steeman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7SJaV"&gt;All the while, Steeman was working at his job as a regional councilor for the province of Northern Holland, where he regularly tackles issues related to mobility. When the pandemic hit, Steeman shifted to working from home, sharing his home’s third floor with his 9-year-old son and all his Legos. “There’s Lego everywhere,” he said, “and I need to tilt my camera upwards to save face in the many digital meetings I have for my work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05eeF4"&gt;Right before the pandemic, Steeman caught wind of rumors of that Lego was going to revolutionize its road system by using adjustable sets and actual bricks, not just the big flat plates, as a way of playing with road designs. That would allow the inclusion of pedestrian crossings and speed bumps — and perhaps bike lanes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDQrKM"&gt;Those redesigned street sets (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Froad-plates-60304&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F31%2F22252640%2Flego-bike-lane-cities-cars-ideas-street#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;#60304&lt;/a&gt;) were finally released last year, along with a small shopping district (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fshopping-street-60306&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F31%2F22252640%2Flego-bike-lane-cities-cars-ideas-street#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;#60306&lt;/a&gt;) that included a pretzel store, a sporting goods shop, a crosswalk, a couple streetlights, and — at long last — a thin blue bike lane. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new official Shopping Street lego set has a tiny blue bike lane next to a large road and small shops." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yFf4pftQl4AFPNcLn5A4i2FdMQg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268907/Screen_Shot_2021_01_29_at_4.05.11_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fshopping-street-60306&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F31%2F22252640%2Flego-bike-lane-cities-cars-ideas-street#donotlink" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lego’s official Shopping Street (#60306), released in late 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Tl9SC5"&gt;Steeman was shocked, but rather than rest on his laurels, he immediately he took stock of all the ways this updated streetscape still fell short of what he really wanted. The bike lane was small, like really small, only two-studs wide, barely enough room for a cargo bike. Also, the box art depicted a bucket truck parked in the middle of the bike lane. Nonetheless, he chalked it up as a “small victory,” and got back to work promoting his idea for a wider, more accommodating bike lane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBiWk3"&gt;He generated a new rendering of his idea using the new road plates as a foundation. He also added some bike racks, a bike with a child’s seat, and most importantly, big, wide, blue bike lanes. He chose blue as the color, knowing that’s the color used in Billund and around Denmark, where Lego is based. Bike lanes are painted red in his native Holland, so as to prevent people from mistaking them for the water in the canals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gaisnL"&gt;Reluctantly, Steeman &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/acdc6e0c-d635-43d4-8292-76510aa54f02"&gt;uploaded his new rendering to Lego’s Ideas website&lt;/a&gt;, anticipating another rejection. But instead, he got another major shock. “To my surprise the idea was accepted within a day,” he said. It was published on the Lego website and now Steeman can try to garner enough support to make it into a real set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nrNcH"&gt;Lego gave him 60 days to get 100 supporters; he did it in 4 hours. Now he has a little more than a year to get 10,000 supporters. The odds are against him — remember, only 33 ideas have ever been accepted — but he’s confident it can be done. And if he doesn’t, he knows that the seed has already been planted with Lego’s designers. A thin blue bike lane can eventually grow into something much larger and safer from the smiling denizens of Legoland. Anything is possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWAM5z"&gt;“In the end, I just want a worldwide generation to grow up with a sustainable, healthy and above all safe alternative to the car-centered world we live in,” Steeman said. “And there is actually no bigger city on earth to start that revolution than Lego City.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WL0Rx4"&gt;He added, “So Lego was probably a bit right when they said it was a political statement.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola One 5G Ace review: a weak hand</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The Ace offers a large screen and massive battery, but it falls short in some key areas&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="9iZybh"&gt;The Motorola One 5G Ace is a $399.99 phone that does a somewhat convincing impression of a more expensive phone. It’s large, which feels like a flagship kind of thing, even if that’s not strictly true. It’s relatively heavy, which, in keeping with the wisdom of &lt;a href="https://jurassicpark.fandom.com/wiki/Donald_Gennaro"&gt;Jurassic Park’s unluckiest lawyer&lt;/a&gt;, means it’s probably expensive. It’s &lt;em&gt;shiny&lt;/em&gt;. I held it up for a friend to look at it from six feet away, and he described it as “sleek, like an old iPhone.” And of course, there’s 5G, which was (until somewhat recently) reserved for premium devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEL40T"&gt;It makes a great first impression, but once you look closer, you start to see where it lacks the polish of a high midrange or flagship phone. Its processor stumbles with heavy tasks, that big screen lacks the resolution or faster refresh rate commonly found on high-end devices, and its cameras can’t compete with the best. As is so often the case, you get what you pay for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50HpoH"&gt;Though $400 is affordable by 5G phone standards, it’s still more expensive than quite good non-5G alternatives. The Ace is one or two hundred dollars more than other capable budget options — some of which even offer 5G, too. The question, as always, is what compromises did Motorola make to offer this phone at $400, and are those acceptable trade-offs for someone considering it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v9LXdU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10309889"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oODc6g"&gt;Motorola One 5G Ace hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XLDGGB"&gt;The One 5G Ace features a generous 6.7-inch screen. Depending on how you feel about big phones, that might be one of this device’s best selling points. Battery is another strength: the Ace is equipped with a 5,000mAh battery (likely a contributor to its big size), which is head and shoulders above the 4,000 or 4,500mAh capacity typical in budget and midrange phones. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YVNuTxdHvjlfBf3XF0FWmyDay20=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264374/ajohnson_210126_4384_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ace is a little big for my comfort, but your mileage may vary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fo0JnB"&gt;The Ace is a large phone that makes itself known; you won’t forget it’s in your pocket, for example. It’s a hair taller and wider than the Galaxy S21 Ultra and 1mm thicker. It’s on the heavier side, too, at 212g, probably owing to the battery. I found its size a little awkward. It feels like a strain to reach my thumb across the screen with the phone in one hand. I also fumbled it a couple of times, picking it up too quickly and forgetting how much it weighs. This is very likely a Me Problem, though; my husband thinks it’s comfortable to hold one-handed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EADeFo"&gt;The screen is a 1080 x 2400 LCD panel with a standard 60Hz refresh rate. It’s bright and viewable even in direct sunlight, but it lacks the nice contrast of OLED. Viewing it from slightly off angles results in a loss of contrast and slight color shift. Its resolution is stretched a bit thin on a screen this size, and if you’ve had higher-resolution phones before, you will probably notice it doesn’t look quite as crisp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ErZaMtcrsEMzaXGUK-65WadTXZI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264375/ajohnson_210126_4384_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ace is just shy of 10mm thick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RGWov3"&gt;Likewise with refresh rate: quick scrolling motions and animations are just a little choppy, particularly if you’ve used a 90Hz or 120Hz screen. If you &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; switching from a phone with better resolution or a faster refresh rate, you won’t feel like you’re missing out on anything, and you’ll probably just appreciate what is a very large, pleasant-to-use screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLXEjj"&gt;With moderate use, I generally got two days out of the Ace’s huge battery. Gaming or watching a lot of videos would cut that down, but it’s hard to imagine a real-world scenario where you wouldn’t get at least a day and then some on a full charge. A 15W fast-ish charger is included in the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RV6i49"&gt;The Ace uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G 5G chipset. It had no problem handling my daily scrolling through Twitter and Instagram, and it generally felt pretty snappy cruising through Zillow and starting the camera. It struggles with certain heavier tasks, like using certain JavaScript features on a webpage (image sliders on this site, for example). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4LDD5_Td1ze13qj_6zYeiK5Z8fA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264376/ajohnson_210126_4384_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll still find a 3.5mm headphone jack on the Ace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ERYS1M"&gt;The Ace is offered with either 4GB of RAM / 64GB of storage or 6GB of RAM / 128GB storage, both of which are expandable via microSD card. I tested the 6GB of RAM variant. Overall, it feels like an appropriate amount of processing power for a $400 phone. The rear-mounted fingerprint scanner is quick and mask-friendly as a bonus, and the Ace includes a 3.5mm headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgXUTT"&gt;Then there’s 5G. Worth noting: the Ace supports Sub-6GHz 5G only, which is the more widespread “nationwide” variety. We still have complicated feelings about the state of 5G in the US, but carriers are pouring resources into expanding and improving their existing 5G offerings. In that sense, choosing a phone that supports it now will mean your device is future-proofed for what 5G brings in the next couple of years. Don’t expect a night-and-day difference just yet, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DyAF-s3c3YanHVVaQBCo__kND_8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264370/ajohnson_210126_4384_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rear camera bump includes a wide, ultrawide, macro, and a flash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cDUkfP"&gt;Motorola One 5G Ace camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CHlusT"&gt;Motorola has equipped the Ace with three rear-facing cameras: a 48-megapixel standard wide that kicks out 12-megapixel images, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, and a 2-megapixel macro camera. Around front, there’s a 16-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pDnzjV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When it stays in its lane, the Ace is capable of very nice photos&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EftzLm"&gt;Motorola also throws in a handful of useful software features. There’s an optional on-screen level, which I appreciate as a serial crooked photo-taker. You can opt for a very wide-format image using the main camera, turning the entire screen into a giant viewfinder, which is a fun creative exercise. There’s also a Pro mode if you want to take control of more settings. I didn’t use it much, partly because its insistence on displaying live Kelvin color temperature values stressed me out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8L3li"&gt;Like most others in this class, the Ace takes nice photos in good lighting conditions. I like its handling of color and white balance. Food looks appetizing, and it handles mixed lighting well. Overall, when it stays in its lane, the Ace is capable of very nice photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xDCdIc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10308631"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vDp3lc"&gt;The Ace, unfortunately, does not always stay in its lane. Often, it tries to do too much with too little. In some high-contrast ultrawide shots, I saw a lot of noise where it tried to boost shadows — noticeable color noise like I haven’t seen since I was reviewing point-and-shoot cameras [redacted] years ago. Night Vision mode produces a very bright image that just looks strangely artificial and overcooked. Ultrawide photos in anything less than bright outdoor light look very smoothed-over from noise reduction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjlxAU"&gt;There’s also some noticeable shutter lag, which would definitely bother someone trying to photograph a moving subject like a child. It was more of a minor annoyance in my particular use cases of sleeping cat and street scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEGzx6"&gt;Even images taken in standard photo mode with the main camera look overworked with close inspection. The camera captures a good amount of detail, but sharpening can be aggressive and crunchy. A photo I took of the sunrise in my backyard was spoiled by some noticeable halo-ing around dark subjects in the foreground. If the Ace had just exposed for the sky and let shadows be, it would have been fine! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCMkdW"&gt;To be clear, it’s not a problem that a $400 phone can’t do all of the things the Ace is trying to do; it’s just that it probably shouldn’t try in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vWgMCo"&gt;Motorola One 5G Ace software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wjLxPl"&gt;The Ace ships with Android 10, and an update to 11 has been promised. That’s the only major platform update you’ll get. Beyond that, Motorola will provide two years of security updates, up until January 2023. Motorola is, unfortunately, behind the curve by offering just one major update, even for a budget device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5tT8xW"&gt;Motorola’s take on Android includes customizable home screen fonts, icon shapes, and colors, along with a couple of annoying pre-downloaded apps that can be hidden but not uninstalled. I like Moto’s handling of lock screen notifications, or “peek notifications” as it calls them. They’re helpful without being intrusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KHOMy-SW8fE2606yTkwIu8RppVc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264368/ajohnson_210126_4384_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ace doesn’t have a lot of direct competition as a $400 phone with 5G, but that will change soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="WRppA1"&gt;“You get what you pay for” is an appropriate takeaway here, and I mean that in both a cautionary and a complimentary sense. Despite some resemblance, this isn’t a $1,000 phone, and you won’t get a $1,000 experience. But for $400, you should expect to get a phone that will get you through your day without giving you trouble. It should do the things you need it to do — even some things you &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;it to do — and it should see you through a couple of years at least. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9fTv0"&gt;The One 5G Ace meets all of those requirements, even though it does fall short of good midrange and high-end devices. Though capable, its processor can’t quite hang with the best of them. The camera is a little clumsy. The screen, while plenty big and bright, isn’t going to offer the rich viewing experience of a competing device with an OLED. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PYhLKg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Despite some resemblance, this isn’t a $1,000 phone, and you won’t get a $1,000 experience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AYk6z9"&gt;For now, the Ace doesn’t have much direct 5G-capable competition for $400, but that will change quickly. If you plan to hang on to your phone for the next couple of years, it does make sense to pick a 5G model now. For a bit more, the $460 Google Pixel 4A 5G offers a superior camera, a nicer screen, and a slightly better processor. Or you could save some money and get the $300 OnePlus Nord N10 5G with a 90Hz screen that’s almost as big and a better camera, though it offers a less powerful processor. If it’s an option, you could wait things out for a few months. More affordable 5G devices are on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="99Njdr"&gt;I don’t have a problem recommending the Motorola One 5G Ace if — and it’s an important &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; — a large screen and great battery are priorities for you above all else. But if you think you’ll want a better camera or a nicer screen, it would be best to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
