    <title>Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 review: ninth time’s the charm</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Lenovo has nailed the ThinkPad formula&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="UOpv2C"&gt;It makes me feel very old to say this, but we are on the ninth generation of Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Carbon. And there have been nine of these for a reason. The X1 Carbon has historically been one of the best business laptops you can get. And that remains the case with its newest iteration. Lenovo has made a few tweaks, but otherwise, it’s the same ThinkPad excellence we’ve come to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COATVp"&gt;Before we get into the pricing, I need to make the usual caveat that Lenovo loves to put absurdly high MSRPs on all of its ThinkPads, but they’re usually available for significantly less. So the base X1 Carbon (the Linux model) has an MSRP of $2,336 but is currently available for $1,401.60. That model includes a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of RAM (soldered), 256GB of storage, and a 1920 x 1200, 14-inch, 400-nit, non-touch display. Prebuilt models run up to a Core i7-1185G7, 32GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $3,479 (listed at $2,249.40). You can add an infrared camera, as well as a touchscreen with Lenovo’s Privacy Guard or a UHD+ panel, but those options are only available with the IR webcam. The IR camera can also come with human presence detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXGnWq"&gt;The specific model I tested is currently listed for $1,829.40 if you &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fconfigurator%2Fcto%2Findex.html%3FbundleId%3D20XWCTO1WWUS1%26ecpn%3D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22691965%2Flenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-9-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;construct it on Lenovo’s site&lt;/a&gt; ($3.049 MSRP). As a full package, it’s listed for &lt;a href="https://www.cdw.com/product/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-9-14-core-i7-1165g7-evo-16-gb-ram/6447737"&gt;$2,251.99 at CDW&lt;/a&gt; but is currently sold out there. It has a Core i7-1165G7 (a step down from the most expensive chip), 16GB of memory, 512GB of storage, a non-touch display, no vPro, and no IR camera. It is verified through Evo, which is the program Intel uses to certify top-performing models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lx7glP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10771588"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="kyZxhF"&gt;The ThinkPad’s biggest update from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/12/17226578/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-2018-laptop-sixth-generation-windows-review-price-specs"&gt;X1 Carbon Gen 8&lt;/a&gt; is the new 16:10 display, a feature Lenovo has been adding to X-series ThinkPads across the line. It affords noticeably more vertical screen space than you’ll see from the 16:9 Carbon Gen 8, which means less scrolling and less zooming out while multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GaCDEe"&gt;Aspect ratio aside, the screen on this device is quite good. It has a 1920 x 1200 resolution and comes with a new technology that’s supposed to reduce blue light exposure. My unit was slightly dim for the category, maxing out at 297 nits (it’s rated for 400), but the matte texture meant I still saw very little glare in bright indoor settings and could work comfortably. The display delivered a good picture with vivid colors, high contrast, and sharp details. The screen covers 99 percent of the sRGB gamut and 87 percent of Adobe RGB, which is good (though not comparable to what you’ll see on something like an OLED panel). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbZftV"&gt;In addition to this display, you can get a 400-nit FHD+ touchscreen model or a brighter 500-nit FHD+ touchscreen option with Lenovo’s Privacy Guard technology, which makes it harder for potential snoops to peek at your screen from the sides. (This option doesn’t have the blue light filter.) Then there’s a UHD+ 500-nit non-touch screen, which &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;include the blue light filter and also supports Dolby Vision. The FHD+ panel is good enough that I don’t think most people should need the UHD one unless brightess is an isuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the right side of the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kl4SoHXkaF2W2GV4Xan_jW2p9FA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804712/akrales_210824_4723_0080.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;USB-A, lock slot, audio jack on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zomSQ622h_dz5lY1IVzeMnHYSRs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804713/akrales_210824_4723_0086.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two USB-C, a USB-A, and an HDMI on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HZRNut"&gt;The second thing that’s been upgraded: the hinge. Put the Gen 9 next to previous ThinkPad X1 Carbon models and you’ll notice that the former now has a single round hinge connecting the display to the keyboard deck. There are communication antennas inside (so it’s no &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569871/lenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review"&gt;soundbar hinge&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s something). I like this build a little more, and it makes the bottom bezel look a bit less chunky, but folks will likely take their own views. Speaking of that bottom bezel, the visible Lenovo and X1 Carbon logos that adorned that of the previous model are now gone, creating a slightly more refined and less commercial look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qt5WjK"&gt;Third change: touchpad is bigger. 10 percent wider, specifically. Sure, &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-8-2020"&gt;reviewers felt&lt;/a&gt; that the Gen 8’s was a bit small. I will say that while the extra width is nice, it’s still a bit cramped height-wise (probably because it needs to accommodate a set of ThinkPad-signature discrete clickers), and I did find myself hitting plastic a lot when I scrolled. Everything else about the touchpad is great, though — it has quite a smooth texture and an effortless click. The keyboard is also snappy, though it is a bit loud and the backspace key squeaked on my model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 on a table in front of a bookshelf, open, angled slightly to the right. The screen displays a Verge article." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fAWMpVpLqD78bCNRnS0aGM91vMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804716/akrales_210824_4723_0131.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keys have a scissor-lift mechanism “to ensure ergonomics and comfort.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zp2tKk"&gt;The X1 Carbon Gen 9 also has an improved Dolby Atmos audio system. There are new upward-firing speakers on each side of the keyboard. The sound was surprisingly good, with particularly forceful percussion and bass. The device comes preloaded with Dolby Access, which you can use to switch between equalizer presets for games, movies, music, and voice calls, as well as custom profiles. These did make a noticeable difference, though I often find that I prefer to listen to music on the Movies profile since the Music profile makes the vocals stand out a bit more than I like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 on a table in front of a bookshelf, facing away from the camera, angled to the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hhnfrHM5i43Gz3zieMELa77bQRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804714/akrales_210824_4723_0101.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are four 360-degree far-field microphones as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k9gUwI"&gt;Finally, the match-on-chip fingerprint reader is now integrated into the power button (it was previously next to the touchpad). Sure, that’s a slightly more convenient position. The sensor didn’t quite get my fingerprint every time (possibly due to how tiny it now is), but it generally worked well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sag8BH"&gt;If you’re not a fan of the fingerprint reader, you may want to spring for a model with the IR camera, which supports Windows Hello facial recognition. Human presence detection enables the computer to automatically wake when you’re near it and lock when you move away. I didn’t have one of these fancy cameras, but the regular one on my unit was serviceable enough — I looked grainy on my Zoom calls, but generally accurate. There’s a physical webcam shutter as well, as is standard for ThinkPads of this caliber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="JGYltN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10771614"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zvlOQq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The X1 Carbon is absolutely up there with Dell’s XPS as one of the best-built laptops you can buy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="h9gjj4"&gt;Elsewhere, the Carbon Gen 9 has a heck of a lot in common with previous X1 Carbon models. It has the same beautiful black chassis with all of the signature ThinkPad features, from the red TrackPoint to the unique keyboard layout. (Remember: Fn and Ctrl are reversed on ThinkPads.) It’s unbelievably thin and light (2.49 pounds, 0.59 inches) while still being quite durable; Lenovo says it’s undergone MILSpec durability testing. The X1 Carbon is absolutely up there with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell’s XPS&lt;/a&gt; as one of the best-built laptops you can buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFqukR"&gt;Inside, the X1 Carbon now includes 11th Gen Intel processors with Iris Xe integrated graphics across the board. My test model was a great multitasker, with no problem running Zoom calls on top of Spotify streams on top of heaps of Chrome tabs. Intel’s Core i7-1165G7 delivers some of the best performance you’ll find from a laptop of this size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8d0cL"&gt;You wouldn’t want to rely on the Iris Xe GPU for anything super graphics-heavy, but it can lend a hand with all kinds of general video playback, multimedia work, and computational tasks. I got through editing a batch of photos just fine. Anyone who plans on doing a lot of gaming has access to similarly priced and similarly built options with GPUs, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="GYLeZy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10771620"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LlYrE5"&gt;For some raw numbers, the ThinkPad took 10 minutes and 22 seconds to export a five-minute, 33-second 4K video in Adobe Premiere Pro. That’s about 20 seconds faster than the XPS 13 with the same processor took to complete the same task. It was over two minutes slower than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;M1 MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; and took over twice as long as the Dell XPS 15 with a GTX 1650, just to illustrate how much an entry-level GPU can add. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUsK7k"&gt;I wasn’t able to run the Puget Systems benchmark for Premiere Pro because it kept freezing. Lenovo is looking into the problem but hasn’t figured out the cause yet. In the meantime, the X1 Carbon tends to score mid-200s (&lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=56480"&gt;248, most recently&lt;/a&gt;) on this test. That also doesn’t approach the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=55783"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but it does beat the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=16041"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, the ThinkPad’s graphics performance doesn’t top the category, but it’s solidly in the mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfXWrT"&gt;I didn’t encounter any bothersome fan noise while using the X1 Carbon. I also had no problem using the device on my lap — it got toasty but never uncomfortably so. The touchpad and palm rests were always downright cool, even under fairly intense loads. No complaints on that front, which is commendable for such a thin device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kvZJKD-k_ylJrSYrLu8Ner8Vnxc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804707/akrales_210824_4723_0042.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That trusty TrackPoint remains.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ja9fA7"&gt;Finally, the ThinkPad’s battery (while running my dozen-tab-plus workload with frequent YouTube and Spotify in the background around 200 nits of brightness) varied a bit based on settings. I consistently got over 10 hours of juice when I was on the Battery Saver profile and had Intel’s battery-saving features on, but I could see as low as five with a more powerful performance profile. I saw an overall average of eight hours and 43 minutes, which is respectable — better than the XPS 15, where I only averaged around six hours, but worse than the XPS 13, where I averaged over nine. I didn’t see any performance penalty from the Battery Saver profile, so I’d use that if you need all-day juice. Also a benefit: The ThinkPad doesn’t ship with McAfee or other crapware that can eat into battery life on consumer models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 closed, seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xES0QJXKpipHpI_ut-YkzTjDSWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804719/akrales_210824_4723_0158.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looks like a ThinkPad, runs like a ThinkPad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SkEh4C"&gt;Apart from the dim screen (and the lack of an option brighter than 500 nits, when a number of business models now offer 1,000-nit options), the still-slightly-cramped touchpad, and the squeaky keyboard, I have very few complaints about this X1 Carbon. Its price is quite high, of course, so those nitpicks still do give me some pause.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Qgw9L3"&gt;Lenovo’s new additions — particularly the 16:10 screen and the upward-firing speakers — are absolutely welcome, and they make the X1 Carbon Gen 9 unquestionably the best iteration of this device so far. It’s a formula Lenovo has perfected to a tee, combining the ThinkPad line’s world-class engineering with exactly the tweaks it needed to stay excellent in the modern market. While the X1 Carbon isn’t the best value for consumers, any deep-pocketed business shopper should give it a look.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s fall hardware event 2021: rumors, news, and announcements </title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AInWsdSsYBNM0c7iKkI3N8b9VP8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69914566/vpavic_200616_4067_0032.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Expect new product announcements on September 28th&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="ktvj5R"&gt;When Amazon announces new products in the fall, it often does it in bulk — fitting for a retailer, maybe, but harder to discern what’s what and which new products are most worthy of your attention. The Verge will try and help with that. We anticipate Amazon announcing a variety of new products coming to its Echo, Fire, and Ring lineups on September 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIt7I2"&gt;Amazon has already been making some waves with recent announcements of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662673/amazon-fire-tv-omni-4-series-price-features"&gt;its own line of TVs&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22684801/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-features-price-release-date"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662985/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-announced-features-price"&gt;new flagship Fire TV Stick&lt;/a&gt;. Yet we’re sure to see plenty more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X48Fhn"&gt;But even if Amazon has already made some notable announcements prior to this event, don’t forget how expansive its products are, from Ring to August smart locks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22663811/amazon-luna-fire-tablet-chromebook-family-retro-channels"&gt;game streaming&lt;/a&gt; and actual &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686351/amazon-games-christoph-hartmann-twitch-luna-new-world"&gt;video game development&lt;/a&gt;. The most recent rumors encompass &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691287/amazon-echo-alexa-devices-wall-mounted-soundbar-auto-robot"&gt;a wall-mounted Echo, Alexa-powered soundbars, a second-generation Echo Auto&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new Echo, a drone, and everything else to expect from Amazon’s big hardware event</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ey0do-8Apbyf0nXfq3sVW3o8VJY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69914536/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon’s 2021 fall hardware event is coming September 28th. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PXQWnL"&gt;Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684357/amazon-fall-event-devices-services-features-september-28th-echo-alexa"&gt;holding its annual fall hardware event&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, September 28th starting at 12PM ET / 9AM PT. It’s invite-only, and while Amazon said it would share news about “devices, features and services,” it’s not elaborating on which product lines might get updates or what new devices could be revealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rY7Fd2"&gt;If last year was any indication, expect to see a massive amount of hardware. Last year, Amazon unveiled a new spherical Echo with Zigbee support and “premium, adaptive sound” from Dolby, spherical Echo Dots (one which came with a clock), and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21454117/amazon-new-echo-show-10-alexa-smart-display-moving-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;the Echo Show 10 got a motorized base&lt;/a&gt; that turns its screen to face you while you’re interacting with it. It also added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21454420/amazon-echo-show-10-netflix-smart-speaker"&gt;Netflix support&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UqxPBG"&gt;Plus, Amazon unveiled its AWS-powered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21451371/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming-service-twitch-alexa-controller"&gt;gaming service Luna&lt;/a&gt; along with a special Luna Controller. And Amazon’s Ring launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453709/ring-always-home-cam-indoor-drone-security-camera-price-specs-features-amazon"&gt;Always Home Cam&lt;/a&gt;, a security drone for your house (which has yet to be released as of this writing). The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453133/amazon-fire-tv-stick-lite-features-price-release-date"&gt;Fire Stick&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21451035/amazon-new-eero-mesh-wi-fi-gear-wifi-6-price-release-date"&gt;Eero routers&lt;/a&gt; both got refreshes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7a2QM"&gt;Now let’s talk about this year’s event. We have a few rumors and educated guesses about what Amazon has on tap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BtQsUB"&gt;Likely: An Alexa-powered soundbar, wall-mounted Echo, and an Echo Auto update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uzUsmR"&gt;Amazon doesn’t typically see its products leak ahead of official announcements as much as some other companies (coughiPhonecough), but there’s been a fair amount of strong evidence about what may be coming next. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; had news that a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-24/amazon-working-on-large-wall-echo-sound-bar-and-new-auto-device?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;wall-mounted Echo&lt;/a&gt; is likely. It would have a much larger 15-inch display that could be mounted on a wall or a stand and could be a control panel for other smart home devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbOnv0"&gt;An Alexa-powered soundbar with an integrated camera that can make video calls easier is also expected, per &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. And while there weren’t many details available, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported an update for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20754404/amazon-echo-auto-review-alexa-car-price-specs-features"&gt;Echo Auto&lt;/a&gt; is also in the works (remember Echo Auto?). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22540298/amazon-ring-car-dash-cam-image-support-article"&gt;An image&lt;/a&gt; of what appeared to be the Ring-branded dash camera &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453632/ring-car-alarm-security-camera-connect-tesla-price-specs-features-amazon"&gt;first announced by Ring last September&lt;/a&gt; showed up in June. The so-called Car Cam would have Alexa integration and be able to record video from the dashboard. If Amazon does plan to update Echo Auto, a Car Cam would make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lwtfk6"&gt;We’re also expecting to finally see the Always Home Cam drone Amazon showed off last year. Yet, that likely won’t be the only Ring hardware. Some other updates to the Ring product line seem likely as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vlvFcU"&gt;Unlikely: The Vesta robot and the Seeker kids’ wearable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="930PL5"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/23/17270002/amazon-robot-home-alexa-echo"&gt;long-rumored Echo home robot Vesta&lt;/a&gt; now seems unlikely to launch this year— if it ever does — even though it reportedly had 800 employees working on it and reached “late prototype stage.” &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazons-lab126-vesta-project-grows-but-insiders-are-concerned-2021-3?op=1&amp;amp;scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4&amp;amp;r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year that people involved with Vesta’s development were concerned it “could turn into another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9292695/amazon-fire-phone-sales-end"&gt;Fire Phone,” one of the biggest Amazon hardware misfires&lt;/a&gt; in, well, ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJGrXY"&gt;It also seems unlikely we’ll see Seeker, the rumored Alexa-enabled wearable for kids, which would come with GPS tracking. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577165/amazon-wearable-for-kids-plus-gps-tracking"&gt;reportedly on the Amazon roadmap&lt;/a&gt; for 2020, but its fate is unclear at this point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MACjH3"&gt;And after Amazon announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22684801/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-features-price-release-date"&gt;new Paperwhite last week&lt;/a&gt;, it seems unlikely we’ll see more in the Kindle department at the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="g1uwar"&gt;Uncertain: Alexa sleep apnea tracker?	&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="t0WeaP"&gt;There were reports earlier this year that Amazon was developing an Alexa-enabled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216648/amazon-sleep-tracking-alexa-brahms-apnea-radar-device"&gt;device that could track and monitor sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;. Whether we’ll see that at Tuesday’s event is anyone’s guess at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQ1hHp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPdHOB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CECkb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Oculus Go’s operating system is being unlocked, John Carmack announces</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oNBBnCa3wHeBR-peKIPI1bVOL9M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69914460/akrales_180426_2494_0175.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zPcUHc"&gt;Facebook is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1441787976191676416"&gt;unlocking the bootloader&lt;/a&gt; of its discontinued Oculus Go headset and giving users full root access. That means the headset will remain useful long after official support ends. The move was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1441496416463904768"&gt;announced by Oculus’ consulting CTO John Carmack&lt;/a&gt;, who stepped down from his full-time role as CTO in 2019 to focus on his work as an independent AI researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="peXOad"&gt;Root access will be achieved by sideloading a future software update, opening the door for anyone to modify and improve Oculus’ original standalone all-in-one VR headset. Facebook originally released the Oculus Go in 2018 before supplanting it with the Oculus Quest the following year. The Go was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21299311/oculus-go-headset-discontinued-quest-alternative-app-channel-launch"&gt;officially discontinued in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g3y6fB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This opens up the ability to repurpose the hardware for more things today, and means that a randomly discovered shrink wrapped headset twenty years from now will be able to update to the final software version, long after over-the-air update servers have been shut down.&lt;/p&gt;— John Carmack (@ID_AA_Carmack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1441496418368294914?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SRBey8"&gt;“We are going to make available an unlocked OS build for the Oculus Go headset that can be side loaded to get full root access,” Carmack &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1441496418368294914"&gt;wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. “This opens up the ability to repurpose the hardware for more things today, and means that a randomly discovered shrink wrapped headset twenty years from now will be able to update to the final software version, long after over-the-air update servers have been shut down.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0E1B2"&gt;Responding to questions from his followers, Carmack said that the initiative only covers the Oculus Go, but that he “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1441498667584684034"&gt;hopes it sets a precedent&lt;/a&gt;” for other devices. The unlocked OS is likely to be made available &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1441498442082054146"&gt;via the Oculus website&lt;/a&gt;, Carmack says, but an official release plan has yet to be finalized. It will consist of the last Go update &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1441530976539054080"&gt;but with root access&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkWuaL"&gt;“I still heard a lot of arguments about what bad things could happen if users had full control of their obsolete devices, but I clearly favor user empowerment,” Carmack explained. The developer has long been a fan of opening his work on titles like &lt;em&gt;Doom &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Quake&lt;/em&gt; for hobbyist tinkering. Most notably, it was the release of &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt;’s source code in the late ‘90s that has allowed the classic shooter to be hacked into dozens of unusual devices &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2014/07/26/playing-doom-on-an-atm/"&gt;from ATMs&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://gamerant.com/doom-player-gets-game-running-dslr-camera/#:~:text=In%20the%20grand%2C%20long%2Drunning,pinnacle%20of%20PC%20graphical%20performance."&gt;digital cameras&lt;/a&gt;. This open-sourcing tradition continued up until the &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt; engine, whose source code was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/11/22/2581536/doom-3-gpl-source-code-availability"&gt;released in 2011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLQ1fK"&gt;It’s worth noting that Carmack previously said Oculus intended to offer support for USB storage on the Oculus Go with a forthcoming update that never materialized, as reported by &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-go-no-usb-support/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the headset’s release, the developer said support would arrive “relatively soon,” but a year later was forced to concede that a “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1192418316473765888"&gt;hardware problem&lt;/a&gt;” prevented the feature’s arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="psZdYu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwPOTE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Metroid Dread feels right at home on Nintendo’s new OLED Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_6_bdFNOLJWkpDw3fp-lqw30Lo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69914302/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GiViOO"&gt;The most impressive feature in Nintendo’s new Switch model is its seven-inch OLED screen, giving games more vivid-looking colors and deeper contrast. It also has an improved kickstand that’s more functional and versatile than the one on the default Switch. But what’s a new system launch without a killer app? I was able to play the first 90 minutes of &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;, and not only does it look like it was worth the 19-year-long wait for a sequel to &lt;em&gt;Metroid Fusion&lt;/em&gt;, but it might also be the ideal showcase for Nintendo’s new OLED Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOnZ95"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dread &lt;/em&gt;is coming to the Switch on October 8th, 2021, the same day as Nintendo’s latest iteration of the tablet / console hybrid. There are many games that I’m looking forward to trying with the OLED screen, but &lt;em&gt;Dread &lt;/em&gt;looked particularly stunning. Its sci-fi world seems even more fully realized (and creepy) on a display that allows for deeper blacks. The details in the 2D-meets-3D environments really stick out as a result of this screen tech, as do all of the new enemy varieties.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RW9jRpJbjdgScKpByPyEX0VXasY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873307/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0008.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DdPvUk"&gt;Nintendo says the new $349.99 OLED-touting Switch model isn’t faster than the standard Switch or the Switch Lite, but where I might be quick to notice graphical rough spots on my launch unit from early 2017, those quibbles weren’t nearly as apparent given the big boost in image quality that this OLED screen delivers. It’s still a 720p screen, but I was more impressed by the differences than I thought I’d be. Given the boost in contrast, text on the screen was a little easier to read, and the graphics overall look better than I’d expect from the Switch’s aging chipset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSOIC1"&gt;I played the game in handheld mode, but I briefly tested out the new kickstand. It can smoothly articulate between about 80 degrees to 10 degrees, or so, making it much easier to find your desired angle in tabletop mode when you’re, say, playing on a plane. With this model, it seems like the days of your kickstand snapping off under normal use (whether to actually prop up the console or just to access the microSD card slot) are gone. The newer kickstand still hides the microSD card slot, but you might not be reaching for that as quickly, as this Switch OLED model comes with 64GB instead of the 32GB default amount in previous Switch consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-03q4G2hyVznbC_XAFlBjp2KBRg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873312/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0014.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g0T1OhREsxWOkqO-7BlLZTPoXnQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873311/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0013.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FmzzTq"&gt;Nintendo suggested that I try playing &lt;em&gt;Dread &lt;/em&gt;through this Switch’s improved speakers, and they were loud and clear enough for me to easily hear at a somewhat-loud press event. They probably won’t outclass most headphones, but they seemed better at creating a virtual bubble of sound that I felt like I was in the middle of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wuGrIV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nintendo hasn’t lost its step in making stellar &lt;em&gt;Metroid &lt;/em&gt;games&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jjx32H"&gt;Regardless of how you feel about these improvements in the OLED Switch, it still feels like a Switch when you’re playing it. And importantly, &lt;em&gt;Dread &lt;/em&gt;feels like a &lt;em&gt;Metroid &lt;/em&gt;game. The story picks up right after the events in &lt;em&gt;Fusion&lt;/em&gt;, and — following a quick recap of prior events — &lt;em&gt;Dread &lt;/em&gt;drops you right into the game. Within the first 15 minutes, you’ll be chased by E.M.M.I robots, which are fast, tough opponents programmed to hunt and capture Samus. It’s a dreadful feeling, reminiscent of encountering SA-X, Samus’ deadly clones in &lt;em&gt;Metroid Fusion&lt;/em&gt;. Though, instead of guaranteed annihilation, &lt;em&gt;Dread &lt;/em&gt;sometimes grants Samus the ability to melee counter an E.M.M.I to get away. It’s tense and exciting. The E.M.M.I robots only patrol fixed sections of the map, gated by strange doors made of floating cubes (seen in the image up top), but you’ll have to get by them to proceed through the game. Of course, there’s a host of new enemy types and bosses, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S9JGt06_G7UfndTmB3BhpWJNPq8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873310/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0011.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6T4_bklXRliAQVkUPEn8c_Ed35c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873305/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OGYBDy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dread &lt;/em&gt;also wastes no time introducing you to some new tricks and heavy weaponry that’ll help you navigate the challenge. From the start, Samus can slide under spaces that used to require a Morph Ball by tapping the left trigger. And like in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16291350/metroid-samus-returns-review-nintendo-3ds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid: Samus Returns&lt;/em&gt; for the 3DS&lt;/a&gt; (which Nintendo also co-developed alongside &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; studio Mercury Steam), the melee counter is back. If an enemy glistens before an attack, you can hit X to stun them to get an easy hit in. Even this limited moveset in the early game served up some of the most cinematic encounters I’ve seen in a &lt;em&gt;Metroid &lt;/em&gt;game, 2D game or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HU2SkS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt; shares plenty in common with its predecessors. Each section of the game has its share of areas you can and can’t access due to your suit’s limitations. There are map download and save rooms, missile and health recharge stations, and plenty of secrets hidden in the terrain. But going through the usual paces, like stopping in a save room or interacting with Chozo statues, which dole out suit upgrades, isn’t the multi-second affair it has been in previous games. Samus runs quickly, and encounters are brisk, yet visceral, aided by solid performance that rarely seemed to dip below a smooth 60 frames per second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uRAlm0tbUDvm9HRdPjcyru9e1a0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873304/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x3YUO5TuyBCF1whkPsDBtonmZUo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873308/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0009.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ARHR8c"&gt;The series’ signature difficulty is still here, but it’s far less punishing in the sections that I played, thanks to save points being spaced out no more than a few minutes apart. That’s great, given the portable nature of the Switch, where you might be trying to squeeze in a short session on the go. On top of that, the divvying out of challenge and reward in &lt;em&gt;Dread &lt;/em&gt;seems finely balanced to the point that it shouldn’t scare off new players or feel too easy for returning veterans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="q2ZPKb"&gt;From what I was able to play, &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt; feels inspired and energetic, not like how I imagined a game that was effectively canceled for over a decade would be. And while a question mark hangs over &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime 4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date"&gt;which was rebooted while still in development back in early 2019&lt;/a&gt;, playing &lt;em&gt;Dread &lt;/em&gt;served as a reminder that Nintendo hasn’t lost its step in making stellar &lt;em&gt;Metroid &lt;/em&gt;games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;p id="QlrgD5"&gt;Instagram says it’s “pausing” development of what’s been dubbed “Instagram Kids” — a version of the photo-sharing app aimed at children under 13. Instagram chief Adam Mosseri announced the news in a &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/pausing-instagram-kids"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; today, saying that the Facebook-owned company would continue to work on parental-supervised experiences for younger users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49MUYi"&gt;In a blog post and series of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1442461230124322828"&gt;accompanying tweets&lt;/a&gt;, Mosseri blames the media and critics for misunderstanding the purpose of the app. “It was never meant for younger kids, but for tweens (aged 10-12),” he writes. In a separate &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1442461237825081353"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, he adds that news of the project “leaked way before we knew what it would be. People feared the worst, and we had few answers at that stage. It’s clear we need to take more time on this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WgqjCf"&gt;Pausing development of the app comes after &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; published a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;series of damning reports&lt;/a&gt; into Facebook last week. These &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;included a story&lt;/a&gt; revealing how Instagram’s own internal research suggested that the app made body issues worse for teenage girls. Facebook says these reports &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22695629/facebook-says-instagram-is-not-toxic-for-teens-despite-damning-wsj-report"&gt;mischaracterized&lt;/a&gt; the company’s studies, but it has so far refused to release its data firsthand for critics and supporters alike to analyze. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I have to believe parents would prefer the option for their children to use an age-appropriate version of Instagram - that gives them oversight - than the alternative. But I’m not here to downplay their concerns, we have to get this right.&lt;/p&gt;— Adam Mosseri   (@mosseri) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1442461233337159688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WROnhh"&gt;In his blog post, Mosseri notes that the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting “raised a lot of questions for people,” and says such criticism has led Instagram to introducing a number of anti-bullying features, as well as “exploring” features that might encourage readers to take a break from the app. (Parts of the &lt;em&gt;WSJ’&lt;/em&gt;s reporting that Instagram and Mosseri have ignored include the company’s own researchers noting that users often feel “addicted” to the app.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmkkUn"&gt;The development of a version of Instagram aimed at younger users was &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56757586"&gt;widely criticized&lt;/a&gt; by a number of groups. Facebook responded to this criticism by saying young people were already active online and it was better that their experience be supervised. The company also said it wouldn’t show advertising on the new app. However, critics were not convinced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pJIWo"&gt;“Facebook claims that creating an Instagram for kids will help keep them safe on the platform,” Kathryn Montgomery, a senior strategist at the Center for Digital Democracy, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56757586"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in April&lt;em&gt;. “&lt;/em&gt;The company’s real goal is to expand its lucrative and highly profitable Instagram franchise to an even younger demographic, introducing children to a powerful commercialized social media environment that poses serious threats to their privacy, health and wellbeing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfvpuo"&gt;Mosseri notes on Twitter that critics will see Instagram pausing development of the kids app “as a concession that the project is a bad idea.” He’s adamant this is incorrect, adding: “I have to believe parents would prefer the option for their children to use an age-appropriate version of Instagram - that gives them oversight - than the alternative. But I’m not here to downplay their concerns, we have to get this right.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Resident Evil 4 VR is launching October 21st, but only on Oculus Quest 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Resident Evil 4 VR Key Art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VNSYmgy2uM6eBBQkn4VEcdaaFdM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69913924/RE4_Key_Art_3840x2160.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ITQjGb"&gt;A virtual reality version of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4 &lt;/em&gt;will launch October 21st on Facebook’s Oculus Quest 2 headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtyC7p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4 VR&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396528/capcom-resident-evil-4-oculus-quest-2-remake-trailer-footage-launch-date"&gt;announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. But Facebook and Capcom — as well as third-party development studio Armature — have only offered glimpses of its gameplay, including a short trailer. It adapts the original game’s content with a (mostly) first-person point of view, re-engineering it to take advantage of VR motion controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Resident Evil 4 VR Screenshot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8n9urNa09QPdrDtxcqEL0GVGRAA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22880730/RE4_SCREENSHOTS_MENDEZ_SHOTGUN_003_2560X1440_Legal.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DWxdtR"&gt;Armature’s &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; makes a somewhat complicated series of small changes the original 2005 horror game. It’s supposed to feature the same narrative content and world design, rather than getting the kind of overhaul &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 2&lt;/em&gt; did in 2019. But it’s been re-engineered to work as a first-person VR game with motion controllers. You’ll interact with weapons, items, and puzzles using your hands. Your health will be visible on a wristwatch instead of a screen overlay. And in addition to moving with the analog stick on an Oculus Touch controller, you’ll be able to teleport or walk in room-scale VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8ed8T"&gt;The new design could affect gameplay in some notable ways. You can wield weapons in each hand, for instance, and switching between them looks a lot easier. You’ll use a knife by physically slashing your controller at enemies instead of hitting a button. And a gameplay video shows you moving around while shooting, a major change from the original design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UAwbId"&gt;The game’s not fully first-person, though. All its cutscenes will be presented in their original third-person format, including ones tied to &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4’s&lt;/em&gt; many quick time events, according to Facebook. Based on Facebook’s description, the game features some surprisingly fast-sounding camera shifts — you can apparently kick a door down with a button, for instance, and see a short third-person animation as it opens.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Resident Evil 4 VR Screenshot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1XmSpxkOf1gFJ0U7ceQNEDTSwnc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22880733/RE4_SCREENSHOTS_CHURCH_PUZZLE_001_2560x1440_Legal.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9PuwRr"&gt;Facebook says the original quicktime event placements and animations are going to stay the same, although some of the actions have been “updated” to work better in VR. (We’ll be waiting to see how the game’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fey8XU0OiWo"&gt;more acrobatic&lt;/a&gt; sections translate to a headset.) Some of the quick time events will involve quickly moving the controllers, while others will ask you to pull their triggers at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w59RUz"&gt;Other tweaks would make sense in any remaster. The game’s textures have been updated, and Armature has made enemies less likely to target your partner Ashley, who you’ll spend a lot of time protecting in either version of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrnadb"&gt;Unlike most Quest games, &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4 VR&lt;/em&gt; isn’t compatible with the original 2019 Quest — it’s completely exclusive to the 2020 Quest 2. Facebook also isn’t sharing any potential plans to bring it to Oculus’ desktop platform, nor has it discussed the game coming to desktop PC or consoles, the way &lt;em&gt;Myst’s&lt;/em&gt; Oculus Quest version &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/myst-vr-remake-pc-vr-release-date/"&gt;later launched outside VR&lt;/a&gt;. But if you’re just interested in a better-looking version of the original &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;, there’s always the game’s &lt;a href="https://www.re4hd.com/?page_id=104"&gt;unofficial HD remaster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NBC gets super aggressive in YouTube TV dispute</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BtySc2U57Vzw1PJ0hs-l_891Ktk=/178x0:2100x1281/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69913813/Image_from_iOS__1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Banner ads are appearing across select channels.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: NBCU&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gEbfOs"&gt;NBC is one of several NBCUniversal channels running prominent banner ads on YouTube TV streams, warning customers that they could lose access over a carriage dispute with Google. The banner lists over a dozen channels that could disappear if a deal isn’t reached by Wednesday, September 30th, and directs customers to &lt;a href="https://youneedchannels.com/"&gt;an NBCU-owned website&lt;/a&gt; offering various ways to pressure Google. These include a pre-written tweet directed at YouTube TV, links to Google’s customer support, and a tool to find alternative providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1aal9O"&gt;“Attention YouTube TV Customers,” the banner, which runs roughly every 10 minutes, reads, “YouTube may drop 14+ channels including NBC, Telemundo, USA, SYFY, Brave, Oxygen, MSNBC, NBCSN, CNBC, GOLF Channel, and E!. Go to YouNeedChannels.com and tell YouTube TV not to drop your favorite channels.” NBCU warns that regional NBC Sports networks may also be affected, including NBC Sports Bay Area, NBC Sports Boston, NBC Sports California, NBC Sports Chicago, NBC Sports Philadelphia, SNY and NBC Sports Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zR38A3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@YouTubeTV&lt;/a&gt; may drop all of your favorite NBCUniversal programming from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nbc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BravoTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BravoTV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MSNBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Telemundo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Telemundo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/USA_Network?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@USA_Network&lt;/a&gt; and more! Visit &lt;a href="https://t.co/I3keStuLVy"&gt;https://t.co/I3keStuLVy&lt;/a&gt; to keep your news, shows and sports.&lt;/p&gt;— NBC Entertainment (@nbc) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nbc/status/1442249805439270915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUZwbJ"&gt;Responding via a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-nbc-programming-update/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Google says negotiations are ongoing and that it’s seeking the “the same rates that services of a similar size get from NBCU” and for YouTube TV to be treated like “any other TV provider.” Google added that if it’s unable to reach an agreement it’ll drop its US prices by $10 (bringing its monthly price down from $64.99 to $54.99) while NBCU’s lineup is off the service. Google says that customers are free to cancel anytime and can sign up for Peacock separately for $4.99 a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SB4eqR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/nbcuniversal-youtube-tv-lose-channels-1235074726/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that there are several points of contention in the ongoing negotiations. NBCU is reportedly asking for higher rates for its channels than Google is willing to pay, and wants YouTube TV to bundle NBC’s Peacock video streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3s0Ms2"&gt;“NBCUniversal is seeking fair rates from Google for YouTube TV’s continued carriage of the only portfolio offering entertainment, Hispanic, news and sports networks,” NBCU told &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;in a statement. “Unfortunately, Google is refusing to make a deal at these fair rates and is willing to withhold entertainment, news and sports programming from their paying customers. NBCUniversal feels a responsibility to inform our fans that they are at risk of losing their favorite shows if Google continues with their demands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjG6LY"&gt;This is just the latest high profile dispute YouTube TV has found itself in this year. However, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412430/roku-youtube-tv-google-feud-explainer-timeline"&gt;during its clash with Roku&lt;/a&gt; it was Google that was the content provider, and Roku that was providing the platform. The situation saw Google’s YouTube TV app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22411711/roku-removes-youtube-tv-channel-store"&gt;removed from the Roku channel store&lt;/a&gt;, only for Google to respond by letting its customers access YouTube TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425035/google-youtube-tv-roku-app-feud"&gt;from its regular YouTube app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QP3l0r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is also an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDWJD3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKArRz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Backbone offers 3D-printed solution for iPhone 13 Pro camera bump issue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BackBone One" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5pTzJYYDGcJV2im_LTmgwbvwrlc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69913581/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hk174V"&gt;Backbone Labs has acknowledged the issue that hampers the use of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;excellent iPhone gaming controller&lt;/a&gt; with the new iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691301/iphone-13-pro-camera-bump-backbone-one-gaming-controller-accessory"&gt;As we noticed last week&lt;/a&gt;, the iPhone 13 Pro’s thicker camera bump means the phone doesn’t sit neatly in the Backbone One controller, either sticking out on one side or causing the bridge on the back to slightly buckle. It’s not unusable, but it’s not great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uV1mXY"&gt;“We spent a tremendous amount of time meticulously crafting every surface of Backbone One (both bits and atoms) and even designing universal support for the iPhones available when it was released,” a Backbone representative wrote in an &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Backbone/comments/pvhl98/backbone_one_iphone_13_pro_pro_max_adapter/"&gt;official post on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. “As a result, we’re disappointed in the situation at hand. Several folks on the team even upgraded to 13 Pro Max for a better gaming experience, and while the fit may be acceptable for some users, it’s not as good as we’d like it to be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WquSRF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Backbone One is a stunning controller that turns your iPhone into a more capable gaming device","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0nAvVr"&gt;To address this, Backbone has designed an adapter that is intended to improve the experience with the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. Unfortunately, the company says it isn’t able to mass-produce them right away because of supply constraints and COVID-19, so the adapter design will be released as an open-source 3D printable file. If you don’t have access to a 3D printer, Backbone says “we’ll do our best” to send an adapter to users who contact the company’s support team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwUaUy"&gt;The printable files should be posted online “in a matter of days;” we’ll let you know how well the solution works when we can.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says Instagram is not ‘toxic for teens,’ despite damning WSJ report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zrW4hwEY_x6dAXJumMMTl6Ekgz0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69913270/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QRKUhm"&gt;Facebook has fired back nearly two weeks after &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Instagram made body image issues worse for one in three teenage girls according to Facebook’s own data. The &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/"&gt;salvo&lt;/a&gt; comes courtesy of Pratiti Raychoudhury, Vice President, Head of Research at Facebook. Raychoudhury’s post on Facebook’s Newsroom claims that &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s characterization of internal research is “not accurate” and blames it all on a poor interpretation of the data the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; has in its possession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpr6Uv"&gt;On September 14 &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journa&lt;/em&gt;l published a story to The Facebook Files, which is a series of stories based around an enormous cache of internal Facebook documents leaked to the newspaper. The September 14 piece &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;focused on data&lt;/a&gt; that suggested Instagram had an extremely harmful effect on teenagers — particularly teenage girls. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; claimed that Facebook was well aware of the harm its products had on teenagers and that the company “has made minimal efforts to address these issues and plays them down in public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JROoia"&gt;Facebook has been evasive about the contents of the study cited by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. But Facebook’s global head of safety, Antigone Davis, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675802/facebook-instagram-teens-harm-blumenthal-blackburn-markey-kids"&gt;expected to appear before the Senate Commerce Subcommittee&lt;/a&gt; Thursday to answer for the claims made in the story and plans for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338911/facebook-instagram-kids-privacy-coppa"&gt;new “Instagram for kids”.&lt;/a&gt; Raychoudhury specifically cites that hearing as the reason for the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEqCmz"&gt;Raychoudhury ignores many of the issues raised in the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; piece, including that teens claimed they felt addicted to Instagram. Instead she focuses her energies on devaluing Facebook’s own research. Much of the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s most scathing claims, according to Raychoudhury, focus on a study that had just 40 partipants. That would be a paltry sample size by any measure — but particularly when you’re talking about a platform with over 1 billion users. The tiny study was “designed to inform internal conversations about teens’ most negative perceptions of Instagram,” Raychoudhury claims. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q05V1_CL7VTsaWjvRCmFGlenbbc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22880746/IG_research.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook hasn’t released the internal studies, but did release the slide the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; cited.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MFSrcw"&gt;Raychoudhury also takes umbrage with the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; referring to an internal Facebook slide that claims “we make body images worse for 1 in 3 teenage girls”. Raychoudhury repeatedly notes that the body image problem was just one of 12 possible issues that Instagram could make worse for teenage girls. “Body image was the only area where teen girls who reported struggling with the issue said Instagram made it worse as compared to the other 11 areas,” she writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaL8kL"&gt;Unfortunately neither Facebook, Instagram, or Raychoudhury have released the actual data that she repeatedly cites in her response to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting. Without seeing the data ourselves it’s extremely difficult to assess &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s or Raychoudhury’s intepretations of it. But, you know, this isn’t the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/4/18210473/instagram-self-harm-suicide-cutting-posts-molly-russell"&gt;first time&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20872711/instagram-weight-loss-cosmetic-procedures-restrictions-policy-wellness-influencer-marketing"&gt;we’ve heard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/19/health/instagram-worst-social-network-app-young-people-mental-health/index.html"&gt;about these problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
