    <title>A software update is giving Whirlpool smart ovens an air fry mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CiKcYXIUDPGu7Eh_u1w2GOE1pq0=/0x1:8510x5674/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346488/Whirlpool_Brand___Air_Fry__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updates to your oven.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Whirlpool&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J7tEGm"&gt;Whirlpool has announced that some of its smart, Wi-Fi-connected ovens will be getting an air fry mode to replicate the crispy reheating properties of one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271772/kitchen-gadgets-tech-favorite-cooking-blender-food-processor"&gt;the internet’s favorite cooking gadgets&lt;/a&gt;, all via a software update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTeWBA"&gt;The feature will be coming to its Smart Slide-in Gas and Electric Ranges and Smart Single, Double, and Combination Wall Ovens via what Whirlpool calls an “instant over-the-air upgrade.” The ovens are also getting the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whirlpool.com%2Fsmart-appliances%2Fworks-with-yummly.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22857723%2Fwhirlpool-smart-oven-air-fry-mode-convection-cooking-gadget" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ability to connect with Whirlpool’s Yummly smart thermometer&lt;/a&gt;, which will let you start preheating the oven from some of the app’s recipes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="26smey"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The promise of new features down the line could be a selling point for smart appliances&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ACVJ1J"&gt;The company says that you’ll be able to buy an air fry basket to put in your oven, starting in “early 2022.” And it seems like more features are in the works — its press release says that “its smart appliances are getting enhanced connected upgrades over time,” referring to the air fry mode as the “beginning.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yoe99o"&gt;Whirlpool didn’t respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s question about how the air fry mode would differ from the convection setting that many of its smart ovens are equipped with, as air fryers &lt;a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/air-fryer-vs-convection-oven-4774315"&gt;are usually just smaller convection ovens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6A9sK"&gt;GE Appliances, one of Whirlpool’s competitors, also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761170/ge-smart-oven-turkey-mode-software-upgrade"&gt;recently added an air fry mode&lt;/a&gt; to some of its smart ovens, along with a Turkey Mode. While some customers — myself included — haven’t found smart appliances especially appealing (the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/7/12/12159766/internet-of-things-iot-internet-of-shit-twitter"&gt;lack of longevity often found in the IoT space&lt;/a&gt; can be hard to swallow for such expensive purchases), the promise of new features rolled out via software update is a pretty decent selling point. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA successfully deploys complex sunshield on James Webb Space Telescope</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jjgKeUKeYQBijeqpIVRPFRApT_M=/0x0:5616x3744/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346478/15414105562_9bdcee1f0e_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The layers of JWST’s sunshield undergoing tests on the ground before its launch&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Northrop Grumman/Alex Evers&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SkjU8N"&gt;NASA’s next-generation James Webb Space Telescope has &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/sunshield-successfully-deploys-on-nasa-s-next-flagship-telescope"&gt;successfully deployed its sunshield&lt;/a&gt; — a critical feature the observatory will use to keep its instruments extra cold during the course of its mission. The unfurling of the sunshield marks the end of perhaps the most complicated deployment the observatory must pull off in order to properly function while in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yit7W7"&gt;“This is a really big moment,” Bill Ochs, the project manager for JWST at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, said to the mission team after the deployment was complete. “I just want to congratulate the entire team. We still got a lot of work to do but but getting the sunshield out and deployed is really, really big.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSywtc"&gt;The James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, is NASA’s powerful new space observatory that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/25/22850167/james-webb-space-telescope-jwst-launch-mission-success"&gt;launched on December 25th&lt;/a&gt; after roughly 25 years of development. Often considered the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope currently in orbit around Earth, JWST promises to provide even more power and an enhanced capability to see distant, faint objects in our Universe. Astronomers hope to use JWST to peer back in time and see some of the first stars and galaxies that formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9Mdlp"&gt;But in order to observe the ancient Universe, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22816310/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-jwst-deployment-sequence"&gt;JWST has to go through a complex unfolding process first&lt;/a&gt;. The telescope was far too large to launch to space in its final configuration, so mission designers crafted the telescope to unfold after launch. The deployment relies on hundreds of mechanisms and moving parts, and everything has to go right in order for JWST to function. Along the way, there are up to 344 single-point failures, deployments without any backups that &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; execute as designed or else they could jeopardize the entire mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qbVxOK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the end of perhaps the most complicated deployment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QhC0ev"&gt;Part of the unfolding process entailed deploying JWST’s sunshield. JWST observes infrared light, a type of invisible light that is associated with heat. Because of this, the telescope must remain extremely cold in order to properly function, operating at roughly -370 degrees Fahrenheit. The sunshield, comprised of five thin reflective layers of a material called Kapton, is designed to prevent the Sun’s heat from cooking the telescope too much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cH5et0"&gt;The deployment of the sunshield was an extremely complex event; the layers are incredibly thin membranes that had to remain intact. Up to 107 release mechanisms were used to unfurl the layers, and each mechanism &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to work as planned in order for the sunshield to completely open up. Once the layers unfurled, the spacecraft then had to draw them taut, a bit like sails on a sailboat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w1IX3uU-f_0QGtPfhrwFq0Q92ME=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144281/51412123217_ba966ac1c2_o__2_.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of JWST fully deployed in space&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tfaCzT"&gt;The sunshield deployment took a little more than a week to complete, a bit longer than originally planned. NASA had tentatively scheduled the process to take about six days, but the JWST team took a pause over the New Year weekend to both get some rest and pore over the data they were receiving from the spacecraft. There were also a few problems they had to work on along the way due to some unexpected temperature readings and equipment issues. “We are still in the getting-to-know-you phase with the telescope,” Ochs said during a press conference the day before deployment ended. “Orbital satellites will always be a little bit different on orbit than they are on the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Oc6vcp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are still in the getting-to-know-you phase with the telescope.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6Se5l8"&gt;The first problem was a small issue with JWST’s solar arrays, which generate power from the Sun that the telescope needs in order to function. A factory preset of the solar arrays was limiting their power output, but Northrop Grumman rebalanced the arrays based on the temperatures they were experiencing in space. That seemed to fix the problem, and JWST is getting enough power now to function properly. The other issue revolved around the motors used to release the sunshield and help tension the layers. They were running a little bit hotter than the JWST team expected, so mission engineers slightly reoriented the observatory to reduce the sunlight hitting them. That helped to cool the motors off ahead of their planned use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OkmULP"&gt;Now that the sunshield is unfurled, some of the most nail-biting moments of JWST’s deployment are in the past. NASA says that between 70 to 75 percent of the single-point failures have officially been completed. “That is huge within the first week and a half or so of the spacecraft being in operation,” Ochs said during the press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9Uq5k"&gt;But there are other milestones yet to come for the telescope. Notably, the observatory still has to deploy segments of its primary mirror, the main tool it will use to collect light from distant galaxies and stars. That crucial event is set to happen in roughly a week, and like all the deployments up until now, it must execute perfectly in order for JWST to fulfill its job. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei ban gets parodied in truly bizarre Chinese state media sketch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FkIbzLbdsSkt0yPCoIRLeYDWSLE=/0x0:2160x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346433/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_4.16.02_PM.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mEBrgH"&gt;China’s state news agency, Xinhua News, has released a bizarre James Bond-themed parody video mocking the US and UK’s crackdown on Huawei. It really needs to be seen to be believed. The English-language video was &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/chinese-state-media-releases-video-mocking-western-fear-1848299545"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and has been released both on Xinhua’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19JYNxeMIXM"&gt;New China TV YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; as well as its &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XHNews/status/1478312196191014916"&gt;China Xinhua News Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, with both accounts carrying a warning about their affiliations with the Chinese state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFYhDx"&gt;I mean, where do we even start with this video. There’s the fact that our protagonist is called James Pond, in what appears to be an unwitting reference to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Pond:_Underwater_Agent"&gt;series of ’90s video games&lt;/a&gt; based on an anthropomorphic mudskipper of the same name. Or what about the fact that one secret agent is supposedly doing an American accent while the other is doing a British accent, despite the fact that their accents are basically identical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmeuVj"&gt;Or the line “that’s bloody outrageous.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HEJ7ZaKCAaCT31GtUj6nMUmxEUc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144541/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_4.16.02_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Xinhua&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TjiKXO"&gt;Or the fact that not once but &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt;, James Pond uses the catchphrase “ExSQUEEZE me,” which &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo &lt;/em&gt;points out appears to be a reference not to James Bond but Mike Myers’ character Wayne from Wayne’s World rather than anything related to the spy franchise this video is ostensibly parodying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zsy8yY"&gt;Or the fact that the video references two western leaders by name — the UK’s David Cameron and Germany’s Angela Merkel — both of whom are no longer in charge of their respective countries. Cameron resigned back in 2016!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWS14E"&gt;Of course, the point of the video is less about trying to make sense and more about pushing an anti-US, pro-China narrative about Huawei. There’s a moment where a warning about China’s “National Security Agency” is revealed to &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; be referring to the work of the USA’s NSA (a Huawei exec &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/huawei-now-just-trolling-u-s-by-dredging-up-nsa-spying-1832925885"&gt;used a similar attack line during 2019’s MWC&lt;/a&gt;) and concerns about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133631/huawei-china-spying-claims-us-officials-blacklist-5g"&gt;Huawei devices containing security backdoors&lt;/a&gt; are dismissed because there’s no “shred of evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Kpfxd"&gt;What the video ignores is that many of the security concerns surrounding Huawei have focussed not on backdoors that are being actively exploited but on poor cybersecurity practices that could enable a future attack. A 2019 report from the UK’s Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC) Oversight Board, for example, raised concerns about Huawei’s “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/28/18285185/huawei-uk-government-cybersecurity-report-5g-rollout-security-concerns"&gt;basic engineering competence and cyber security hygiene&lt;/a&gt;.” The parody also makes no mention of Huawei’s alleged role in building technology for labor and reeducation camps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834860/huawei-leaked-documents-xinjiang-region-uyghur-facial-recognition-prisons-surveillance"&gt;in China’s Xinjiang region&lt;/a&gt;, nor the reports about its work on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163499/huawei-uighur-surveillance-facial-recognition-megvii-uyghur"&gt;facial recognition system to surveil Uighurs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaslSi"&gt;After several years of sanctions that have prevented it from acquiring much of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspension"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/9/21360598/huawei-chips-us-sanctions-trump-china-privacy-smartphone"&gt;hardware&lt;/a&gt; it needs to make modern devices, Huawei’s consumer business is in a sorry state. Its latest flagship, the P50 Pro, is yet to release outside of China, and even there, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22598135/huawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras"&gt;released as a 4G-only device&lt;/a&gt;. In China, Huawei has &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/china-smartphone-share/"&gt;fallen behind competitors like Vivo and Oppo&lt;/a&gt; in terms of smartphone sales after previously having outsold them in its home market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YuUuI0"&gt;Anyway, none of that’s really important in the context of this parody, which I promise you still makes zero sense even if you’re completely up to date on the Huawei situation. Just sit back and let the fever dream wash over you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T is giving away six months of Nvidia GeForce Now cloud gaming service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBaxb5_ISwC-cEq5oFEkCdVMFvA=/130x0:1150x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346147/GeForce_NOW_CES_Image.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lD0L3A"&gt;At its CES 2022 virtual keynote, Nvidia is announcing a partnership with AT&amp;amp;T to offer six months of GeForce Now cloud gaming service for free. New and existing AT&amp;amp;T customers with a 5G-capable device and qualifying plan &lt;a href="https://special-offers-signup.att.com/#/51/GeForceNOWPriorityAccess"&gt;can claim the promotion through the service provider&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to stream free-to-play titles and supported PC games they already own on the go with the cloud gaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hy1SGY"&gt;This promotional offer is for Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce-now%2Fmemberships%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865583%2Fnvidia-geforce-now-cloud-gaming-att-5g-plan-deal-ces-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Priority tier of GeForce Now&lt;/a&gt;, not the new RTX 3080 one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750246/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-3080-google-stadia-cloud-gaming"&gt;we recently enjoyed&lt;/a&gt;. The Priority tier normally costs $49.99 for a prepaid six-month period (or $9.99 monthly) and includes enough GPU power to add raytracing to some older games at 1080p resolution and at up to 60fps (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778693/nvidia-geforce-now-cloud-gaming-framerate-cap-fps-cyberpunk"&gt;though you won’t see that in every game&lt;/a&gt;). Priority lets you play for up to six hours at a time. It also typically comes with a free digital copy of &lt;em&gt;Crysis Remastered &lt;/em&gt;to keep, though it’s not clear if that comes with the AT&amp;amp;T promotion. AT&amp;amp;T subscribers can &lt;a href="https://special-offers-signup.att.com/#/51/GeForceNOWPriorityAccess"&gt;redeem their free six months of GeForce Now on AT&amp;amp;T’s special signup page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4hJMq"&gt;Nvidia also made new claims as to how GeForce Now is being optimized for AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network (and AT&amp;amp;T Fiber), promising upcoming technological developments from both companies to bolster the GeForce Now service in the future. The goal is to reduce latency and packet loss while playing on a 5G network, though Nvidia doesn’t have any specific new technologies to reveal yet.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qs9wS5"&gt;Razer isn’t using CES 2022 as a moment to show off a bold, new laptop concept. Instead, it’s asserting its dominance in the gaming laptop world by announcing refreshed Blade laptops that are barely different on the outside but with marked improvements on the inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="upQ6xB"&gt;Starting with the biggest updates, the Blade 14, Blade 15, and Blade 17 each feature the jump to faster DDR5 RAM (Razer’s goes up to 4,800MHz), along with support for AMD’s latest Ryzen 9, or Intel’s new 12th Gen processors, depending on the model you want. Additionally, Razer’s 2022 update will offer support for up to Nvidia’s new RTX 3070 Ti and the 3080 Ti mobile graphics chip. You’re likely to find these specs in many gaming laptops being announced during this year’s trade show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JGTE7C"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nvidia announces 3080 Ti and 3070 Ti laptop GPUs, says they can control your CPU, too","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22865535/nvidia-3080-ti-3070-ti-mobile-laptop-max-q-intel-amd-alder-lake-rembrandt"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="tuyQLn"&gt;In the past couple of years, Razer has made worthwhile upgrades to the Blade lineup, including refining the keyboard layout, boosting the webcam resolution from 720p to 1080p in some models (all of the early 2022 models have a 1080p Windows Hello webcam), and finishing each of its laptops with a more fingerprint-resistant coating. This year’s across-the-board refinement — those specs above aside — includes a larger keyboard with bigger keycaps, and laser-cut speaker grills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maWJdC"&gt;I’m going to dive into each of the models to cover the specs and prices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 14 (early 2022)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VRTuKUlKPML0zp4yI4kEDfsCIiY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23129973/blade14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MHnsjb"&gt;The Blade 14 for 2022 supports up to AMD’s latest Ryzen 9 6900HX octa-core processor with 16GB of DDR5 RAM (which is soldered on, though its 1TB SSD is replaceable). It starts with the Nvidia RTX 3060 graphics chip and a 1080p IPS panel with a 144Hz refresh rate, but Razer offers two QHD 165Hz refresh rate panel options that can be configured with the RTX 3070 Ti or the RTX 3080 Ti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNQNvT"&gt;The Blade 14 has an MUX switch that lets it switch between the integrated Radeon 680M graphics and the dedicated GPU. It also now has a 61.6Wh battery and includes a 230W power adapter. It will start at $1,999.99, and preorders will open first at Razer on February 10th, with availability beginning sometime in Q1 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 (early 2022)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oVn4zdATTgQeN-l51MMwL3Ty00A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23129968/razerblade15.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pTEe6Q"&gt;Moving on, Razer is simplifying the naming convention for its Blade 15 and Blade 17 laptops, leaving the names at that instead of appending “Pro,” “Advanced,” or “Base,” which I’m sure confused some customers, including myself at times. Both the Blade 15 and 17 use Intel’s 12th Gen Core i7-12800H 14-core processor (and with it, gain two Thunderbolt 4 ports, whereas the Blade 14 has USB-C), and both models come with 1TB of upgradeable storage (dual M.2 slot, each supporting up to 2TB) and 16GB of upgradeable DDR5 RAM (supporting up to 64GB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DRqC7F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AMD is still nowhere to be found on the Blade 15 / 17&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B8JqMQ"&gt;The Blade 15 and 17 each start with QHD panels and the RTX 3060 graphics chip at $2,499.99 and $2,699.99, respectively, but each can go up to a 4K IPS panel with 100 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color space, upgrade to the Intel Core i9-12900HK processor, and pack in Nvidia’s RTX 3080 Ti if you’ve got the cash to spend. The top-end Blade 15 costs $3,999.99, and the Blade 17 tops out at $4,299.99. The Blade 15 has an 80Wh battery and comes with a 230W adapter, while the Blade 17 has an 82Wh battery and comes with a 280W GaN charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovulme"&gt;If you want to preorder the Blade 15 or 17, you can do so starting January 25th from Razer, and both models will be available sometime in Q1 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC8aWA"&gt;All of these changes and spec improvements seem fine, but I wish that Razer would give people the option to opt for AMD’s processors in the Blade 15 and Blade 17. The Blade 14 is a beast of a mini laptop, yet it’s unclear why its AMD partnership is limited to the company’s most niche laptop and not across its entire portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anker’s portable 4K projector runs Android TV and brings its own speakers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TfGcjklSOolgjDVk0E8jHtKFg4o=/0x47:1900x1314/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346346/nebula_4k_projector.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker’s Nebula Cosmos Laser 4K.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Anker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cOakUi"&gt;Anker sub-brand Nebula has a new projector that runs Android TV 10.0 called the Cosmos Laser 4K. It’s designed to be portable with a pair of 30W speakers baked right in for spontaneous gaming or movie nights wherever you might be. The ALPD 3.0 laser tech can project 4K images at 2400 ANSI lumens. That’s respectable, but likely too dim to produce a decent image in anything but a darkened room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sFuPyb"&gt;It unfortunately looks like it won’t run Netflix natively, just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22798489/xgimi-aura-projector-review-price-specs"&gt;like&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548487/xgimi-horizon-pro-4k-hdr-review-projector-portable-specs-price"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; Android TV 10.0 projectors we’ve reviewed. Instead Anker says the Cosmos Laser comes with a “4K streaming dongle” to push content off your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MS0FW5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;3 second autofocus and keystone correction&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2zVZaG"&gt;Other features include fast (3 second) autofocus and automatic keystone correction which are niceties in a projector meant to be moved around, as well as eye-guard tech to cut the laser to protect the curious gaze of pets and kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="612vl1"&gt;Anker says that the all-in-one Nebula Cosmos Laser 4K projector will debut on kickstarter January 11th for $2,199 / £2,199 / €2,199 before shipping in March. That’s relatively expensive compared to similarly specced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548487/xgimi-horizon-pro-4k-hdr-review-projector-portable-specs-price"&gt;4K all-in-ones priced at $1,699&lt;/a&gt;, but will hold any judgement pending reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eufy’s new video doorbell uses two cameras to catch porch pirates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k-i9nnZmX6InG3CGFG83N-ahN5o=/375x0:2625x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346347/eufy_doorbell.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eufy Security Video Doorbell Dual uses two cameras to keep an eye on your front door.﻿&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Eufy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aAXM9v"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YV40dq"&gt;Eufy, Anker’s smart home brand, is trying to solve the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22359973/ring-video-doorbell-pro-2-review"&gt;video doorbell’s&lt;/a&gt; biggest blindspot with a new dual-camera option. The Eufy Security Video Doorbell Dual has two cameras: a 2K camera up top to capture the face and body of a visitor and a 1080p camera down below to monitor packages left on the doorstep. At CES 2022 this week, the company also announced a new Garage Cam, which is a garage door controller and camera in one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XL0wes"&gt;The concept of two cameras in a video doorbell is an interesting one, helping solve the problem most camera doorbells have where they either show you a tall, skinny video so you can see packages as well as people, but not much context outside that. Or, you get a wide view that gives more context but misses out on the doorstep itself, where those packages normally are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McVqu3"&gt;This Eufy Video Doorbell Dual, which costs $350, including the required Homebase 2, is not the first to attempt this type of two-camera solution. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgetkuna.com%2Fproducts%2Fanswer-doorbell&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865803%2Feufy-video-doorbell-dual-garage-control-cam-specs-release-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kuna Maximus Answer&lt;/a&gt; also does double duty. However, that’s a hardwired doorbell; Eufy’s version is the first battery-powered buzzer to try this trick. Its downward-facing 1080p camera has a 120-degree field of view, while the 2K camera can see as wide as 160 degrees. It also has AI that can detect packages, plus a new “Family Recognition” feature that uses AI to recognize friends and family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlBYcT"&gt;In addition to dual cameras, the doorbell has dual motion detection, using radar and PIR technology to detect people versus motion and reduce false alerts, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKwxTY"&gt;As with all Eufy cameras, there is no required monthly subscription fee. When paired with a Eufy hub — the HomeBase 2 — 16GB of local storage provides up to 90 days of video recording. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLaA2Z"&gt;The Eufy Dual should last up to six months on a charge, and based on my testing of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464940/eufy-anker-solocam-security-cameras-local-storage-battery-no-hub"&gt;Eufy cameras&lt;/a&gt; in the past, this battery life largely pans out. Although if you have a very busy front door, it’s more like four months. However, the addition of a second camera could have a significant impact on battery life. Prior &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.eufylife.com%2Fproducts%2Fe82101w3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865803%2Feufy-video-doorbell-dual-garage-control-cam-specs-release-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eufy battery-operated doorbells&lt;/a&gt; could be used wired as well; we’ve asked the company if this is also the case with the Dual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hn6Omb"&gt;The Eufy Dual will work with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Amazon Alexa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;Google Home&lt;/a&gt; smart home platforms and is scheduled to launch on February 8th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JfzoUSf7-cYmoAdncLM6cPaWChU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144211/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_8.56.08_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eufy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Garage-Control Cam combines a garage door controller and camera into one device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BRjofI"&gt;The other new product announced this week is the Eufy Security Garage-Control Cam and the Cam Plus. These are all-in-one garage control and surveillance devices that can be used to remotely open / close the garage door, as well as visually check in on your garage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mSJXT"&gt;The Garage-Control Cam offers 1080p video and can control one door, and the Cam Plus has 2K video and can control up to two doors. They both pair with door sensors to detect the status of the door and send an alert if you forget to close it. It’s not clear if the devices need to be hardwired to your existing garage door opener or which garage door manufacturers the product will be compatible with. We’ve reached out to Eufy for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1duZ7d"&gt;As with other garage door controllers — such as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chamberlain.com%2Fmyq&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865803%2Feufy-video-doorbell-dual-garage-control-cam-specs-release-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chamberlain’s MyQ &lt;/a&gt;and the &lt;a href="https://gotailwind.com/"&gt;Tailwind IQ3&lt;/a&gt; — the Garage Control Cam lets you open and close your garage door remotely using the app or with voice control. Eufy also has the option of geofencing detection, so you can set the door to open or close as you arrive or leave home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTatIS"&gt;Both Cam devices can distinguish between humans, vehicles, and general motion using on-device AI, and they don’t require a Eufy hub. Instead, 32GB of local storage using an SD card provides video recordings with no monthly cloud storage fees. The cameras also support 24/7 continuous recording with a 4-second pre-roll feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rx56hU"&gt;The Garage-Control Cam (1080P/ single-door control) will cost $99 and the Garage-Control Cam Plus (2K/ two-door control) $129, and both are expected to launch in March of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BUZJh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hisense floods the zone with TVs at every price point for 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cgP7XKisILiCMOyCzT9aOxMck0E=/0x7:1772x1188/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346368/hisense.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Hisense&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TBCeUW"&gt;Hisense is one of those brands that’s easy to sleep on when you’re shopping for a new TV. But over the last few years, the company has built a strong reputation for delivering much better picture quality than you’d typically expect from TVs that sell at similar prices. And for 2022, Hisense is trying to offer a TV that won’t disappoint regardless of your budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VEhgpg"&gt;At the top of the heap of this year’s “ULED” TVs is the flagship U9H Series. It’s got Mini LED backlighting (with over 1,280 dimming zones), quantum dot HDR, a peak brightness of 2,000 nits, support for 4K gaming at 120Hz, FreeSync variable refresh rate, and an upgraded processor for improved responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwHzdR"&gt;Under that comes the U8H, the latest in the well-reviewed U8 series, and the one Hisense is positioning as its “best all-around TV.” The peak HDR brightness drops some to 1,500 nits, but you’re still getting the revamped Mini LED backlighting, all the expected gaming features, and a wide net of supported video modes that includes Dolby Vision IQ, HDR10+, IMAX Enhanced, FilmMaker Mode, and others. Also new for 2022 is a larger 75-inch size for the U8H Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUggGZ"&gt;Stepping down from there, you get the U7H Series. It drops Mini LED, which isn’t unexpected for the $799.99 starting price. But it still includes a 120Hz variable refresh rate, auto low latency mode, and other gaming perks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aAYwQw"&gt; U9H ships in late summer for $3,199.99 (75-inch model).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="W9Q3hr"&gt;U8H ships in mid-summer starting at $1,099 and available in 55-, 65-, and 75-inch sizes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uTqcL8"&gt;U7H ships in mid-summer starting at $799.99 and comes in 55-, 65-, 75-, and 85-inch sizes, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="OZ8K9a"&gt;Hisense’s TVs will come with Google TV onboard and include built-in mics for hands-free voice commands. The company is also announcing a range of lower-cost TVs plus projectors and soundbars at CES 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s GeForce Now will be limited to 1080p on Samsung and LG TVs — for now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w7jqJ3GLUdssHZXupj4rnQPX12E=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346340/GAMINGHUB_LANDINGPAGE_3_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3M4SiK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22862814/samsung-2022-tv-geforce-now-stadia-nvidia-google-utomik-cloud-gaming"&gt;Samsung and LG have embraced cloud gaming this winter&lt;/a&gt; with support for Google Stadia and Nvidia’s GeForce Now in their television sets — but neither brand of TV will include Nvidia’s best quality streams for now. Nvidia cloud gaming boss Phil Eisler confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that TVs will start at 1080p, and it sounds like the company’s 4K HDR streams will stay exclusive to the company’s own Nvidia Shield TV set-top through the first half of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NC9zTy"&gt;But afterward, that may change — depending on your TV’s processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teL4Eq"&gt;“The TVs use many different SOCs with different performance levels capable of decoding our streams at 60 FPS, so we’re focused on 1080p first,” Eisler explains. “We’ve rolled that out with LG first in December and with Samsung models in the first half of 2022, and will increase resolutions in the second half of 2022 as we continue to optimize for those decoding applications,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tM46cE"&gt;Google confirmed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge &lt;/em&gt;yesterday that its own Stadia cloud gaming service will offer 4K streams on both LG and Samsung TVs (Samsung had not previously made that clear), though it’s probably good to note that Stadia’s definition of “4K” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel"&gt;has been a little bit suspect ever since the service launched&lt;/a&gt;. It often refers to the resolution of Stadia’s stream itself, rather than the internal render resolution of its games. The “4K” version of &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; on Stadia is actually upsampled 1080p, for example. GeForce Now has had its own weaknesses, though, as I explained &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750246/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-3080-google-stadia-cloud-gaming"&gt;in my hands-on with Nvidia’s RTX 3080 tier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nUfqc"&gt;During Nvidia’s CES 2022 press conference today, it said that cloud gaming in general is expected to grow to 100 million subscribers by 2024 and announced that AT&amp;amp;T 5G customers can get a free six-month membership of its GeForce Now “Priority” tier. That’s the 1080p one that runs on the cloud equivalent of RTX 2080 (not 3080) video cards.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia announces RTX 3090 Ti with faster memory and performance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uOfvd3CS8x9dQqm6Tocs-SORbXM=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346242/chrome_tHrcoTnakt.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pyV5sT"&gt;Nvidia is announcing a new flagship GPU today, the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti. While the wait continues for Nvidia’s Ampere successor, the RTX 3090 Ti is here to prove Nvidia can still squeeze more performance out of its existing 8nm GA102 chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNGLau"&gt;Nvidia is only teasing the RTX 3090 Ti today, and it’s the familiar-looking triple-slot design we’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21417048/nvidia-rtx-3090-gpu-flagship-8k-pc-gaming-price-specs"&gt;seen on the RTX 3090&lt;/a&gt;. Both cards may look identical, but inside, the new RTX 3090 Ti will include 24GB of GDDR6X running at 21Gbps. That’s the same amount of VRAM as the RTX 3090 but with a nearly 7.7 percent faster memory clock, providing additional performance for 4K gaming and AI tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V1v612G8buoKN617MU0ujxqKVhQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144597/85lXfjr.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fggJVl"&gt;Nvidia says the RTX 3090 Ti will also include 40 teraflops of GPU performance, around 11 percent faster than the RTX 3090 with 36 teraflops. There’s also 78 teraflops for ray tracing and 320 teraflops for AI tasks. Nvidia hasn’t detailed base and boost clocks, but it certainly looks like the RTX 3090 Ti will be around 10 percent faster than the RTX 3090 on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaXKrW"&gt;Just how much this extra performance will impact power requirements isn’t clear yet, either. &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-pictured-specifications-confirmed"&gt;Rumors suggest&lt;/a&gt; the RTX 3090 Ti could require a 1000W PSU, with a TDP of 450 watts. If accurate, that’s 100W more than the RTX 3090 in terms of power draw and a big bump to the 750W recommended PSU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PCOZz"&gt;All of these numbers mean very little without game benchmarks or pricing, though. Nvidia isn’t sharing these details today, so we’ll have to wait on detailed reviews to see how well this card performs against the RTX 3090 and AMD’s Radeon RX 6900 XT. Given the RTX 3090 debuted for $1,499, we wouldn’t be surprised if the RTX 3090 Ti launches around the $2,000 mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mmmFU"&gt;Nvidia is promising more details on the RTX 3090 Ti later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
