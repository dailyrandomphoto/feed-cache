    <title>The COVID-19 vaccines weren’t hacked — this task force is one reason why</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Securing the supply chain meant focusing on tiny companies&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZmrUmM"&gt;Last fall, a tiny company no one had ever heard of was keeping Josh Corman up at night. It was one of the only groups in the world that made an ingredient that pharmaceutical companies like Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech needed to make the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. And it didn’t employ a single cybersecurity expert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orAc42"&gt;Corman is a senior adviser to the United States’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and for the past year, he’s been working on a task force within the agency focused on protecting the COVID-19 vaccine supply chain from cyber threats. Healthcare organizations have been some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18293817/cybersecurity-hospitals-health-care-scan-simulation"&gt;biggest&lt;/a&gt; victims of growing waves of cyberattacks over the past few years, and during the pandemic, they were an even bigger target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CyIMLH"&gt;What worried Corman weren’t places like Pfizer and Moderna. Those big, name brand companies all employ in-house cybersecurity experts. He was worried about companies like the one making an mRNA ingredient: small, anonymous groups that made bits and pieces pivotal for vaccines, but that might not have ever thought they’d need to protect against a hacking campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6TBBn0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You could sneeze on that one company, and they would be disrupted.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R663eo"&gt;“You could sneeze on that one company, and they would be disrupted. And if they were disrupted, we’d be living in a very different world right now because they were so critical to those mRNA candidates,” Corman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rO6NpN"&gt;Over the past year, the task force tracked down hundreds of similar companies critical to the development, production, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the US. It offered to help them check for any gaps in their digital networks, give them resources to boost their preparedness, and help them respond to any incidents. A cyberattack on any of them could have slowed down the vaccine efforts, keeping shots out of reach for longer — at great cost to the health of the country, Corman says. “We wanted to make sure we had no delays because of cybersecurity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3kmkKJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re-creating the supply chain &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9GPdgc"&gt;The US approach to COVID-19 vaccine development ran through Operation Warp Speed — a $10 billion project that involved partnerships between biomedical companies and various agencies within the federal government, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Health and Human Services. It funded the development of vaccine candidates at companies like Moderna and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and was in close contact with others involved in manufacturing and distribution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1p0nh"&gt;“Operation Warp Speed is generally described as being around the 30 biggest companies related to vaccines — research, delivery, and all the way to shipping out to states,” says Beau Woods, a senior adviser at CISA working on the COVID-19 task force. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EouVFd"&gt;CISA was one of the other federal agencies pulled into Operation Warp Speed. It’s part of the Department of Homeland Security and is responsible for assisting both the government and the private sector on cybersecurity issues. Along with the COVID-19 response, it spent 2020 working on &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/trump-fires-cisa-director-chris-krebs/"&gt;security for the presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKsxLE"&gt;During Operation Warp Speed, CISA was asked to help with security for the main 30 players. “CISA has the ability to deliver protective, preventative, and response services to designated critical infrastructure. Anyone on that list was obviously prioritized,” Corman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="bthxJS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There were more companies involved with the vaccine development, production, and distribution process than just the ones on that list&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4jeZC3"&gt;But there were more companies involved with the vaccine development, production, and distribution process than just the ones on that list. Each of those 30 or so companies have their own supply chains, Woods says. The groups that made up those supply chains would need protection as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Er6O0c"&gt;When Corman started working on COVID-19 response efforts as part of the task force within CISA, those companies hadn’t been identified yet. No one knew who they were. “I asked, what are those smaller, less obvious players that, if they’re disrupted, means there’s no vaccine? And no one had an answer,” Corman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cUko0"&gt;Corman worked with colleagues like Michelle Holko, a presidential innovation fellow who worked with the task force, and Reuven Pasternak, another CISA senior adviser who’s also a physician, to develop a rubric that would help them identify those players. They looked for companies making products that were in short supply or couldn’t be easily replaced and companies making products that the groups making vaccines were highly dependent on. The group asked international partners to send them the names of any groups that could be important to the vaccine development process as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnu2rU"&gt;“We identified people who were never nominated at all, but bubbled up right to the top. Those were some of the most critically important weak links in the chain,” Corman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVrcgV"&gt;The list was dynamic — at the start of the process, it focused on groups involved in vaccine research and development. Then it shifted to companies working with the manufacturing and distribution of the shots. Overall, the group identified hundreds of companies involved in the process that could have been risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="naeN9h"&gt;“A lot of them are smaller. In some cases, they’d have fewer than 100 people, and may not have traditionally looked at cybersecurity threats,” Woods says. Because they were involved in the vaccine process, they were targets for hackers, but they didn’t have the know-how to protect against threats. “That’s where we focused,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WqKoId"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outreach efforts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="147AmC"&gt;After making that list of companies that could be potential targets for cyberattacks, the task force started reaching out to each one to offer its services. A big part of those early conversations involved making sure companies understood that the group wasn’t a regulatory body but was just coming in to offer a service, says Steve Luczynski, the lead of the CISA COVID-19 task force. “Everybody’s concerned when the government’s calling,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="w3ND86"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Everybody’s concerned when the government’s calling.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JLXY7x"&gt;But after they heard what the group was offering — help understanding any vulnerabilities, alerts about possible threats, and other guidance — many companies were eager to use their resources, Woods says. “In a few cases, we’ve had the organizations come back and say, ‘Hey we saw something, we think we got to it in time — but we’d love for you guys to just double check,’” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCeskG"&gt;Health IT and electronic health records company Cerner was one of the groups that worked with the CISA and the task force. &lt;a href="https://www.cerner.com/perspectives/supporting-the-covid19-vaccination-process-with-technology-and-data"&gt;Cerner assisted&lt;/a&gt; with scheduling, inventory, and dose tracking for organizations administering vaccines, and its electronic health records had data on people receiving the shots. Kevin Hutchinson, Cerner’s cybersecurity operations manager, had initially signed the company up for security alerts with CISA. The CISA task force then got in touch about participating in their other programs. “Given the footprint of Cerner, they were really excited to have us on board,” Hutchinson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xChyUK"&gt;The CISA team took a look at Cerner’s existing security protocols, which were already strong. “It was a good pat on the back that we were doing things that we should be,” Hutchinson says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0WxUf"&gt;Cerner also regularly meets with around a dozen of the largest hospital systems that use its services to talk about security, and a handful of those groups were also using CISA’s services. Many hospitals don’t have the funding for a dedicated security team. “They had mentioned how valuable it had been for them,” Hutchinson says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cei2wJ"&gt;The task force was able to offer services like scanning company systems for cybersecurity vulnerabilities and custom cyberintelligence tools, Woods says. But one of the most important parts of outreach was just creating a relationship with the company so that CISA was able to quickly relay any important information. “Part of it is just working out that trust, so that when they pick up the phone, they know who you are,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jVDogh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Part of it is just working out that trust, so that when they pick up the phone, they know who you are.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s1YXEK"&gt;Through those relationships, the task force and CISA helped companies respond to cyber threats over the course of the past year. Threats included a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/coronavirus-vaccine-hackers-phish-ibm-cold-chain/2020/12/03/27a5b0b2-355d-11eb-9699-00d311f13d2d_story.html"&gt;phishing campaign&lt;/a&gt; aimed at the cold chain vaccine transport system and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210667/solarwinds-hack-worse-government-microsoft-cybersecurity"&gt;SolarWinds hack&lt;/a&gt;, which targeted US government agencies. None had major impacts on the vaccine development and distribution process. “We had these good connections. We knew that this is the person to call, and here’s the email to send to, when these events happen,” Luczynski says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FG5In"&gt;Those connections could carry through into the future and help healthcare organizations manage cybersecurity threats. “I am happy to see greater engagement between CISA and healthcare, and I definitely hope that continues,” Woods says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKgBeQ"&gt;The work the task force did on the vaccine supply chain could also be a model for other projects in the future, he says. “A lot of times when the government works with the private sector, they’re most engaged with larger organizations because they don’t have connections with the smaller ones,” Woods says. This work showed that, many times, the riskiest areas are actually those smaller organizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Q8ssX8"&gt;So far, the COVID-19 vaccine development and distribution process hasn’t been delayed by any cyberattacks. Luczynski says the task force can’t take all the credit — it’s hard to say definitively if its work was the reason there weren’t major issues. But he thinks it made a difference. “I am confident we contributed to making things better.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukX5dl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel’s What If…? gets a new trailer and an August 11th release date</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-7OPzOIac0rgrDvJELCjf1J7XwM=/228x0:1533x870/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556760/Screen_Shot_2021_07_08_at_12.33.06_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DV6F1O"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9D0uUKJ5KI"&gt;Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;is an animated series that promises to showcase alternate takes on the dozens of characters that make up the interconnected universe of movies and shows in the MCU. And now, thanks to a new trailer, we’ve got our best look yet at the upcoming show, which is set to debut on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1104507/9358?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus &lt;/a&gt;on August 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDLZCn"&gt;As the name implies, &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; will showcase different versions of the MCU and answer questions like, “What if Peggy Carter was chosen to get the Super Soldier Serum instead of Steve Rogers?” or “What if Yondu kidnapped T’Challa instead of Peter Quill when he came to Earth?” Unlike the other Disney Plus Marvel shows, which are live-action, &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; also marks the first animated property in the MCU — a factor that makes it easier to revisit the altered storylines without, say, having to remake the entirety of &lt;em&gt;Captain America: The First Avenger&lt;/em&gt; in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="c04BTg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first animated MCU show&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Eo5Hx"&gt;In addition to a slew of Marvel regulars &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; — which is still considered part of the overarching MCU, despite its alt-universe tales — will introduce Uatu the Watcher (voiced by Jeffrey Wright) to the franchise as the show’s narrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQmO0E"&gt;Alternate takes on characters seem to be a popular theme in the MCU right now, with &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; already featuring a slew of different versions of the villain from across the timeline. (And with Marvel’s slate of films and shows continuing to expand, it’s possible &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt;’s animated hypotheticals could one day show up in live-action, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnEmil"&gt;The August release date makes perfect sense, too, given &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;’s season finale is about to wrap up on July 14th, making &lt;em&gt;What If...? &lt;/em&gt;the perfect way to make sure the biggest Marvel fans stay subscribed to Disney Plus for another month or two. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why did the Teletubbies forge their vaccination cards?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Teletubbies 20th anniversary party - London" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ebtpbSjVuvQe8nTWepNPCuC9yUw=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556711/645519008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jonathan Brady/PA Images via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RX12pm"&gt;Look, the question isn’t &lt;em&gt;whether&lt;/em&gt; the vaccine cards the Teletubbies display in a tweet from Teletubbies HQ are forged. All you have to do is look at the date of the second vaccine: July 22nd, 2021 — that is, two weeks in the future. The question is what they hope to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cHG65I"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re all vaxxed! Just in time for a Tubby hot summer ☀️ Who's ready to come out &amp;amp; play &lt;a href="https://t.co/AtXTExaCMs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/AtXTExaCMs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Teletubbies (@TeletubbiesHQ) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeletubbiesHQ/status/1412790031530475524?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5vnipc"&gt;There’s more. Check out the dates of birth listed for the Teletubbies: all in 2003. The Teletubbies &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142055/"&gt;premiered on BBC2 in 1997&lt;/a&gt;. Famously, in 1999, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2017/12/jerry-falwell-and-tinky-winky-the-gay-teletubby.html"&gt;Jerry Falwell condemned Tinky Winky&lt;/a&gt; for being gay. The original run &lt;em&gt;ended &lt;/em&gt;in 2001. The Teletubbies are old enough to drink! A birthdate of 2003? &lt;em&gt;Who the fuck do these creatures think they’re kidding?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vPLcn"&gt;Look, I babysat my younger siblings while they watched the Teletubbies. I’ve had my eye on that Sun Baby for years — the Teletubbies’ god-king, who rules the psychedelic, rabbit-infested, post-apocalyptic word of these creatures. The careful rituals of appeasing the Voice Trumpets and containing the troubles of their misbehaving vacuum cleaner (“Noo-Noo”) are not foreign to me. I just want to know what the plot here is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJXGEL"&gt;There is one other oddity. It appears to be based on an American vaccination card, issued by the CDC. The dates on it are also rendered American style (month, day, year) instead of UK style (day, month, year). Is this a terrible plot by the Sun Baby to confuse UK children? Should we expect a future in which the UK switches to American date style?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="asGOvw"&gt;I don’t know what this means&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;but I don’t think it bodes well. Who can know what the Sun Baby ultimately wants? We never did learn why the Teletubbies worshiped it. Perhaps it is looking for more followers — and these vaccination cards are just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Encanto’s first trailer promises a magical, musical Disney adventure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/571sGlPIpyStzd-x-6E_-eP7kJk=/195x0:1737x1028/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556692/Screen_Shot_2021_07_08_at_12.11.46_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="13y4Jv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=togmdDHG3Pw"&gt;The first trailer for &lt;em&gt;Encanto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the latest animated film from Walt Disney Animation Studios, is full of magic. The upcoming movie is set in a magical village in Colombia, and it focuses on the Madrigal family who each possess their own gifts, like shapeshifting, plant growth, or super-strength. Even the house is enchanted, dancing along to the beat of everyday life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iryDdJ"&gt;Well, everyone except for Mirabel (Stephanie Beatriz), that is, who, alone in her family, doesn’t have any special powers. Drama, presumably, ensues, although the first teaser isn’t too forthcoming as to what the actual story here is. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eDXasIAF4wyS9IbKPVulotlX7w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22705930/Screen_Shot_2021_07_08_at_11.26.00_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qEKpso"&gt;The film does look spectacular, though, with the Madrigal’s house, in particular, stealing the show with its vibrant colors and unique architecture. In Disney tradition, &lt;em&gt;Encanto&lt;/em&gt; is also a musical, featuring songs by the &lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/tv/2019/2/21/18233226/egot-necklace-30-rock-tracy-morgan-whoopi-goldberg"&gt;EGOT-chasing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hamilton &lt;/em&gt;creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kyq1mM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Encanto&lt;/em&gt; is set to hit theaters on November 24th, making it the first major animated film from Disney to not be released straight to Disney Plus since theaters first shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The studio has spent the last year and a half shifting almost all of its major animated releases from both Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar — including &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt; — either straight to its streaming service or with concurrent releases in both theaters and on Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The NFL jumps to Twitter Spaces after initial Clubhouse partnership</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="U.S.-TAMPA-NFL-SUPER BOWL" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LiwsaCUud2JnOswJjtHfeJRqjn4=/0x33:2048x1398/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556610/1231057154.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Xinhua/Wu Xiaoling via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DqhaEz"&gt;The National Football League is signing on to use Twitter Spaces. As part of &lt;a href="https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/National-Football-League-and-Twitter-Extend-Partnership-Through-Multi-Year-Deal.aspx"&gt;a new deal&lt;/a&gt; with Twitter — which will see the social network continue to run game highlight videos — the NFL has agreed to host 20 live audio rooms throughout the 2021 season. Those will include “current NFL players and other NFL talent” as hosts discussing the season’s matchups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrmx2F"&gt;Twitter’s partnership with the NFL would appear to be a blow to Clubhouse, which &lt;a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/clubhouse-announces-exclusive-content-deal-with-nfl-its-first-official-spo/599005/"&gt;previously partnered with the league&lt;/a&gt; to host live audio rooms during the draft in April. It was Clubhouse’s first official sports league programming — and now the NFL has jumped to Twitter and signed on to be Twitter’s first sports partner. A Clubhouse spokesperson said the company has an “ongoing relationship” with the NFL and NFL Players Association. Clubhouse &lt;a href="https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/nhl-clubhouse-stanley-cup-final-montreal-canadiens-tampa-bay-lightning"&gt;also partnered with the National Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; to host rooms around the Stanley Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJ7QG0"&gt;Spaces began launching on Twitter in December and the feature has expanded more widely in the months since. The launch came as Clubhouse was blowing up in popularity, but the live audio service now faces competition from all sides; in addition to Twitter, Facebook and Discord have launched competitors, and similar features are being developed inside Slack, Reddit, and LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LTdBaH"&gt;While the vast majority of programming on these live audio apps is user-generated, the obvious next step for these networks is to try bringing in major talent to hook viewers who might not otherwise tune in. Twitter has been partnering with the NFL since 2013, so presumably, the network has seen some worthwhile engagement out of giving the league a formal presence on the app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vilo’s three-router mesh Wi-Fi system covers your home for just $59</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PwlKbQFebammfwQw-YAShwk-PY0=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556536/Vilo_March2021_ErinLodiPhotography_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A single Vilo router costs $19.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Vilo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z9Qg9R"&gt;Vilo is a new mesh Wi-Fi company that promises a three-device system that covers up to 4,500 square feet for just $59. That’s much more affordable than the mesh Wi-Fi systems offered by more established brands like Eero, whose &lt;a href="https://eero.com/shop/eero"&gt;comparable system costs $199&lt;/a&gt; for a three-pack. Vilo is also selling a single standalone router for $19, compared to $79 with Eero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RmKtj"&gt;As you might expect, Vilo’s affordable pricing means you’re not getting top-of-the-line specs. There’s no Wi-Fi 6 here, so it’s not ready for the next-generation standard, and it’s also dual-band rather than tri-band, meaning it lacks the extra 5GHz band that other systems use to provide better communication between their routers and satellites. Each base station has three gigabit-Ethernet ports for wired devices, and there’s an app to enable features like guest networks and automatic alerts when unrecognized devices attempt to connect to the network.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7OgzHQPErb3zWNCyTiPc-6Efayo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22703079/Single_Unit_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Vilo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each router has three ethernet sockets for wired connectivity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="36qLZw"&gt;The company’s positioning is similar to Wyze, which has grown its brand by offering internet-connected security cameras at more affordable prices than established brands like Ring and Nest. The functionality of Wyze’s cameras often isn’t as slick as its more expensive competitors, but they’re an okay option if you’re working with a tight budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iv5xUR"&gt;Vilo’s promise of up to 4,500 square feet of coverage is just a fraction smaller than the 5,000 square feet promised by Eero’s $199 system, but Vilo also says its system can handle up to 120 connected devices, while Eero claims a more modest “50+.” Vilo also claims a hefty maximum speed of 1.2Gbps, versus 350Mbps from Eero. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGYPuZ"&gt;But theoretical performance often falls short in real-world usage. We also have questions about &lt;a href="https://www.viloliving.com/terms-of-service"&gt;Vilo’s privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;, which notes that it “may include advertisements” in its services. When asked, a spokesperson for the company said the clause is to allow Vilo to run ads for its own products in its app or website, and said the company will never sell its user data to third-parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39VNy2"&gt;Potential drawbacks aside, $59 is remarkably cheap for a three-device mesh Wi-Fi system. It could make Vilo a tempting alternative for anyone building out a home network on a budget. Vilo’s mesh Wi-Fi system is available &lt;a href="https://www.viloliving.com/"&gt;direct from its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter will comply with India’s new rules to keep its legal immunity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SF--h8t0tW4sygh1wK1_hv70mjQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556381/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ADWtNc"&gt;Twitter has outlined how it intends to “fully comply” with India’s new social media rules after the government said its lack of compliance meant it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564768/twitter-india-legal-liability-users-posts-defamation-digital-media-ethics-code"&gt;could be held legally liable&lt;/a&gt; for its user’s posts, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/twitter-pledges-to-fully-comply-with-india-internet-rules?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. In response to the government’s filing, a lawyer for the company said it has already appointed an interim chief compliance officer and that it would soon have a grievance officer and an employee to respond to law enforcement requests, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/twitter-appoints-india-interim-compliance-exec-fill-other-jobs-soon-2021-07-08/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter is required to fill each of the roles under new regulations introduced this year. The company also said it would be setting up an India liaison office in the next eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MRsXVw"&gt;Had Twitter not pledged to comply with the rules, it faced being made legally liable for users’ posts on its platform, potentially allowing its executives to face criminal charges over user-generated content. Social media platforms often take down content in response to legal challenges, but they’re generally not considered liable for it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bmI845"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The government could still take action if it doesn’t comply&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0SRv3l"&gt;If Twitter does not comply with the rules, the judge said India’s government will be able to take action against the company, &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports. The company was given a deadline of two weeks to make the appointments. Other tech companies, including Facebook and Google, have reportedly already started appointing employees to the relevant positions in response to the regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiWKbX"&gt;The legal action marked an escalation of the tensions between Twitter and the Indian government. In May, police &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451271/police-india-raid-twitter-tweets-government-manipulated-media"&gt;raided Twitter’s India offices&lt;/a&gt; after the platform labeled a government official’s tweets as “manipulated media,” and more recently, a government minister warned the company of “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/5/22520330/india-warns-twitter-rules-social-media"&gt;unintended consequences&lt;/a&gt;” if it does not comply with the new rules. As the world’s largest market outside of China, India is not one that Twitter can afford to be excluded from, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w60Fwx"&gt;While the company said it will comply with the rules, it said it reserves the right to challenge their legality and validity, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWbeYN"&gt;Twitter is not the only large tech firm to clash with the Indian government over its new regulations. In May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454381/whatsapp-indian-government-traceability-lawsuit-break-encryption-privacy"&gt;WhatsApp sued the government&lt;/a&gt; over a requirement that it trace the origins of messages sent on its platform. The firm argued that this is unconstitutional, would force it to undermine its users’ privacy, and risks breaking the end-to-end encryption offered by its service. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best laptop you can buy in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13, Dell XPS 15, HP Elite Dragonfly, Surface Laptop 3, MacBook Pro, and Lenovo Yoga C740." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C554ZjlwY7R1hgqzx9H7bhxKvWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66770456/VRG_4013_Best_Laptop_Grid.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: William Joel/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best laptops for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="gnIMOm"&gt;The best laptop of 2021 can come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Here, we’ve got the rest of the best laptops, Windows 10 business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, laptops for school, and 2-in-1 convertibles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfv5g0"&gt;Our current pick for the best laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptop of 2021 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for budget shoppers is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. For a sub-$1,000 price, it delivers performance on par with much more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2021 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Elite Dragonfly. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below or our roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;best gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re looking for a powerful machine that doesn’t sacrifice portability.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qIDMjX"&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M1 processor, is the best laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYCzY0"&gt;Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 screen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDDWFN"&gt;But the new processor is the star of the show here; it’s fast. In our testing, it handled intense photo- and video-editing workloads better than almost any Intel-powered laptop we’ve tried this year. It was also able to run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at close-to-playable frame rates, which is quite a feat for integrated graphics. At launch, these apps hadn’t yet been optimized for the M1 processor and were running through Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer — but they still worked fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACwNY3"&gt;And the processing power didn’t even weigh down the battery life: we got between eight and 10 hours of sustained work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XZkaRR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10220133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8eGPnz"&gt;Another benefit of the M1 processor is that it enables the MacBook Air to run iPhone and iPad apps natively on macOS. As of this writing, there still isn’t a huge selection of mobile apps available, and some that have been released aren’t quite optimized for the laptop screen. Still, it’s a benefit we can look forward to as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjPO8F"&gt;Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t consider the MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air should be fine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="L8pJhA"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best Laptop 2021: HP Spectre x360 14" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VXu0jcRLvUdGZwwpjg3vvbG1mn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279295/mchin_190429_4395_0002.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Spectre x360 14 is one of the best convertible laptops you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O7mXrt"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Spectre x360 14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best Windows laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwIVn"&gt;It’s hard to come up with a single complaint about the Spectre x360 14. It’s a drop-dead gorgeous machine with a sturdy build and a premium look and feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xL3xF1"&gt;But the Spectre x360 14 isn’t just pretty to look at: it’s also a pleasure to use as a daily work driver. Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and Iris Xe integrated graphics deliver snappy performance with no slowdown or freezes that we observed. And we got an average of 10 hours of battery life out of the device — one of the best results we’ve ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfMa1S"&gt;On the outside, the Spectre includes a roomy 3:2 display, and if FHD resolution doesn’t suit your fancy, there are OLED and 1,000-nit options available. There’s even a packaged stylus, which attaches magnetically to the side of the Spectre — handy if you’re using the device as a tablet. Pretty much every other aspect of this laptop, from its comfortable keyboard and smooth touchpad to its bass-heavy audio and practical port selection, rivals or exceeds the best convertibles on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxTNW9"&gt;Such an exceptional package of features doesn’t come cheap, and many customers will find everything they need in a less expensive product. But the Spectre x360 14 is the new gold standard of Windows convertibles. Overall, it’s the best Windows laptop you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ewzfR6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10340665"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Best Laptop 20201: LG Gram 17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GfTxqQBd93C-ef4Dw31UfHEVW_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411713/cfaulkner_20210326_4491_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Gram 17 is the lightweight 17-inch laptop to buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SoHxJX"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364183/lg-gram-17-2021-intel-11th-gen-iris-xe-graphics-performance-battery-review"&gt;LG Gram 17 (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best laptop in 2021 for big-screen fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ovDneV"&gt;Even if you’ve used a light laptop before, it’s difficult to explain how light the LG Gram 17 is. It has a massive 17-inch display, but it’s somehow only three pounds. Picking it up messes with your mind; you feel like you’re not holding anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbftFc"&gt;But the Gram 17’s weight isn’t the only standout feature. It also has some of the best battery life you can get, lasting over 12 hours in our testing. Add a great keyboard, a solid port selection, quiet fans, and a fast processor, and there’s very little not to like about this device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvoTCC"&gt;Not everyone needs a 17-inch display, and many folks who do are looking for a heavier-duty workstation that probably doesn’t get moved very often. But if you’d just really like a large screen for your daily office work and Netflixing, you’re the target demographic for this machine. It’s a niche, but truly impressive device without much real competition in today’s market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kJHRXY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498451"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="VSwm66"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: HP Envy x360 13" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-3n_PDQBp_EOIUDusfA7A_LYGZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20069599/mchin_200705_4086_0006.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Envy x360 is the best laptop you can buy for under $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7dLyUJ"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best budget laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6ONzJr"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin-and-light chassis and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3k1xVZ"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro 13 (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best MacBook Pro for everyday users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yUbRrT"&gt;If you’re looking to buy an M1 MacBook for heavier workloads, you’ll want to look at the late-2020 MacBook Pro. It starts at $1,299, which is $300 more than the late-2020 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNImzP"&gt;The MacBook Pro has a slightly different design and look than the Air, as well as a few additional features like the Touch Bar. But the two have the same processor. The main difference is that the Pro includes a fan (the Air is fanless), which means it can sustain heavy workloads for a longer period of time without needing to throttle its performance. But you won’t notice much of a performance difference between the two MacBooks unless you’re routinely pushing heavy tasks for long periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USngRn"&gt;If that’s you, though, go for the Pro. We were able to run a number of hefty Premiere Pro exports and didn’t see a dip in times. The Pro also achieved a significantly higher score than the Air in a 30-minute loop of Cinebench R23; the scores were closer together after a single run. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best convertible you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NKt5f4"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;A great 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iLNMXR"&gt;If you’re looking for a convertible laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13 2-in-1. It features a sturdy and well-made chassis, a nearly bezel-free 16:10 touch display, and Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dghfZI"&gt;The base model, for $1,099, includes a Core i3-1154G4, 8GB of RAM, a 1920 x 1200 display, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that up to a 3840 x 2400 display, a Core i7-1165G7, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are various add-ons as well: you can pay $50 extra for a white model and $60 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Basically, there’s something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEAGgI"&gt;Dell has made a few minor tweaks to the 2-in-1 since last year’s model. The webcam now supports Windows Hello, and the RAM and microSD reader have been upgraded. But the exciting news is the new chip and, in particular, Intel’s new integrated graphics. The XPS 13 2-in-1 did a better job than any 10th Gen laptop with an iGPU on our Adobe Premiere Pro export test. And you can even play some games on this thing: it broke 60fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and even managed 36fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at its lowest settings. That’s an improvement over the results we saw from 10th Gen systems, and it also beats some 11th Gen systems (including the clamshell Dell XPS 13). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izx3w7"&gt;Of course, it’s not perfect. The port selection is limited (as is customary for modern XPS models) and the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste. But overall, the 2-in-1 excels on the fundamentals: build quality, display, performance, and battery life. What more could you want?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best laptop for college&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6xPrkB"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is a compact and reliable laptop. Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik0URk"&gt;This late-2020 model comes with Intel’s new Tiger Lake processors, from a Core i3-1154G4 up to a Core i7-1165G7. It starts at $999, so it’s a bit cheaper than the 2-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCO5H"&gt;My review unit (an i7 model) blew through the work tasks I needed it to do without any slowdown or heat. It did quite well, and handily beat its 10th Gen predecessor in both gaming and media work. It didn’t do as well as the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is why that model is ranked higher on this list. But if you like the look and feel of the XPS 13 and would prefer a clamshell model (or need a bouncier keyboard), this XPS is still a great option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uN3gSr"&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22528646/dell-xps-13-oled-2021-review-screen-specs-price"&gt;OLED model&lt;/a&gt; of the XPS 13 as well, which costs $300 more than the FHD model. This model has worse battery life, but does deliver a stunning picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best gaming laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2eqQM4"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not compromising performance for that portability. The G15 is powered by the top mobile chips AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and pairs thim with a fast 165Hz QHD display. In our testing, the system was able to handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxthwN"&gt;Almost everything else about the G15 is great too: the audio sounds good, the keyboard and touchpad are some of the best on the market, the port selection has just about everything you’d need, and the battery can last over eight and a half hours to a charge. If you’re looking for a high-powered gaming machine that also works great as a daily driver, the Zephyrus G15 should be at the top of your list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;The best laptop for business travel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XTubRZ"&gt;In many ways, the ThinkPad X1 Nano is a run-of-the-mill ThinkPad. It’s got a solid sturdy chassis, discrete clickers, a physical privacy shutter, a red TrackPoint in the middle of the keyboard, and all kinds of business-specific security and management features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdGWMd"&gt;But the Nano is special because it’s the lightest ThinkPad Lenovo has ever made. It’s also one of the lightest laptops you can buy, at just 1.99 pounds. You’re not sacrificing performance to get that mindblowing weight: The Nano kept up with our heavy testing workloads without any fan noise or noticeable heat. If you’re looking for a reliable business laptop that will feel like nothing in your briefcase, this is the one for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pLq6K9"&gt;The best 14-inch gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FBMA49"&gt;The Zephyrus G14 is an astonishingly powerful gaming laptop for a low price (relative to other notebooks with comparable hardware). It pairs AMD’s new Ryzen 9 4900HS with an Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q GPU and a 120HZ display, and it can run demanding games at their highest settings without a problem. It’s also quite light for such a powerful laptop, weighing just over 3.5 pounds. Its battery life is also impressive for a gaming rig; we got almost nine hours of multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWOpxK"&gt;But you don’t need to be a gamer to appreciate the Zephyrus G14. It’s also a great notebook for business and everyday multitasking with a unique retro design. Plus, the keyboard and touchpad are exceptional and quiet enough not to bother officemates. On the flip side, if you need to use your laptop for videoconferences, the G14 would not be a great choice, as it lacks a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2WSPjS"&gt;A great choice for Mac power users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TfAFYg"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best Apple laptop for power users. Apple dealt with the biggest complaints that people have historically had about MacBook Pros, and if you can stomach the price, there’s not a lot else to complain about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIH5ZZ"&gt;Most importantly, the keyboard is good again. The keys have a full millimeter of travel, and while the typing experience isn’t exceptional, it’s a world away from the maligned butterfly keyboard of MacBooks past. It’s fairly quiet, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjExSY"&gt;This MacBook also features the best sound you’ll find on a laptop. Apple has crammed three speakers into each side, including two woofers. The result is balanced audio with audible bass and great stereo separation. For those who need a laptop that can crank through editing video, working with multiple audio tracks, or processing large batches of photos, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is the king of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="t0EL7n"&gt;The best business laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOD1p"&gt;If you’re a business professional and money is no object for you or your company, you can’t do better than the HP Elite Dragonfly. The 2020 model is the first Dragonfly that features HP’s super-secure SureView Reflect technology, which tints the screen so that snoops can’t see what you’re doing while you’re working in public. When it’s not tinted, the display gets quite bright (over 700 nits) and has great viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzVcoU"&gt;The new Dragonfly is also the first laptop to include a built-in Tile tracker. That means if you lose the device, you can use the Tile smartphone app to set off an alarm (if it’s in Bluetooth range) or locate it anywhere in the world using Tile’s crowd-finding network. The tracker can work for a limited time even when the laptop is off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXS6n7"&gt;Almost everything else about the Dragonfly is good; it has some of the best battery life of any laptop on the market (we got over 11 hours), a sleek and stunning 2-in-1 design, and an exceptional keyboard. Plus, it incorporates sustainable material, including ocean-bound plastics and recycled DVDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEHKpz"&gt;The Dragonfly is pricey, and there are cheaper business laptops that will suit the needs of most professionals just fine. But if you’re looking for the best of the best, it’s the unambiguous winner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="WpIKDR"&gt;The best laptop for students&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5khaPj"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;A stylish, powerful productivity laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1AVfKp"&gt;Razer is best known for its gaming laptops, but the company is making a big splash in the business and productivity space with its new Razer Book 13. At 0.6 inches thick and 3.09 pounds, the Book 13 is a portable workstation with a gorgeous and sturdy aluminum build. It features a good port selection including Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, HDMI 2.0 and a microSD slot, and it’s one of very few non-gaming laptops out there to come with a per-key RGB keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAI01n"&gt;On the inside, this laptop is even more impressive. Its powerful chip did better than any other Windows laptop of its size on our Premiere Pro media export test. And while the Book 13 isn’t a gaming laptop, it delivers some of the best gaming performance I’ve ever seen from integrated graphics — it can even run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; over 30fps. While the Razer Book 13’s high price means it won’t be ideal for everyone, it’s still an outstanding laptop all around, combining a high-quality chassis with powerful productivity performance.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a powerful gaming laptop with few compromises.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zaTcIA"&gt;15. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DdByBe"&gt;The best 17-inch gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="S5SM7Z"&gt;Usually, if you want a 17-inch laptop that can pull playable frame rates out of today’s most demanding games, you’d expect some compromises on portability and design. Notebooks of this size often weigh north of seven pounds and require multiple power bricks to charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whz2V3"&gt;But while the Blade Pro 17 doesn’t have quite the gaming chops of some bulky desktop replacements, it makes up for that by sporting the compact and attractive design that’s a trademark of the Razer Blade line. At just over six pounds, it’s not too difficult to move around (as 17-inch workstations go). You get an RTX GPU (up to Nvidia’s 2080 Super Max-Q) an eight-core CPU (Intel’s Core i7-10875H) and either a 300Hz screen or a 120Hz touchscreen. There’s even an RGB keyboard with color effects tailored to the game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volkswagen, BMW fined $1 billion for colluding to make dirtier cars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="File: Global Carmakers Brace For Tariff Whiplash" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aDR3F_siHbDdbfVSJhOSCgdlLWE=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556348/989626420.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IMkxPd"&gt;Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler spent years illegally colluding to slow the deployment of cleaner emissions technology, says the European Union, which is &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3581"&gt;dishing out fines as a result&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgHabJ"&gt;The EU’s executive branch hit the Volkswagen Group (which owns Audi and Porsche) and BMW with a collective €875 million ($1 billion) fine on Thursday for their role in the scheme. Volkswagen Group must pay €502 million ($595 million), while BMW will pay €373 million ($442 million). Daimler, however, evaded a €727 million fine of its own because the automaker revealed the collusion to the regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gCst8"&gt;The scheme described by EU authorities is separate from the Volkswagen Group’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352646/volkswagen-dieselgate-investigation-damages-winterkorn-audi"&gt;massive Dieselgate scandal&lt;/a&gt;, in which the company installed software on its diesel vehicles that helped fool environmental regulators into believing they were compliant, when in reality, they were polluting far more than the legal limit. Dieselgate ultimately led to nearly $40 billion in fines, buybacks, and legal fees for the Volkswagen Group. Daimler also installed software on some of its diesel vehicles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367768/daimler-diesel-emissions-cheating-scandal-settlement-us-amount"&gt;to cheat emissions tests&lt;/a&gt; and has paid billions of dollars in fines. BMW was careful to point out Thursday that, unlike the other companies it was caught colluding with, it had not cheated emissions testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fABc7D"&gt;The existence of this so-called emissions cartel was first revealed in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/24/16021292/german-car-companies-cartel-diesel-emissions-90s"&gt;explosive July 2017 report from &lt;em&gt;Der Spiegel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which said that collusion around diesel emissions dated back to the 1990s. The companies met in secret working groups to discuss “the technology, costs, suppliers, and even the exhaust gas purification of its diesel vehicles,” the outlet reported at the time. At the same time, EU authorities announced a probe into the allegations and started raiding the automakers’ corporate offices in search of evidence. Daimler claimed &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-antitrust-volkswagen/eu-raids-daimler-and-vw-in-widening-cartel-inquiry-idUSKBN1CS1OK"&gt;whistleblower status in October of that year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6Na3U6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An emissions cartel, in addition to the separate dieselgate scandal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="86Imsv"&gt;The EU &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18296540/european-commission-emissions-scandal-collusion-bmw-daimler-vw-diesel-petrol"&gt;formally accused the companies&lt;/a&gt; of collusion in 2019. The conduct considered for the fines announced Thursday took place between 2009-2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ee0fNO"&gt;The “exhaust gas purification” of diesel vehicles mentioned in the original &lt;em&gt;Der Spiegel&lt;/em&gt; report is at the center of the fines that the EU levied Thursday. Specifically, authorities say the Volkswagen Group, BMW, and Daimler agreed on details like the sizes of the tanks used to house AdBlue, a common solution that mixes with a diesel car’s exhaust to neutralize harmful pollutants. By doing this, authorities argue that the automakers had the technology to make cleaner cars but effectively agreed not to compete on this issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEkXhV"&gt;“The five car manufacturers Daimler, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche possessed the technology to reduce harmful emissions beyond what was legally required under EU emission standards,” the EU’s executive branch wrote in a statement. “But they avoided to compete on using this technology’s full potential to clean better than what is required by law. So today’s decision is about how legitimate technical cooperation went wrong. And we do not tolerate it when companies collude.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRBbb1"&gt;The Volkswagen Group, which has a documented history of lying about its compliance emissions regulations at this point, said in a statement that the “contents of the talks were never implemented and customers were therefore never harmed” and said that bigger AdBlue tanks were eventually used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbnRlw"&gt;As for some of the other allegations that originally surfaced in the &lt;em&gt;Der Spiegel &lt;/em&gt;report about the collusion extending to suppliers and other technology, the EU authorities had already “narrowed the original scope of its investigation to ensure its charges stuck,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/eu-fines-bmw-volkswagen-group-restricting-competition-emission-cleaning-2021-07-08/?taid=60e6ff0bfdc7d300011fd83e&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The settlement agreement announced Thursday won’t make an enormous dent on either the Volkswagen Group’s or BMW’s bottom line. The Volkswagen Group made nearly €12 billion, or around $14 billion, in before-tax profit in 2020, while BMW logged €5 billion, or just over $6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hori’s Split Pad Pro for the Switch is $10 off at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DHmsWglKjz3FA0yIohWeLOxYqPk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556244/DSCF7116.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OJUBaZ"&gt;The deals are thin today, but there are a few that are worth sharing with you. If you already have a Switch or are planning to get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565307/nintendo-oled-switch-screen-news-updates"&gt;the OLED model launching in October&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll definitely want to get Hori’s Split Pad Pro controllers. You can get them in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FJ7XY3B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the translucent black colorway (in my opinion, the best option available) for $40 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $10 off their normal price. These slide in just like Joy-Con controllers but are more accommodating for larger hands than Nintendo’s. They make the Switch less portable, but it might be worth it for you. Unlike Joy-Con, though, these don’t feature rumble, and they only work while connected to the Switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpYrmR"&gt;If you need more convincing, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871866/hori-split-pad-pro-controller-nintendo-switch-daemon-x-machina-review"&gt;check out my colleague Sam Byford’s hands-on with the Split Pad Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W8mVhk"&gt;Until 1PM ET / 10AM PT today, July 8th, you can still purchase PC games on Steam at the lowest prices of the season. The digital storefront has been hosting its annual Summer Sale for several days, but it’s down to the wire now. A few notable discounts include &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151640/Horizon_Zero_Dawn_Complete_Edition/?snr=1_4_600__104"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for $30, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/782330/DOOM_Eternal/?snr=1_4_600__104"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for $20, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/814380/Sekiro_Shadows_Die_Twice__GOTY_Edition/?snr=1_4_600__104"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for $30, and &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/435150/Divinity_Original_Sin_2__Definitive_Edition/?snr=1_4_600__sale-deals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Divinity: Original Sin II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for $18. There’s so much more to check out, so do that before 1PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="n41xYM"&gt;I featured this deal yesterday, but it bears repeating if you’ve been trying and failing to find Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless headset in stock. It normally costs $100 by itself, but there’s a deal happening at eBay that includes a month of Game Pass Ultimate (normally $15) &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F124796256296%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F8%2F22568320%2Fhori-split-pad-pro-nintendo-switch-steam-summer-sale-xbox-headset-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for a total of $107&lt;/a&gt;. Get it while it’s still available, which may not be for much longer as the eBay listing says it has a limited supply.&lt;/p&gt;
