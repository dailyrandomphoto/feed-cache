    <title>T-Mobile launches long-promised 5G home internet service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile first began piloting wireless home internet over LTE in 2019. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZegUuC"&gt;After a long pilot period, T-Mobile is making its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fisp&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F7%2F22312155%2Ft-mobile-5g-home-internet-wireless-broadband" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;5G home internet service&lt;/a&gt; a reality today. The company made the announcement on a live stream today, teased as its next Uncarrier move, and it says 30 million homes are now eligible for the service — 10 million of which are in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIDGQ2"&gt;The service costs $60 per month, or $65 without autopay, which is $10 more per month than when the pilot program was introduced. The service comes with no data caps, hardware rental fees, or annual contracts, and customers self-install their own equipment. T-Mobile says most customers will experience speeds of 100Mbps, and all eligible customers should see average speeds of 50Mbps. Depending on coverage in your area, it will either use a 4G or 5G signal, whichever is faster. But there’s an important caveat: home internet customers are subject to data slowdowns during times of network congestion, which could be a serious deterrent for some customers who live in dense areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HB1E69"&gt;T-Mobile’s talk of 5G home internet dates back to 2019, when the company was making its case to the Federal Communications Commission why it should be allowed to acquire Sprint. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254853/tmobile-sprint-merger-5g-home-internet-service-promises"&gt;claimed that gaining access&lt;/a&gt; to Sprint’s network would be a necessary step in offering high-speed in-home wireless internet. According to the company, this would allow T-Mobile to offer an alternative to the dominant ISPs and bring faster internet to underserved rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="detQu9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2h75wy"&gt;Before the ink was dry on the deal, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18275640/tmobile-lte-wireless-home-internet-service-pilot-launch"&gt;T-Mobile started piloting the service&lt;/a&gt; over its existing LTE network. It started small, as an invitation-only deal for 50,000 households. As of last month, the pilot included 100,000 households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCLeHM"&gt;Testing a pilot program in select cities is one thing; opening up that service to 5G customers across the country is another. T-Mobile is certainly confident that its network can handle it, and with good reason: that spectrum it acquired from Sprint &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297311/tmobile-5g-mid-band-magenta-max-unlimited-data"&gt;has given it a leg up&lt;/a&gt;, especially compared to Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T. Maybe when it’s done fulfilling &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; promise from its Sprint acquisition talks, it can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295777/dish-network-5g-q3-2021"&gt;work on its promise to help Dish&lt;/a&gt; become that fourth wireless carrier that we’ve been missing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s Portal TV now supports Zoom so you can take meetings from the couch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gJSgFo8_dw6PA4XRJd6c1JcDUng=/112x0:1306x796/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69089138/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_10.29.01_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3e8LAn"&gt;Facebook has added Zoom and GoToMeeting support to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871173/facebook-portal-camera-price-release-date-availability"&gt;Portal TV product&lt;/a&gt;, so you can fully embrace the work-from-home lifestyle and take meetings from your living room couch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BH4pL9"&gt;Zoom and GoToMeeting, as well as BlueJeans and Webex, are already available on Facebook’s more portable Portal devices, including the standard Portal, the Portal Mini, and the Portal Plus. The new additions to the Portal TV should make it much more useful as a work webcam, but also in the event any of your COVID-era digital hangouts happen on Zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w154rv"&gt;“Now, your favorite Zoom functionality extends to the largest screen in your home, so you can work from your couch as well as your desk,” reads a &lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/telecommute-from-your-tv/"&gt;blog post published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. “That includes joining breakout rooms for brainstorming in smaller groups, calendar integration to help you stay on top of your schedule, screen sharing to improve remote collaboration, and virtual backgrounds to improve your overall experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vI7RvT"&gt;Facebook has been slowly building out the feature set of its Portal family of video chat devices. In October of last year, it added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504264/facebook-portal-tv-netflix-app-update"&gt;Netflix to the Portal TV&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20913653/facebook-portal-10-inch-2019-review-price-specs-features-whatsapp-video-calling"&gt;second-generation Portal and the first Portal Mini&lt;/a&gt; released back in 2019 added WhatsApp calling support alongside more reasonable price tags. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HuekGB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Unicomp New Model M review: back to brilliant basics</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;An amazing typing experience that’s sometimes far from practical&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="LrRrnr"&gt;I’m not old enough to have ever encountered an original IBM Model M in an office. But in my second year of university, after hearing about how amazing these old keyboards were to type on, I sought out an old model on eBay. For the next two years, every essay I wrote was hammered out on a vintage keyboard from 1985. I never took it to libraries or lectures (I’m not a monster), but my second-year roommate must have been pretty happy to see the back of me that summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BgFdhQ"&gt;As of this writing, you can still find plenty of decades-old IBM Model M keyboards &lt;a href="https://www.clickykeyboards.com/shop/"&gt;for sale online&lt;/a&gt;, or you could buy a $104 New Model M from Unicomp, a company with its roots in the Lexington-based keyboard factory that produced many of the original Model Ms. The New Model M is big, bulky, and it’s got the same buckling spring switch mechanism that made its predecessor such a treat to type on. It’s not hard to imagine this board soaking up cigarette smoke and coffee on the desk of a 1980s office worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4rccL"&gt;When people ask me what it is I like about mechanical keyboards, I usually respond by saying something about how timeless their designs are. IBM keyboards produced in the 1980s still feel great to type on today, and there’s a good chance many mechanical keyboards made nowadays will outlast the computers they’re plugged into. But feeling great to type on isn’t the only thing a modern keyboard needs to do, and that’s where the New Model M falls short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LS13wc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10431752"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EStu3Q"&gt;The New Model M is available in a variety of different configurations. Although its case only comes in black, its keys are available in either gray or, like we have here, white and gray. It’s available with an old-fashioned PS2 connector or more modern USB. (The cable, unfortunately, isn’t detachable like many modern mechanical keyboards.) It’s available with layouts suitable for a variety of countries, including US, UK, Denmark, Finland / Sweden, France, Germany, Norway, and Spain. If you go for a US layout, there’s the option of getting the keyboard with a slightly longer space bar, and Unicomp will also &lt;a href="https://tidbits.com/2021/02/17/new-model-m-is-an-american-made-keyboard-that-puts-a-spring-back-in-your-typing/#post-50396:~:text=I%20contacted%20Unicomp%20support%20in%20mid%2DDecember,mechanical%20keyboards%20currently%20on%20the%20market."&gt;ship the keyboard with a Mac layout&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these options come with customization fees. Unsurprisingly, there’s no option for wireless connectivity, just like there wouldn’t have been in the mid-1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JjyHD"&gt;Even for a full-size keyboard, the New Model M is &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt;. There’s a border of at least 2cm (0.78in) of plastic around the four sides of the keyboard, and even between the sections of keys themselves, there’s more empty space than you’ll find with most modern keyboards. It’s a tad narrower and shorter than my ’80s Model M, though not by much. It’s also a lot lighter and doesn’t feel quite as sturdy as my original model. It’s not flimsy; it’s just not built like a tank in the same way the old keyboards were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aIy21Tot5iOcf2GiSHKBZZlZriQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22393207/akrales_20210323_4477_0059.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Model M is a bulky keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L5JYqrtGjM5UlBBHdtpUrkaq-lg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22393210/akrales_20210323_4477_0078.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unicomp’s logo looks a little dated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X3CwJ7"&gt;There are obvious practical downsides to a keyboard this big, and space-constrained typists should look elsewhere (or perhaps at Unicomp’s more recent &lt;a href="https://www.pckeyboard.com/page/product/MINI_M"&gt;Mini M&lt;/a&gt; if you’re prepared to give up the Numpad and could use a detachable USB cable). But if you need a full-size keyboard and you’re even slightly space-constrained, then the New Model M isn’t a great choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="CNEGX2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10431706"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M9y27e"&gt;The overall design of the New Model M I could take or leave. It has a kind of retro charm to it, but the Unicomp logo emblazoned on the top right is dated in an ugly way rather than a charming way, and the blue LEDs that light up when you’ve got caps lock or num lock turned on are an eyesore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6pBuDg"&gt;Overall, although build quality isn’t quite as good as an original Model M, Unicomp’s keyboard feels solidly built by modern standards. Its keycap legends are printed on using &lt;a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Keycap_printing#Dye_sublimation:~:text=Dye%20sublimation,-Dye"&gt;dye-sublimation&lt;/a&gt;, so they’re not going to wear away anytime soon, and they’ve got a slightly rough matte texture that feels nice under the fingers. They’re fairly tall and gradually increase in height from front to the back of the keyboard, with squared-off edges and a slight curvature from left to right. (I’d say they’re closer to OEM than Cherry profile keycaps overall.) There’s a pair of raised bars on the J and F keys to help touch typists find their home row, but they’re subtle and take a little getting used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QJ91yTWC8Mw_TJ0xh4nsbj2YpO8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22393204/akrales_20210322_4477_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Its keycaps are made of PBT plastic and have a slightly rough texture to them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PNrdDJ"&gt;The quality and style of the keyboard’s PBT keycaps are important because alternatives aren’t nearly as easy to come by as they are for keyboards for Cherry-style switches. Unicomp does sell &lt;a href="https://www.pckeyboard.com/page/category/Buttons"&gt;replacements via its online store&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’re someone who’s interested in buying any of the wildly designed keycaps available across the internet, then be aware that vanishingly few of them are compatible with the New Model M. I also found the keycaps weren’t as easy to remove and replace as the keycaps on Cherry MX-style switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HeaLJ"&gt;It all means the New Model M isn’t the best keyboard for tinkerers. There are no Cherry MX-style switches for you to desolder and swap out, and you won’t be tempted by a seemingly never-ending supply of new keycaps to buy online. That won’t matter for the vast majority of typists, but it’s worth bearing in mind if you’re curious about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21112581/taeha-types-mechanical-keyboards-custom-twitch-tfue-fortnite-streaming"&gt;weird and wonderful world of custom keyboards&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VFvZCNHBrXJtVqvtdPPlpc7R10A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22393206/akrales_20210323_4477_0051.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legends are printed using hard-wearing dye-sublimation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RLWmyHPiYfCf6IOXj_0QVQ1mAqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22393212/akrales_20210323_4477_0096.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, Unicomp’s keyboard features Windows keys, which were missing from the original Model Ms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="85giTH"&gt;If you’re buying a New Model M, you’re buying it for the typing experience it offers out of the box. Thankfully, that experience is one of the best around. The keyboard’s heavy keys take a little bit of getting used to (I find that typing with my wrists held in the air rather than resting on my desk helps a lot), and pretty soon, the tactile clack of each keypress guides you into a reassuring rhythm. The fact that each key is that little bit harder to press than most other keyboards meant that I mistyped less frequently, making it easy for me to get into a good flow and just enjoy the process. At its best, the New Model M sounds like a glorious cacophony of key-clacking, and it feels every bit as good as it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6Iu3n"&gt;People like to give advice about what kind of switches you should buy a keyboard with based on what you’re going to use it for. If you’re a typist, Cherry MX Blues are said to be a good choice, while gamers might be better off with Cherry MX Reds. MX Browns are considered a mix of the two. For the most part, I think advice like this can be a little prescriptive. I know people who game on Blues and type on Reds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KEdcji_zakQDp-ADq25x8850XaA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22393209/akrales_20210323_4477_0073.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The board is available with white and gray or just white keycaps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Py1NZz"&gt;But when it comes to buckling springs, I really do think these are switches for typing and typing alone. That pressure you have to use to press each key is fine when you’re typing, but it can get tiring if you’re holding down a key while playing a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcVWEz"&gt;Another downside to consider is their volume: buckling springs are &lt;em&gt;loud&lt;/em&gt;. They’re so loud that it’s not just an issue if you’re planning on using the keyboard in a shared dorm or office, but their loudness also caused problems for me on Zoom calls. I had to mute myself while on a recent call to avoid disturbing everyone else with my clacking, and I had to turn up my speakers’ volume on other occasions to be able to hear a press conference while I typed up notes. Another time, I managed to completely ruin a recording of an interview because all you could hear was the sound of me clacking away while an interviewee spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="LbUxXb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10432250"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K3d8Js"&gt;If all you do on your computer is type, then the New Model M does that brilliantly. But when you need to use your computer for other things, like playing games or making calls, the keyboard’s lack of versatility becomes obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FwTzgHLW46kxxk0PKbxi6riMvu8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22393211/akrales_20210323_4477_0086.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our model has a UK layout, but it’s also available with a US layout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E2u98D8Qgqqv_5FB7yjOxDvQx3o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22393208/akrales_20210323_4477_0070.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buckling spring switches feel great to type on, but their loudness can be an issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nApMoB"&gt;I loved using my IBM Model M, and there’s no way I’m going to part ways with it anytime soon. But soon after I was done with school, I switched to a more modern keyboard with much quieter Cherry MX Brown switches. Ultimately, I needed my computer’s main control peripheral to be good at things that weren’t just typing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERMBJu"&gt;Like its predecessors, when you’re using the New Model M for what it’s designed for, typing, there are few other keyboards around that do it quite as well. People have been clacking away on buckling spring keyboards for decades for good reason. But Unicomp’s keyboard is just as uncompromising as any Model M from the ’80s. It’s too loud for any modern office or video calls, and its stiff switches aren’t great for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="scRTnr"&gt;Still, if you’re after the best typing experience around at whatever cost, then the Unicomp New Model M is one of your best options. You just need to understand exactly what “whatever cost” is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7C3Vi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZaHha"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6QWX4m"&gt;Western Digital’s 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD with PCIe 4.0 support in compatible motherboards is cheaper than ever at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1605430-REG%2Fwd_wdbapy0010bnc_wrsn_1tb_sn850_black_gaming.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.westerndigital.com%2Fproducts%2Finternal-drives%2Fwd-black-sn850-nvme-ssd%23WDS100T1X0E-00AFY0&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F4%2F7%2F22371525%2Fwestern-digital-1tb-ssd-pcie4-oculus-quest-store-game-discount-code" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company’s own site&lt;/a&gt;. It originally sold for $230, but you can get one now for $180. There are cheaper SSDs that have 1TB of storage, but this is a good deal if you want an SSD that’s capable of far faster transfer speeds than most others. Western Digital claims it can achieve up to 7,000MB/s read speeds and 5,300MB/s write speeds when it’s mounted into a motherboard that supports PCIe 4.0, which only a few do at this point. But it’ll work in any motherboard with an M.2 slot, just not at those aforementioned speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1kn4z"&gt;Given that the PS5 has a PCIe 4.0 M.2 slot for storage expansion, it’s possible that this might be a perfect fit for the console once it’s patched to support expandable storage. That’s supposed to happen later this summer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Wxgega"&gt;Through April 12th, the service &lt;a href="https://moviesanywhere.com/bonusoffer"&gt;Movies Anywhere is offering a promotion&lt;/a&gt; that’ll net you a free movie when you purchase one. It’s like a buy one, get one deal, except the list of eligible movies you can get on the house is fairly small. Still, a free movie is a free movie. And if you’re considering buying elsewhere, there are some good reasons to snag them through Movies Anywhere instead, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21210040/movies-anywheres-screen-pass-lending-feature-open-beta-sign-ups-today"&gt;Screen Pass feature&lt;/a&gt; that lets you lend your library of flicks to someone else. Another big perk is that it can bring in movies purchased through other services, like Apple, Google, or Microsoft, making it easy to see everything you’ve bought across multiple platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QovUhO"&gt;To get the free movie, you’ll need to log in with a Movies Anywhere account, purchase a movie, then use the code you’ll find in your inbox to redeem one for free. There are some titles that aren’t eligible for this promo, so before you buy, check out &lt;a href="https://moviesanywhere.com/bonusoffer"&gt;the fine print at the bottom of this page&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll have until April 26th at 11:59PM ET to redeem your free movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="P7g16K"&gt;If you have an Oculus Quest game on your wishlist, you’ll be able to save 25 percent on one title if you purchase it through the mobile app (&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oculus-vr/id1366478176?itsct=apps_box&amp;amp;itscg=30200&amp;amp;at=1001l7uV&amp;amp;ct=TheVerge&amp;amp;ls=1"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oculus.twilight&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;) and enter the code &lt;strong&gt;mobile25&lt;/strong&gt;. This deal appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.cheapassgamer.com/topic/373101-oculus-quest-25-off-any-one-game/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CheapAssGamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and I was able to successfully apply it to a game that was in my cart. It’s not a huge discount, but it can reduce the sting of buying a full-priced game. If you more recently got a Quest or Quest 2 VR headset, there are a bunch of good options you can use this code on. My colleague Sam Byford &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21535909/oculus-quest-2-best-games"&gt;compiled a few favorites right here&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Samsung is bringing its lowest-cost 5G phones to the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eNy7tQ3zzU7D1HzCcoipD2oNM0o=/0x1:2000x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088752/Galaxy_A02S_A12_A32_A42_5G_5G_A52_5G_Lineup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five new A-series models will debut in the US this month, from the entry-level A02s up to the midrange A52 5G.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C4wNQQ"&gt;Until now, we’ve known almost everything about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22334392/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-a72-specs-price-camera"&gt;Samsung’s newest Galaxy A-series phones&lt;/a&gt; (which were announced recently at the company’s Unpacked event) except for a couple of key details: which models would be sold in the US and for how much. That’s the announcement Samsung made today, with three low-cost 5G phones leading the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5cIkjQ"&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G, A42 5G, and A32 5G will all go on sale in the US later this week, with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231420/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-europe-cheapest-5g-phone"&gt;sub-$300 A32&lt;/a&gt; clocking in as Samsung’s lowest-cost 5G model to date. They’ll each ship loaded with Android 11 and with charging bricks included in the box. Also arriving Stateside soon: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21628573/samsung-a12-a02s-phones-budget-price-specs-2021"&gt;entry-level Galaxy A12 and A02s&lt;/a&gt;, each costing under $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4QvV6M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10432345"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2LYuk9"&gt;The A52 5G is the highest specced A-series model US customers will see this year; the A72, which was unveiled at the same Unpacked event, is missing from today’s list. The A52 5G follows up on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"&gt;last year’s solid A51 model&lt;/a&gt; and includes a 6.5-inch OLED with 120Hz refresh rate, a Snapdragon 750G processor, IP67 water resistance rating, and a 4,500mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pAGFLFoROgD83eL_GtiW2VvuNI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424833/Galaxy_A52_5G_Awesome_Black_Front_Back.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G features a stabilized main camera, IP67 weather resistance, and a 120Hz screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="726Ua2"&gt;Its camera hardware is also a step up from the other models in this bunch, including a 64-megapixel main camera with optical image stabilization. The A52 5G supports sub-6GHz 5G only (no mmWave), and like the other two 5G models, it supports C-band frequencies at a hardware level. It will be sold with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage for $499 starting on April 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gGqZrgSgCd2Gxqqitc7DCtn1-mI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424847/GalaxyA42_5G_Variants.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A42 5G supports sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wrCzlm"&gt;The A42 5G is the only model of the bunch to support mmWave 5G in addition to sub-6GHz. It also features a 6.6-inch OLED with standard 60Hz refresh rate, and like the A52 5G, it will use a Snapdragon 750G chipset. The A42 5G features a 48-megapixel main camera and doesn’t include an IP rating. It will include 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and is going on sale for $399 starting on April 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6X-DqtsUzJueeQ8sMP0LUxnmmX8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424854/Galaxy_A32_5G_Awesome_Black_Front_Back.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A32 5G is Samsung’s least expensive 5G model to date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k6jEFV"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy A32 5G skips out on quite a few features in order to hit its low price point. It includes an LCD rather than OLED — a 6.6-inch panel with 90Hz refresh rate — and uses a MediaTek 720 processor rather than a Snapdragon chipset. It will include 4GB of RAM and a skimpy 64GB of storage, thankfully expandable by microSD. It will sell for $279 starting on April 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m-Vc98jOIvuWYPmFTFnFYQKl_ig=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424856/Galaxy_A12_Black_Front_Angled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A12 offers a 6.5-inch LCD.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7igkht"&gt;Rounding out the set are the LTE-only, budget-oriented A12 and A02s, each featuring a 6.5-inch LCD with standard refresh rate and a 5,000mAh battery. The A12 gets a 16-megapixel main camera and a 5-megapixel ultrawide and will offer 3GB of RAM. The A02s includes a 13-megapixel main camera without the ultrawide and offers just 2GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlVP9f"&gt;Both phones will ship with Android 10 and (thankfully) offer storage expansion via microSD; with just 32GB of built-in storage each, some extra space will be a necessity. The Galaxy A12  will sell for $179 starting on April 9th; the Galaxy A02s will cost $109.99 and arrive on April 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIuR0V"&gt;All of these A-series devices will be sold unlocked by Samsung, though the company could only confirm that the A52 5G would be available this way on April 9th; all others would be coming at some point later this spring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAsXdC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>So you’re vaccinated — what are you waiting for?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ykXO0D5HG2yOHWpcUPjCAyNhnsw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088651/vrg_illo_4510_foldableSign.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;I asked experts when vaccinated people can resume high-risk activities — and got a whole bunch of answers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Au1Dis"&gt;It’s been over a year since my office shut down. Over a year since I went to a bar, a fitness class, a movie theater, a concert, a Knicks game, or to the many other public events that were once centerpieces of my social life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KeMjm"&gt;But there’s finally, &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; a finish line in sight. There are three safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines authorized and available in the US — and at least &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/most-americans-will-be-eligible-covid-19-vaccine-mid-april-n1262369"&gt;90 percent of all adults&lt;/a&gt; will be eligible to receive one by April 19th. If our current vaccination pace continues, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tracking-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-11611355360?mod=article_inline"&gt;75 percent&lt;/a&gt; of adults will have at least one dose by early summer. Reader, I am dying to get back to my favorite activities, and I can tell that people around me are, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcwQcb"&gt;But according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, vaccinated people aren’t out of the woods yet. The agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html"&gt;current guidelines&lt;/a&gt; still severely limit some activities that are a big part of many people’s “normal” and some people’s livelihoods: theaters, concerts, bars, sporting events, and the like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R5MkN9"&gt;Now, I know concerts aren’t more important than public health, and I’m happy to follow expert advice for as long as needed to stop the spread of COVID-19. But that hasn’t stopped me from wondering “when?” When can our pre-pandemic lives resume, without distancing, capacity limits, quarantines, and other restrictions? When can I go clubbing again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqgsSf"&gt;Lately, there’s been a lot of great writing about what vaccinated people should and shouldn’t do &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;. But that didn’t help me get a clear picture of what the future might hold. So I spoke to seven experts, who have all been involved in studying or treating COVID-19, about a slightly different question. I asked them: What signs are we waiting for? When will we know that we can get back to “normal”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CO5gRw"&gt;Those are difficult questions to answer because there are a lot of uncertain variables, and the situation is changing rapidly. The US is averaging over &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tracking-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-11611355360?mod=article_inline"&gt;3 million doses per day&lt;/a&gt;, and some states are already dropping their pandemic restrictions — but COVID-19 cases are still on the rise, and officials are worried about an &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccinations-are-picking-up-pace-but-new-cases-are-still-rising-11617190131"&gt;upcoming surge&lt;/a&gt;. To understand what our “normality” goalposts are, it’s important to first understand what those unknowns are and why the CDC is asking people to keep being patient after they get their shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vgXT0I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Real-world evidence shows that the COVID-19 vaccines work","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358085/covid-vaccines-effective-real-world-infection-protection-cdc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="qwdW5n"&gt;Let’s start with the basics: if I’m fully vaccinated, why should I still avoid crowds?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uDeh3R"&gt;When you’re fully vaccinated, you want to avoid coming into close contact with unvaccinated people. For one, no vaccine is 100 percent effective. Some experts I spoke to believe they’re effective enough that vaccinated people can justifiably stop worrying about their own risk, while others continued to urge caution. But everyone agreed that while we have data on the efficacy of the vaccines in preventing you from getting severe COVID yourself, we have less information about how well they prevent you from potentially passing it to unvaccinated people. Every expert I spoke to cited this as a reason vaccinated people still needed to be cautious while COVID is widespread in their area. It’s also mentioned in the CDC’s guidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hA9JE0"&gt;I pressed on this, though, because it’s not the case that we have &lt;em&gt;no &lt;/em&gt;information on this topic. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-israel-vaccine-int/israeli-studies-find-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-reduces-transmission-idUSKBN2AJ08J"&gt;Preliminary studies from Israel&lt;/a&gt; have indicated that Pfizer’s vaccine greatly reduces transmission, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358085/covid-vaccines-effective-real-world-infection-protection-cdc"&gt;CDC recently found&lt;/a&gt; even more evidence that Pfizer’s and Moderna’s shots are highly effective at preventing infection in vaccinated frontline workers. So I asked the experts how much more information they’d need before they were comfortable with vaccinated people returning to public crowds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69qdbc"&gt;I got a wide variety of responses here. Brian Cruz, regional medical director of PhysicianOne Urgent Care, says he’s waiting for more peer-reviewed studies. The Pfizer data from Israel, for example, isn’t peer reviewed, and the researchers have stated that further &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-israel-vaccine-int/israeli-studies-find-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-reduces-transmission-idUSKBN2AJ08J"&gt;study is needed&lt;/a&gt;. And while the CDC’s findings indicate that the US vaccines are likely effective in preventing COVID infection, Cruz notes, they don’t settle the question of whether a vaccinated person can be an asymptomatic carrier. He doesn’t think it’ll take too long for all of that to be cleared up. “There’s a strong push to get that information out,” he tells me. “I think we’re getting to that point.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iUcGR"&gt;Others don’t feel that they’ll be satisfied with transmission research at any point in the near future. Before a majority of people are vaccinated, “regardless of the science that might come up ... I don’t think it’s responsible to gather in medium or large-sized groups,” says epidemiologist Matthew Weissenbach, senior director of clinical affairs at Wolters Kluwer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D41Jcb"&gt;Epidemiologist Brian Castrucci, who is president of the de Beaumont Foundation, stressed that uncertainty around transmission is less of a concern when a high proportion of people are protected. “This is a novel virus and a novel vaccine. We’re going to be learning for a while as to how it interacts and how it works,” he says. What we do know, he adds, is that “the more people who are vaccinated, the less the virus has a path forward.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7Lork"&gt;With those answers in mind, I began asking about the future. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5AW87JyaCZcsGGWBMUmM30KaASk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425446/vrg_illo_4510_stoplight.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pyvuSM"&gt;When can I go see &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; in the room where it happens — instead of on TV?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dzmOc5"&gt;You can’t control who else attends large public events (theater, clubbing, concerts, religious services, basketball games, and the like), and a vaccinated person will run the risk of coming into close contact with unvaccinated people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5KVoa"&gt;Some of these events can happen in a low-risk manner with modifications — small religious gatherings outdoors with six feet between participants, for example. But I wanted to know what it will take to get the full nine yards back: indoor crowds, full capacity, screaming and cheering, the works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vd8xmp"&gt;The big thing to look out for with local events is the pace of vaccination &lt;em&gt;in your community&lt;/em&gt;, since most venues like bars, churches, and, yes, theaters, largely draw local patrons. (There are exceptions, of course — more on those later.) The CDC is &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; vaccination rates, case counts, hospital utilization, deaths, and other metrics by county. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LmAuq4"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “What we need to see is that all the trends continue in the right direction.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fRarRF"&gt;Experts say they’ll be watching for a few things. One is case counts. A positive test rate of 0.5 percent or lower would be a good sign, according to Mireya Wessolossky, an infectious disease specialist at UMass Memorial Medical Center and associate professor at UMass Medical School. Another is hospitalizations. “There need to be no people in the hospital, or once in a while,” Wessolossky says. Another is the overall direction of cases and hospitalizations — “What we need to see is that all the trends continue in the right direction as we start to get back to normality,” said Andrew Catchpole, virologist and chief scientific officer at hVivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KmfbQk"&gt;And a fourth is the proportion of people in your community who are vaccinated. Most of the experts I spoke to said they’ll be most comfortable with large, public events when the area in question has a vaccinated proportion sufficient for herd immunity — the point at which enough people are immune to a disease that a community as a whole is protected, including those who don’t have immunity themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dexKuH"&gt;When can I have my birthday party? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lfJmzP"&gt;Here’s the good news: your birthday party, book club meeting, and other personal gatherings should be fine now, provided that everyone invited is fully vaccinated. So if you’ve been holding out on throwing an indoor birthday party, you should be waiting until &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/03/08/fully-vaccinated-americans-spend-time-together-indoors-unmasked/"&gt;two weeks after&lt;/a&gt; everyone on your invite list has had their shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwoAbc"&gt;Weddings are the one area where experts seem to diverge. Weissenbach thinks they should wait for herd immunity (or should be held outdoors, with distancing precautions) since there are likely to be outside staff involved with ambiguous vaccination status. “You probably have food vendors, you probably have a DJ,” he says. “I’m not super comfortable with it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8QRI9"&gt;Others were tentatively okay with indoor weddings of fully vaccinated guests sooner. But everyone did agree that for weddings (or parties or other sorts of indoor, unmasked, and close gatherings) with unvaccinated guests, herd immunity is the goal. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pnnsjiK6KSo9pA-UKpJnWZ3u0zQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425444/vrg_illo_4510_Crosswalk.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Tk6zi7"&gt;Okay, cool. So how many people need to be vaccinated for herd immunity against COVID-19? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lbN1rN"&gt;Unfortunately, we won’t know that for a while. The threshold for herd immunity varies between diseases, and COVID-19 is a new virus. The best we can do for now is make educated guesses based on our knowledge of other viruses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llfkMG"&gt;It’s possible that COVID’s number is very high — a population needs a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20herd%20immunity%20against,the%20threshold%20is%20about%2080%25."&gt;95 percent&lt;/a&gt; vaccination rate to achieve herd immunity against measles. However, COVID is unlikely to be as contagious as measles, and many of the experts I spoke to were comfortable with a rough estimate of 70 to 80 percent. That’s also the range Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/12/16/80percent-of-the-population-needs-to-be-vaccinated-to-reach-herd-immunity-fauci.html"&gt;projected in mid-December&lt;/a&gt;. “I would feel good about 70 to 80 percent,” says Castrucci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="g6hI7L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I would feel good about 70 to 80 percent.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x1msAz"&gt;Some were more optimistic: Michelle Prickett, an associate professor at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, says she’d be okay lifting some restrictions above the 50 percent mark. And others are less so. Catchpole tells me, “To operate at maximum safety and minimum risk, we’d want to see as close to a 100 percent takeup of the vaccine as possible before pre-pandemic normality is brought back.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M8TKFm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/02/20/us/us-herd-immunity-covid.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;Plenty of factors&lt;/a&gt; could impact what those thresholds are, and how long it takes to reach them. But overall, this goalpost is clear: we want a large majority of people to be fully vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2pMNdO"&gt;Got it. So can I plan to attend the Stanley Cup playoffs this year?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UBsjMm"&gt;This year’s Super Bowl was &lt;a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2021/03/03/tampas-super-bowl-was-not-a-coronavirus-super-spreader-officials-say/"&gt;not a COVID superspreader event&lt;/a&gt;, according to health officials. Fifty-seven cases were linked to official Super Bowl festivities, and 25 people were exposed at the events — over 280,000 people participated. That said, this year’s Super Bowl was held in an open-air stadium at &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/sports/football/super-bowl-2021-covid-coronavirus.html"&gt;less than half capacity&lt;/a&gt;, and fans were required to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/nfl-plan-super-bowl-2021-safety-covid19-risks.html"&gt;wear masks&lt;/a&gt; and adhere to social-distancing measures. So I asked what it would take for the experts to go back to indoor games with full crowds.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBKy9W"&gt;Castrucci says nationwide vaccine rates are more important here than local numbers — the 70 to 80 percent threshold is the goal. Even if they’re taking place in your area, big sporting events and gatherings at similar scale may bring in fans from all across the country. You may not know whether other attendees you’ll encounter are vaccinated, where they came from, or what vaccine rates are in their area. “Something like a Super Bowl, that’s something to be thoughtful about,” Castrucci says. “We’re only going to be as safe as the group that is vaccinated least.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VZoDdU"&gt;Seventy to 80 percent seems high — are we actually going to hit these numbers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4fy7GI"&gt;I got a chorus of emphatic yeses; the experts I asked believe that number is realistic. “A little bit of patience and we’re going to get to that point,” says Cruz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrRiHA"&gt;The segment of people who plan to get a vaccine is promising. A recent poll indicated that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22316094/covid-19-vaccine-supplies-us-antivirus-newsletter"&gt;69 percent&lt;/a&gt; of US adults had already gotten the vaccine or were willing to get one (and that proportion may be much higher in your region). And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331619/covid-vaccine-second-dose-cdc"&gt;nearly everyone&lt;/a&gt; who gets the first dose of a two-shot vaccine has been getting their second one within the recommended window. Kids also make up &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-shots-for-children-hold-key-to-herd-immunity-11616923801"&gt;22 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the US population, and it’s looking like 12- to 15-year-olds could have access to shots &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359883/covid-vaccine-pfizer-adolescents-effective"&gt;before the next school year&lt;/a&gt;. Opening up that bracket will likely make up for some adult hesitancy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzkw6R"&gt;It’s also likely that more hesitant people will be pushed to get the shot if schools and other institutions make COVID vaccines mandatory. And there’s also a normalization factor at play. “Once someone initially resistant to getting a vaccine shot knows other people within their peer group who have had a vaccination, they’re more likely to change their mind,” says Catchpole. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BKGi3E0i4OjP-fHfhiaKmmEknRg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425448/vrg_illo_4510_Train_Crossing.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sgE7Gc"&gt;What about that Cancun vacation I’ve been putting off?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv7Y2R"&gt;International travel will take longer. Many countries around the world are not open to US tourists, and some that are have still &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/us-international-travel-covid-19/index.html"&gt;highly discouraged leisure travel&lt;/a&gt; and are requiring arrivals to test and quarantine before they can enter. If you’re planning an international vacation, that’s going to be an even longer waiting game than getting tickets to any big event. Some experts caution that countries might open their borders prematurely but still recommend that fully vaccinated people keep six feet of distance from others during their trips and quarantine before and after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vvsk0C"&gt;Wessolossky says travelers should be looking at the proportion of people who have been vaccinated at their destination, once it’s open (as well as other metrics like positive test rates and hospitalizations). That’s especially true because if you’re vacationing, you may want to visit restaurants, bars, or other indoor attractions where the virus and variants of the virus can spread easily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XTG0JY"&gt;Shoot, now I’m thinking about variants. How do they factor into vacation planning?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uTh8NS"&gt;Even if the country you’re aiming to visit is open and vaccinated at high rates, Wessolossky says, it would be a bad idea to visit if there’s a new variant circulating there and you can’t find research on how it interacts with your vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nO29E"&gt;But like transmission, variants aren’t a topic we know &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; about. Some &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-19-vaccines-efficacy-variants-south-africa-uk-brazil-2021-3"&gt;current research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that while our vaccines may be less effective against some concerning variants, they likely still provide some degree of protection. So I asked: what information are we waiting on regarding the variants we’re currently worried about, and given that future variants are a perpetual question mark, will we ever know enough? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OwdP4o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We need a bit more infrastructure here in the US and globally.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LG5qps"&gt;The answer to both questions appears to be infrastructure: tests for detecting variants &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/labs-cant-tell-you-if-you-have-a-covid-variant-a-problem-for-tracking-and-prevention"&gt;aren’t yet approved&lt;/a&gt; for diagnostic use in the US, and only a small number of US labs can validate them, so variant-focused contact tracing is difficult. “If we had the science infrastructure to sequence variants … things would become clearer,” Castrucci says. “We haven’t made those investments.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUYBDm"&gt;Prickett says she’s waiting for the US to scale up that monitoring and testing capacity before she’ll feel comfortable with total normality. “The best way to get a hold of variants is to do early observation, and we need a bit more infrastructure here in the US and globally,” she says. The Biden administration has committed nearly $200 million to expanding that capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85avsZ"&gt;Weissenbach says variants just underscore the need for countries to reach herd immunity. “It’s like a wildfire in California,” he says. “They’re going to continue to crop up. We’re just trying to put a squash on it.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PvtnMcKEOFWy6blkfEdIYP-wL84=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425447/vrg_illo_4510_trafficSign.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O2CkKH"&gt;Bottom line: what are we waiting for?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TEInwd"&gt;After getting such a wide variety of answers to so many of my questions, I am left hopeful but also frustrated. How should laypeople like me navigate our lives post-vaccine when even medical experts disagree?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9rNhW"&gt;While it may seem tempting to draw the conclusion that this all comes down to a value judgment — you should weigh your risk tolerance against how much you value your wedding or vacation and make your own decision — that doesn’t sit right with me. Our risk is our business, sure, but we’re also asked to restrict our behavior to keep other people safe. And I’ll be brutally honest: I miss live entertainment, traveling, and even indoor dining enough that if I really believed that my post-vaccine decisions came down solely to my own risk-reward calculus, I’d probably drop all pre-vaccine restrictions as soon as I was two weeks out from that last shot. That’s a decision I think every expert in this article would agree is the wrong one because there’s an element of responsibility in the equation as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6CdlB"&gt;Some folks will certainly disregard all public health guidelines and start globetrotting immediately after their second shot. Others may swear off concerts for the rest of their lives. But many people (myself included) feel an obligation not to contribute to spread but would also benefit from knowing there’s an end in sight — knowing that there’s a time coming when the risk of spread will be low enough that we can go back to our favorite pre-pandemic joys with science on our side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egkCRD"&gt;So here’s my takeaway, for what it’s worth. Experts across disciplines have conflicting advice. As vaccination rates rise, we’ll likely see some authorities relax their demands, while others continue to urge caution. Governors will allow things to open, and people on Twitter will urge you not to go. It’s going to be a confusing time, and different areas will move at different paces. But for the riskiest indoor activities, there’s a tentative finish line in sight: we’re waiting for a large majority of our communities to be fully vaccinated, and for cases and hospitalizations to decline. Here’s my mental finish line: with the caveat that variants and other circumstances could change the equation, and that precautions should be eased carefully rather than thrown to the winds, 70 to 80 percent is the rough threshold I’m watching for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCDPlz"&gt;To gut check this conclusion I turned to Ben Bates, a professor at Ohio University who studies health communication and messaging. He’s not surprised that I’d had trouble finding straight answers. He emphasizes that communicating public-health guidance is challenging, and he thinks some of the expert messaging around COVID has underweighted the value of social gatherings. “The way science and public health work is you want to accumulate as much evidence as possible and test it over and over,” Bates says. “By nature these are very cautious, conservative people. I don’t think we’ll hear for a good long time ‘It is now absolutely safe to go out.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Doafe9"&gt;But Bates thinks the prospect of US communities hitting a high vaccination threshold, and seeing a subsequent decline in community transmission, is “quite realistic” and agrees that it’s a reasonable milestone to wait for that fairly balances risk aversion against the costs of restrictions and the high value of social gatherings. “Politicians, and business folks, and church leaders and so on will rightly say, ‘This is the kind of number you said would help protect us, and we’ve reached that number,” Bates says. “That’s when I think things will be pretty darn opened up.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Arcade finally got the boost it needed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GNbAP2eGnJ4kxD39kEkqb8vSygk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088559/opening2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VoZQ7K"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362388/apple-arcade-game-subscription-update-monument-valley-threes-iphone-ipad"&gt;Apple Arcade received its biggest update since launching back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. More than 30 titles were added to the subscription service, including much-anticipated games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362624/fantasian-release-date-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;Hironobu Sakaguchi’s roleplaying epic &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But while the quantity and quality of titles added were impressive, the most important part of the announcement was a change in direction. Among those big-name exclusives were a number of classics, ranging from &lt;em&gt;Monument Valley&lt;/em&gt; to chess to &lt;em&gt;Threes&lt;/em&gt;, that help round out the service. Apple Arcade has finally matured into something close to a Netflix for mobile games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="xRwD9v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10432584"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cKXwLy"&gt;Since the beginning, the pitch for Apple Arcade has been entirely centered on quality. While the App Store continues to devolve into a space dominated by free-to-play games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893691/apple-arcade-subscription-gaming-price-premium-games-zach-gage-noodlecake-snowman"&gt;Arcade provided an alternative&lt;/a&gt; where some of the most talented developers in the world could create great mobile games without having to worry about monetization. It launched alongside new games from the likes of Zach Gage and Ustwo, and it has continued to add titles on a near-weekly basis. Subscribers get all of those games for a flat monthly fee. It’s been a solid service — but it’s always felt like something was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91717B"&gt;When you sign up for something like Netflix, it might be because of one of the service’s big exclusive titles like &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;. But that won’t necessarily keep you hooked. Part of what makes Netflix so compelling is &lt;em&gt;everything else&lt;/em&gt;, from reality shows to classic sitcoms, that give you something to watch after you’re done with the big tent poles. Frequently, these aren’t traditional exclusives: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297077/the-office-friends-peacock-hbo-max-streaming-wars-disney-plus-star"&gt;think of how important &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; have become in the age of streaming TV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1gxGs"&gt;Those kinds of experiences are something Apple Arcade didn’t really have before this shift. Now, though, when you’re done playing a short narrative game like, say, &lt;em&gt;Creaks&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Assemble With Care&lt;/em&gt;, there’s a lot more to keep you invested with recent additions like &lt;em&gt;Good Sudoku&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Threes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EjgYix6_JhkfSAb-fHIf2BxEsqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425030/01_Welcome.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wonderbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kM6Tyn"&gt;Even better, while many of these games are available on other platforms or through the App Store, the Arcade versions are generally improved because they feature no form of in-app purchases or monetization. You won’t find puzzle or card games saddled with ads or have to open loot boxes in &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K21&lt;/em&gt;. There’s even &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Legends&lt;/em&gt; — essentially a character-collecting gacha game — which almost feels strange to play without being prodded to spend money. (This lack of microtransactions makes Arcade &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164414/apple-arcade-family-kids-crossy-road-butter-royale-loud-house-netflix"&gt;a very family-friendly service&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ayy0Rw"&gt;It’s also important to note that this change in strategy is additive. Apple has introduced two new categories to Arcade — one for older App Store hits, another for classic games like chess or solitaire — but it’s still releasing those big exclusive titles. In addition to &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;, last week’s update included &lt;em&gt;Wonderbox&lt;/em&gt; (think &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; for younger players), &lt;em&gt;World of Demons&lt;/em&gt; (the latest action game from PlatinumGames, the team behind &lt;em&gt;Nier: Automata&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bayonetta&lt;/em&gt;), and &lt;em&gt;Taiko no Tatsujin: Pop Tap Beat&lt;/em&gt; (a new entry in an excellent long-running rhythm game series). It’s a great and diverse lineup of experiences; sometimes scrolling through games on Arcade can feel like heading into an alternate reality version of what mobile gaming could have been if the race to free-to-play never happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAVEO8"&gt;Obviously, none of this is a guarantee of success. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308657/apple-arcade-canceling-games-subscription-service-engagement"&gt;if previous reports are to be believed&lt;/a&gt;, the shift appears to be a result of Arcade’s inability to keep subscribers hooked. While the subscription model is now dominant for the music, film, and television industries, it’s still relatively nascent for games. Outside of Xbox Game Pass, there hasn’t been a major success to date. Apple Arcade arguably faces a greater challenge being on mobile, where users have long been conditioned to expect games for free. The Netflix of games still feels inevitable, even if we’re not there yet — but Arcade feels closer than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>When will the global chip shortage end so you can finally buy a PS5?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ePU06M8Owg78ymj7yiaSrnZU9tY=/7x0:2293x1524/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088535/Qualcomm_Snapdragon_8c_Compute_Platform___Chip_Front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SCyevf"&gt;There aren’t enough chips to go around. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22363232/global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-pandemic-consoles-cpus-graphics-cards-cars"&gt;ongoing global semiconductor shortage&lt;/a&gt; means the difficulty of buying a PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or high-end GPU from companies like Nvidia or AMD could go on for months — if not for the rest of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ND4cPv"&gt;And it’s not just gaming gear: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;car companies like Ford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331766/gm-pickups-semiconductor-shortage-fuel-economy-emissions"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; are having problems with their truck production, Apple supplier Foxconn is warning of part delays that could last until 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325999/gogo-5g-network-delay-chip-shortage"&gt;5G rollouts are getting delayed&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335502/galaxy-note-2021-delay-canceled-samsung"&gt;Samsung is warning of a “serious imbalance”&lt;/a&gt; in the semiconductor industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBVgdD"&gt;There are a lot of reasons why this shortage is hitting now: trickled-down delays from COVID-19 shutdowns of factories last year, a surge in demand from customers stuck at home during the pandemic who want new laptops, along with more political issues like former President Trump’s trade war with China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1IhAXj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not that there aren’t enough chips, so much as there aren’t enough chipmakers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qo3y7G"&gt;But the issues lie even deeper than that: it’s not that there aren’t enough chips, so much as there aren’t enough chipmakers. “In the year 2000, we used to have 30 companies that made their own integrated circuits. Then, they discovered that it’s cheaper to outsource,” explains UCLA professor Christopher Tang in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9pyHU"&gt;As demand for products — and the increasingly computerized nature of even more mundane products like cars or smart home accessories — has spiked, there’s never been more need for chips. But at the same time, the industry has become smaller over the past several decades, as many technology companies, and even chipmakers like AMD, have switched to a fabless model where they outsource the actual manufacturing to other companies (like Samsung or TSMC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVD0BT"&gt;Solving &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; chip shortage, though, will likely just be a matter of time: eventually, demand will stop outpacing the limited supply, and things should go back to normal (and you’ll be able to just buy a PlayStation without jumping through online hoops and endless digital queues). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0RCsD"&gt;But preventing future shortages will probably require bigger changes to how the industry at large sources semiconductors to reflect our increasingly digital world. We’re already seeing some of them: &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tsmc-investment-plan/tsmc-to-invest-100-billion-over-3-years-to-meet-chip-demand-idUSKBN2BO3ZJ"&gt;TSMC has announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to invest $100 billion over the next three years to increase its capacity to meet rising demand. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;Intel plans to spend $20 billion&lt;/a&gt; on expanding its fabs in Arizona, as well as opening its doors to produce chips for other companies (similar to how TSMC and Samsung already operate), adding a new major supplier to the marketplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3j6lP"&gt;But those changes will take time and a commitment from the industry to actually build a healthier supply chain over the next several years and decades. And very little is likely to make it easier to buy that hard-to-find gadget in the next few months. But those changes could eventually make buying a hypothetical PlayStation 6 or Xbox successor easier down the line. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring’s new floodlight camera borrows features from its best doorbell</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1poXivw99Svt3d7UMkMSez-GisA=/651x0:7676x4683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088552/20210217_image_lifestyle_insitu_flcprogen1_daytime_rgb_crop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ring&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QjTD84"&gt;Ring has announced a new floodlight with an integrated camera called the Floodlight Cam Wired Pro. As its name suggests, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FCWRXQR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Floodlight Cam Wired Pro&lt;/a&gt; borrows several features from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22359973/ring-video-doorbell-pro-2-review"&gt;recently released Video Doorbell Pro 2&lt;/a&gt;, including 3D Motion Detection with radar and a top-down view of someone’s movements in front of the camera, which the company calls Bird’s Eye View. The Floodlight Cam Wired Pro, which I will refer to as the Floodlight Pro from here on out, is available for preorder in either white or black starting today, April 7th, for $249.99, with shipments starting on May 6th, 2021. Ring is also keeping &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Floodlight-Camera-Motion-Activated-Security/dp/B0722R3WV5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the original Floodlight Cam&lt;/a&gt; in the lineup at a new $199.99 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vz4mN5"&gt;Like the first Floodlight Cam, the Floodlight Pro is a motion-activated, 2,000-lumen LED floodlight with a camera mounted between its two articulating lights. It has a 110dB siren, supports both 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi, records 1080p HDR video with color night vision, and has improved microphones and a speaker for better two-way audio communication. The new 3D Motion Detection uses a radar sensor to track movement across a certain threshold that you define in Ring’s app, which is then presented as an aerial map in the recorded video clip. The Floodlight Pro is hardwired and can be mounted on a standard round outdoor junction box. Given its name, I wouldn’t be surprised if Ring has a wireless version in the works, but the company isn’t announcing anything on that front right now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HUfQKmK8w5_E6ftzw6x_IPVyuFw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425786/20210217_image_packaging_lifestyle_insitu_flcprogen1_blk_nighttime_rgb_crop.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Floodlight Cam Wired Pro is available in either white or black color options&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;aside id="aWxXp0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 review: Ring’s best doorbell yet","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22359973/ring-video-doorbell-pro-2-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mcQFuQ"&gt;In addition, Ring is announcing the new &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B08JNR77QY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$199.99 Video Doorbell 4&lt;/a&gt;, which is the latest in its mainstream line of video doorbells that can be used in a standard wired installation or run off a battery. The new model upgrades the black and white pre-roll video that debuted on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21174876/amazon-ring-new-video-doorbell-3-plus-chime-pro-pre-roll"&gt;last year’s Video Doorbell 3&lt;/a&gt; to full color, allowing you to see four seconds of motion in color before the doorbell is pressed. It also has a new Quick Replies feature that lets you have the doorbell automatically respond to visitors when you aren’t home or otherwise don’t want to be disturbed. You can use the Doorbell 4 with either 2.4GHz or 5GHz networks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5lLtyqqtf6A2tsDilYywCV88Pjo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425791/ring_video_doorbell_4_intro_tablet_696x522_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Video Doorbell 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cb0kje"&gt;The Video Doorbell 4 records up to 1080p video, but it lacks the square aspect ratio that I found so useful in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22359973/ring-video-doorbell-pro-2-review"&gt;my review of the Video Doorbell Pro 2&lt;/a&gt;, instead sticking with the traditional wide 16:9 field of view. The 4 also doesn’t have the Pro 2’s more advanced Alexa integration to answer the door — though, based on my testing, I don’t think you’ll miss much there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cz00nw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ELf1ARbITMY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vALnzy"&gt;Ring says the Video Doorbell 3 and Video Doorbell 3 Plus will remain available, though I’m not sure why you’d buy those when the 4 is out and costs either the same or less. The Video Doorbell 4 is available for preorder starting today and will be shipping starting on April 28th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X42aYe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s Mother’s Day Gift Guide 2021</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j6ndHY"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ethics-statement"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;ethics statement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouo3hr"&gt;It’s been a very hard year for us all — but especially for moms, who have had to deal with not only the worry about the pandemic itself, but its effect on their work schedules, their kids’ schooling and socialization, and all of the other issues that have come up over the past year. So for Mother’s Day this year, it could be a good idea to give mom a gift that will allow her to relax, if only for a few hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRBC5Q"&gt;We’ve put together a list of about 30 possible gifts that might give your mom — or you — a short vacation from stress. Have a look, and see if any of these work for you or at least give you some ideas of the ways that you, your family, and your friends can take a break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="NZJH6Z"&gt;These are the best wireless earbuds to get for music, podcasts, and calls, especially if mom operates in the Apple ecosystem. They’ve got great sound and are easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="BkLDmx"&gt;Wireless earpods that offer pleasing bass-heavy sound, reliable performance, and can connect with two devices — like a phone and laptop — at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="qpAvBg"&gt;Knowing you can find your keys can remove a major source of tension. Tile, the best-known tracking device, has released a collection of limited edition trackers that are decorated with designs with names like Watercolor Dream and Nightbloom, making them both practical and pretty gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XrCQA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetileapp.com%2Fen-us%2Flimited-edition-tiles&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22358371%2Fmothers-day-gifts-ideas-best-mom-tech-gadgets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$63 at TILE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="10gheL"&gt;Streaming video subscription&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zwidEM"&gt;One way to relax is by watching a great film or TV series, and several streaming services offer gift subscriptions. You can buy gift cards from Hulu and Netflix that can be exchanged for subs. And if mom is a cinephile, you can get her a year’s subscription to the Criterion Channel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="CZx75b"&gt;Who doesn’t like a good murder mystery? These games provide two puzzles in one: you can find clues to the murderer’s identity by solving the jigsaw puzzle. It’s a great way to spend a relaxing evening at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="eSLOjk"&gt;It can cheer you up to drink your morning coffee out of something unique and special, like this handmade mug, which holds 10 ounces of hot or cold liquid (12 ounces to the rim). Got an AeroPress? Don’t worry, this will fit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="PrdpvQ"&gt;Summer is coming, along with the chance to gather (safely) outdoors with friends and family, so a good cheese board is a great gift for those evening BBQs or parties.
