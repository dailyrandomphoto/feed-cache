    <title>The best video game subscription deals right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ve6XpF"&gt;Online game subscriptions are quite common in the gaming industry. Whether it's a subscription for an online service for multiplayer gaming or Netflix-like services that provide access to a massive library of games to play, gaming subscriptions provide good incentives and a lot of value for many gamers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAgFMs"&gt;While sales tend to stay steady throughout the year, these subscription services will hold promotions or discounts now and then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="75ZAPD"&gt;PlayStation subscription deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2CYtx"&gt;PlayStation Plus is arguably the most popular subscription service available on PlayStation consoles. Subscribing comes with a few perks outside of occasional discounts on the PlayStation Store and playing (most) games online. Each month, Sony provides a rotation of games you can play for free so long as you have an active subscription. If you own a PS5, you have access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PS Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a digital library of “generation-defining games” originally released for the PS4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouXbHO"&gt;A one-year subscription to PlayStation Plus normally retails for $60, but &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fpsn-subscriptions" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eneba&lt;/a&gt; tends to sell digital keys for US subscribers for less than half of its usual price. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals03312021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fplaystation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US players can grab a year for $27&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, it is $60 at places like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Membership-Digital/dp/B004RMK5QG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736465838929287529#donlotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fdigital%2Fsubscriptions%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-plus-1-year-membership%2F10084626.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. The service is also available for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Membership-Digital/dp/B017V6YVDC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$10 a month&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Membership-Digital/dp/B004RMK57U?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$25 for three months&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oQl0wf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0eA7sP"&gt;PlayStation Now is Sony’s cloud gaming service, allowing subscribers to stream games released on the PS2, PS3, and PS4 on their PS4, PS5, and PCs. The service tends to release new games into the library regularly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6jNP0"&gt;New users can do a seven-day free trial to get a feel for the service. Otherwise, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Now-Month-Subscription-Digital/dp/B00ZGG1HZA?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;monthly subscription&lt;/a&gt; costs $10, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736465889242682683" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months of the service&lt;/a&gt; in advance costs $25, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Now-Month-Subscription-Digital/dp/B019CYYSFC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a year-long subscription&lt;/a&gt; is $60. &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-now-12-month-subscription-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eneba has a one-year subscription available for $27&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lowest we have seen it go for, although Sony recently had a promotion where new subscribers could get one month free of charge. Alternatively, it is $60 at typical retailers, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Now-Month-Subscription-Digital/dp/B019CYYSFC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fdigital%2Fsubscriptions%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-now-1-year-subscription%2F11097720.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6LMQ2H"&gt;Xbox subscription deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LuSn3s"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is Microsoft’s flagship gaming subscription right now. Subscribing to this service nets you access to Game Pass Console and Game Pass PC. It bundles Xbox Live Gold, a premium online service. Additionally, Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud, is included with Game Pass Ultimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkcdOo"&gt;You can choose between &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a monthly plan for $15&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TFP7JFH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months&lt;/a&gt; for $45. If you are new to Game Pass, you can &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get your first month for $1&lt;/a&gt;, and it will convert to a $15 monthly charge unless you cancel. If you are not a new user of the service but want to renew your subscription for one month only, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-1-month-subscription-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-live-key-global" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eneba is selling a single month for $9&lt;/a&gt;. If you want three months but don’t want to be billed automatically, you can grab it for its usual price at places like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-one%2Fdigital%2Fsubscriptions%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-game-pass-3-month-ultimate-membership%2F11095751.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fmicrosoft-3-months%2Fp%2FN82E16832350399%3FDescription%3DXbox%2520Game%2520Pass%2520Ultimate%26cm_re%3DXbox_Game%2520Pass%2520Ultimate-_-32-350-399-_-Product" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kZo2dI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tchitw"&gt;Outside of Game Pass Ultimate, Microsoft has two separate versions of the service, including one specifically for Xbox consoles, which is probably the better choice for gamers who solely play on the Xbox and are not interested in the other incentives offered by the Ultimate Tier. Again, you can get &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this model for $1 if you are new&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, it’s &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$10 a month&lt;/a&gt;, $60 for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Membership-Digital/dp/B07BKXDW67?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;six months&lt;/a&gt;, or $112 for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Membership-Digital/dp/B07K782P3N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a full-year subscription&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5pUly"&gt;Another subscription available on consoles is &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-play?join-now=true"&gt;EA Play&lt;/a&gt;, which provides access to a slew of titles published by Electronic Arts. It’s available on a few platforms, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/EA-Access-12-Month-Subscription/dp/B014Q5UNH4/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=EA+Play&amp;amp;qid=1617219222&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5498-CUSA15087_00-PSEAA1M000000000"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt;, but the service is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493265/ea-play-xbox-game-pass-release-date-subscription"&gt;included with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; now. If you are subscribed to Game Pass Ultimate and buy an EA Play subscription, it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493265/ea-play-xbox-game-pass-release-date-subscription"&gt;convert to a certain number&lt;/a&gt; of days or months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lh5L5F"&gt;Nintendo subscription deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BVh6Q6"&gt;Nintendo Switch Online is a good service for owners of Nintendo’s hybrid console if they want to do the following: play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, or get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era. It comes in two forms: an individual membership, which provides access and perks through a single account, or a family membership, which provides access to the service via the same or multiple Switch consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haNwb6"&gt;You can get a seven-day free trial for both. Otherwise, an individual membership costs &lt;a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership"&gt;$4 for one month&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV61ZC9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$8 for three&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736473387011881465" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$20 for a full year&lt;/a&gt;. You can do it directly through Nintendo’s eShop on the Switch itself; retailers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736473387011881465#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/nintendo-switch-online-12-month-individual-membership?partner=voxmedia"&gt;Humble&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fdigital%2Fsubscriptions%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-online-12-month-individual-membership%2F176406.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-online-12-month-individual-membership-nintendo-switch-digital%2F-%2FA-78630258&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; also sell three-month or one-year subscriptions. The best deal currently is at Eneba, which is selling &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fnintendo-nintendo-switch-online-membership-3-months-eshop-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months for $7&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fnintendo-nintendo-switch-online-membership-12-months-eshop-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full year for $18&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jEWRuc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10422489"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JPkA27"&gt;Family Memberships only include a full-year subscription, which you can buy for $35 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736473860075502827#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership"&gt;Nintendo eShop&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IcYUKQ"&gt;PC gaming subscription deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qoeGMy"&gt;Xbox Game Pass for PC is available as a standalone service for those with a gaming PC who do not want all of the perks available with Game Pass Ultimate. Like the console version, Game Pass PC is available for $10 a month or $1 for your first month if you are a new user. Typically, retailers sell the PC-only service for three months, which is normally priced at $30. Currently, Eneba has &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-1-month-microsoft-key-global" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one month available&lt;/a&gt; for $8 or &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-3-month-windows-10-store-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months&lt;/a&gt; for $23. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Game-Pass-For-PC-Microsoft-Windows-10-Digital-Download%2F116004075&amp;amp;subid1=VergeGamingSubscriptionDeals03312021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; also has a deal on a three-month subscription for $24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HIGoSB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10422524"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hMlkSB"&gt;EA Play is also available on PC, but the prices vary depending on whether you subscribe on Steam or Origin. If you &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriptions/ea#SaleSection_77945"&gt;subscribe to Steam&lt;/a&gt;, it is the same price as consoles ($5 per month, $30 annually). &lt;a href="https://www.origin.com/usa/en-us/store/ea-play"&gt;Origin has EA Play Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which costs $15 monthly or $100 per year. The key biggest difference between EA Play and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Pro is the Pro version provides unlimited access to the publisher’s latest releases, similar to how Game Pass provides access to Xbox exclusives on the day those titles release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGmZnI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535105/ubisoft-plus-uplay-subscription-service-google-stadia-amazon-luna-pc-gaming"&gt;Ubisoft Plus&lt;/a&gt; (formally UPlay Plus), like EA Play, is a gaming subscription service with a library of games published and developed by Ubisoft. You also receive access to new releases at launch, over 100 games in the library, and Amazon’s Luna and Google’s Stadia cloud gaming services. You can subscribe to a monthly plan, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubi.com%2Fus%2Fubisoftplus%2F%3Flang%3Den_US&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22348957%2Fbest-video-game-subscription-playstation-plus-xbox-game-pass-nintendo-switch-online-deals-price-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which is $15 each month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Fayzzi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10422601"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nx27Nw"&gt;Originally released in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription?partner=VoxMedia"&gt;Humble Choice&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Humble Monthly) is a Humble Bundle gaming subscription. Each month, the company allows subscribers to choose from a curated list of 10 or more DRM-free games, which they can keep forever. Unlike some other services by the company, all of the games are revealed upfront. It comes in &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription/checkout?partner=VoxMedia"&gt;three tiers&lt;/a&gt;: Lite ($5 per month), Basic ($15 per month), and Premium ($20 per month). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DVTwM0"&gt;Mobile game subscription deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YZZ3M2"&gt;Released in 2019, Apple Arcade has its own dedicated tab located on the App Store. It is available on products that run iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS. It costs $5 per month, or you can get a year for just $50. All of the games available on the service are free of in-app purchases and pesky ads and the option to play these games offline. Subscribers can also share access with five other individuals via family sharing. New users can get a one-month free trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Kx7Bgn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10422551"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hFNJkG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fintl%2Fen_us%2Fabout%2Fplay-pass%2F#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Play Pass&lt;/a&gt; serves as a direct competitor to Apple Arcade and is available on Android devices. It features over 400 apps and games with no ads or in-app purchases. You can subscribe for $5 monthly or $30 annually. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="LXu7Mb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;’ huge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338782/among-us-airship-map-accounts-update-innersloth"&gt;Airship map&lt;/a&gt; finally arrived on Wednesday, offering new tasks for crewmates, new ways to get around, and new ways to plot against your friends as the imposter. I tried out the new level for an hour or so last night, and players who might have grown bored of the well-worn pathways of &lt;em&gt;Among Us’&lt;/em&gt; other levels will have a lot to play with on the airship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWJ5Rt"&gt;The airship is &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;’ biggest map yet, but to my surprise, I actually didn’t feel all that overwhelmed in my first matches. Developer InnerSloth did a great job making the different rooms visually distinct. The circular records room has four large bookshelves, for example, while the kitchen has a charming tile pattern and a pot simmering on a stove. The airship also adds a couple of new ways to get around, including ladders and a floating platform that moves you across a chasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLsZ6m"&gt;On some of &lt;em&gt;Among Us’&lt;/em&gt; other maps, I have trouble remembering exactly where I’ve been. But the notable traits of many of the airship’s locations made them easier to recall when pleading my innocence in player meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e8BGC9JF9FC8K0TCaNA5CqoxUUw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22413405/icAXDi.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: InnerSloth&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GNV6KZ"&gt;For crewmates, the airship has a lot of new tasks to keep you busy while avoiding the imposter. In my hour or so of playtime last night, I hammered a showerhead into place, shined a jewel, waved a phone around to get good reception, fast-forwarded a video cassette, dressed up a mannequin, and even unclogged a toilet. And if you’re a longtime &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; player, you’ll recognize some old standbys — rest assured that your finely honed card swiping skills will be put to good use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRJExb"&gt;If you’re an imposter, the airship is a playground, packed with large objects and distant corners you can use to strategically hide the bodies of your crewmates. And of course, imposters can still use vents to zip from room to room as well as turn off the ship’s lights, communications, and other functions to mess with other players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHY05w"&gt;At times, the airship can feel &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; big, though; at the default walking speed, it takes a long time to get from place to place. To help with that, InnerSloth lets you start from one of three rooms every time you jump into the map. But no matter where you start, it still takes a while to get to the opposite side of the ship. In games with fewer players, the sheer size of the airship also means you may not see a lot of your crewmates. It almost seems designed for the &lt;a href="https://innersloth.itch.io/among-us/devlog/237019/lets-go-airship-new-update-out-now"&gt;upcoming 15 player lobbies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Supreme Court says Facebook text alerts aren’t illegal robocalls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EpzRT5_9sXpVsN0ekZb9tdkACIg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69061404/akrales_180614_1777_0110.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LfXwgQ"&gt;The Supreme Court has unanimously decided that Facebook text message alerts don’t violate laws against unwanted auto-dialed calls. The court ruled that a lower court defined illegal “robocalls” too broadly and that the term should only apply to systems that generate lists of numbers and call them indiscriminately, not a system that simply stores numbers and automatically calls them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GBZ4Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320184/supreme-court-facebook-duguid-robocall-tcpa-class-action-lawsuit"&gt;The lawsuit involves text messages&lt;/a&gt; that notify Facebook users of an attempted login. Its plaintiff, Noah Duguid, sued after receiving unwanted, erroneous notifications despite not having a Facebook account. Duguid argued that Facebook was violating the 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). An appeals court agreed, but the Supreme Court interpreted the law’s definitions differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5i6Qy"&gt;Closely parsing the TCPA’s grammar, the court concluded that an illegal auto-dialing system “must use a random or sequential number generator,” and this definition “excludes equipment like Facebook’s login notification system, which does not use such technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9k4Rga"&gt;Facebook argued that the earlier court decision could have defined basic smartphone functions as illegal autodialers. The Supreme Court agreed. “Duguid’s interpretation of an autodialer would capture virtually all modern cell phones,” the opinion says. Although robocalls are a huge problem on American phone networks, it says “expanding the definition of an autodialer to encompass any equipment that merely stores and dials telephone numbers would take a chainsaw to these nuanced problems.” So it’s opting for a much more limited definition — both for Facebook and any similar future system.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung created a whole Hulu series that’s sponcon for the Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Galaxy S21 Ultra, in Phantom Black" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EINbVH77msO-2UZYvp72Hym-uvY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69061399/vpavic_210119_4377_0170.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u9ylel"&gt;Samsung wants you to know its new phone, the Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G, is good at capturing photos. Maybe you could outwardly tell from its five image sensors, including four on the back, that the company takes mobile photography seriously. But if not, you now have an entire Hulu series to watch in which the S21 Ultra 5G is the main character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ene3fx"&gt;The company announced today it’s created a branded Hulu show called &lt;em&gt;Exposure &lt;/em&gt;where up-and-coming photographers compete in challenges to be crowned “America’s best mobile photographer.” The show will debut on April 26th, and it entirely centers on the S21 Ultra 5G; it’s the only device contestants will use to capture their images. This is Samsung’s best attempt at showing off its phone in less of a commercial format — although, in reality, this show is an extended commercial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pn70uv"&gt;Branded content is nothing new for TV. But typically, these partnerships are more covert. Maybe the device someone uses is a specific phone that they mention aloud, or the hosts of a show drive a specific car that lingers on the screen for a second longer than expected. &lt;em&gt;Exposure&lt;/em&gt; is, instead, a full-out admittance from Samsung that it is so invested in making sure people know about its camera technology that it’s willing to spend money on an entire series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qrad81"&gt;For what it’s worth, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; reviewer Dieter Bohn said the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G’s cameras did live up to the hype when he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;reviewed the device in January&lt;/a&gt;. “The camera system on the Galaxy S21 Ultra is the best I’ve used on any Android phone and is extremely competitive with the iPhone 12 Pro Max,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVRxML"&gt;These &lt;em&gt;Exposure&lt;/em&gt; contestants will likely capture quality images. You just have to be okay with the fact that you’re watching content that Samsung approves and wants you to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UQgoH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan would take on the wreckage of drilling and mining</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Navajo Nation uranium mining clean-up" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/In7X64PQnpYhf5AtUr3yAnhERPM=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69061375/1194589435.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Signs warning of health risks are posted outside the gates of an abandoned uranium mine in the Red Water Pond Road community of the Navajo Nation on January 13th, 2020.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=editorial&amp;amp;photographer=The+Washington+Post" target="_blank"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;Contributor via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;But it will take more than the $16 billion Biden offered&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZRlUYK"&gt;In Pittsburgh this week, Joe Biden unveiled a new infrastructure plan that will serve as the centerpiece for his economic agenda. Spending $2 trillion over eight years, the sweeping plan includes a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359496/biden-american-jobs-package-broadband-semiconductors-electric-vehicles"&gt;wide range of measures&lt;/a&gt;, from building out electric vehicle charging stations to de-leading municipal water mains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAfbVs"&gt;As part of the plan, Biden wants to spend an “immediate up-front investment” of $16 billion to plug abandoned oil and gas wells and clean up old mines. He says that money will create “hundreds of thousands” of union jobs. It’s also supposed to stop planet-heating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22360189/gas-stove-methane-leaks-electric-climate-change"&gt;methane&lt;/a&gt; and other pollution from escaping wells and mines. “Many of these old wells and mines are located in rural communities that have suffered from years of disinvestment,” a fact sheet for the plan says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HA43p9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Left alone, those wells and mines pose dangers to the environment and to people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HQfY7p"&gt;Hazards from abandoned infrastructure are a serious and often ignored problem. Left alone, those wells and mines pose dangers to the environment and to people. They’ve also been a financial headache for states and federal agencies left with the enormous costs associated with safely retiring them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Pdaty"&gt;The money could cover some of the costs of remediating the oldest wells and mines, which were dug before companies were required to put aside money for what happens to the site at the end of its life. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Thousands Of Abandoned Wells Pose Pollution Risk In Pennsylvania" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4QnFDLNhSY2qodoI37eVFlhrbeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22413277/541872914.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oil and other pollutants run from an abandoned oil well on a property near the Allegany National Forest in Marienville, Pennsylvania, on June 7th, 2016. In Pennsylvania, the birthplace of the US oil industry, century-old abandoned oil wells have long been part of the landscape. Nobody gave much thought to it when many were left unplugged or filled haphazardly with dirt, lumber, and cannon balls that slipped or rotted away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5mKC7A"&gt;“Our infrastructure is crumbling,” Biden said during an address in Pittsburgh yesterday. “Put simply, these are investments we have to make.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4W7rS"&gt;$16 billion could go part of the way toward sweeping up the crumbs of neglected resource-extracting infrastructure. But experts and advocates say it’s only a first step toward fully reckoning with the toxic holes in our landscape left by abandoned wells and mines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRKju7"&gt;There are 500,000 abandoned mines in the US, according to the Bureau of Land Management. &lt;a href="http://duwaterlawreview.com/the-abandoned-mine-problem-who-should-bear-the-burden/"&gt;Before the 1970s&lt;/a&gt;, it wasn’t unusual or illegal for companies to simply walk away from mines when they were no longer profitable. Waste from those mines has polluted the surrounding soil, water, or air. Metals from these mines can leave behind highly acidic water, which puts fish and the people who eat those fish at risk. Dust from mines can also spread arsenic, lead, and even radioactive material, harming nearby communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHiTdW"&gt;Many of the companies responsible for creating these hazards have left governments with the tab to clean it all up. Between 2008 and 2017, federal agencies spent about &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-20-238.pdf"&gt;$287 million a year&lt;/a&gt; remediating and monitoring abandoned mines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Crs3m"&gt;Then there’s the even bigger problem of abandoned oil and gas wells: at least &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/assets/2020/06/22/document_ew_01.pdf"&gt;57,000 out-of-commission wells&lt;/a&gt; in the US are considered “orphans” because whoever operated them either can’t be identified or can’t afford to plug them. On top of that, there are even more “idle” wells that do have owners but haven’t been used in years and are in danger of becoming orphans. Altogether, there are over 2.1 million of these wells languishing in the US, according to an &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-04/documents/us-ghg-inventory-2020-main-text.pdf"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency estimate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BriHwk"&gt;Even if the wells are no longer in use, they can still do harm if not properly handled. If they’re not plugged or if the plug fails, the well can spew out oil, gas, and saltwater that might contaminate freshwater or soil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="XdfjPu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s like a ticking climate bomb.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KLM9vk"&gt;Unplugged wells also &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.0c04265#:~:text=Abandoned%20oil%20and%20gas%20wells%20are%20one%20of%20the%20most,methane%20emissions%20into%20the%20atmosphere.&amp;amp;text=Methane%20emission%20factors%20range%20from,average%20at%206.0%20g%2Fh."&gt;release methane&lt;/a&gt;, a potent greenhouse gas. Methane is far more powerful than carbon dioxide when it comes to trapping heat. The EPA estimates that orphan and idle wells are responsible for about &lt;a href="https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/research/report/green-stimulus-oil-and-gas-workers-considering-major-federal-effort-plug-orphaned-and-abandoned"&gt;280,000 metric tons&lt;/a&gt; of methane a year, which does about the same harm to the climate as 2.1 million cars do in a year. So plugging those wells would help shrink US greenhouse gas emissions.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Swn2Dp"&gt;“It’s like a ticking climate bomb,” says Ben Beachy, a director at Sierra Club. “It’s something that we’re gonna have to deal with one way or the other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46FJkE"&gt;The problem could get even worse in the future. If Biden follows through with his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324575/joe-biden-jobs-climate-change-plan-energy-elections"&gt;campaign goal&lt;/a&gt; of putting the US on track to transition to 100 percent clean energy by 2050, someone will eventually have to foot the bill for plugging up 3.8 million open wells — including active ones — in the US. That’ll add up to $280 billion, according to Greg Rogers, who co-authored a &lt;a href="https://carbontracker.org/reports/its-closing-time/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on abandoned wells for the financial think tank Carbon Tracker. Taking that into consideration, Biden’s initial $16 billion offer for orphan wells is a drop in the bucket.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnfSZf"&gt;States are already losing a lot of money because of abandoned wells. Even though there are now regulations that require companies to set aside money to pay for decommissioning a well, companies can get away with putting up very little money in a lot of states. In Ohio, a company can put up a $15,000 &lt;a href="https://ohiodnr.gov/wps/portal/gov/odnr/buy-and-apply/regulatory-permits/oil-and-gas-permits/bonding-insurance"&gt;“blanket” bond&lt;/a&gt; to cover an unlimited number of wells. It’s a paltry sum considering the average cost of plugging a single well in the state in 2019 was &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063430105"&gt;$100,000&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PZGGOx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;States are already losing a lot of money because of abandoned wells&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7nr7M1"&gt;“States accept bonds which basically are equal to pennies on the dollar of the cost to actually do this end-of-life work [to plug wells],” says Rogers. “It’s really a subsidy from the state governments to the oil and gas industry.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVvkcE"&gt;The economics of well remediation are daunting, and the current lack of funding could &lt;a href="https://grist.org/energy/plugging-abandoned-oil-wells-carbon-offsets/"&gt;leave wells dangerously unplugged&lt;/a&gt; — particularly after state budgets took a hit from the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zPO7U"&gt;The average cost of safely plugging an older well falls somewhere between $40,000 to $50,000. But for newer wells that are typically deeper, the cost can reach $300,000, according to Rogers’ report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2VEEWZ"&gt;If Biden is going to send federal money to states to help them cover those costs, Rogers says he needs to attach strings that will force companies to take greater responsibility for cleaning up after themselves. That might include prioritizing funding states that set higher bonds for extractive companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="EWpvEn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Don’t set the conditions for this problem to continue to repeat itself.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cSvgHu"&gt;“Don’t set the conditions for this problem to continue to repeat itself,” says Rogers. “Increase the bonding amount. Get rid of blanket bonds.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlLfpb"&gt;Rogers and Beachy are optimistic that all that spending will lead to more jobs, especially for people who previously worked in oil and gas fields or mines. “We have got to make sure that we are proactively, creating good family sustaining jobs in the same communities where workers are facing energy transition,” says Beachy, who’s from West Virginia, where the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/coal-miners-coronavirus-job-losses"&gt;decline of coal&lt;/a&gt; has already &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/215786/coal-mining-employment-in-west-virginia/"&gt;cost jobs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tj6kJ3"&gt;Cleaning up the mess of the past is at the core of Biden’s overall infrastructure plan, which would be funded by an increase in corporate taxes. The plan also allocates money to replace all of the nation’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18250801/lead-contamination-flint-michigan-water-testing"&gt;lead pipes&lt;/a&gt;, which have poisoned children — particularly in communities of color like &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/2/15/10991626/flint-water-crisis"&gt;Flint, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. It also invests in speeding the transition to electric vehicles and a clean energy grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bf2sqB"&gt;But environmental advocates like Beachy are pushing for even more ambitious plans. Sierra Club is part of a network of progressive organizations that have endorsed an infrastructure and pandemic recovery agenda called the “&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/infrastructure-bill-biden-administration-progressive-democrats_n_605e518ec5b6531eed04e2a6"&gt;THRIVE Act&lt;/a&gt;” that would spend $10 trillion over the next decade. Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) is expected to introduce it as a bill in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMrkSO"&gt;Democrats will face an uphill battle in Congress to turn any infrastructure plan into actual policies. Whether they come to fruition or not, someone will pay for the costs that come with abandoned wells and mines — whether those costs come from cleaning the mess up or living with the environmental consequences. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MSI announces two new convertible business laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The MSI Summit E13 Flip Evo and E16 Flip on a black and white marble background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zS2drs9ovyim5NynOJFLWKxGyg4=/86x0:1954x1245/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69061243/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: MSI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GQzSfM"&gt;MSI, a company best known for bold and flashy gaming laptops, has announced two additions to its new Summit Series business line. The Summit E13 Flip Evo and Summit E16 Flip are convertible notebooks powered by Intel’s Tiger Lake processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xeEcO8"&gt;The big news is that the new Flips come with 16:10 displays. MSI says the new aspect ratio will provide 10 percent more visible screen space than a similarly sized 16:9 screen. That’s a good sign for business users — it means less scrolling and more room to multitask. Both models are also compatible with MSI’s proprietary MPP 2.0 stylus (the MSI pen), which the company says has 4,096 pressure levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1P9js"&gt;Like the rest of the Summit Series, the two models include a number of features designed for remote meetings. These include a “noise-reduction” camera (with a physical shutter as well as a keyboard kill switch), and audio noise cancellation. MSI claims the notebooks will get 20 hours of battery life, which would certainly be a step up from the five-hour lifespan I got out of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22327287/msi-summit-series-b15-review-chassis-build-keyboard-speakers"&gt;Summit B15&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user draws on the MSI Summit E26 in reverse-clamshell mode with a stylus. The screen displays a chart." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sHo2liz8LD2rgkS8sbApSjzwjDw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22413346/unnamed__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: MSI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Summit E16 is stylus-compatible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pPIR02"&gt;The E13 Flip Evo is, as its name implies, certified through Intel’s Evo program. This means it’s met Intel’s various standards for top-performing Tiger Lake laptops, including responsive performance, quick boot time, all-day battery life, and other modern amenities like Thunderbolt 4 and Wi-Fi 6. MSI claims it “performs 10% higher than other 2-in-1 laptops of the same tier.” (I’ll have to test that claim for myself when I get my hands on a unit, of course.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOU7VK"&gt;The E16 Flip looks to be more of a workstation device. MSI says it will include “the latest Nvidia graphics card” to lend a hand with content-creation tasks. It also comes with four microphones for conference calls. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ygfUcg9GZKh1NAzcS7X_PiAsNnE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22413351/unnamed.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: MSI&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ml80vK"&gt;Models support Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2, as well as PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukkvN9"&gt;Pricing and availability are still to be announced. The current Summit E13 Flip costs &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?prodsku=6454599&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsummit-e13-flip-13-4-2in1-touch-laptop-i7-1185g7-irisxe-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-win10-with-msi-pen-ink-black%2F6454599.p%3FskuId%3D6454599&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,599.99&lt;/a&gt;, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see these two models somewhere above that range.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Aptera and its solar car are back from the dead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mY4tg15gOqEyx_KK5tXWW-0huhk=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69061115/Aperta_3x2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;And so is the government program that killed it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="R1bJMk"&gt;A decade ago, a small electric vehicle startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/12/3/2607224/aptera-motors-closes-its-doors-without-producing-its-space-age"&gt;died&lt;/a&gt;. But now it’s back from the dead — and so is the government program that helped kill it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcLOLf"&gt;This zombie company, called Aptera, is once again trying to sell people on a curious idea: an ultra-efficient three-wheeled electric vehicle powered, in part, by solar panels. And like a bad sequel, one of the villains from the first go-round is back, too: the Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program. The same program that famously saved Tesla from an early collapse also helped deliver the death blow to Aptera and a number of other startups along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qj0SH0"&gt;Aptera is not the only would-be EV startup that died seeking money from the government in a post-recession world. In fact, one of them — Fisker Automotive — got the money and still keeled over. But Aptera is the only one so far to walk among us once again. It even has its original founders at the helm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgQAdz"&gt;Now, this undead company finds itself in a much different world, one brimming with optimism — and cold hard cash — for electric vehicle startups. But one thing’s the same: the office that ran the DOE’s loan programs is back. And Aptera is ready for another shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IoTVd-NWHBGj0RdR8t-vnzfSJn8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410850/aptera.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="VBeMH9"&gt;Steve Fambro and Chris Anthony founded Aptera in 2006, two years before Tesla started selling its first electric car, the Roadster. The pair came up with an idealistic vision of what one should be: something light, ultra-efficient, and futuristic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUXpmm"&gt;It was the kind of optimistic idea that was popular at the time in the tech industry. Their car was electric, and therefore made no emissions. The solar panels on top made it possible to gather electricity from the sun to power the climate system. It was relatively lightweight and sported just three wheels, meaning it took up no more space than it needed to — practically sacrilege in a pre-recession world full of SUVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TPlKfS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The original Aptera was dismissed by Detroit, but it found support in Silicon Valley&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DnwK3L"&gt;There was also what seemed like a great opportunity. General Motors had architected the most serious electric vehicle to date, the EV1. It not only abandoned the program in favor of its gas-guzzlers, but it literally crushed the EVs it took back from owners. Silicon Valley started training its attention on the transportation industry as a place that was ripe for disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1V9vp"&gt;A few other early EV startups shared this romantic view of EVs back then, sparking similarly strange designs. But even among its peers, Aptera’s EV stood out. NBC called it “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna21883886"&gt;Jetson-like&lt;/a&gt;.” General Motors &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125288146359206959"&gt;called it a “novelty vehicle.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3t8CJX"&gt;While Detroit dismissed it, Aptera won over parts of Silicon Valley anyway. Google, for instance, backed it &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2008/07/23/googleorg-gives-electric-cars-a-push-with-investments-in-aptera-and-actacell/"&gt;through its philanthropic arm&lt;/a&gt; to the tune of a few million dollars. So did tech incubator Idealab. Part of Aptera’s plan relied on its vehicle being classed as a motorcycle to keep costs down — exactly the kind of regulatory arbitrage that Silicon Valley loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original Aptera prototype in 2007.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ql8UMx"&gt;All this attention was enough to help Aptera convince around 4,000 people to put down $500 deposits &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-01-23-aptera-rolls-out-first-pre-production-vehicle-promises-shipment.html"&gt;by the end of 2008&lt;/a&gt;. But the closer Aptera’s vehicle got to the road, the further the company strayed from that original vision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2mjQXh"&gt;The new board of directors paid “a ridiculous amount of money” to recruit a new executive team, Anthony told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and eventually picked a new CEO from Detroit named Paul Wilbur in September 2008. Fambro took a reduced role as the company’s CTO as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmMU1w"&gt;In December, just after he took over, the Department of Energy &lt;a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1070490_aptera-collapse-how-why-it-happened-a-complete-chronology"&gt;rejected Aptera’s application for the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan program&lt;/a&gt;. Electric vehicles were still viewed more as science experiments than proven products, so the program seemed like one of the safest bets a small startup like Aptera could make when it came to funding. The same program eventually gave out heaps of cash to Tesla, Fisker Automotive, and even Ford. But the DOE wasn’t evaluating three-wheelers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CO2Pr1"&gt;Wilbur decided to redesign Aptera’s vehicle to adhere to the same standards for passenger cars, in hopes of convincing the incoming Obama administration to reconsider the rejection. On top of the redesign, he wanted to create a hybrid variant and a new, more traditional product to be designed as well: a car with four wheels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mx59xL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The closer the vehicle got to the road, the further it strayed from the vision&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DLeHve"&gt;The DOE agreed to consider three-wheelers for the ATVM program in October 2009. At that point, Aptera was simultaneously redesigning its main vehicle, developing a four-wheeled option, and slogging through the application process for the ATVM loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tl0wNa"&gt;Aptera’s efforts to raise outside money stalled in 2010. By that point, Wilbur had essentially bet the entire company on the support of the government. The ATVM program was its last hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYNk6e"&gt;He nearly hit it big. Aptera got a commitment from the DOE for $150 million in 2011 — on the condition that the startup raise $80 million in the private markets. Wilbur and his team wore a path in the asphalt on Sand Hill Road. But the private funding scene was dry for automotive startups, especially with giants like General Motors having gone bankrupt. Aptera folded at the end of 2011 and sold off all its assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzX93Y"&gt;Fambro and Anthony were already gone. Reports at the time &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/02/steve-fambro-leaves-aptera/"&gt;said they were forced out by the board&lt;/a&gt;, though Anthony maintains he left the company to start battery company Flux Power in 2009. Fambro was officially done in early 2010, and Anthony admits now he “got frustrated much quicker than Steve did.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A revamped version of Aptera’s vehicle after Paul Wilbur took over as CEO in 2008.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="92dcxV"&gt;“We had a production-intent vehicle ready. And unfortunately, the production plans hinged on the Department of Energy loan,” Anthony recalls. “Steve and I had left Aptera, and the new management team did not get that Department of Energy loan, so they really had no path forward. The economy was crumbling and people just weren’t willing to put money into esoteric ideas.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YzAilS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ATVM program became a “poison pill”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lFfSHm"&gt;One former Aptera employee, who was granted anonymity to speak freely about the company’s collapse, said the loan was a “poison pill” for the startup. “The DOE loans were the worst thing to happen to the EV industry in the 2009-2010 time period,” they said. “It became the only litmus test for whether you were a viable electric vehicle company.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHGx5X"&gt;Aptera wasn’t alone — even Anthony’s next company took a hit. Flux Power was developing batteries to be used in other vehicles, but without access to funding, many of them died out. “The ATVM loan program screwed Flux [Power] as well,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7B1Uj"&gt;The Department of Energy handed out a life-saving loan to Tesla, as well as billions of dollars to major automakers like Ford and Nissan. But when startups like Fisker Automotive and solar company Solyndra defaulted on theirs, the program stalled. It hasn’t given out any new money since, despite there being more than $40 billion already appropriated. The ATVM program alone accounts &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/products-services/advanced-technology-vehicles-manufacturing-loan-program"&gt;for a $17.7 billion slice&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="He0ISE"&gt;“I think it’s sad that $17 billion are collecting dust,” Anthony says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3HWrT0hwzNL1Vs2sa3jy_ygSX-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410915/d77790_64495187b92c4b8f8ac8116a21c52e2a_mv2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KE2gYd"&gt;“After the end of the first Aptera, I tried to just jettison it from my mind,” Fambro explained on a Zoom call in late December. Just a few weeks after leaving Aptera in 2010, Fambro said he already had a term sheet for his next company. He spent the next few years developing advanced hydroponic farms and running a clean tech fund for the royal family in Abu Dhabi but stayed close with Anthony. “Steve and I had always had it in the back of our minds that Aptera would be great to resurrect,” Anthony says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrLwPK"&gt;In the meantime, Aptera was being stripped for parts. The startup’s investors — Idealab, energy company NRG, Google, and others — sold Aptera’s intellectual property in December 2011. Aptera also auctioned off all of its other &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111208006176/en/Assets-of-Concept-Electric-Vehicle-Manufacturer-Aptera-Motors-to-Be-Auctioned-on-December-20-21-2011"&gt;assets&lt;/a&gt; in a liquidation sale, like &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111208006176/en/Assets-of-Concept-Electric-Vehicle-Manufacturer-Aptera-Motors-to-Be-Auctioned-on-December-20-21-2011"&gt;power tools, computer towers, and even the signs on the Carlsbad, California headquarters&lt;/a&gt;. Chinese automaker Zhejiang Jonway won the bidding war for the startup’s vehicles, equipment and tooling, and IP, and so those went to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcVdpK"&gt;Zhejiang Jonway eventually tried in 2013 to spin out &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2013/06/11/zaptera-says-aptera-usa-will-push-on-with-gas-electric-versions/"&gt;another independent company called Aptera USA&lt;/a&gt; that would make gas versions of the car in the US. It’s unclear if a new Aptera USA was ever even incorporated after Zhejiang Jonway’s announcement. The Chinese company never even filed to take over Aptera’s IP with the US Patent and Trademark Office, according to the government database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tv4X1P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Chinese company that bought the remains of the first Aptera never did much with them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UFpOfS"&gt;This left Anthony and Fambro room to resurrect their original vision. “There didn’t seem to be any real hurdles in restarting the business just because it had laid fallow for so long,” Anthony says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxJGdp"&gt;The pair decided to reanimate Aptera in 2019. Electric vehicles were no longer science fair ideas. Tesla was in the middle of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113987/tesla-q4-2019-earnings-results-profit-revenue-model-3"&gt;then-record year&lt;/a&gt; ahead of becoming the most valuable automaker on the planet, and the financial markets began throwing billions of dollars at companies working on electric vehicles. Other startups had even taken up Aptera’s original mission of trying to make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18744078/lightyear-one-solar-powered-electric-car-release-date-price-range-features"&gt;a solar-powered commercial EV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNAf1O"&gt;This time around, though, the new Aptera wants to take the idea much further, as it claims the solar panels on the vehicle can provide as much as 45 miles of range per day — blowing way past simply powering the air conditioning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qw641c"&gt;There are more than three square meters of photovoltaic cells on the roof that are nearly twice as efficient as the ones the original Aptera used, Anthony says. That capability, paired with a 100kWh battery pack and a shape that produces extremely low amounts of aerodynamic drag, could make it so that some owners never have to plug the new vehicle in to charge, according to Aptera. The startup refers to the car as having a 1,000-mile range and, in turn, refers to it as the “&lt;a href="https://wefunder.com/aptera"&gt;world’s first never-charge solar vehicle&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/teDuaCBhrRRySSY8AJp9jIsQUQ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410931/d77790_ecebc023f1c0469da186968a8353c67a_mv2.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7MQc3s"&gt;These are staggering claims for any company, let alone a startup. When pressed, Anthony admits Aptera is painting a rosy picture, even for those lucky enough to bask in the Southern California sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WMRQot"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new Aptera is making some bold claims&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F47jgb"&gt;“If you have a job somewhere that has an open parking lot, and you can park [the vehicle] out in the middle of that parking lot, and get lots of sun, [you’ll be] very happy with how much energy you created that day,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zwJAJX"&gt;The new Aptera vehicle features more modern trimmings, too. There’s a large Tesla-style touchscreen on the dashboard. It will use in-wheel motors to save space and weight. It will have an attractive price, between $26,000 at the low end and closer to $50,000 at the high end — another big promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHXALd"&gt;Anthony and Fambro didn’t just tweak the technology, though. They’ve also changed how they are financing their effort. They initially turned to a crowdfunding site known as &lt;a href="https://wefunder.com/aptera"&gt;WeFunder&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, which lets people contribute to the company in exchange for small equity stakes. Aptera raised some $200,000 in 2019 on WeFunder and roughly doubled that figure in 2020. Then, they mixed in some private funding and &lt;a href="https://www.aptera.us/post/aptera-closes-4m-series-a-round-and-takes-a-quarter-billion-in-orders"&gt;closed a $4 million Series A funding round in early 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCGSQw"&gt;In March, Aptera filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1786471/000110465921033701/tm218422d1_partiiandiii.htm"&gt;raise another $50 million&lt;/a&gt;, again with a public-private mix. But this time, retail investors will have to go through Aptera’s website; the raise won’t be done on a crowdfunding platform. “We’re hoping that we can raise $20 million as quick as possible so we can get the wheels spinning to get into production,” Anthony says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRZxBR"&gt;More than anything, this hybrid approach to funding the new Aptera is about one thing: Anthony and Fambro want to hold on to power this time. “It’s very crucial for Steve and I to make sure we retain control of the company so we can build it sensibly,” Anthony says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RwKBMW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Biden’s new energy secretary immediately revived the DOE loan program&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KLzsZ4"&gt;As Aptera started talking about its funding plans more publicly, though, there was a series of announcements from the incoming Biden administration. Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, who helped broker the recession-era auto industry bailout, was tapped to run the Department of Energy. And one of her first moves was to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/ceraweek-usa-granholm/ceraweek-u-s-energy-secretary-ready-to-loan-40-bln-to-boost-clean-energy-idUSL2N2L11U5"&gt;revive the loan programs office&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96FNuw"&gt;The DOE’s loan programs were “a bit moribund over the past few years,” she &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/jennifer-granholm-interviews-energy-loans-5ceef97a73fc04fe3cca75bf84e91327"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s “an amazing tool.″ Granholm said she will work to streamline the process, too, so that it’s easier for companies to apply than it was back when Aptera took its first shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHm7wD"&gt;Fambro and Anthony were expecting something like this; in fact, they had already hired a lobbyist and spent tens of thousands of dollars. Anthony says they’re pursuing a loan in the $100 million to $150 million range, but that it won’t be necessary in the near term. Anthony says they’d most likely use the money to make a four-wheeled Aptera vehicle — something that’s also back in the company’s sights after the trouble it caused a decade ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjzDzH"&gt;The priorities may have shifted, but this is still a lot to take on for a startup. Aptera’s founders have a weird, exciting solar-powered three-wheeler; they’re thinking about designing a normal car; and they’re once again chasing federal funding. At least the landscape has totally changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="so5yEd"&gt;“I’m stoked. Honestly, I think the first time around for us was it was almost like the cosmos was training us for this time around,” Fambro said. “We’re stronger. We’re better prepared. We’ve got loads of experience under our belt, you know, globally. And so I think we’re far more ready for it now than we were the first time around.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Casio announces first Wear OS smartwatch in iconic G-Shock lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zWvMaQFaBxOGXMqSWEL1udBtu5w=/0x0:1349x899/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69060838/HIz0xsGodYbCgfDTr0wQnBUPKg9xx4TJHrFkK9c9.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Casio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n3nGLi"&gt;Casio has announced the first Wear OS smartwatch in its long-running G-Shock lineup: the &lt;a href="https://world.g-shock.com/asia-mea/en/products/g-squad/gsw-h1000/"&gt;GSW-H1000&lt;/a&gt;. The watch will retail for $699 in the US or £599 in the UK, and it will be available in red, blue, or black. With shock resistance and water resistance up to a depth of 200 meters, Casio says the GSW-H1000 is a fitness-focused wearable designed for everything from surfing to snowboarding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJWpVl"&gt;The watchmaker has been releasing devices using Google’s smartwatch OS since 2016, when it released the Android Wear-powered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/29/11525360/casio-smart-outdoor-watch-fs10-android-wear-review"&gt;Casio Smart Outdoor Watch&lt;/a&gt;. But this is the first time Google’s software has appeared on a G-Shock watch. The G-Shock lineup dates back to the 1980s, and the watches have a reputation for being some of the hardest-wearing around. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1E4uO4snjIFs7Hnzn5FA2_pe-e4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22413325/qwpwTYcRiQLJMBe09VsOrPSSxeVnnuUPnpPOoyVA.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Casio&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Its dual-layer display includes one monochrome and one color panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o4WFNn"&gt;The GSW-H1000 comes with many of the features expected on a fitness-focused smartwatch. There’s an optical heart rate sensor, and Casio’s built-in software supports 15 activities and 24 indoor workout options. The watch supports GPS and has a built-in compass, altitude sensor, accelerometer, and gyrometer. Wear OS means there’s Google Assistant and Google Fit support, and you can download apps from Google Play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOKBOe"&gt;In terms of hardware, the watch has a 1.2-inch 360 x 360 dual-layer display that combines a monochrome always-on LCD display with a color LCD panel. Battery life is rated at around one and a half days if you’re using the color display, extending to up to a month if you only use the watch for timekeeping and sensors. A full charge takes around three hours, according to Casio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgKXW0"&gt;With rumors of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22351979/apple-watch-rugged-extreme-sports-rumor-bloomberg"&gt;extreme sport-focused Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; on the horizon, Casio and other rugged smartwatch manufacturers could soon be facing a lot more competition. But on paper at least, the GSW-H1000 looks like it could be up to the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dl8QOG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6SaA3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MSCHF will not ship its 666th pair of Satan Shoes after Nike lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MSCHF / Lil Nas X “Satan Shoes”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DSo7qWDud-cy0T0HpvOOTyVS1qM=/64x0:1984x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69060672/Exbfpl2WgAAQkl8_resized.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: MSCHF&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zW2fyM"&gt;Internet collective MSCHF says it’s not infringing on Nike’s trademark with a pair of exclusive, blood-infused “Satan Shoes,” setting the stage for a bigger legal battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sZFex"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357225/nike-sues-lil-nas-x-unauthorized-satan-shoes-mschf"&gt;filing a lawsuit earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, Nike sought a &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nyed.461880/gov.uscourts.nyed.461880.7.0.pdf"&gt;temporary restraining order&lt;/a&gt; to bar MSCHF from fulfilling any orders of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/28/style/nike-satan-shoes-lil-Nas-x.html"&gt;its Satan Shoes&lt;/a&gt; — a $1,018 Nike sneaker embellished with a pentagram and allegedly injected with ink and a single drop of blood. But &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nyed.461880/gov.uscourts.nyed.461880.14.0.pdf"&gt;in a response&lt;/a&gt; filed yesterday, MSCHF says all but one pair of the shoes, a 666 pair collaboration with rapper Lil Nas X, have already shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cU0BRT"&gt;“Contrary to Nike’s speculation in its papers, all but one pair of the shoes already have been sold and shipped. MSCHF has no intention of issuing additional Satan Shoes,” MSCHF’s attorneys wrote in a response to the Nike suit. The collective says it planned to give away the last pair on April 2nd, but it’s suspended that plan due to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nike’s legal exhibit distinguishing standard Nike shoe from “unauthorized Satan Shoe”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WCD9l551DV_WlLU8LxbUNSjFM0E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406803/Screen_Shot_2021_03_29_at_7.20.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nike&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fNeqry"&gt;Nike claimed that MSCHF sold its shoes using Nike branding but modified them in ways that tarnish Nike’s brand. It cited internet commenters who believed the shoes were official products. But MSCHF argues that buyers knew Nike hadn’t designed the Satan Shoes. It also accuses Nike of singling out the Satan Shoe while ignoring a similar 2019 “Jesus Shoe.” In a footnote to a court filing, Nike says it may amend the suit to include Jesus Shoes, but it’s not targeting them because they aren’t being sold at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOjBwQ"&gt;MSCHF argues that since “there will be no further distribution of Satan Shoes” for now, Nike won’t suffer harm that would require a restraining order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdeMzy"&gt;More generally, MSCHF says the shoes are works of artistic social commentary — comparable to signed Banksy prints. “These shoes are works of art that are intended to criticize the ever popular ‘collab culture,’ where brands like Nike collaborate with anyone willing to make a splash,” its response says. They were sold in partnership with Lil Nas X, but they were also “portrayed as a collaboration with Satan himself (a comment on the extreme collab culture).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvaBgO"&gt;In the filing, MSCHF basically admits that the Satan Shoes were more of a one-off stunt than a full-fledged commercial product. But if the two parties go to court, they could set a legal precedent for the entire fashion world, particularly online sellers who “upcycle” or heavily modify designer clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Let this be the year April Fools’ Day for brands dies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cCXeQmnOnaSSmjqHWCZoYJUx3jE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69060563/jbareham_170330_1577_0005_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XbfsVr"&gt;Today is April 1st, one of the worst days on the internet every year. For the rest of the day, the internet will be filled with an unending parade of dumb PR stunts, fake products, lie-filled press releases, and just plain unfunny jokes that have been filtered through layers and layers of corporate branding teams as to be unrecognizable as humor by normal humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaZl1A"&gt;Last year, the holiday fell at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic; faced with the unspeakable human tragedy that was unfolding on a daily basis, most companies elected to opt out of the holiday. Some, like Google, have wisely chosen to once again &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360619/google-april-fools-2021-prank-cancel"&gt;pull their April Fools’ gags&lt;/a&gt; in light of the current state of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvWgzZ"&gt;And yet, April 1st has rolled around once again, and like villainous treasure hunters in an Indiana Jones movie&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; it seems brands just can’t stop opening the box of forbidden knowledge and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcR9k8o4I0w"&gt;getting their faces melted off&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="l9kCz9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"April Fools’ Day is canceled, you monsters","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201179/april-fools-day-2020-is-canceled"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8JDTQE"&gt;The latest example of this cautionary tale is Volkswagen, which, earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357166/volkswagen-name-change-voltswagen-us-division"&gt;messed up so spectacularly&lt;/a&gt; with a fake rebranding that created a backlash so severe that I truly hope that it ends the practice forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjHCVk"&gt;As it stands, there are only four options for a brand in 2021 pulling this nonsense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="5nB7Qf"&gt;Don’t do an April Fools’ joke. Put the time and energy into doing something productive that will materially benefit the world (or, less idealistically, your business) instead. Or just don’t do anything. Abstaining entirely would still be a net positive over the drain of resources and mental energy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tFm8xo"&gt;Do an April Fools’ “joke” but actually follow through on your stunt. This is arguably not a prank, since you’ve actually created a video game skin or a real product that people can buy — but it doesn’t really hurt anyone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KbCzsB"&gt;Do an April Fools’ joke but be extremely clear from the start that this is a dumb joke and you have no intention of doing the thing that you are “humorously” pretending to do. Does this defeat the purpose of doing an April Fools’ joke because you’re not “fooling” anyone anymore? Absolutely. (Please see my first two points.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jlDza6"&gt;Lie to your customers, successfully tricking them into believing you are making some product, rebranding, or service you are not. By doing so, you will almost certainly annoy everyone once your deceit is made plain for the extremely small gain of pointless PR. The aphorism goes that there is no such thing as bad publicity; the seemingly endless line of companies willing to make fools out of themselves has proven this false time and time again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="Qwqt7p"&gt;In a more logical world, brand managers and social media strategists the world over would simply take the day off, realizing there’s simply no benefit in risking your customers’ ire (or, in some cases, your entire good name) to celebrate a toxic internet holiday that was never much fun to begin with. Unfortunately, today — as happens every year — the brands will almost certainly refuse to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
