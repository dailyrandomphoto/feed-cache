    <title>Valve will replace Big Picture mode with the new Steam Deck UI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xJ_x0TfJoS9yUVFESBJoQ5x4mGE=/0x0:1612x1075/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69610106/steam_deck_004.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qsneG1"&gt;Big Picture, the mode that converts Steam’s user interface into a more console-like design better suited to TVs and controllers than monitors and mice, may not be long for this world. According to austinp_valve, a Valve employee &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigpicture/discussions/1/5167301764850695635/"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; on the Steam community forums, the plan is for the new UI from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579493/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;just-announced Steam Deck handheld PC&lt;/a&gt; to replace Big Picture mode on the desktop version of Steam as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1YNsg"&gt;Valve announced Big Picture mode in 2011 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/3/3723508/valve-steam-big-picture-leaves-beta-launch-sale"&gt;released it the following year&lt;/a&gt;. The mode formed the basis of the UI for SteamOS, the version of Linux that shipped on console-style devices that were part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/5/8733139/valve-steam-machine-half-baked"&gt;Valve’s ill-fated Steam Machine project&lt;/a&gt;. With the Steam Deck running an all-new version of the operating system called SteamOS 3.0, it makes sense that the redesigned UI would make its way back to the PC client — especially since Big Picture has felt outdated for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EKusfTBeQSEh2iGkaiyjJ_Zdr_s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22730287/steamos3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;SteamOS 3.0 on Valve’s Steam Deck.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ry7zDW"&gt;Valve isn’t giving an ETA for when the new UI will make its way to existing PCs. The Steam Deck is set to start shipping in December, though the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22582617/new-steam-deck-reservations-q2-q3-valve-hand-held"&gt;level of demand&lt;/a&gt; has meant that new orders are being pushed out to midway through next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Green travel rewards app Miles raises $12.5 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rTteoSt1KtFcpzsh78TzvUKpwVw=/214x0:1947x1155/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69609858/Miles_screenshots_1a.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Miles&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VgIKNG"&gt;Three years ago, a startup called Miles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17604438/miles-app-tracking-transportation-deals-discounts"&gt;launched a free app&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of becoming a sort of rewards program for all travel — with an emphasis on clean transportation. Cover enough ground by bike, bus, subway, or even on foot, and you’d be rewarded with “miles” (aka points) that could be exchanged for perks at Starbucks or discounts to services like Audi Silvercar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNzjrI"&gt;I was curious, so I used Miles for a little over a year. I lived in New York City at the time and did a lot of daily walking and subway-riding, with occasional biking and bus travel. I was in a great spot to rack up miles without having to change my habits, so I shook the icky feeling of letting another app know my location to see if that occasional free coffee would be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkTuDR"&gt;It never was for me. While Miles had teased gift cards from places like Amazon, Target, and Starbucks, the rewards I saw were always far less enticing or tangible. You know all the kinds of ads for introductory offers you hear in the middle of podcasts? Those seemed to dominate the Miles app. I hoarded thousands of miles but had almost nothing to spend them on besides temporarily free or discounted subscriptions to services like Hello Fresh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3bEQgP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The team will use the investment to create “Miles 2.0”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v8aNjg"&gt;Now, Miles says it’s setting out to change some of that. On Wednesday it will announce a Series A round of funding of $12.5 million led by Scrum Ventures that includes Japan Airlines, TransLink Capital, and a host of others. The funding will help the startup create “Miles 2.0,” which will feature many new rewards, and new &lt;em&gt;types&lt;/em&gt; of rewards — like, eventually, PayPal credits, airline miles, or even cash.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YvgSV3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Miles is an app that tracks your every move in exchange for deals and discounts","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17604438/miles-app-tracking-transportation-deals-discounts"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wHbrrO"&gt;First, though, Miles CEO Jigar Shah tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview that the company has already made lots of changes to the app, especially since early last year, when it was forced to reshuffle priorities during the pandemic. With people around the world self-isolating, and both &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-government-and-politics-environment-and-nature-politics-lifestyle-56d36574e38cec038f77339ef12076bc"&gt;transit ridership&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://kinder.rice.edu/urbanedge/2020/07/27/transportation-traffic-dropped-66-it-came-back-and-covid-19-followed"&gt;vehicle miles traveled dropping&lt;/a&gt;, Shah says Miles started tweaking its rewards system to encourage the outdoor activities it already tracked where social distancing was possible (like walking, running, and biking). The Miles team also got to work on drumming up new rewards that didn’t require going into physical stores. They brought on new partners, including streaming services like Disney Plus and FandangoNOW, as well as home delivery startups like wine company Winc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxMVWY"&gt;“We went from almost 40 to 60 different partnerships in 90 days in March, April, and May of last year,” Shah says. The Miles team also started pulling other levers, like how many miles it cost to redeem certain rewards. It added a charity function, too, where miles can be donated to non-profits on the platform. If those non-profits collect enough miles, they get a payout directly from the startup. (The thresholds and payouts vary per charity and are negotiated with Miles.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="M2bc6v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The pandemic already forced Miles to make a lot of changes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="src1kL"&gt;All of these changes accelerated growth across the board for Miles last year and into 2021, Shah says. More people used the app, and users redeemed more of their miles. Out of 12 billion miles collected by users to date, 3.5 billion have been redeemed for around 7 million rewards, he says. Miles also says it has driven more than $200 million in revenue to its rewards partners to date. While it may be hard to grok those numbers, it’s obvious they were at the very least good enough to convince investors to come together for a Series A round. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4ez1z"&gt;Miles attracted new rewards partners along the way, which Shah says might help address the problem I had with the app. On Wednesday it will announce even more, including Lego, Buffalo Wild Wings, Garmin, Sam’s Club, Chewy, Wayfair, Rover, and HP. It still features plenty of subscription services, though, as some of its more recent deals include ButcherBox, Harry’s Razors, and Craftsy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ay7yBM"&gt;Shah admits that the balance was likely not right at the outset. “I think [in the] initial days, we were building up the marketplace, and it was all about the quality of the marketplace [versus] the quantity of the marketplace, and I think we couldn’t fight both,” he says. “And we chose quantity at that point in time over quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKlhQP"&gt;The pitch Miles originally made in 2018 of constant location tracking in exchange for rewards was eyebrow-raising, to say the least. In theory, that idea has only gotten &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;fraught over the last three years as &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/nepxbz/i-gave-a-bounty-hunter-300-dollars-located-phone-microbilt-zumigo-tmobile"&gt;reporting from &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has uncovered just how much of a black market there is for precise location data created by our phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C9pH7A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We [initially] chose quantity at that point in time over quality”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l7qslq"&gt;Miles maintains that it does not share any location data with its rewards partners, and Shah takes his company’s position as a sort of middleman in this respect seriously. “They get zero data at this point in time,” he says, emphatically. “Even at the aggregated level, even at the anonymized level, they just don’t get anything. The only thing they get is to put a reward on our platform.” As Shah put it back in 2018, the selling point is that Miles has created a “predictive marketing AI platform” that is supposed to match users with appropriate deals based on their behaviors — sort of like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/6/6917895/advertising-beacons-discovered-in-hundreds-of-nyc-phone-booths"&gt;a smarter version of advertising beacons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tborrV"&gt;The closest Miles comes to sharing information about people’s actual movements is in the relationships with cities and transit agencies, Shah says. Even then, it’s offered in aggregate and abstracted. “[Say] there are 14 percent of people in San Francisco who walk after taking a train trip, and their median distance of walking is 0.7 miles. That’s the formation of the data” that cities or transit agencies get in a dashboard created by Miles, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ogIT1H"&gt;(Cities and transit agencies don’t necessarily have goods to sell, so Miles can create “challenges” in its app that encourage, say, subway ridership. For example, the Miles app may challenge users to take the subway to work instead of drive in exchange for a reward from a different partner.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="0vIqX2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is it better to get something rather than nothing?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cV1aps"&gt;If you want to be optimistic about all this, you could view Miles as a vanguard of sorts for trying to offer &lt;em&gt;some &lt;/em&gt;kind of compensation for being tracked — something other apps are likely already doing without you knowing. A $5 Target gift card is not nearly as progressive an idea as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18302076/data-monetization-control-manipulation-economy-jaron-laniers-virtual-reality-vr-vergecast"&gt;federal law requiring tech companies to compensate people&lt;/a&gt; for the labor of generating data while using their services. But it’s more than what we get right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KmMeQE"&gt;“It’s more than we get right now” is also a pretty grim place to be. So it’ll be up to Miles’ users to decide whether the tradeoff is worth it, all while the company adds new rewards and continues to tweak the platform to shift the underlying balance. In that light, maybe the best we can hope for isn’t necessarily that users get a free coffee now and then, but that the promise of one gets a few more people to experience riding a bus for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One of the biggest myths about EVs is busted in new study</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Geely Targets Apple, Big Tech With Its New Zeekr Electric-Car Unit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sQIvIC63IHAynHTF3NTDNWPYzXE=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69609851/1232320777.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vehicle bodies on the production line of the manufacturing plant for Zeekr Co., an electric-car unit of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China, on Wednesday, April 14, 2021.&amp;nbsp; | Photographer: Gilles Sabrie/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DGmj74"&gt;A new study lays to rest the tired argument that electric vehicles aren’t much cleaner than internal combustion vehicles. Over the life cycle of an EV — from digging up the materials needed to build it to eventually laying the car to rest — it will release fewer greenhouse gas emissions than a gas-powered car, the research found. That holds true globally, whether an EV plugs into a grid in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577162/european-union-climate-change-greenhouse-gas-emissions"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; with a larger share of renewables, or a grid in India that still relies &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/country/IND"&gt;heavily on coal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="q32XhA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fossil fuels are driving the climate crisis&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zu8uIv"&gt;This shouldn’t come as a big surprise. Fossil fuels are driving the climate crisis. So governments from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576994/european-union-gas-vehicle-ice-ban-2035-electric-cars"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; have proposed phasing out internal combustion engines by 2035. But there are still people&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;who claim&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that EVs are only as clean as the grids they run on — and right now, fossil fuels still dominate when it comes to the energy mix in most places. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="184Szi"&gt;“We have a lot of lobby work from parts of the automotive industry saying that electric vehicles are not that much better if you take into account the electricity production and the battery production. We wanted to look into this and see whether these arguments are true,” says Georg Bieker, a researcher at the nonprofit research group the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) that published the &lt;a href="https://theicct.org/publications/global-LCA-passenger-cars-jul2021"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. The ICCT’s analysis found that those arguments don’t hold true over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6ZaSg"&gt;The report estimates the emissions from medium-sized EVs registered in 2021 in either India, China, the US, or Europe — countries that make up 70 percent of new car sales globally and are representative of other markets across the world,  the ICCT says. Lifetime emissions for an EV in Europe are between 66 and 69 percent lower compared to that of a gas-guzzling vehicle, the analysis found. In the US, an EV produces between 60 to 68 percent fewer emissions. In China, which uses more coal, an EV results in between 37 to 45 percent fewer emissions. In India, it’s between 19 to 34 percent lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pKbuek"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s difficult to predict how much the world’s energy infrastructure will actually change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nGZ6ZN"&gt;It’s important to note that the study assumes that the vehicle was registered in 2021 and will be on the road for around 18 years. Study authors ended up with a range of potential emissions reductions for each region by looking at the energy mix under existing policy, as well as projections from the International Energy Agency for what the future electricity mix will look like as climate policies develop. But it’s difficult to predict how much the world’s energy infrastructure will actually change. For example in the US, President Joe Biden has set a goal of getting 100 percent clean electricity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324575/joe-biden-jobs-climate-change-plan-energy-elections"&gt;by 2035&lt;/a&gt; — but still needs to pass the policies to make that happen. The study also doesn’t take into account other non-climate related&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;environmental effects that constructing the cars might have from things like mining and waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foZ2AP"&gt;Actually building an EV is still a little more carbon-intensive than building a traditional vehicle. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20951807/electric-vehicles-battery-recycling"&gt;Recycling EV batteries&lt;/a&gt; could eventually bring that carbon intensity down. But for now, EV drivers start to reap the climate benefits after driving their car for a year or so, according to Bieker. That’s when the car passes the threshold when the emissions that it saves by running on cleaner electricity make it a better option for the climate than a traditional car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5RNgg3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We need globally to phase out combustion engine cars.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7W1Zlw"&gt;Bieker hopes the ICCT’s findings will help policymakers make more informed decisions about the future of transportation. Climate experts are rushing to bring global greenhouse gas emissions down to &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;near zero by the middle of the century&lt;/a&gt; to avoid the worst effects of global warming. Electric vehicles are necessary to make those cuts happen, and even hybrid-electric vehicles aren’t clean enough to meet that goal. The report recommends against allowing any new internal combustion vehicles on the road by the 2030s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qa9ytm"&gt;“Combustion engine vehicles of any kind are not able to deliver the greenhouse gas reductions we need to live with climate change,” Bieker says. “That’s a global finding, therefore we need globally to phase out combustion engine cars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7zf9B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7KLf1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brokered cell location data led to the outing and resignation of a Catholic official</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ijapUNFChi3zs9pdIeFDHX8c74U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69609783/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EKcZHM"&gt;Location data from a cell phone, obtained and sold by data brokers, has lead to the alleged outing and resignation of a priest working for the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, according to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2021/07/20/bishop-misconduct-resign-burrill/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; The traffic data, which was linked to the priest and appeared to show when and where he was using the LGBTQ dating app Grindr, was obtained by a publication and shared with the Conference, where the priest worked as the general secretary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Q9q92"&gt;This incident is another example of how invasive the collection and sale of location and other personal data by brokers can be. While the data sold by these companies is ostensibly anonymized, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21029992/smartphone-location-tracking-legal-technology-privacy-new-york-times"&gt;shown that individuals can be picked out and tracked&lt;/a&gt;. The data broker industry has been a concern among privacy advocates for years, especially after companies have been caught selling data to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303190/congress-data-smartphone-tracking-fbi-security-privacy"&gt;law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244848/us-intelligence-memo-admits-buying-smartphone-location-data"&gt;state agencies&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve also seen how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18214667/att-t-mobile-sprint-location-tracking-data-bounty-hunters"&gt;carriers&lt;/a&gt; and other companies sell data to these brokers, with Grindr itself being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249578/grindr-fined-norwegian-data-protection-authority"&gt;fined for the practice&lt;/a&gt; by the Norwegian government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bu6mAo"&gt;The priest’s story is illustrative of how that commercially available data can be used against someone, and of how the relatively-unknown data broker industry can have profound consequences on peoples’ lives. For many of us, it’s hard to keep track of who’s tracking our data — making it difficult, if not impossible to prevent it from being collected and sold by companies we didn’t know had access to it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ymloVB"&gt;Samsung has officially announced when it will hold its next Unpacked product event: August 11th at 10AM ET / 7AM PT. It is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572858/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2021-leak-evan-blass-galaxy-z-fold-flip-3-s21-fe-watch-4-buds-2-date"&gt;widely expected&lt;/a&gt; to announce the next version of the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;both of which have already leaked quite a bit&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung’s not being shy about those expectations, as a quick look at its invite reveals the outline for both of those devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMCaRV"&gt;Samsung is also expected to announce new Galaxy watches, which would be the first to use the new combined Wear platform that was announced at Google I/O earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63RkvA"&gt;Samsung is holding the event virtually again on its website, and it promises to post more &lt;a href="https://smsng.news/2TqTjNm"&gt;details on the livestream here&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also keeping up another Samsung trend: &lt;a href="https://shopsamsung.page.link/A1gWkiA6yiC9Xvvt7"&gt;letting customers “reserve” “its next flagship”&lt;/a&gt; before it’s even been officially announced. Samsung says it will offer “increased trade-in credit and 12 months of Samsung Care+ at a discounted rate” for early reservations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIeRnR"&gt;According to the images leaked by Evan Blass, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 looks very similar to the current iteration of the folding phone. The largest upgrade will apparently be compatibility with Samsung’s S Pen stylus. Samsung itself has been telegraphing that it would add stylus support to the Fold line for a very long time now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qZULQKv1zeeuJKAzVV0v4dZAQrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679450/E4qkWBHXwAgIQ_W.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1408107239903223808?s=21" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass / Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (tweet now deleted)&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4zpnFF"&gt;As for the Galaxy Z Flip 3, the biggest update may be on the outside, where Samsung will replace a very tiny screen with a slightly larger but still fairly small screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ooz3x6"&gt;Samsung has done a better job with durability on its folding devices since it switched over to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;using “Ultra thin glass”&lt;/a&gt; under a plastic sheet for these displays. However, the screens are still much more fragile than regular smartphone screens. If Samsung is intending to encourage users to poke at the Z Fold 3’s screen with a plastic stick, that folding screen will need to become more durable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KgHEKq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/cLlE0ot4fO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cLlE0ot4fO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734400420896768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Afejm"&gt;Though it’s not likely to get top billing, the new Galaxy smartwatches are likely to be a bigger shift than the iterative updates to the folding phones. That’s because it’ll be the first Samsung smartwatch to run Google’s Wear operating system in over half a decade. Samsung had been using its own Tizen-based OS on smartwatches, which had benefits over Google’s Wear OS but did not have an app library worth using. Now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;the two operating systems are combined&lt;/a&gt;, this upcoming Samsung watch will be our first real look at what the new Wear operating system really works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6G3NZn"&gt;We are expecting both a Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 with a rotating bezel and a Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 4 without to be announced, both in multiple colors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITtldf"&gt;It’s always possible there will be more on tap — Samsung’s Galaxy Buds lineup could also be due for a new model. We’ll find out for sure when Samsung kicks off its livestream on August 11th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A fix is coming for those locked out of their Chromebooks by Google’s update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IGDNtT94BgE2U_2DM88YHB9UrV0=/0x186:1360x1093/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69609149/mchin_181029_4126_0002sq.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zvs0vw"&gt;A bad update to Chrome OS, version 91.0.4472.165, has left some users unable to log in to their accounts, or reportedly with boot-looping computers (&lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/second-major-chrome-os-update-bug-leaving-users-locked-out-chromebooks"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you’ve found yourself locked out of your Chromebook, help is on the way: Google posted &lt;a href="https://support.cloud.google.com/portal/system-status"&gt;on its system status page&lt;/a&gt; that it’s working on a fix, which it expects to release on Wednesday. It’s also pulled the update, which should prevent more users from experiencing the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRKjwL"&gt;According to Google, the only options to immediately regain access to your Chrome OS device (if it unfortunately downloaded and installed the update) will lead to the local data on the device being wiped. If you can wait until the new fix the issue is released, though, your device should automatically download that update as well. Or, you can manually trigger the update using the guest account. If your computer has downloaded the bad update but not installed it, you might want to avoid shutting it down or rebooting it until the fix is out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tyv3MS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The second bad Chrome OS update we’ve seen this month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eQ5rVb"&gt;If you can’t wait for the fixed update, Google recommends either &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/183084?hl=en"&gt;“Powerwashing” (factory resetting) your Chrome OS device&lt;/a&gt;, rolling back the update &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1080595?hl=en"&gt;with a recovery USB key&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1059260?hl=en#zippy="&gt;removing your account and re-adding it&lt;/a&gt;. Again, all these solutions will delete local data on the device, so be careful. Google’s status page also doesn’t address the boot looping issues — &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/second-major-chrome-os-update-bug-leaving-users-locked-out-chromebooks?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+androidcentral+%28Android+Central%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; that if you’re experiencing those issues you’ll have to use the recovery USB key method to reinstall Chrome OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KT04LY"&gt;The broken 91.0.4472.165 update is actually the second bad Chrome OS update we’ve seen this month: &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/16/chrome-os-91-performance-issues-chromebooks/"&gt;Google had to pull another update&lt;/a&gt; around July 7th after users discovered that some Chromebooks were having their performance seriously throttled. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An on-the-ground look at Blue Origin’s motley crew </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ohq-T7szdIwKZnts-fcaGLC8ogc=/0x0:4182x2788/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69609133/_MG_4801_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jeff Bezos, his brother Mark and Oliver Daemen walk off New Shepard’s landing pad as Wally Funk, 82-year-old aviation icon and the mission’s fourth passenger, remains in awe at the size of New Shepard, the suborbital rocket they all launched to space on. | Joey Roulette/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A record-setting flight&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="vAdeNf"&gt;Today, Wally Funk, 81, and Oliver Daemen, 18, made history as the oldest and youngest people ever to go to space. They &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22582735/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-launch-landing"&gt;hitched a ride with Jeff Bezos&lt;/a&gt; and his brother, Mark, aboard the New Shepard, a rocket made by Bezos’ company, Blue Origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZ2NPS"&gt;Blue Origin will eventually sell seats, though Bezos declined to say how much they’d sell for. “We’ll be announcing that later,” Bezos said, when &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked how much his company plans to charge. When’s “later?” “We’re not quite sure yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jksRet"&gt;Daemen was the first paying customer — though he didn’t win the June auction for the seat. That winner, who remains anonymous, bid $28 million to fly, but had to reschedule for vague “scheduling conflicts.” (Blue Origin would not identify the bidder or explain what the issue was.) Daemen’s dad, a Dutch private equity firm’s CEO, was bumped up from the next mission, and gave the seat to his son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGNKTc"&gt;“We know the vehicle is safe. If the vehicle is not safe for me, it’s not safe for anyone,” Bezos said in an interview with CNN. If nothing else, it’s good advertising for space tourism.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where to preorder the Nintendo Switch OLED model</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/evcDNXAUvZ90QSh1sO3zM2YmJ8A=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587172/oled_model_photo_01.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="guw0Bh"&gt;After months of speculation and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346041/oled-nintendo-switch-dlss-nvidia-chip-report"&gt;sea of rumors&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;officially announced&lt;/a&gt; the next iteration of its popular gaming console: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt;. The upcoming device serves more as a midlife update than anything else, a refinement of the 2019 model as opposed to the more powerful “Switch Pro” that was rumored (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565469/nintendo-switch-pro-oled-timing-chip-shortages-cpu-nvidia-tegra"&gt;may still launch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKuikp"&gt;On sale for $350 starting October 8th, the aptly-titled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565307/nintendo-oled-switch-screen-news-updates"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt; is the next iteration of what has become one of the best-selling consoles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562530/nintendo-switch-lite-sales-october-2020"&gt;over the last two years&lt;/a&gt;. It’s outfitted with a 7-inch 720p OLED display, a new dock with a wired Ethernet port, and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand"&gt;improved kickstand&lt;/a&gt; that seems to take a cue directly from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21526702/microsoft-surface-pro-x-2020-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Pro tablets&lt;/a&gt;. It also offers 64GB of built-in storage, up to nine hours of battery life — the same as the current Switch — and features “enhanced audio” for handheld or tabletop play. Sadly, despite persistent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22312559/new-nintendo-switch-oled-screen-holiday-release-report"&gt;rumors of 4K support&lt;/a&gt;, the OLED model only supports 1080p resolution when docked. Apparently, Bluetooth support and an improved CPU will also have to wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6ASo1a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo denies report that OLED Switch will have higher profit margin","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583141/nintendo-switch-oled-profit-margin-report-denial"},{"title":"Nintendo Switch OLED hands-on: a small upgrade that makes a big difference","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="UyweAO"&gt;Still, the OLED model has plenty to get people excited, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564966/nintendo-switch-oled-display-ps5-xbox"&gt;including our own Alex Cranz&lt;/a&gt;. It plays all the same games, supports the original Joy-Cons, and ships with a sleek black-and-white finish reminiscent of next-gen consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S. It will also be available with the red and blue Joy-Cons, if you prefer the original model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HnhAvm"&gt;Where to buy the Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5An2L3"&gt;The Nintendo Switch OLED model initially went up for preorder on Thursday, and we’ve seen a few retailers allow for additional preorders in the time since. However, if you’re still looking to get your hands on the OLED-equipped Switch at launch and get ahead of what already appears to be another console shortage, you’re in luck. Right now, you can preorder the red and blue iteration of the forthcoming console for $350 at &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-oled-with-blue-and-red-joy-con%2F11149259.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zikzMn"&gt;The white model is currently unavailable for preorder, though neither configuration is expected to ship until the console officially goes on sale on October 8th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome for iOS will let you lock down incognito tabs with Face ID</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DhHxQL4W5zfgv8dotss3F2Kwiec=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69608611/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zVFCrm"&gt;Chrome’s latest update for iOS will let you secure your incognito tabs with Touch ID, Face ID, or a passcode (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/chrome-biometric-authentication-incognito-tabs/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). When the new feature is rolled out to you, you can turn it on by navigating to the settings menu, then tapping “Privacy,” then “Lock Incognito tabs.” I just updated the app and the option wasn’t there for me, so you might have to wait just a bit until you can flip it on. Google first revealed it was testing this new privacy feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279719/google-chrome-face-id-incognito-mode-ios-support-feature"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHl2DH"&gt;The update brings a few other handy features to Google’s mobile browser, including the ability to take a full-page screenshot of a website. You can use it by snapping a screenshot with the button combination specific to your device, tapping the screenshot preview, and then tapping over to the “Full Page” tab that will appear, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/20/chrome-92-ios/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (I don’t have this feature yet, either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCbS8Y"&gt;You can download Chrome 92 &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-chrome/id535886823"&gt;from the App Store now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram introduces a setting to control sensitive content in your Explore tab</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R5W-igcNyErp031220QpoAoSJos=/0x0:890x593/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69608523/CD21_455_NRP_IG_Sensitivity_Content_Control_Inline.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RW1A3k"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/introducing-sensitive-content-control/"&gt;Facebook is announcing&lt;/a&gt; a new setting that allows you to limit how much potentially sensitive content shows up in your Instagram Explore tab. According to Facebook, the new Sensitive Content Control setting will let you “see more or less of some types of sensitive content,” which may be “upsetting or offensive.” How much content the three levels, “Allow,” “Limit (Default),” and “Limit Even More” will or will not show is pretty vague, and we’ve reached out to Facebook for clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DfRl7"&gt;On &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/251027992727268"&gt;the support page for Sensitive Content Control&lt;/a&gt;, Instagram says that sensitive content could include sexually suggestive or violent posts, as well as posts that promote things like tobacco or pharmaceutical use. Facebook is clear that this setting is based on its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/313829416281232"&gt;Recommendation Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, which govern what can show up on the Explore page, and not &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119"&gt;its Community Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8XW7FB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Graphic” violence or nudity will still be taken off the site&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p6kT1b"&gt;Posts that flat-out violate Facebook’s rules will still be removed, Sensitive Content Control just gives users more options about how much they want to be exposed to content that could be upsetting in the Explore tab. For example, &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/251027992727268"&gt;Facebook says&lt;/a&gt; content showing a fight or people in see-through clothing may be considered “sensitive,” and therefore shouldn’t show up on the Explore page for people who have sensitive content limits. “Graphic” violence or nudity, however, would be taken off the site and wouldn’t show up even for those who have Sensitive Content Control set to “Allow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKYAVV"&gt;Facebook didn’t respond to a request for comment on how much of a difference the setting makes to the amount of potentially sensitive content that’s shown to a user. The descriptions shown in Facebook’s screenshot of the feature, seen at the top of this article, are a bit vague, though — the Limit Even More setting doesn’t say that you won’t see sensitive content, just that you “may” see fewer posts that “could” be upsetting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pabmy2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The descriptions of how much content will be shown are a bit vague&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I6Kgqh"&gt;According to Facebook, the setting will be accessible by going to your profile, then tapping Settings &amp;gt; Account &amp;gt; Sensitive Content Control. The feature doesn’t seem to have rolled out to all users yet: the option didn’t appear for me or a few of my colleagues. Facebook says that the setting to allow sensitive content may not be available to people under 18 years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRoeXB"&gt;This announcement comes at a time when many social networks, especially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557942/instagram-no-longer-photo-app-video-entertainment-focus"&gt;photo and video sharing platforms&lt;/a&gt;, are trying to figure out how to deal with content that may be upsetting to some users but engaging for others. Last year, TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175889/tiktok-updated-community-guidelines-violent-disturbing-content-warning-labels-opt-in-vaccine-info"&gt;introduced warning screens&lt;/a&gt; for potentially graphic videos, and Pinterest recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558960/pinterest-weight-loss-ads-ban-social-media"&gt;a ban on weight loss ads&lt;/a&gt;. Instagram itself tries to blur out images that could be potentially triggering for people struggling with eating disorders, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295693/instagram-eating-disorder-resources-help-lines"&gt;and provides resources&lt;/a&gt; to users searching for content related to disordered eating. Today’s announcement doesn’t seem to signal a drastic change for the Explore page, but it should give people a bit more control over what they see on it.&lt;/p&gt;
