    <title>Stellantis, parent company of Dodge and Jeep, had an ‘EV Day’ and it was extremely weird</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dChjkhcbsfTy7FWLEeUZk4HxnKI=/364x0:1332x645/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69557587/Screen_Shot_2021_07_08_at_2.11.43_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Stellantis&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OHPIPZ"&gt;Stellantis is not a musical version of &lt;em&gt;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&lt;/em&gt; set in an underwater kingdom, but actually the name of the newly merged Fiat Chrysler and PSA Group, and the fourth largest automaker in the world. The company held an event Thursday to brief investors and media on its electrification strategy, and as befits a company that represents a mishmash of Italian, American, German, and French sensibilities, it was kind of a hot mess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0WuluN"&gt;The first indication that things were about to get weird was when Dodge CEO Tim Kuniskis emerged from a thick cloud of smoke produced by the squealing tires of a Dodge Challenger to present his brand’s electrification strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="q6gsBq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was kind of a hot mess&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sTfktf"&gt;It was a jarring transition from the previous presenter, the mild mannered Opel CEO Michael Lohscheller, standing next to a one-off &lt;a href="https://www.goldeagle.com/tips-tools/what-is-a-restomod/"&gt;restomod&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a36570065/electric-opel-manta-restomod-revealed/"&gt;Opel Manta Model A&lt;/a&gt;. But I’m sure the whiplash was totally intentional. This is Dodge we’re talking about, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/11/15266608/dodge-demon-announced-new-york-auto-show-2017"&gt;maker of the offensively fast Demon&lt;/a&gt;. This is not a company known for its nuance. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3vA63a6xbp9dUMZ8_tGcMY6VJTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706378/ddoge_ceo.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W7siMA"&gt;Kuniskis’ job was to let Dodge customers know that the company wasn’t going to kowtow to any lame-ass electrification strategy. After all, who would want to buy a muscle car that doesn’t emit thick plumes of toxic pollution into the environment while scaring all your neighbors’ cats with its aggressive engine growl? “Dodge will not sell electric cars,” he declared. “Dodge will sell American muscle.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FNSdhD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apparently that was a bit of sleight-of-hand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2werIl"&gt;But apparently that was a bit of sleight-of-hand, because it turns out that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568272/dodge-electric-muscle-car-2024-stellantis-ev-day"&gt;Dodge &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;sell an electric car&lt;/a&gt;. It was a little confusing, but I think it’s because Dodge is branding its future EVs as “eMuscle” cars, a hokey bit of branding that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/8/12846440/ford-tough-ford-trucks-ford-tough-ford-tough-truck-ford"&gt;automakers tend to think sounds a lot cooler than it actually does&lt;/a&gt;. As if that wasn’t enough, Kuniskis went on to compare Dodge to a “hammerhead shark [that] has thrived at the top of the food chain.” (Why hammerhead? Why not a great white shark?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGUw44"&gt;Kuniskis then said that Dodge’s new mission would be “to tear up the streets, not the planet,” which brings me to the next bit of cringe from this presentation: the taglines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ilaveJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So here are all the mottos that Stellantis announced for each brand as part of its new “electrification approach…” &lt;a href="https://t.co/9ttMWXIzqB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9ttMWXIzqB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Motor1 (@Motor1com) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Motor1com/status/1413140147399368711?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nbDKmk"&gt;Each of Stellantis’ 14 brands is getting a new motto, which range in quality from Jeep’s “Zero Emission Freedom” (sure, fine) to Opel’s “Green is the New Cool” (burn it down, salt the earth so nothing else can grow). Stellantis is a global corporation with thousands of employees and access to some of the world’s most elite market research firms. Which leads me to wonder: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_pvFXbVlt8"&gt;who are the ad wizards who came up with this one?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t7J3DmNO6sUDArNvjcivJZK4us4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706470/jeep_drone.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BLu8JA"&gt;Speaking of Jeep, the iconic brand made some significant news today — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568306/jeep-ev-hybrid-wagoneer-wrangler-cherokee-stellantis"&gt;zero-emission models in every category by 2025&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGqKDSp0CFU"&gt;in addition to some news that was just... out there&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently by that same date Jeep is also promising that drones will launch out of your Wrangler, and biometric facial recognition will be used to unlock your vehicle (even though it may not technically have doors to unlock). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CM4Tjm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fully autonomous Jeeps off-roading through the desert?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0TVren"&gt;And by 2030, we’ll have fully autonomous Jeeps off-roading through the desert, which sounds extremely cool but also feels very “CES circa 2016,” when every company was promising fully autonomous everything without any constraints, way before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20951385/uber-self-driving-crash-death-reason-ntsb-dcouments"&gt;Uber killed a person&lt;/a&gt; with its self-driving car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3AEZw"&gt;It’s like Jeep hasn’t really been paying attention to the recent news on self-driving cars. We are more than a decade away from starting to see them in any significant number. Even then, the idea of autonomous vehicles that can drive anywhere, under any conditions, may never become a reality. Even Elon Musk, the king of “fake it till you make it,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22563751/tesla-elon-musk-full-self-driving-admission-autopilot-crash"&gt;admitted that autonomous vehicles are way harder&lt;/a&gt; than he anticipated! But sure, go off with your driverless Jeep Rubicon in the middle of the desert, without any road markings or anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChpfJQ"&gt;Listen, I’m not trying to rag on Stellantis for getting weird with its EV Day. Other companies have had similar events that have mostly been stuffy and boring, so kudos to Stellantis for shooting its shot. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8NxtL-oLm4"&gt;Live every week like it’s shark week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h6ptCm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcaA6Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Startup Halo will bring driverless car service to Las Vegas later this year on T-Mobile 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sQ4bVX2CCwAEhHYpxBXBIULu4AQ=/0x23:3000x2023/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69557369/21CM0192_05_060221_1040v2m_sm.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo says it will use remote drivers to operate its vehicles over T-Mobile 5G.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: T-Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GdySA9"&gt;Driverless car startup Halo has announced a new service coming to Las Vegas later this year: a fleet of remotely operated electric vehicles, using T-Mobile’s 5G network. It’s potentially a big step toward fulfilling the promise of 5G remote driver tech, with a significant catch: the cars don’t operate &lt;em&gt;solely&lt;/em&gt; on T-Mobile 5G. While it’s the primary network they’ll use (mid- and low-band 5G, specifically, with LTE as a fallback), they will also rely on other networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pWiKV"&gt;The idea is simple enough: Halo employs remote drivers to operate the vehicles, delivering them to waiting customers who then get behind the wheel and take the car to their destination. When the trip has ended, the car moves on to its next pick-up under remote control. Halo is also currently operating test drives with safety drivers in vehicles, which it says it won’t include when the service launches for paying customers. That’s easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xag8xZ"&gt;There’s no shortage of driverless and autonomous vehicle pilot programs in Las Vegas; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17718018/lyft-aptiv-self-driving-cars-las-vegas-5000-trips"&gt;Lyft has operated a driverless taxi service&lt;/a&gt; in the city, and more recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22291682/motional-fully-driverless-autonomous-cars-las-vegas"&gt;Motional has been testing autonomous rides&lt;/a&gt; without a backup driver behind the wheel. Halo’s service is a little different, using a remote driver, along with an “Advanced Safe Stop” mechanism to automatically bring the car to a halt if a hazard is detected. The company says that ultimately it hopes to achieve full autonomy, and that in the meantime its vehicles are designed to “learn” from their human operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UW4YRK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"I took a gamble by riding in a self-driving Lyft in Las Vegas","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/8/16860590/self-driving-lyft-las-vegas-ces-2018"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="f66CMo"&gt;Fully remote driverless vehicles have been one of the promises of 5G, and it’s a use case that actually demands the speed and low latency that 5G connectivity is capable of delivering. But in the US, at least, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;our networks just haven’t met the bar yet&lt;/a&gt; to make it a reality. This new service is a step in the right direction, but it seems we’re not quite at full 5G remote operation yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zlq7l"&gt;It won’t exactly be a widespread service at first, either. Halo says that it will operate in “urban parts of the Las Vegas Valley” at launch and doesn’t disclose how large of an area it will cover, just that it plans to later expand to more parts of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phRERG"&gt;Oh, and it’s probably a coincidence, but Las Vegas is also set to be the stage for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295777/dish-network-5g-q3-2021"&gt;Dish Network’s first 5G rollout&lt;/a&gt; this summer, a venture that T-Mobile is supposed to be helping to facilitate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134278/sprint-tmobile-merger-court-ruling-opinion-decision-explainer-carriers-antitrust"&gt;per its Sprint acquisition deal&lt;/a&gt;. If T-Mobile’s 5G network can indeed support a fleet of remotely operated vehicles, it’ll be thanks in part to the addition of Sprint’s spectrum. Before we get carried away by the possibilities of driverless cars, let’s spare a thought for the fourth wireless carrier we’re still missing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Minimum broadband speeds are likely too low, government watchdog says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m1PDE_csNuhYDtnhRI_eyUHVMQc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69557295/acastro_170711_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xXiy6l"&gt;Since 2015, the Federal Communications Commission has maintained that minimum broadband speed should stay the same: 25 megabits per second for downloading files, and 3 megabits per second for uploading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lE93IU"&gt;Now, a government watchdog is telling the FCC to re-evaluate these rules in &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-494?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=usgao"&gt;a new report&lt;/a&gt;, saying small businesses in 2021 require more bandwidth to effectively run their operations. The report, produced by the Government Accountability Office, also shows examples of small businesses around the country which aren’t even getting the minimum speed required by the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8QqCxw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One Vermont inn pays $78 per month for 10 Mbps speeds&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FY9CW4"&gt;This isn’t the first time the FCC has faced heat over its broadband minimums. Earlier this year a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22312065/fcc-highspeed-broadband-service-ajit-pai-bennet-angus-king-rob-portman"&gt;group of senators&lt;/a&gt; called for the agency to raise the bottom limit to 100 Mbps for both download and upload speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urKAgX"&gt;The FCC has basically admitted that it has very little reliable data on whether people are getting the mandated minimum speeds, or access at all. Its broadband coverage maps are based on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition"&gt;self-reported data from internet providers&lt;/a&gt;, who are incentivized to overstate their coverage to shirk regulation. It has attempted to create &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379848/fcc-speed-test-app-google-apple-download-broadband-maps-coverage"&gt;speed test apps&lt;/a&gt; to get more direct information, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345533/fcc-broadband-data-collection-program-fix-the-internet"&gt;collected complaints&lt;/a&gt; directly from consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdwIWN"&gt;Anonymized data visualized by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; paints a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data"&gt;much bleaker picture&lt;/a&gt; than the FCC has admitted, with many counties reporting less than 10 percent broadband availability at minimum speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjUlcT"&gt;But the GAO contends that there’s enough evidence to reconsider these rules. Reports from small businesses show that many want a minimum of 100 Mbps download speed, and up to 1 gigabyte per second for offices with dozens of employees. Even Zoom recommends at least 3.8 Mbps of upload speed to make high-definition video calls, which exceeds the federal minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUdbRd"&gt;Business owners also told the GAO that while they might be able to access broadband, it’s expensive and unreliable. One Vermont inn and spa owner said that they pay $78 per month for substandard 10 Mbps speeds, and upgrading to 40 Mbps would cost a prohibitive $335 per month. Others said they had to rely on expensive satellite internet services to have any reliable access to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaTCTb"&gt;Raising this minimum benchmark to 100 Mbps down / 10 Mbps up would have long-term effects for people in rural communities who suffer most from these internet deserts, the GAO writes. The change would lower the percentage of rural Americans who are considered to have acceptable broadband coverage from 83 percent to 67 percent, a strong argument that providers need to invest more in rural infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8ahDH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook accidentally lost a piece of its moderation policy for three years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="National demonstration in support of the Kurdish people in..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CFBbdHUArLJiWj1z92nhHxwnxWE=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69557218/1201232431.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A demonstration in Rome in support of freeing Kurdish political leader Abdullah Ocalan.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Matteo Nardone / Pacific Press / LightRocket / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EItjCZ"&gt;Instagram accidentally banned a post criticizing solitary confinement because Facebook had misplaced the policy allowing it, according to a new Facebook Oversight Board (FOB) decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ7pbW"&gt;The semi-independent Oversight Board &lt;a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/decision/IG-I9DP23IB"&gt;says the Facebook-owned site should not have removed&lt;/a&gt; a post about Abdullah Öcalan, a founding member of the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). Facebook designates Öcalan and the PKK “dangerous entities” that users cannot support on its platforms. In January, moderators applied that policy to a message criticizing Öcalan’s imprisonment and solitary confinement — a practice the United Nations has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/17/18305109/solitary-confinement-prison-criminal-justice-reform"&gt;deemed a form of torture&lt;/a&gt; — in a Turkish prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Zwcsmr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Board is concerned that specific guidance for moderators ... was lost for three years”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Id0BpO"&gt;The user appealed to the Oversight Board, which agreed to examine the case. As it did, Facebook apparently “found that a piece of internal guidance on the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy was ‘inadvertently not transferred’ to a new review system in 2018.” The policy had been developed in 2017 partly because of the debate over Öcalan’s living conditions, and it “allows discussion on the conditions of confinement for individuals designated as dangerous.” But the internal guidance was never made public to Facebook or Instagram users — and Facebook only realized it had dropped out of the moderation guidelines altogether when the user appealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdNDAX"&gt;“Had the board not selected this case for review, the guidance would have remained unknown to content moderators, and a significant amount of expression in the public interest would have been removed,” the FOB’s decision states. Facebook declined to comment on whether it considers that assessment accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gh5n5X"&gt;“The board is concerned that specific guidance for moderators on an important policy exception was lost for three years,” the FOB’s decision continues. While Facebook restored the post about Öcalan in April, it told the board it was “not technically feasible” to see how many other posts might have been removed because moderators weren’t aware of the exception. “The Board believes that Facebook’s mistake may have led to many other posts being wrongly removed and that Facebook’s transparency reporting is not sufficient to assess whether this type of error reflects a systemic problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1Lk7sv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This case demonstrates why public rules are important for users”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JNGlFb"&gt;The FOB decision broadly pushes Facebook to make its rules more transparent. “This case demonstrates why public rules are important for users: they not only inform them of what is expected, but also empower them to point out Facebook’s mistakes,” it says. The decision says Facebook is conducting a review of how the policy failed to be transferred, and the FOB has offered a series of further, optional recommendations. They include conducting a review process to see if any other policies were lost, as well as publicly clarifying the limits of its ban on supporting “dangerous individuals and organizations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V75qkh"&gt;Social networks like Facebook and Instagram often keep parts of their policies secret, saying that releasing totally precise moderation rules lets trolls and other bad actors game the system. However, as the FOB notes, this kind of secrecy on a huge, diffuse service can make miscommunication easier — as it apparently did in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="FaVTRH"&gt;Luxury carmaker Bentley has &lt;a href="https://www.bentleymedia.com/en/newsitem/1234"&gt;announced details&lt;/a&gt; about its Flying Spur Hybrid sedan, its second Bentley hybrid, which the company claims is the “most efficient Bentley ever.” Using just the electric motor, Bentley says you’ll be able to drive for more than 40 kilometers (or just under 25 miles), and the company says the car offers a “total driving range” of more than 700 kilometers (just under 435 miles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZSdnl"&gt;The Flying Spur Hybrid will be able to accelerate from 0 to 60mph in 4.1 seconds, according to Bentley. That’s slower than what Tesla claims for the Model S Plaid, which it says can go from 0-60 in 1.99 seconds, but that’s a feat that’s only feasible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22540154/tesla-model-s-plaid-acceleration-test-conditions"&gt;under very specific conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="jv4dC3"&gt;Bentley also says the car delivers a total of 536 horsepower and 750NM of torque. You can check out the full specs of the Flying Spur Hybrid on &lt;a href="https://www.bentleymedia.com/en/newsitem/1234"&gt;Bentley’s press release&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bentleymotors.com/en/models/flying-spur/flying-spur-hybrid.html"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Microsoft is giving employees a $1,500 pandemic bonus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="microsoft logo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9r2F_GO2qrVxt7_HRzuvUVq_qfk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69557040/DSCF1179.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ANHBIu"&gt;Microsoft is gifting its employees a $1,500 pandemic bonus. In an internal memo seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the software giant says this one-time bonus “is in recognition of the unique and challenging fiscal year that Microsoft just completed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdDzgc"&gt;Microsoft’s chief people officer, Kathleen Hogan, announced the gift to employees today, and it will apply to all eligible employees in both the US and internationally. Microsoft is gifting this bonus to all staff below corporate vice president level that started on or before March 31st, 2021, including part-time workers and those on hourly rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyNgig"&gt;Microsoft has 175,508 employees worldwide, but LinkedIn, GitHub, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;and ZeniMax&lt;/a&gt; employees are not eligible for the bonus, despite Microsoft owning these three separate companies. As a result, we understand it’s a gift of around $200 million, or less than two days’ worth of profit for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXkBtB"&gt;It follows similar employee gifts from big companies over the past year, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183513/facebook-giving-1000-dollar-bonuses-every-employee-coronavirus-mark-zuckerberg"&gt;Facebook gifting its 45,000 employees $1,000 each&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s $300 holiday bonus &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/26/amazon-gives-front-line-workers-a-300-holiday-bonus.html"&gt;for frontline workers&lt;/a&gt;, and BT gifting its 60,000 employees &lt;a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/philip-jansen-britain-b925906.html"&gt;£1,500 each&lt;/a&gt; (approximately $2,000). Vox Media, owner of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, also gifted employees a $1,000 bonus late last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2RWxx"&gt;Microsoft says it has &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/11/microsoft-washington-support-communities-covid-19/"&gt;also donated&lt;/a&gt; “more than $98 million of assistance to nonprofits in Washington state” since the COVID-19 pandemic began, with plans to commit an additional $60 million in support by July. Since the pandemic started, Microsoft has generated at least $160 billion in revenue, thanks to a mix of businesses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406472/microsoft-teams-145-million-daily-active-users-stats"&gt;flocking to cloud services&lt;/a&gt;, a boost in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;laptop sales and Windows usage&lt;/a&gt;, and strong &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406254/microsoft-q3-2021-earnings-revenue-xbox-cloud-services-surface-gaming"&gt;Xbox growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA clears Natural Cycles birth control to use a smart ring for temperature measurements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W9frvYUOT3HVjYnDRiCLdHPM-pk=/20x0:620x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69557017/1614590448_learn_status_newbrand.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Natural Cycles&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p8V08Y"&gt;Digital birth control Natural Cycles can now use temperature data from&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;devices like the Oura smart ring to make predictions on when someone could become pregnant. The company said today it got clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to give users the option of taking their temperature through a device with a temperature sensor, rather than taking it manually with a thermometer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxL3Qe"&gt;The sign-off makes Natural Cycles the “world’s first wearable birth control,” the company said in a statement. The feature is currently only available in a private beta program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZtCU4D"&gt;Natural Cycles prevents pregnancy through an algorithm that uses daily temperature measurements and period cycle tracking to give users information about the days of the month when they’re least likely to get pregnant. The app was first cleared by the FDA as birth control in 2018 (a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/19/18139681/natural-cycles-fda-approval-standards-de-novo-digital-health-devices"&gt;controversial decision&lt;/a&gt; at the time). A second birth control app, made by Clue, was cleared &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/clue-gets-fda-clearance-to-launch-a-digital-contraceptive/"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meYEvf"&gt;A person’s resting body temperature increases during ovulation, and tracking that temperature consistently can tell people when they are more or less likely to become pregnant. Previously, to use Natural Cycles as birth control, people had to take their temperature using a thermometer every day when they woke up. Now, they will be able to wear something like an Oura ring overnight and have their temperature information automatically sent to the app each morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3RviJ"&gt;Natural Cycles tested the Oura ring in a study of 40 women, the company said in its filing to the FDA. Each of the women were experienced Natural Cycles users who both wore the ring and manually took their temperature each day. In total, the analysis included 155 complete menstrual cycles. The algorithm was able to predict ovulation accurately using either temperature reading, the filing said. Using the ring gave users an average of 1.6 additional “not fertile” days during each cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rIIs8G"&gt;Elina Berglund, co-founder and CEO of Natural Cycles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/3/21548201/natural-cycles-oura-digital-wearable-birth-control-fda"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;last fall that the company was interested in wearables in order to make it easier for people to collect temperature information. “We do see that there are some users that have trouble remembering to take their temperature in the morning,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5p2PzB"&gt;Using a wearable to automatically monitor temperature would be easier and could be more accurate — it would measure temperature continuously as someone slept, rather than at a single&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;point in time, Rebecca Simmons, a researcher and fertility awareness specialist at the University of Utah, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/3/21548201/natural-cycles-oura-digital-wearable-birth-control-fda"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But research is still limited, even with the study included in the filing. “There’s a long way to go before we can feel like, oh yeah, these are really able to tell us what we need to know in order to predict our fertility,” she said last fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uT58Yb"&gt;Natural Cycles now has a hardware team, which it launched after filing for the new clearance with the FDA last year, the company said in a statement. It’s evaluating other wearables and also has plans to build its own device.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6otf1S"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISOnLF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The COVID-19 vaccines weren’t hacked — this task force is one reason why</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1RSx3O-jpGazwClMm0yTPnPufAs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556777/acastro_210708_4663_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Securing the supply chain meant focusing on tiny companies&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZmrUmM"&gt;Last fall, a tiny company no one had ever heard of was keeping Josh Corman up at night. It was one of the only groups in the world that made an ingredient that pharmaceutical companies like Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech needed to make the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. And it didn’t employ a single cybersecurity expert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orAc42"&gt;Corman is a senior adviser to the United States’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and for the past year, he’s been working on a task force within the agency focused on protecting the COVID-19 vaccine supply chain from cyber threats. Healthcare organizations have been some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18293817/cybersecurity-hospitals-health-care-scan-simulation"&gt;biggest&lt;/a&gt; victims of growing waves of cyberattacks over the past few years, and during the pandemic, they were an even bigger target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CyIMLH"&gt;What worried Corman weren’t places like Pfizer and Moderna. Those big, name brand companies all employ in-house cybersecurity experts. He was worried about companies like the one making an mRNA ingredient: small, anonymous groups that made bits and pieces pivotal for vaccines, but that might not have ever thought they’d need to protect against a hacking campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6TBBn0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You could sneeze on that one company, and they would be disrupted.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R663eo"&gt;“You could sneeze on that one company, and they would be disrupted. And if they were disrupted, we’d be living in a very different world right now because they were so critical to those mRNA candidates,” Corman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rO6NpN"&gt;Over the past year, the task force tracked down hundreds of similar companies critical to the development, production, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the US. It offered to help them check for any gaps in their digital networks, give them resources to boost their preparedness, and help them respond to any incidents. A cyberattack on any of them could have slowed down the vaccine efforts, keeping shots out of reach for longer — at great cost to the health of the country, Corman says. “We wanted to make sure we had no delays because of cybersecurity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3kmkKJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re-creating the supply chain &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9GPdgc"&gt;The US approach to COVID-19 vaccine development ran through Operation Warp Speed — a $10 billion project that involved partnerships between biomedical companies and various agencies within the federal government, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Health and Human Services. It funded the development of vaccine candidates at companies like Moderna and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and was in close contact with others involved in manufacturing and distribution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1p0nh"&gt;“Operation Warp Speed is generally described as being around the 30 biggest companies related to vaccines — research, delivery, and all the way to shipping out to states,” says Beau Woods, a senior adviser at CISA working on the COVID-19 task force. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EouVFd"&gt;CISA was one of the other federal agencies pulled into Operation Warp Speed. It’s part of the Department of Homeland Security and is responsible for assisting both the government and the private sector on cybersecurity issues. Along with the COVID-19 response, it spent 2020 working on &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/trump-fires-cisa-director-chris-krebs/"&gt;security for the presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKsxLE"&gt;During Operation Warp Speed, CISA was asked to help with security for the main 30 players. “CISA has the ability to deliver protective, preventative, and response services to designated critical infrastructure. Anyone on that list was obviously prioritized,” Corman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="bthxJS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There were more companies involved with the vaccine development, production, and distribution process than just the ones on that list&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4jeZC3"&gt;But there were more companies involved with the vaccine development, production, and distribution process than just the ones on that list. Each of those 30 or so companies have their own supply chains, Woods says. The groups that made up those supply chains would need protection as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Er6O0c"&gt;When Corman started working on COVID-19 response efforts as part of the task force within CISA, those companies hadn’t been identified yet. No one knew who they were. “I asked, what are those smaller, less obvious players that, if they’re disrupted, means there’s no vaccine? And no one had an answer,” Corman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cUko0"&gt;Corman worked with colleagues like Michelle Holko, a presidential innovation fellow who worked with the task force, and Reuven Pasternak, another CISA senior adviser who’s also a physician, to develop a rubric that would help them identify those players. They looked for companies making products that were in short supply or couldn’t be easily replaced and companies making products that the groups making vaccines were highly dependent on. The group asked international partners to send them the names of any groups that could be important to the vaccine development process as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnu2rU"&gt;“We identified people who were never nominated at all, but bubbled up right to the top. Those were some of the most critically important weak links in the chain,” Corman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVrcgV"&gt;The list was dynamic — at the start of the process, it focused on groups involved in vaccine research and development. Then it shifted to companies working with the manufacturing and distribution of the shots. Overall, the group identified hundreds of companies involved in the process that could have been risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="naeN9h"&gt;“A lot of them are smaller. In some cases, they’d have fewer than 100 people, and may not have traditionally looked at cybersecurity threats,” Woods says. Because they were involved in the vaccine process, they were targets for hackers, but they didn’t have the know-how to protect against threats. “That’s where we focused,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WqKoId"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outreach efforts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="147AmC"&gt;After making that list of companies that could be potential targets for cyberattacks, the task force started reaching out to each one to offer its services. A big part of those early conversations involved making sure companies understood that the group wasn’t a regulatory body but was just coming in to offer a service, says Steve Luczynski, the lead of the CISA COVID-19 task force. “Everybody’s concerned when the government’s calling,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="w3ND86"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Everybody’s concerned when the government’s calling.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JLXY7x"&gt;But after they heard what the group was offering — help understanding any vulnerabilities, alerts about possible threats, and other guidance — many companies were eager to use their resources, Woods says. “In a few cases, we’ve had the organizations come back and say, ‘Hey we saw something, we think we got to it in time — but we’d love for you guys to just double check,’” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCeskG"&gt;Health IT and electronic health records company Cerner was one of the groups that worked with the CISA and the task force. &lt;a href="https://www.cerner.com/perspectives/supporting-the-covid19-vaccination-process-with-technology-and-data"&gt;Cerner assisted&lt;/a&gt; with scheduling, inventory, and dose tracking for organizations administering vaccines, and its electronic health records had data on people receiving the shots. Kevin Hutchinson, Cerner’s cybersecurity operations manager, had initially signed the company up for security alerts with CISA. The CISA task force then got in touch about participating in their other programs. “Given the footprint of Cerner, they were really excited to have us on board,” Hutchinson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xChyUK"&gt;The CISA team took a look at Cerner’s existing security protocols, which were already strong. “It was a good pat on the back that we were doing things that we should be,” Hutchinson says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0WxUf"&gt;Cerner also regularly meets with around a dozen of the largest hospital systems that use its services to talk about security, and a handful of those groups were also using CISA’s services. Many hospitals don’t have the funding for a dedicated security team. “They had mentioned how valuable it had been for them,” Hutchinson says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cei2wJ"&gt;The task force was able to offer services like scanning company systems for cybersecurity vulnerabilities and custom cyberintelligence tools, Woods says. But one of the most important parts of outreach was just creating a relationship with the company so that CISA was able to quickly relay any important information. “Part of it is just working out that trust, so that when they pick up the phone, they know who you are,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jVDogh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Part of it is just working out that trust, so that when they pick up the phone, they know who you are.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s1YXEK"&gt;Through those relationships, the task force and CISA helped companies respond to cyber threats over the course of the past year. Threats included a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/coronavirus-vaccine-hackers-phish-ibm-cold-chain/2020/12/03/27a5b0b2-355d-11eb-9699-00d311f13d2d_story.html"&gt;phishing campaign&lt;/a&gt; aimed at the cold chain vaccine transport system and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210667/solarwinds-hack-worse-government-microsoft-cybersecurity"&gt;SolarWinds hack&lt;/a&gt;, which targeted US government agencies. None had major impacts on the vaccine development and distribution process. “We had these good connections. We knew that this is the person to call, and here’s the email to send to, when these events happen,” Luczynski says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FG5In"&gt;Those connections could carry through into the future and help healthcare organizations manage cybersecurity threats. “I am happy to see greater engagement between CISA and healthcare, and I definitely hope that continues,” Woods says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKgBeQ"&gt;The work the task force did on the vaccine supply chain could also be a model for other projects in the future, he says. “A lot of times when the government works with the private sector, they’re most engaged with larger organizations because they don’t have connections with the smaller ones,” Woods says. This work showed that, many times, the riskiest areas are actually those smaller organizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Q8ssX8"&gt;So far, the COVID-19 vaccine development and distribution process hasn’t been delayed by any cyberattacks. Luczynski says the task force can’t take all the credit — it’s hard to say definitively if its work was the reason there weren’t major issues. But he thinks it made a difference. “I am confident we contributed to making things better.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukX5dl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And now, thanks to a new trailer, we’ve got our best look yet at the upcoming show, which is set to debut on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1104507/9358?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus &lt;/a&gt;on August 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDLZCn"&gt;As the name implies, &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; will showcase different versions of the MCU and answer questions like, “What if Peggy Carter was chosen to get the Super Soldier Serum instead of Steve Rogers?” or “What if Yondu kidnapped T’Challa instead of Peter Quill when he came to Earth?” Unlike the other Disney Plus Marvel shows, which are live-action, &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; also marks the first animated property in the MCU — a factor that makes it easier to revisit the altered storylines without, say, having to remake the entirety of &lt;em&gt;Captain America: The First Avenger&lt;/em&gt; in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="c04BTg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first animated MCU show&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Eo5Hx"&gt;In addition to a slew of Marvel regulars &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; — which is still considered part of the overarching MCU, despite its alt-universe tales — will introduce Uatu the Watcher (voiced by Jeffrey Wright) to the franchise as the show’s narrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQmO0E"&gt;Alternate takes on characters seem to be a popular theme in the MCU right now, with &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; already featuring a slew of different versions of the villain from across the timeline. (And with Marvel’s slate of films and shows continuing to expand, it’s possible &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt;’s animated hypotheticals could one day show up in live-action, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnEmil"&gt;The August release date makes perfect sense, too, given &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;’s season finale is about to wrap up on July 14th, making &lt;em&gt;What If...? &lt;/em&gt;the perfect way to make sure the biggest Marvel fans stay subscribed to Disney Plus for another month or two. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why did the Teletubbies forge their vaccination cards?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RX12pm"&gt;Look, the question isn’t &lt;em&gt;whether&lt;/em&gt; the vaccine cards the Teletubbies display in a tweet from Teletubbies HQ are forged. All you have to do is look at the date of the second vaccine: July 22nd, 2021 — that is, two weeks in the future. The question is what they hope to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cHG65I"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re all vaxxed! Just in time for a Tubby hot summer ☀️ Who's ready to come out &amp;amp; play &lt;a href="https://t.co/AtXTExaCMs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/AtXTExaCMs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Teletubbies (@TeletubbiesHQ) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeletubbiesHQ/status/1412790031530475524?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5vnipc"&gt;There’s more. Check out the dates of birth listed for the Teletubbies: all in 2003. The Teletubbies &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142055/"&gt;premiered on BBC2 in 1997&lt;/a&gt;. Famously, in 1999, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2017/12/jerry-falwell-and-tinky-winky-the-gay-teletubby.html"&gt;Jerry Falwell condemned Tinky Winky&lt;/a&gt; for being gay. The original run &lt;em&gt;ended &lt;/em&gt;in 2001. The Teletubbies are old enough to drink! A birthdate of 2003? &lt;em&gt;Who the fuck do these creatures think they’re kidding?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vPLcn"&gt;Look, I babysat my younger siblings while they watched the Teletubbies. I’ve had my eye on that Sun Baby for years — the Teletubbies’ god-king, who rules the psychedelic, rabbit-infested, post-apocalyptic word of these creatures. The careful rituals of appeasing the Voice Trumpets and containing the troubles of their misbehaving vacuum cleaner (“Noo-Noo”) are not foreign to me. I just want to know what the plot here is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJXGEL"&gt;There is one other oddity. It appears to be based on an American vaccination card, issued by the CDC. The dates on it are also rendered American style (month, day, year) instead of UK style (day, month, year). Is this a terrible plot by the Sun Baby to confuse UK children? Should we expect a future in which the UK switches to American date style?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="asGOvw"&gt;I don’t know what this means&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;but I don’t think it bodes well. Who can know what the Sun Baby ultimately wants? We never did learn why the Teletubbies worshiped it. Perhaps it is looking for more followers — and these vaccination cards are just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
