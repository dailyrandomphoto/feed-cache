    <title>Rivian files to go public at up to a reported $80 billion valuation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oSci-s4zz4znkxLnlY0qDxVZN0k=/621x504:2221x1571/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69784225/rivian_r1t_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rivian&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FfHS8z"&gt;Buzzy (and extremely well-funded) EV startup Rivian has filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission to go public. Rivian will be doing a traditional initial public offering, bucking the recent trend of electric vehicles going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U977yH"&gt;The company, which is backed by Amazon and Ford, announced that it submitted a draft registration statement for the IPO &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210827005292/en/Rivian-Announces-Confidential-Submission-of-Draft-Registration-Statement-for-Proposed-Public-Listing#.YSj7kO5r9HM.twitter"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. The draft will initially remain confidential, though &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-27/rivian-is-said-to-file-for-ipo-seek-about-80-billion-valuation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has reported that Rivian is seeking a valuation as high as $80 billion. The IPO date is expected to be sometime before the end of this year. When it happens, Rivian will add to a fundraising war chest that is already over $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="St6d4W"&gt;Rivian’s IPO filing comes as the startup is set to finally deliver its first vehicle: the R1T electric pickup truck. Originally revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18111782/rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-price-specs-la-auto-show-2018"&gt;at the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show&lt;/a&gt;, the R1T has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580293/rivian-delay-september-deliveries-electric-pickup-r1t-amazon"&gt;hit with multiple delays&lt;/a&gt;. Rivian’s second vehicle, an electric SUV known as the R1S, is supposed to follow soon after. Rivian is also developing electric delivery vans for Amazon, which owns at least 10 percent of the company following its investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZJ1Fb"&gt;Rivian bucking the SPAC trend fits the company’s longstanding pattern of zigging where other EV startups have zagged. While many of its peers (like Faraday Future, Byton, and Nio) emerged in the mid 2010s with splashy announcements and exorbitant spending, Rivian was founded in 2009 and stayed in stealth mode until 2018. Instead of trying to build its own factory, it bought an existing one and repurposed it (though it is now reportedly interested in building a second factory from scratch). Rivian spent a lot of time crafting a brand, too, instead of focusing solely on the technology it has been developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32DCy0"&gt;All told, it was an unusually methodical approach for an EV startup, but one that helped Rivian court big name investors and strategic partners along the way, setting it up for a big IPO that is now closer than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fA4ocC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota pauses self-driving ‘e-Palette’ service after one crashed into an Olympic athlete</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jpWlTgUDLV1qzKt0WAfbUt1lFoE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69784064/20201222_01_28.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AngzZd"&gt;Toyota has halted its autonomous shuttle service in Tokyo’s Olympic village after one of its vehicles collided with a visually impaired athlete, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-halts-all-self-driving-e-pallete-vehicles-after-olympic-village-accident-2021-08-27/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. Technically, the vehicle was not driving autonomously but was under manual control at the time of the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHZWyH"&gt;Toyota had been operating dozens of its “e-Palette” shuttles during the Olympics as a demonstration of a far-out concept &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/8/16863092/toyota-e-palette-self-driving-car-ev-ces-2018"&gt;the company first showed off in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Back then, the automaker said its e-Palettes, which are modular battery-electric vehicles without traditional controls like steering wheels or pedals, could operate either as ride-hailing shuttles or mobile retail spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRvMfN"&gt;Toyota saw the Olympics as an opportunity to demonstrate its new technology. The boxy vehicles were being used by athletes and Olympics staff for months prior to the start of the summer games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="la23Rp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota saw the Olympics as an opportunity to demonstrate its new technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VJO6Gw"&gt;But that came to an end this week, after one of the vehicles slammed into an athlete that was set to compete in the Paralympic Games. According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, the shuttle was at a T-intersection when it turned into the athlete at a speed of 1-2 kilometers-per-hour. The vehicle was under manual control at the time, with a human operator using the joystick control. The athlete was taken to a nearby medical center for treatment and was able to walk back to their residence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6yOyzR"&gt;Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda acknowledged the crash in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJXhG_hFNK4"&gt;a video posted to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. “It shows that autonomous vehicles are not yet realistic for normal roads,” he said, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gVQFv"&gt;A spokesperson confirmed that the e-Palette service has been halted as a result of the crash and could not say when it would be resumed. But this doesn’t spell the ultimate end of the e-Palette program, the spokesperson said. “This doesn’t mean the entire e-Palette program beyond its current use at the Games has been halted,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFDim3"&gt;Toyota’s shuttles look similar to the low-speed autonomous pods that are in operation in cities around the world. In 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20690793/self-driving-shuttle-crash-las-vegas-manual-controls-locked-away"&gt;a driverless shuttle crashed into a truck in Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; while in autonomous mode. Investigators later determined that the crash occurred partly because the safety operator inside the shuttle didn’t have direct access to the manual override controls. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga review: a promising start</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A laptop that knows its business&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="F8aoQS"&gt;Most people know a ThinkPad when they see it. While the line has evolved throughout its decades of existence, it’s maintained a consistent ThinkPad look, ThinkPad feel, and ThinkPad set of features, from the red keyboard nub to the trio of discrete clickers. The formula has a devoted following, and with good reason — it’s tried and true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktU91K"&gt;With the new Titanium line, Lenovo seems to be trying some new things on for size. For one, the first X1 Titanium Yoga is the thinnest ThinkPad ever made (not to be confused with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;ThinkPad X1 Nano&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;lightest&lt;/em&gt; ThinkPad ever made). There’s a hodgepodge of other stuff, too, including a 3:2 display (an aspect ratio you don’t see every day in the X1 series), a haptic touchpad, and a top cover that’s — as the name implies — actually made of titanium. There’s an IR webcam with human presence detection, a match-on-chip fingerprint reader, and two Thunderbolt 4 ports. It’s a grab bag of eccentric features thrown together into one new, very unique ThinkPad.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iPRUV"&gt;The result: fantastic. Sure, it’s a first-generation product, with some kinks to work out here and there. But with Intel’s 11th Gen processors and Evo certification in tow, the X1 Titanium Yoga is a solid contender in the premium business laptop sphere. It maintains the hallmarks of the ThinkPad line, but it’s unlike any ThinkPad we’ve ever seen before. I’m excited about this one, but I’m more excited for the next generation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fNwXjb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10720390"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="JdxzJj"&gt;Before we jump in, the usual disclaimer about ThinkPads: They’re expensive. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpadx1%2Fx1-titanium-g1%2F22tp2x1x1t1%23models&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22642876%2Flenovo-thinkpad-x1-titanium-yoga-review-windows-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;base X1 Titanium Yoga&lt;/a&gt; has an MSRP of $2,949, but is currently listed for $1,769.40. My test model has an MSRP of $3,369 but is listed for $1,674.39. (In case this wasn’t obvious, you should never pay full price for a ThinkPad.) This isn’t ridiculous as business laptops go, of course — a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpadx1%2Fx1-carbon-gen9%2F22tp2x1x1c9%3Fclickid%3DxW2XgoUiVxyLUhwwUx0Mo3ZwUkBWZyQeNViK1M0%26irgwc%3D1%26PID%3D221109%26acid%3Dww%253Aaffiliate%253Abv0as6%26visibleDatas%3D696%253AIntel%25C2%25AE%2520Core%25E2%2584%25A2%2520i5%253B704%253A16%2520GB&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22642876%2Flenovo-thinkpad-x1-titanium-yoga-review-windows-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9&lt;/a&gt; with comparable specs is currently listed at $1,727.40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxW71Z"&gt;Many ThinkPads have dizzying arrays of options to choose from, but the X1 Titanium Yoga’s selection is refreshingly straightforward. There are four processors, all of which support Intel’s vPro platform for remote management: the Core i5-1130G7 (which my test unit has), the Core i5-1140G7, and two Core i7 chips. The 1130G7 is the only processor available with 8GB of RAM; the other three come with 16GB. Human presence detection is also only available with the Core i5 models — you can’t get it with either Core i7, which is a bit frustrating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tEir6o"&gt;My model has the Core i5-1130G7, 16GB of RAM (soldered), 512GB of storage, and the presence-detection webcam. Like all models, it also has a 13.5-inch 2256 x 1504, 450-nit touch display, and ships with Lenovo’s Precision Pen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="j2wR60"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The X1 Titanium Yoga’s selection is refreshingly straightforward&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P5KvLp"&gt;The Titanium Yoga’s primary selling point is its category-topping portability. It’s 0.45 inches thick, making it no problem to slide into a packed backpack or briefcase. The 3:2 aspect ratio makes it a bit taller than most competitors of this size, so it’s not one of the lightest laptops on the market — but at 2.54 pounds, it’s still a pretty effortless lift. I could be convinced that I’m carrying an empty chassis, rather than a full system, when I walk around with this device. It’s hard to believe there’s a whole... computer inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8t5Ogq"&gt;Despite its thin frame, the Titanium Yoga is quite sturdy. Its lid is a combination of titanium and carbon fiber, while the rest is a more boring (and cheaper-feeling but still fine) magnesium aluminum. Lenovo claims to have tested the system against “12 military-grade certification methods and over 20 procedures.” I didn’t see any scratches or dinks in the chassis after my testing period, and the keyboard deck didn’t pick up a ton of fingerprints, though the lid did get a bit smudged. My only real complaint about the build quality is that I wish the hinge were sturdier. There was a decent amount of screen wobble when I used the stylus — so much that I mostly stuck with the touchpad in clamshell mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga from the left side with the stylus on top of the keyboard." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7HzJ0t26AhNMterxFRl6CuSE9Bw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763955/akrales_210804_4676_0119.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power button, audio jack, lock slot on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga seen from the left side half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/70zYadCdVMyqfXzvcLqMjIBibmk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763953/akrales_210804_4676_0098.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two Thunderbolt ports on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nV9Jgy"&gt;Laptops that are so extremely compact often come with significant tradeoffs for their size. There are a few worth noting here, though I wouldn’t call any of them disqualifying. The biggest drawback is certainly the haptic touchpad — as a space-saving measure it has no moving parts, so the clicking sensation is entirely simulated. While it convincingly emulates a regular touchpad, it has some other issues. It’s cramped for scrolling, its texture is a bit coarse for my liking, the click is stiff, and it’s not the most accurate — I sometimes felt like I had to coax the cursor to where it needed to go, and it occasionally thought I was scrolling or zooming in when I wasn’t trying to. This is one of those things I assume will improve over generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYGhMz"&gt;If you’re fed up with the touchpad, you do have the option of using the red keyboard nub or Lenovo’s Precision Pen, though there’s no garage to put the latter in (another space-saving measure). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nXThgD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I sometimes found myself having to lean in to hear the person speaking&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8g1Q0f"&gt;Another expected sacrifice is port selection. You get just two Thunderbolt 4 ports, both on the left side, one of which will be taken up by the charger. Get your dongles and docks ready. (There’s one audio jack and one Kensington lock slot as well.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNviBP"&gt;Finally, audio is also often a thin affair on thin-and-light laptops, and the Titanium Yoga’s two upward-firing speakers are no exception. They deliver audio that’s clear but not particularly deep. Bass is not present. During Zoom calls, I sometimes found myself having to lean in to hear the person speaking, even with the volume cranked all the way up. The microphones did do a fine job of picking up my voice despite some background noise, and the F4 key functions as a kill switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The left palm rest of the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga with the stylus laid diagonally across it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QBgzkvGKOX2G6qegTHnIbDfwwzE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763948/akrales_210804_4676_0058.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pen has 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity, according to Lenovo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The fingerprint sensor on the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VCSAUVTsgG3aXbxlgMlyN1wBsoM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763951/akrales_210804_4676_0069.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fingerprint sensor didn’t give me any trouble.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGEMh8"&gt;But there’s no compromise in arguably the most important part of the laptop: performance. The Core i5 isn’t a workstation chip, but it handled my hefty load of Chrome tabs, Spotify streaming, and Zoom calls with no problem. I never heard fan noise or felt uncomfortable heat, though the bottom of the chassis was consistently warm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJUCSQ"&gt;Battery life was okay, but not spectacular. The Yoga averaged seven hours and 52 minutes of continuous productivity work around medium brightness. While that doesn’t top the business category, it’s about what we expect from ThinkPads (we got a slightly worse result from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/12/17226578/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-2018-laptop-sixth-generation-windows-review-price-specs"&gt;the last X1 Carbon we reviewed&lt;/a&gt;). It means the device will just about get you through a work day if your load is similar to mine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo logo on the lid of the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KEFvNVJvcvx_PKXkXBj9ebblNZU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763954/akrales_210804_4676_0109.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use it in clamshell, tablet, or tent mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MTQ0oS"&gt;All in all, the ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga is an interesting bet. It’s clear that Lenovo has an eye on the traits that modern business users have been asking for: stylus support, the 3:2 aspect ratio, durability, and portability, in addition to the security of the vPro platform. The Titanium Yoga is the first iteration of a line that I’m very excited to see Lenovo making, and for that I think it deserves a high score. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNXvqG"&gt;With that said, I won’t pretend it’s the most practical purchase out there. It’s a first-generation product, and — as is often the case with first-generation products — there are some kinks to be worked out. The limited ports, the finicky touchpad, the shaky hinge, and the thin audio could all be overlooked on their own, especially as understandable sacrifices for the portable build — but they’re a lot to stomach as a package. I think the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22623290/thinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs"&gt;X1 Yoga&lt;/a&gt; and X1 Carbon, while a bit thicker, will be more pragmatic devices for the vast majority of users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="uiIkLk"&gt;But the Titanium Yoga is still quite an achievement, and I can’t wait for the next one. If Lenovo works out the kinks, it’ll be a spectacular product.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pIxkE1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10720435"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Ef42at"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10720873"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

No, it’s not the new IP67 dust and water resistance. It’s not the larger screen or the biggest battery in a Pixel yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htW8zR"&gt;It’s all about the headphone jack, or “the circle” as this very Jony Ive-esque spot constantly refers to it. Google is truly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/3/19/22340529/google-pixel-switch-commercial-edible-meditation-god"&gt;getting out there with its YouTube advertising&lt;/a&gt;, and you’ve probably never seen a video about a headphone jack quite like this. I mean, the ad uses footage of a space station docking to underline the “satisfying feeling of click” you get when plugging headphones into Google’s latest phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uauOJH"&gt;My favorite part is when it dives right into the nitty-gritty of headphone jack terminology: Google says the Pixel 5A is “designed to welcome both 1/8th-inch three-pole TRS and four-pole TRRS connections.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9xH7t"&gt;Even the video’s description is on point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="rPh1sp"&gt;Calling this perfectly-symmetrical, technological marvel, a “headphone jack” may feel like an understatement...but technically, that’s what it’s called, so... fair enough. Behold! The Headphone Jack, on the Google Pixel 5a with 5G. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KKp4kn"&gt;The narrator declares the Pixel 5A’s headphone jack to be “a glorious achievement that draws from our past as it propels us into the future.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBEFVC"&gt;But something about that line got to me. Because now, my friends, we must come tumbling back to reality, where that “future” only applies to the midrange Pixel. Google’s next flagship smartphones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, won’t have the circle. However perfect it might be, it’s been absent on the top-tier Pixels since the Pixel 2.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer gaming mice, headsets, and more are discounted at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PrCHFKFRWfxSckAFhdrnMtKAR8Q=/0x0:1120x747/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69783673/akrales_191104_3773_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Razer Basilisk Ultimate is just one of many big sales in today’s roundup&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ETWiCW"&gt;A wide variety of Razer gaming accessories are a featured &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/0211f3c4"&gt;deal of the day today at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. It’s advertised to get you “up to 30 percent off,” but there are deeply discounted products with items marked down as much as 40, 50, and 60 percent. Some notable ones to check out are the Razer Basilisk Ultimate wireless mouse for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Basilisk-Ultimate-HyperSpeed-Wireless/dp/B08564NLZG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$94.99&lt;/a&gt;, the BlackShark V2 wired headset for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackShark-Gaming-Headset-Detachable/dp/B086PKMZ1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$79.99&lt;/a&gt;, and the Huntsman TE TKL keyboard for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Huntsman-Tournament-Tenkeyless-Keyboard/dp/B07V25YPVW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$79.99&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4Du0Lu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10392735"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="70Rjb7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best wired or wireless gaming headsets to buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="kh4dSf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568257"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="PppS8d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10721765"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IUShup"&gt;Amazon-owned Eero launched its Eero 6 line of Wi-Fi 6 mesh routers late last year, and today it's on sale for a new low price that even beats the recent Prime Day discount. You can pick up the Eero 6 router and two extenders &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-eero-6-3-pack/dp/B085WSCTS4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Amazon for $195&lt;/a&gt;, a 30 percent discount. If you’re not familiar with mesh networks, they can be a great investment if you live in a space that struggles with reliable Wi-Fi coverage. Although neither extender offers an ethernet port, strategically placing the two extenders can still blanket your home with reliable internet, allowing for speeds of up to 500Mbps no matter where you are. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22193059/eero-pro-6-review-mesh-router-wifi-6-test-speeds-network"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Eero Pro 6 review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="TlkrAc"&gt;The base Apple Watch SE recently saw a healthy discount, but the larger, cellular-equipped version has now dropped to its best price ever. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5VZ3BS/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is offering the 44mm Apple Watch SE with cellular connectivity in silver with the navy sport loop for $299.99, a savings of $59. This is a fantastic deal for anyone who wants a bargain on a current Apple Watch, one that matches much of the performance of today’s flagship Series 6 and sports a larger display size than the Series 3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bVlSqC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10720656"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4zt6Ip"&gt;Also in the world of budget-friendly SE products from Apple is the iPhone SE (2020). This is the best bang-for-the-buck phone offering from Apple, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-2nd-Generation-64GB/dp/B08R988XHQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is offering an added discount on their “Renewed Premium” refurbished models. The red colorway with 64GB of storage clocks in at just $305, while the black and white models are $313 each. These phones are direct from Amazon and carry a one-year warranty. It assures that these iPhones are in like-new condition and with a minimum battery capacity of 90 percent. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XN5Ivn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10721721"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oyaayC"&gt;Oh, hello there! If you made it here you’re in for a nice little treat, because the Xbox Series S console will be in stock very soon at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08G9J44ZN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $300, its full retail price. It’s not a deal, per se, but much like the Xbox Series X, Microsoft’s adorable speaker-looking Xbox console has been notoriously difficult to find. It’s not as powerful as its larger brethren and lacks a disc drive, but it fits just about anywhere due to its small size. It also boasts sharp looks, an excellent catalog of new and old titles, and targets up to 1440p resolution in games. You can easily order it and have it shipped to you very soon, no queuing up necessary. Hopefully, it’s a small sign that console shortages are beginning to wane, though we’re not holding our breath yet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="VWVnMD"&gt;More great deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Hy8IhL"&gt;B&amp;amp;H has a daily deal on the Samsung 2TB T7 Touch Portable SSD. That is a lot of storage for an SSD, and for today only it’s an all-time low at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1540697-REG%2Fsamsung_mu_pc2t0s_ww_2tb_t7_touch_portable.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F27%2F22643232%2Frazer-gaming-accessories-xbox-s-apple-iphone-watch-se-eero-6-mesh-router-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$269.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mK1n5k"&gt;Amazon Warehouse items are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?i=warehouse-deals&amp;amp;bbn=16059675011"&gt;20 percent off today&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to hunt around for some sweet pricing on used gear like the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, gaming headsets, or a keyboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GFwkN0"&gt;Anker’s Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro noise-canceling earbuds are on clearance at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750207088602991622" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $97.99&lt;/a&gt; in black. That’s a cool $32 off on the wireless, IPX4-rated buds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d2aD3c"&gt;On the other side of the listening spectrum, Sennheiser’s PXC 550-II headphones are now &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPQQCVX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$156.59 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. That is a heavy markdown from the original $349.95 price tag affixed to the noise-canceling headphones, and a new historical low. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="j9V6Is"&gt;The midrange OnePlus Nord N10 5G, with its solid battery life and 90Hz refresh rate screen, is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Smartphone-Midnight-BE2026/dp/B08R7D4KZJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$279.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. It was well reviewed at its regular price of $300, and a little extra savings doesn’t hurt. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ahNIKc"&gt;First-person photography game &lt;em&gt;Umurangi Generation&lt;/em&gt; was an indie darling in 2020, making it into many “best of” lists and even winning the grand prize at the IGF Awards this year. The Nintendo Switch version, which added optional motion controls to compose your shots, is currently on sale with its &lt;em&gt;Macro&lt;/em&gt; DLC on the &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/umurangi-generation-special-edition-switch/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo eShop for $17.49&lt;/a&gt;, 25 percent off the list price.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Waymo will no longer sell its ‘Laser Bear Honeycomb’ lidar sensors to other companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bzkvW2HV3AG_wEPL7p0YFyka5QA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69783591/waymo_chrysler_pacifica_detroit_auto_show_2017_0192.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0YJyNZ"&gt;Waymo is getting out of the lidar selling business. The Alphabet-owned company said it would no longer sell its laser sensors to other companies, ending a nearly three-year-old revenue stream for the self-driving leader. The news was &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/2cba5c"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaJ4uJ"&gt;Lidar, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, are laser sensors that are seen as an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21165014/waymo-fifth-generation-self-driving-radar-camera-lidar-jaguar-ipace"&gt;essential component for self-driving cars&lt;/a&gt;. The sensors are placed on the roofs of autonomous vehicles, as well as the sides and grilles, where they send out thousands of laser points to map the surrounding environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJjhwr"&gt;Waymo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/8/14206084/google-waymo-self-driving-chrysler-pacifica-minivan-detroit-2017"&gt;first began manufacturing its own lidar sensors&lt;/a&gt; in early 2017 as a way to dramatically reduce the costs of its autonomous vehicle business. At the time, the company said that by making its own sensors, it could lower the unit price from $75,000 for an off-the-shelf lidar sensor to just $7,500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XFbLL7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Waymo first began manu&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;facturing its own lidar sensors in early 2017&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aglnFe"&gt;In 2019, Waymo went a step further, announcing that it would begin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/6/18252561/waymo-sell-lidar-laser-sensor-av-customer-robot-taxi-competition"&gt;selling its lidar&lt;/a&gt;, awesomely dubbed the “Laser Bear Honeycomb,” to customers that won’t compete with its robot taxi business. That included companies working on robotics, security, and agricultural technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fR3pU3"&gt;But it’s unclear how lucrative this business was for Waymo. The company did not disclose how many lidar it sold, nor how many clients had purchased them. A spokesperson said Waymo would continue to make its lidars in-house for its own vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2OpHM"&gt;“We’re winding down our commercial lidar business as we maintain our focus on developing and deploying our Waymo Driver across our Waymo One (ride-hailing) and Waymo Via (delivery) units,” a Waymo spokesperson said in a statement. “As we continue to advance our technology and scale our business, we’re focused on areas that will be most impactful for Waymo’s core businesses and in service of our mission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUxq3J"&gt;After over a decade of working on this technology, Waymo has only a little bit of actual revenue flowing in. It operates a robotaxi service in the suburbs around Phoenix, Arizona, where it conducts around 1,000-2,000 rides every week. The company recently announced plans to launch a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639226/waymo-san-francisco-rides-self-driving-service"&gt;similar service in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;. It also has a number of delivery pilots involving its autonomous semi-trailer trucks, but it’s not known how much revenue Waymo generates from those, if any. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLFDE5"&gt;In 2020, it was estimated that &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/money-pit-self-driving-cars-16-billion-cash-burn"&gt;Alphabet had spent over $3.5 billion on Waymo&lt;/a&gt; over the years. Those costs are expected to rise as the company seeks to ramp up its autonomous taxi and delivery services. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Twitter outage cut off the Midwest this morning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MI7CpdNE0uIoNccECv4oTM2Y7QE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69783501/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QWeUdl"&gt;For slackers west of the Appalachians there was some bad news — Twitter went down. An outage unplugged many people beyond the East Coast of the US starting at around 8:30AM ET, with reports from as far north as Toronto and as far south as Arkansas. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="DownDetector Twitter outage reports" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/khtpvpTAkB84ND4Nlo03BXu0v08=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22809177/downdd.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/twitter/map/" target="_blank"&gt;DownDetector.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DownDetector Twitter outage reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IGOGiD"&gt;Twitter has not updated its status page to note any particular issue, but &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/twitter/map/"&gt;DownDetector&lt;/a&gt; and other social media platforms are hosting the suddenly silenced voices of your favorite Midwestern cities. Since I live in Michigan, I’ve one of them, which didn’t make this any easier to figure out. There don’t appear to be any wider CDN problems or issues with a cloud service like AWS, but remember, the answer is always &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/WmRbmf5.png"&gt;it’s DNS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sV9Q2Q"&gt;For everyone outside that area, if you have something to get off your chest about someone who lives in Chicago then you may have missed your chance — it appears that service is being restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P6sO2x"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Some of you may have experienced an issue loading Twitter just now. This has been fixed.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When paying for porn gets complicated&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4381hb"&gt;Last week, OnlyFans — one of the internet’s best-known porn platforms — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22640988/onlyfans-no-ban-porn-sexually-explicit-content-creators"&gt;almost banned porn&lt;/a&gt;. The company said it would no longer allow “explicit sexual content” in the future, before reversing the policy unexpectedly the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="MbhR6C"&gt;Sex workers had built OnlyFans into a multibillion-dollar subscription platform, and after the news, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jg89mb/sex-workers-describe-the-instability-and-necessity-of-onlyfans"&gt;many have explained&lt;/a&gt; why the proposed change was such a betrayal. They helped make the company valuable, and in return, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638310/onlyfans-ban-explicit-content-payment-processing-visa"&gt;nearly kicked them out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouzHZo"&gt;Less immediately clear, however, was OnlyFans’ rationale. Early reports speculated that a new set of Mastercard rules were responsible for the change. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7b8ce71c-a87a-440e-9f3d-58069ca0480b"&gt;A later &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; interview&lt;/a&gt; placed the blame on banks. While we might never know exactly what happened at OnlyFans, its decision — and reversal — shines a light on the complicated and fraught world of paying for porn online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9BJp4f"&gt;What is OnlyFans?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HOL4nK"&gt;OnlyFans is a UK-based online subscription platform that was founded in 2016. Users can “follow” creators and get access to exclusive content, paying with a monthly fee or one-time tip, while OnlyFans takes a 20 percent cut of the funds. While the app is general-purpose, OnlyFans has proven &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/style/onlyfans-porn-stars.html"&gt;particularly useful&lt;/a&gt; for sex workers who want to sell pictures and videos or hold personal chats with clients. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/23/everyone-and-their-mum-is-on-it-onlyfans-boomed-in-popularity-during-the-pandemic"&gt;exploded in popularity&lt;/a&gt; during the coronavirus pandemic, currently reporting 1.5 million content creators, 150 million registered users, and $5 billion paid annually to creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UDTZfq"&gt;What’s been happening with OnlyFans and sexual content?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9iQC3z"&gt;Late last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634785/onlyfans-new-terms-of-service-policy-banning-sex-masturbation"&gt;OnlyFans announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would ban content that posted, advertised, or referred to “sexually explicit content.” It would allow nudity, but not real or simulated sexual activity or a variety of other conduct. The change was set to take place on October 1st, leaving many OnlyFans sex workers scrambling for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qs0d2D"&gt;Then OnlyFans reversed course. On Wednesday, it declared that it had “secured assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community.” It suspended its plans for the new policy, and as of this writing, there’s no indication it will reimplement the ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CCqdRK"&gt;Why did OnlyFans plan to ban porn?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bpAgll"&gt;The short answer, according to OnlyFans CEO Tim Stokely, was “banks” — which Stokely said wouldn’t work with OnlyFans because of its reputation as a porn platform. But that answer followed a heated discussion about the complicated world of paying for sex work online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xlw8Ci"&gt;Payment processing can be opaque and costly for all kinds of web platforms, but adult sites particularly struggle at nearly every step of the financial chain. That’s on top of problems that individual sex workers face with banks and payment processors, which might ban them with little recourse even for non-sex-related transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0CLeX"&gt;Mike Stabile, director of public affairs at the adult industry group Free Speech Coalition, explains that launching a platform requires establishing a direct relationship with a bank or using a payment processor that accepts adult industry clients. In turn, banks and processing gateways need to comply with rules set by Mastercard and Visa. (American Express doesn’t support digital adult content at all.) “At every point, there’s a potential where someone is not going to want to work with you, because you’re adult content,” says Stabile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Idn6V6"&gt;Beyond the policies of any one specific institution, these issues all contribute to an environment where losing support from any partner can be risky for a company like OnlyFans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OsngGp"&gt;Why don’t financial companies want to work with adult sites?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PLPyoS"&gt;Part of the problem is an unusually high risk of disputed charges — from customers who make a purchase but deny it out of embarrassment, for instance, and try to get their money back. Stabile says there’s also a ripple effect where financial companies worry about violating Visa and Mastercard’s adult content rules and may act even more conservatively, overshooting the mark of the actual policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBTFtt"&gt;These issues are nearly as old as online porn payments, but they’ve been exacerbated by a recent effort to cut off revenue to adult services. As longtime sex work reporter &lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160488/nick-kristof-holy-war-pornhub"&gt;Melissa Gira Grant has documented&lt;/a&gt;, religious organizations like Exodus Cry and the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (formerly Morality in Media) have pushed regulators and companies to crack down on major adult platforms. While they’ve framed this fight as an anti-trafficking movement and pointed out real instances of abuse, they target sexual content as a whole, even that made voluntarily by independent sex workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NY1AM"&gt;Anti-porn activists scored a major victory when Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to Pornhub — the video site run by adult services juggernaut MindGeek — following &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; pointing to nonconsensual pornography and videos of children on the site. In April, Mastercard introduced new rules for all adult services, requiring them to verify performers’ ages and their consent to have content posted. The rules are set to take effect in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLh0gh"&gt;The OnlyFans and Pornhub conflicts take place against a long-running online legal crackdown on sex work. OnlyFans became popular in the wake of FOSTA-SESTA, the law that removed substantial legal protections for sex workers and the platforms that host them. After it announced its ban, writer and porn performer &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/08/onlyfans-sex-banned-allowed-decision-history.html"&gt;Stoya detailed years of political decisions and social factors&lt;/a&gt; that helped set the stage, as well as sex workers’ ongoing efforts to organize against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ewgjQE"&gt;Is OnlyFans in the same position as Pornhub?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MuILdF"&gt;OnlyFans and Pornhub share one big similarity: they’re major adult content providers that are receiving a lot of outside scrutiny. Around OnlyFans’ announcement, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58255865"&gt;the BBC published&lt;/a&gt; a report that OnlyFans was giving popular accounts extra leeway when they posted illegal content. And in March, &lt;a href="https://forensicnews.net/banks-flagged-leonid-radvinsky-for-potential-money-laundering-underage-activity/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forensic News&lt;/em&gt; published&lt;/a&gt; a report alleging that OnlyFans’ majority owner Leonid Radvinsky could be linked with money laundering operations, directly highlighting banks that had flagged suspicious activity around Radvinsky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cdNrKh"&gt;Stokely suggested that banks had been spooked by negative reporting on OnlyFans. “Banks read the same media as everyone else,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpM2AC"&gt;But the two services otherwise work very differently. Pornhub is a huge streaming portal full of content that’s historically gotten limited vetting, along the lines of YouTube. (It introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173858/pornhub-videos-removed-user-uploaded-visa-mastercard-verified"&gt;new verification rules&lt;/a&gt; after the Visa and Mastercard ban.) OnlyFans is more like Patreon: a monetization platform connecting users with specific creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qhgFyN"&gt;In some ways, OnlyFans’ subscription system is part of a direct backlash against Pornhub’s free distribution model, which has drawn harsh criticism from sex workers for hosting pirated and nonconsensually posted content. Like many creator platforms, OnlyFans has huge disparities in income — but some users can earn big payouts by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21439657/onlyfans-tiktok-subscribers-videos-fans"&gt;cultivating a direct feedback loop&lt;/a&gt; between OnlyFans and social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MdeDZx"&gt;What do Mastercard’s rules mean for OnlyFans-style subscription sites?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="K6wkN1"&gt;The new rules place more responsibility on platforms to check creators’ identities and documentation. “It’s something that we can do, but it’s also time-consuming and expensive,” says Kat Revenga, vice president of subscription service FanCentro. Revenga says the new rules require maintaining extra records, and as FanCentro has tested age verification tools like facial age estimation, it’s had to balance them with privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UTN2t1"&gt;But to some extent, these sites are simply building out an existing system. “We never allowed people to upload content if they weren’t verified — and we verify age, we verify that their ID is not fake, we verify it’s them in the ID,” says Dominic Ford, creator of the platform JustForFans. “We were already doing that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxTf0w"&gt;For its part, OnlyFans has denied the planned changes were related to Mastercard’s policies. “We’re already fully compliant with the new MasterCard rules, so that had no bearing on the decision,” Stokely told the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7edK3Y"&gt;Websites obviously sold porn before OnlyFans. Why can’t it work with whatever payment companies they use?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HkPE4y"&gt;OnlyFans hasn’t outlined exactly which companies it works with. But Stabile says it appears to have built more mainstream banking relationships than many adult companies. The platform has so far avoided being pigeonholed as &lt;em&gt;exclusively&lt;/em&gt; a sex-related platform, frequently highlighting its creators in other industries and launching a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628521/onlyfans-app-ios-android-oftv-no-nudity"&gt;fully safe-for-work mobile app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhKrIP"&gt;If OnlyFans isn’t being treated like an adult company, that probably saves it a massive amount of money. Partly because of the risks mentioned above, companies that focus on sex typically face much higher fees than generic platforms. “Anybody that we touch charges us because we work in adult [services],” says Ford — from JustForFans’ payment processors to its payroll services. “There’s absolutely no comparison.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvuyOK"&gt;Lower rates could help OnlyFans pass more money to creators. Ford says JustForFans, which recently dropped its commission from 30 to 20 percent, has struggled to support the kind of rates it wants to offer thanks to fees. But it means sex workers also have to weigh the risk that OnlyFans might abandon them like it almost did last week. “They’ve never wanted to be a porn site,” says Ford. “At what point do you as a sex worker say, this site does not want me — let me go to a site that does?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O8NAti"&gt;Could platforms bypass all these problems with cryptocurrency?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IrSnuQ"&gt;Some porn platforms accept cryptocurrency or &lt;a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/adult-cryptocurrency-xxxnifty-onlyfans"&gt;help sex workers sell NFTs&lt;/a&gt;. But right now, Visa and Mastercard remain indispensable. Lots of users don’t hold cryptocurrency and aren’t going to acquire it specifically to spend on a subscription site, especially when there’s the chance of holding it until it appreciates. To reach even a fraction of OnlyFans’ size, you simply have to accommodate non-crypto users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nlY5nK"&gt;“For the immediate time, we don’t have a choice. We can try to work with these institutions or we can lose the ability to process payments,” says Revenga. JustForFans users can choose to bypass payment processing fees by using cryptocurrency, but Ford says it’s not a popular option: since its launch in 2018, its entire crypto-based earnings equal about one day’s worth of traditional payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="S4sedv"&gt;Now that OnlyFans reversed its plans, what happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hqZPnw"&gt;Even if nothing explicitly changed, OnlyFans has probably shaken some users’ faith in the service. JustForFans, FanCentro, and other competitors like ManyVids both saw a huge jump in signups after the ban was announced, although it’s too early to say if those users and creators will stick around. But it’s tough for creators to leave a platform where they’ve built their fan base, especially when they face the added challenge of selling adult content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="WrHxaP"&gt;Meanwhile, OnlyFans may still eventually have to decide between serving adult content creators and keeping its mainstream status — and even if it won this round, banks still hold a lot of the cards. “Given the cost of losing a bank, you have to do what they say,” says Stabile. “If you’re making $300 million [a month] and that’s what you’re fundraising on, and that’s going to be cut in half because you’re going to lose the mainstream bank that processes with you, that’s going to affect everything.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Six things we learned about Elden Ring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cbtS3__8h9h0FkDeyuE3Smf9P_Y=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69783072/ELDENRING_25.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;More details on the collaboration between George R.R Martin and FromSoftware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7apIzv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; is a collaboration between two masters of fantasy: &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; author George R.R Martin and &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; studio FromSoftware, led by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18272238/hsekiro-shadows-die-twice-idetaka-miyazaki-interview-dark-souls"&gt;visionary director Hidetaka Miyazaki&lt;/a&gt;. With big names like those come equally big expectations, and the game has been hotly anticipated, even as players have seen little of it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18647110/elden-ring-leak-george-rr-martin-from-software-ps4-xbox-e3-2019"&gt;since it was announced in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22307059/elden-ring-george-rr-martin-fromsoftware-e3-2021-trailer-gameplay"&gt;The first gameplay trailer was revealed in June&lt;/a&gt;.) In many ways, it’s a big departure for the studio, with a more traditional story structure and an ambitious open world to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tlv7k1"&gt;To get a better sense of what &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; actually is, I recently had the chance to view a hands-off demo and chat with FromSoftware’s Yasuhiro Kitao to learn about its development and philosophy. Here are six things I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="elden ring" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_IC2VMy4PIxS4TLyzSXrIBJleYY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22808388/ELDENRING_22.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IAvDd0"&gt;The world is huge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDqk9L"&gt;For the first time, FromSoftware is tackling an open world. Called the “Land Between,” &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;’s fantasy realm is a series of dungeons connected by a vast overworld. It’s a big change for the studio — and it involved a lot of iteration and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0kwH5"&gt;“When we first set out, we knew we wanted to create a very large world, and have that interspersed with these legacy dungeons, that sort of structure,” Kitao says. “But we thought the overworld would become a lot more flat and plain, and be there to connect these dungeons. As we built it out, we learned that we wanted the Lands Between to have a lot more character, and a lot more verticality, and more intricate design. So we ended up handcrafting a lot of this map, and trying to make it as interesting to explore as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SDzW1n"&gt;But it won’t be a chore to traverse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gDFLGM"&gt;One of the key tenets of the world design, though, is that the studio didn’t want its scale to be a hindrance. Instead, there are a number of features — such as a &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;-like system where you can drop waypoints on the map — meant to make it easier to manage getting around. Here’s Kitao on some of the other new traversal-related features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="owm3RR"&gt;As we built out the open world, we realized we wanted to alleviate player frustration as much as possible with these large distances involved. We have our existing corpse run system carried over from previous games, but we didn’t want that to be a frustrating or stressful aspect for the player to have to run all the way across the map to collect their experience points. So one thing we did was, in an area with a high level of challenge, we’ve placed these retry points — that’s still a tentative name — and if the player finds that, they’ll have the option when they die of respawning from the retry point or the last checkpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uG1Q70"&gt;Also, by opening the map, the player can fast travel to any previously visited “site of lost grace,” as long as they’re not within a dungeon currently. It just alleviates some of that stress, and having this burden in the back of your mind of having to travel all the way back to where you’ve previously been. It streamlines that a little bit. Of course we’re conscious of the fact that the world is so big, and we wanted it to be filled with interesting discoveries and encounters. And so we’re currently in the middle of fine-tuning that pacing and that tempo of what you run into out in the overworld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="elden ring" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06iCxV_Zi0TqxJ-aupkRlxTwtkI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22808411/ELDENRING_21.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TDU8vB"&gt;You get a ghost horse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="u7nutk"&gt;Maybe the best part of the open world is that you’ll get a horse, called a spirit steed, to move around quicker. It looks cool and can even accompany you into battle. More importantly — as has been the case in games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/12/8586515/witcher-3-wild-hunt-review-ps4-xbox-one-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16978294/shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-remaster-ps4-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Colossus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — it sounds like you’ll be able to form a connection with your ethereal horse over the course of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5rMan"&gt;“We hope that players can form at least a small bond with the spirit steed,” says Kitao. “It is a unique creature that is inherited by the player, so it is unique to them. You can’t choose or ride any horse in the game. You will be able to do small interactions, such as feeding it to regain its health and small things like this. Hopefully through this the player will be able to form a small attachment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DVSoLi"&gt;George R.R. Martin set the stage, but FromSoftware took it from there&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iJ1l7G"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; is billed as a collaboration between Martin and FromSoftware, but the reality sounds slightly less involved than that. Instead of working on the game together simultaneously, Martin got things started by outlining the world and its history, before passing it off to the studio to make the game. Here’s how Kitao explains the working relationship:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FI0wQs"&gt;George R.R. Martin provided us the mythos for the world, which takes place many, many years before the events of the game, and really shapes a lot of the current state of the world and its characters. We think this original mythos that he created really had a lot of influence on our approach to the narrative this time. George R.R. Martin was kind enough to hand that over for us to do what we want with it, and Miyazaki has had a lot of fun playing around with that mythos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTwCwB"&gt;We felt it was a really inspiring collaboration. When George R.R. Martin says “Okay, here’s the mythos, do what you will with it,” Miyazaki is just going to run with it. So he’s really taken a lot of inspiration. Miyazaki has really been free to take his own interpretations and create his own characters based off of that. He’s really enjoyed having this script as a backbone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Z1WNSz"&gt;FromSoftware is taking a different approach to storytelling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ddrkyy"&gt;To go along with this, &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; appears to be a different — and more traditional — approach to storytelling for FromSoftware. The studio’s past work, from &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;, has been defined in part by deep, convincing worlds that required the players to piece things together themselves. But &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; looks to be a little more like a conventional fantasy story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDBtf7"&gt;“We’ve always tried to make our games approachable and have interesting narratives, but the player has always been getting caught up in something preexisting, and been taken along for a ride,” Kitao says. “This time they have more agency, they have more ambition, and an overarching objective within that fantasy. We feel like this will be very different to our previous titles. Instead of just being a sick foreigner who has come to Yharnam, or an undead warrior who finds himself in a bleak landscape, the player has returned to the Lands Between as a ‘tarnished’ in search of the Elden Ring’s power, to uncover its mysteries. It’s a very simple premise but it helps to drive that mainline story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="elden ring" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fFIJVhOwHCInA3riLjMH1-orPIY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22808517/ELDENRING_23.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UT0yGk"&gt;The monsters are terrifying&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TMe5IQ"&gt;One thing that hasn’t changed: &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; still has the inventive and often horrifying monsters for which From games are known. During a brief gameplay video I witnessed gigantic dragons, a troll that look ripped from &lt;em&gt;Attack on Titan&lt;/em&gt;, an unsettlingly stretchy snake-man, and a boss that looked like a whole bunch of dead bodies smushed together. At one point there was a giant bird with swords in its talons, tossing explosive barrels at the player. According to Kitao, the variety and creativity of From’s creature designs comes in part from the studio’s process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="aEurpw"&gt;What tends to happen is Miyazaki will provide some keywords about what sort of creature he wants, and then he’ll give that to the design team. He won’t start with an image. And they’re free to interpret that as they will. That begins this collaboration between Miyazaki and the design team. This doesn’t just apply to the creatures and the monsters, but basically all of the elements of the game, weapons, equipment, characters. It’s a lengthy process, but we think the result is that we get things from each of our artists, working with Miyazaki, to create these things that maybe have not been seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAHxyn"&gt;One example is the demigods, the boss characters in the game. The keywords for them were they were “Old heroes from the Lands Between.” So we wanted them to have this heroic and majestic quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fq1Hfp"&gt;Whenever we have these design discussions, we try to have the game designers and the game planners involved. They’re always able to watch how this design takes shape and how it’s going to be presented in the game. And while the design does take precedence, but you don’t want anything too crazy to break the game. We try to keep everyone involved in the discussion from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SzYcNV"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Elden Ring &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is launching January 21st on a huge range of platforms, including PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter starts launching Ticketed Spaces for some iOS users</title>

  &lt;p id="wJoh7l"&gt;Twitter is beginning its rollout of Ticketed Spaces, or paid live audio rooms. The company announced yesterday that it’s “experimenting” with the feature for some iOS users. It first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545167/twitter-opens-super-follows-ticketed-spaces-new-feature-test-application-ios-android"&gt;rolled out applications&lt;/a&gt; to try the product in June with the plan to eventually make it available to all interested iOS and Android users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDJBXE"&gt;“Know it’s taking us a little time, but we want to get this right for you,” Twitter wrote in its announcement yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DD99im"&gt;Hosts can charge between $1 and $999 for their ticketed rooms and can also set a room size cap for them. These test group participants will initially keep 97 percent of the money they make, after the fee Apple and Google charge for in-app purchases. But Twitter will increase its cut from 3 percent to 20 percent if a user makes a total of $50,000 across their earnings on the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUlmKG"&gt;This fee will also increase when the feature is more widely available. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447328/twitter-ticketed-spaces-monetization-stripe-approval"&gt;a preview&lt;/a&gt; of the feature in May, Twitter said hosts would instead keep 80 percent of their revenue, after app store fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVOQQB"&gt;In the months since Twitter announced and previewed Ticketed Spaces, it’s also made changes to how people can find these live audio rooms; they now show up for some users at the top of the mobile Twitter app if someone a user follows is only listening to a space. They used to have to be hosting. (You can hide this activity from your own account through the settings menu.) It also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631036/twitter-spaces-developers-api-v2"&gt;updated&lt;/a&gt; its API, so third-party apps can point users to Spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
