    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mpzFb6"&gt;There is no better screen in the world of tablets (yet) than the Mini LED panel on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro of 2021. While Mini LED is not super common yet — though we did see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22871890/computer-monitors-ces-2022-lg-samsung-asus-alienware-oled-qd-mini-led-ark"&gt;more of it announced at CES 2022&lt;/a&gt; — it’s appealing as it achieves deeper black levels, a high contrast ratio, and high brightness. It’s also more expensive than a traditional LCD panel, so any dollar saved can be a worthwhile one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kcfaiz"&gt;If you want that Mini LED-equipped iPad Pro, we have a solid discount to share. Apple’s Wi-Fi-equipped base 128GB storage configuration is $100 off. This model usually runs for $1,099, but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932BKSLP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling it in the silver colorway for $999. The 2021 iPad Pro also packs Apple’s stellar M1 processor, ensuring its performance can not only push all those pixels but do so with speed and with the promise of enough performance headroom to likely stay that way for years to come. If you prefer more storage, you can get the 256GB configuration for $1,099 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F385211636&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals011222" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (also $100 off). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VjMeBq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aYPmhE"&gt;The PowerA Fusion Pro wireless controller for Switch is an intriguing alternative to Nintendo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/24/14699044/nintendo-switch-pro-controller-hands-on-preview"&gt;Switch Pro controller&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XXTW41G?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has the Fusion Pro in its slick white-and-black colorway for $65.99, a savings of $34 off its usual price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zjE22"&gt;The PowerA Fusion Pro may be worth considering if you want to try something that’s as close as you can get to a Switch-equivalent to the Xbox Elite controller. It has customizable analog sticks and optional rear paddle buttons. When it’s wired to your Switch dock, its 3.5mm headphone jack can pipe game audio to your headphones. It also lacks some things found in the Switch Pro controller, like rumble and Amiibo support. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22608203/powera-fusion-pro-customizable-analog-sticks-paddles-nintendo-switch-controller-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lt5ZZK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10973226"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qrvxhl"&gt;From a cute white controller to a cute white camera, the Wyze Cam v3 is an inexpensive home camera that supports 1080p recording with weather resistance for outdoor use. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095NWYQBC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has it with kitted out with a spotlight LED for just $36.60, saving about $16 and making it an excellent option for monitoring a front door, like a mini flood light for a much cheaper price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cq87FF"&gt;The Wyze Cam v3 also supports both color and black-and-white night vision, so its ability to see in the dark is quite good even when the spotlight is not in use. These little cameras are some of the most affordable ones around, offering solid video quality with motion detection, two-way audio, and support for both Alexa and Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mnpk7X"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Wyze’s security camera pay-what-you-want subscription accepts $0","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22879759/wyze-cam-plus-lite-pay-what-you-want-subscription-person-detection-cloud-recordings-12-seconds"},{"title":"Wyze’s cameras can now be a monitored home security system","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750594/wyze-cams-monitored-security-smart-switches-price-release-date-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="hVbINL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10973234"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tAKO0S"&gt;While the recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22870203/ces-2022-best-of-gadgets-concepts-tech"&gt;CES 2022&lt;/a&gt; announcements featured new innovations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865220/sony-a95k-qd-oled-qdoled-4k-tv-announced-features-explainer"&gt;coming to OLED TVs&lt;/a&gt;, the promise of even better tech will ultimately bring us even more expensive OLEDs. As for the here and now, the 48-inch LG A1 OLED is just $796.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Built-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED48A1PUA/dp/B092LZNZB7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, saving $403 off MSRP. The A1 may not be the top tier in LG’s lineup, but if you don’t need a giant TV you can’t go wrong saving money on this affordable panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiTCRr"&gt;OLEDs are a great choice in general for deeper black levels and excellent contrast, but you don’t have to break the bank. We have featured the popular LG C1 OLED TVs numerous times, though today’s deal on its entry-level A1 counterpart gets us below $1,000 — not something you see every day for OLED. Unlike the C1, which features a 120Hz refresh rate and HDMI 2.1 ports, the A1 tops out at 60Hz and doesn’t support 4K at 120Hz. Still, it seems like a solid TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LyFvW0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10959416"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tj92BW"&gt;More deals to deal with:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="L6SAZv"&gt;The Razer Nari Essential gaming headset is a bit long in the tooth, but if you don’t mind Micro-USB charging it seems like a fine wireless headset for just $41.99 ($58 off MSRP) at &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-13527013?sid=vergedailydeals011222&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Frazer-nari-essential-gaming-headset-27" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Kirby’s post-apocalyptic Switch adventure is coming in March</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V2nEwwzbe0lUpGHwU7z8wAijWno=/0x0:5400x3600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378832/KirbyandtheForgottenLand_KeyArt_16x9.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UrgsKR"&gt;Horizon Zero Kirby, better known by its official title, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689905/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-trailer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kirby and the Forgotten Lands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, launches on March 25th and has a new trailer showing off the game’s co-op features and all the cool powers you’ll be able to suck out of the local fauna. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtcSPA"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Kirby and the Forgotten Lands&lt;/em&gt;, the eponymous Pepto-Bismol-colored creature travels to a mysterious land dotted with overgrown buildings and rusted-out cars to investigate the mass kidnappings of Waddle Dees. Kirby, eater of worlds, is joined on his journey by a cute blue sidekick called Elfilin, who will help him defeat the evil Beast Pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVjjrF"&gt;The trailer showcases two new abilities Kirby can learn using his power of vore: Drill and Ranger. With Drill, Kirby can dive underground dodging attacks and surprise enemies from below. The Ranger ability gives Kirby a blunderbuss that he can use to snipe enemies from afar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dH3sO7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kirby and the Forgotten Lands&lt;/em&gt; features a town populated by the Waddle Dees Kirby saves. The more Waddles he rescues, the more amenities and mini-games are unlocked in the town. Kirby can moonlight at the Waddle Dee Café, serving up delicious treats quickly and to the right patrons to beat the high score. There’s also fishing and gacha games Kirby can play. The journey through the Forgotten Lands can be solo or local co-op, with a second player taking command of Bandana Waddle Dee. Though there is no online co-op, players can connect online to see interesting stats like the most-used copy ability or how many Waddle Dees players have saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eaXtR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kirby and the Forgotten Lands&lt;/em&gt; releases on the Nintendo Switch March 25th, 2022. This year also marks Kirby’s 30th anniversary, long may he &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/XBvRzwXxzSQ"&gt;poyo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s The House is an unsettling anthology wrapped in cozy stop-motion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The House" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wVFHVLI_thRY-DS65Z30eWAzOE4=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378802/The_House_Chapter3_01_01_26_08.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YFwmIs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The House&lt;/em&gt;, one of Netflix’s first new releases of the year, is a straightforward concept. It’s a film split into three chapters, each helmed by a different director, all of which explore a different story related to the same sprawling home. What connects each short, aside from the physical house and stop-motion animation, is a creeping sense of dread. &lt;em&gt;The House&lt;/em&gt; looks cute, with talking animals and dollhouse-like visuals, but in each story there’s something lurking just beneath the surface; something wrong, unsettling. It could be a recession or a scary creature — but when you put it together the result is an anthology with a trio of distinct, yet clearly connected stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xEnSEO"&gt;The first chapter, directed by Marc James Roels and Emma de Swaef, is an origin story of sorts, which opens with the ominous phrase, “and heard within, a lie is spun.” It’s a story about envy: when visiting relatives mock a young family’s home, the father makes a drunken arrangement with an eccentric architect offering to build them the house of their dreams free of charge. Initially, it’s an almost idyllic scenario; not only is the house huge and beautiful, but food appears as if from nowhere and the lights turn themselves on. But slowly things unravel. One day stairs go missing as the architect decides to rearrange his masterpiece, while zombie-like workers lurk around in silence. Later the architect gifts the parents bizarre clothing to match the decor. It’s hard to tell whether something supernatural is going on or if it’s just a cruel psychological experiment, and it’s all rendered in soft felt that only adds to the surreality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rm8K7R"&gt;Later stories move the timeline forward. Chapter two, directed by Niki Lindroth von Bahr, is set in modern times, when a struggling contractor — who is also a mouse — is renovating the house in an attempt to make some big money. Unfortunately, everything seems to go wrong; not only is he investing everything in the project in the midst of a recession, but he has to deal with persistent problems like a mysterious bug infestation. When the house is complete, only one couple bites: and there is something clearly wrong with them. I won’t spoil anything, but this one is worth watching for the final twist alone. The last chapter, helmed by Paloma Baeza, pushes things further into the future when the house is surrounded by a flooded city. However, a young cat, who has converted the home into apartments, refuses to cave to reality and literally tries to wallpaper over her problems while her remaining tenants do what they can to help her move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GAOyA3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wqbZlAEUb5w?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B2odPM"&gt;Despite the various circumstances and timelines, in each story the house represents a kind of lifeline for the characters. It’s a chance for a family to inspire jealousy, for a mouse to pull himself out of the crushing weight of debt, and for a cat to slowly build the home of her dreams. The house seems to attract the desperate. What’s most interesting about &lt;em&gt;The House&lt;/em&gt; is how each story offers a different riff on this theme. The first two chapters lean into being creepy, particularly their unsettling endings, but while the first is more of a slow-building dread, the second is much more tangible. Meanwhile, the final chapter, despite starting out quite bleak, ends on a surprisingly hopeful note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9dsSf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The House&lt;/em&gt; also features some of the best-looking stop-motion animation you’ll see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/18/12500814/laika-studios-behind-the-scenes-kubo-and-the-two-strings-video"&gt;outside of a Laika film&lt;/a&gt;. Each story has a different vibe. The felt characters of chapter one lend it an almost cozy vibe, that makes the darker elements even more stark, while the second chapter is incredibly lifelike and detailed, right down to the little piece of tape covering the webcam on the contractor’s laptop. The final story, meanwhile, is more ethereal, with foggy backdrops that signal something approaching the end of the world. The only constant is the house, which is always recognizable despite superficial changes over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mkkL4b"&gt;It’s an almost ideal anthology: connected and yet standalone. And, at around 30 minutes each, the chapters are short enough that they don’t overstay their welcome, while also being strange enough to stick with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qB3xcD"&gt;&lt;small&gt;The House &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;streams on Netflix starting January 14th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKu5iI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WyvER"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden administration announces major new initiatives to clean up the electric grid </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Installation of offshore wind farm at Block Island, Rhode Island" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P0lW-Lrg780O07AhzoN96Gnf2sw=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378804/1328686375.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mz7RDt"&gt;On Wednesday, the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/12/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-races-to-deploy-clean-energy-that-creates-jobs-and-lowers-costs/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a slew of new moves to transition the US to renewable energy, with a focus on upgrading the power grid and using public lands and waters to harness solar, wind, and geothermal energy. It’s the administration’s latest effort to clean up the nation’s electricity grid, as Democrats struggle to make headway on key legislation needed to tackle the climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYjYpG"&gt;The Department of Energy is rolling out a “Building a Better Grid” initiative, which will put federal dollars to work after the recently passed bipartisan infrastructure law allocated &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/"&gt;$65 billion&lt;/a&gt; for grid improvements. Notably, there’s $2.5 billion earmarked for new and improved transmission lines that will be crucial for zipping renewable energy from far-flung solar and wind farms to communities. Another $3 billion will go towards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419206/smart-grid-renewable-energy-power-sector"&gt;smart grid technologies&lt;/a&gt; that aim to make homes more energy efficient and reduce pressure on the grid while balancing the flow of intermittent sources of renewable energy like wind and solar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xUp5a"&gt;There’s also more than $10 billion in grants to states, tribes, and utilities for efforts to harden the grid and help prevent power outages. As the grid ages and extreme weather events are worsened by climate change, blackouts have grown longer in the US, with the average American going &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774266/power-outages-worse-united-states-electricity-grid-climate-change"&gt;more than eight hours without power in 2020&lt;/a&gt; — twice as long as was typical when the federal government started keeping track in 2013. Things could get worse without efforts to rein in greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4X0zHA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Plans to auction off vast swaths of federal waters for offshore wind farms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gVqbJ7"&gt;The administration is also commissioning new national studies to inform its deployment of thousands of miles of additional transmission lines. And it pledged to convene with tribes, states, and local governments that might have a stake in the build-out of these lines, which &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09644016.2021.1952799"&gt;often meet fierce opposition&lt;/a&gt; from local communities in their path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTNqGv"&gt;Plans to auction off vast swaths of federal waters for offshore wind farms also moved forward today. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) posted the &lt;a href="https://www.boem.gov/renewable-energy/state-activities/new-york-bight"&gt;final sale notice&lt;/a&gt; for six commercial lease areas in the New York Bight off the coasts of New York and New Jersey. Those lease areas stretch across 488,201 acres. Once developed, wind farms there could generate up to 7GW of clean energy — enough to power 2 million homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6J6dD"&gt;Still, members of the fishing industry have voiced &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/24/offshore-wind-development-new-jersey-us-fishermen-ocean-life"&gt;concerns&lt;/a&gt; over how the wind farms could harm marine ecosystems and coastal economies. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, New York Governor Kathy Hochul, and New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy announced a new partnership to work together on “job creation and environmental justice.” The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and BOEM also said they are entering a new interagency agreement focused on “protecting biodiversity and promoting cooperative ocean use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="bEdMAA"&gt;&lt;q&gt; A “really, really big deal”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8wk5HT"&gt;Senior administration officials described the lease sale, scheduled to take place next month, as a “really, really big deal” in a call with reporters. It is considered a key pillar in the administration’s plan to install &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/29/fact-sheet-biden-administration-jumpstarts-offshore-wind-energy-projects-to-create-jobs/"&gt;30GW of offshore wind capacity&lt;/a&gt; across the United States by 2030. Throughout the year, BOEM plans to keep momentum going on proposals to bring wind farms to areas off the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22735645/new-orleans-east-hurricane-ida-entergy-power-shift"&gt;Gulf Coast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453282/joe-biden-california-west-coast-offshore-wind"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, Oregon, and central Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcNDlP"&gt;The Biden administration also wants to “fast-track” the permitting process for wind, solar, and geothermal projects onshore. To speed up reviews, five agencies — the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency — issued a memorandum of understanding to prioritize renewable energy proposals on public lands. The aim is to permit 25GW renewable energy projects on public lands by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2SQoY"&gt;Biden is trying to make good on commitments he’s made to move the power sector entirely to clean energy by 2035 and virtually eliminate planet-heating pollution from fossil fuels by 2050. But those efforts are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848603/democrats-build-back-better-bill-clean-energy-power-grid-manchin"&gt;in jeopardy&lt;/a&gt; as West Virginia senator Joe Manchin drags out Democrats’ negotiations on their roughly $1.75 trillion environmental and social spending bill. With clean energy provisions already whittled down in the bill, Biden will likely have to rely more heavily on the executive branch to meet his goals on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOGHFx"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Becca’s ‘buds’ beat out other words</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T6OpJQeym4rvePZ9rpnBKF6HkEw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378711/VRG_ILLO_BeccaData.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Grayson Blackmon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Buds, buds, buds, buds!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="CNRiWq"&gt;&lt;script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KwCqo9"&gt;After working on a data piece &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744897/verge-coverage-stories-data-charts"&gt;analyzing everything &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has ever written&lt;/a&gt;, I thought it might be fun to look at some other &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;data to see what I could find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eaWNsm"&gt;Becca Farsace is one of the best sports we have on our team here, and she also has some of the most distinctive speech patterns — and catchphrases — so I asked her if she would let me dive into the data of her words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwMT6G"&gt;Her Slack response: “Wowee... I’m terrified, but go for it!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ungVqp"&gt;We all have a tendency to use the same vocabulary and phrases from day to day — it’s a part of what makes us who we are, of course. So I pulled the transcripts of every video Becca has hosted on our YouTube channel (over 30!) to get an impression of her speech patterns. A few videos didn’t have transcripts, and I didn’t include videos where she was only a guest for ease of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWRrWZ"&gt;After collecting the raw transcripts and analyzing them, I took out some common words, such as “a,” “the,” “and,” “I,” and so on, and came away with some interesting findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9UvKjz"&gt;
&lt;div id="Becca_Data_BarChart"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;script src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131058/Becca_Data_alt_BarChart.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dLMqBE"&gt;You can view the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/20725204"&gt;original version here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jbq0eEjocU7wyaeQhS6ncjWrxtE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161603/VRG_ILLO_4967_Becca_Bar_Chart.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MIFZDV"&gt;In the chart above, you can see Becca’s top words across all videos she’s ever hosted. No surprise: “buds” is the top word with nearly 300 uses, followed by “really” and “camera.” “Buds” is a common term of endearment from Becca, referring to us the viewer, but it also reinforces what we already know: that Becca covers a ton of earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8FZ6jU"&gt;
&lt;div id="Becca_Data"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;script src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161554/Becca_Data_alt.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x4Ho64"&gt;You can view the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/20725204"&gt;original version here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-V2_8RJHW4oYqYxwRZ9I-t-PfD4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161611/VRG_ILLO_4967_Becca_Scatter_Chart.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="waPESh"&gt;By looking at Becca’s top words per video, we can see how her language shifts from video to video — generally to highlight the topic being discussed. Again, “buds” (highlighted in pink) takes the top spot here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcNkGw"&gt;The use of “buds” is increasing over time, too. Is this due to an ever-growing number of “buds” named products she reviews or a deeper personal connection with her audience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TSfaG"&gt;Mostly, it seems to align with what she’s covering. They can be broken down into five buckets: action cameras, cameras, earbuds, phones, and an assorted bucket of everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OaZ2N3"&gt;Action Cameras, with six videos, didn’t have any particular word or phrase stand out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SJGFfq"&gt;Cameras had “camera” as the top word three videos out of a total of five.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JhVodu"&gt;Earbuds had “buds” as the top word in nine out of 10 videos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Sqp1p2"&gt;Phones, with three videos, had “Pixel” or “Pixel / iPhone” in two videos as the top word.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qckkAq"&gt;In the Other category, the top word seemed to match the topic of the video, with an even spread over five videos of “AI,” “fiber,” “video,” “board,” and “bike.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Ii3eYg"&gt;The data suggests that Becca’s speech most closely mirrors the topic she’s covering in each video, rather than being skewed by a favored catchphrase. Though it still goes without saying: Becca says buds &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqYIwR"&gt;“In my defense, ‘buds’ is a product category I cover, but it is also a part of my everyday language,” Becca told me. “Is it time that changes? Maybe I’ll let the buds decide.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Buy Nothing exploded on Facebook — now it wants a platform of its own</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of groups of people holding computers, connected to other groups by narrow lines" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/90fX_57QysM80_XtPwId-cbD-Xk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378635/acastro_220111_4960_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new app hopes to be an independent platform for the wildly popular Buy Nothing groups&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="uFJU5X"&gt;In the same week, Katylin has seen a banana and a boat given away between neighbors, no strings attached. In her local Buy Nothing group in Seattle, neighbors share what they have to give — vacations, gift wrap, symphony tickets, Airbnb accommodations — up for grabs to whoever wants or needs it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4uB7Kp"&gt;This is the essence of a Buy Nothing group: instead of tossing what you don’t need or buying something you do, try offering it up or asking your neighbors first. Bartering and trading are prohibited, and users are required to give and receive freely. Everything given is worth the same, no matter the perceived value. Bikes and boats are listed next to dryer lint and chicken feces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcyYk0"&gt;“The banana and the boat are both just gifts — they’re a way to connect with your neighbors,” Katylin says. “They’re actually equal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bvJXjD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are 7,000 individual Buy Nothing communities across 44 countries, from a group for New York’s Chinatown to a suburb of Reykjavík in Iceland. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YnwArQ"&gt;The Buy Nothing Project is a rare success story of digital community-building on Facebook that blossoms offline. Founded in 2013, the project grew organically, primarily through closed Facebook groups, and then exploded in popularity during the pandemic, now counting more than 5 million members. There are 7,000 individual Buy Nothing communities across 44 countries, from a group for New York’s Chinatown to a suburb of Reykjavík in Iceland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aj1a06"&gt;After so much success, Buy Nothing is now facing a dilemma: whether to leave Facebook behind. The platform allowed Buy Nothing groups to spread across the globe and easily connect neighbors with surplus goods. But it’s also posed an increasing number of problems, from moderating sprawling, disconnected communities to reaching people beyond the walls of the highly contentious social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuCgYb"&gt;To solve those problems, the Buy Nothing Project launched a mobile app of their own in November, which they’re hoping will be a more sustainable option long term as it continues to grow. Project co-founders Liesl Clark, Rebecca Rockefeller, and new business partners Tunji Williams and Lucas Rix formed a public benefit corporation, ShareThing, in 2021 and raised money from friends and family to fund the app’s development. After years of being approached by potential investors, Clark and Rockefeller finally felt ready to begin building their own platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A series of comments of someone asking for and being offered a sprinkler." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yh64ypF_QuxcO_LUXrDx3rpiMAY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23162084/Comments_copy.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Buy Nothing Project&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Users are encouraged to ask neighbors for things they need.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tgQt4U"&gt;The app attempts to solve headaches and hiccups that moderators and leaders have dealt with while using Facebook. Because most of the groups exist on Facebook, even knowing how many Buy Nothing community members there are is a herculean task. Volunteers like Katylin must hand count membership numbers using a spreadsheet, logging member count for each of the thousands of groups. Admins of groups must go through the steps of creating groups, manually adding new members, and coming up with geographic boundaries before people can start gifting and receiving items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UudApk"&gt;But asking 7,000 groups to try a new platform presents its own issues. Though the thousands of Buy Nothing groups follow the same manual and guiding principles, in practice each is responsible for itself. Different administrators have different rules of engagement. For example, Facebook groups will lay out the exact boundaries of where you must live to join the community, but some moderators allow people who work or go to school in the area to join, or who are slightly outside of the neighborhood limits. Some admins have developed regular community events in the neighborhood that might not exist in a nearby area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Grz0MY"&gt;The app dissolves those clearly defined communities, creating a somewhat borderless experience with the individual user at the center. Instead of being in a network for your town or neighborhood, the app uses a person’s location and distance preferences to create a radius with other users nearby. The role of admins, too, is redefined — on Facebook, they are responsible for even the most tedious of tasks, like troubleshooting tech issues. On the app, anyone who takes a training course can become a “community builder,” whose job it is to model best practices and facilitate activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The app presents three distance settings for users from “hyperlocal” to “surrounding areas.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4hPr-GeZvP6gst_HhbgAb_DMO2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23162040/IMG_7239.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Buy Nothing Project&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The BuyNothing app creates a borderless experience instead of clearly defined boundaries that Facebook groups have.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M33ABG"&gt;This in-between period, Clark admits, is a little bittersweet and awkward. Thriving communities might feel threatened by yet another space with the same mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyN9m5"&gt;“At times, people will feel that there’s only room for one group,” Clark says. “But I think that if we do this over and over and over again, and practice it, then we won’t even need an app, we won’t even need Facebook groups. We’ll just be doing it in real life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0zV2I"&gt;So far, most Buy Nothing users seem to be staying where they are: the app only has 166,000 downloads as of late December, though Clark says it is growing by 5 percent week to week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpGnLs"&gt;Eddie Chang, a moderator of a Buy Nothing group on the Upper East Side in New York, says some administrators feel the addition of the app might unnecessarily complicate a system that was already working well. Expanding the project requires the money to cover increasing costs, potentially putting it in a tough spot if funding dries up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJDmIk"&gt;“You already have a very rich product that you created, and you have people who have skin in the game as owners of their own individual communities within this umbrella organization,” he says. “If [donations] dry up, and you get paid through another outlet, how does that change the philosophy?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vWCM4"&gt;Even though buying and selling aren’t allowed in the Buy Nothing universe, money is a key question in this new chapter. Though it’s free to participate, Clark says any costs associated with the project — from creating resources for the public, to hiring developers — have been covered since day one by herself and co-founder Rebecca Rockefeller. (In December, the &lt;a href="https://buynothingproject.org/"&gt;Buy Nothing website&lt;/a&gt; for the first time featured a banner asking for supporters to consider chipping in.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuAmvu"&gt;The fine print currently allows for admins to have a “&lt;a href="https://bnponfb.org/2020/12/22/a-brief-history-of-the-buy-nothing-project-complete-with-controversies/"&gt;gratitude jar&lt;/a&gt;,” and Clark says she would like to see volunteers compensated for the time and skills they’ve already devoted to keeping groups afloat. But the topic of compensation has at times been contentious, with many administrators deeply against it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qlayIw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Do I need to spend 40 hours a week on this thing? No, I don’t. But it’s a labor of love.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ltNebv"&gt;“I think there are the purists who believe that an endeavor like this should all be free,” Clark says. “Managing this is full time and then some … We can’t earn a living and just give away all our time. We do need to feed our families.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PAaTG1"&gt;Chang, the administrator of the Upper East Side group, doesn’t believe he should be paid for the work he does. As opposed to similar community groups that allow sponsored content, Chang believes that without money changing hands, Buy Nothing can remain a safe, influence-free space. The reward, he says, is meeting and building relationships with the people around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sm5vR1"&gt;“Do I need to spend 40 hours a week on this thing? No, I don’t,” he says. “But it’s a labor of love.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Tw2Ex"&gt;The middle ground for communities has been to attempt to keep both the Facebook group and the app active, an option that Clark and other project co-founders encourage if it makes sense for the group. Admins like Chang suggest members try out the app or crosspost items and asks. From what he’s seen, most admins either say nothing about the app, or facilitate activity on both platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmYnAv"&gt;“We’re trying to embrace it,” Chang says. “We’re not getting out of it yet what we’re getting out of the group, so it’s not fully adopted. It’s still in early days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="pYhtDH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“On the app, I will have to teach people the water is fine. You don’t know all your neighbors yet.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xbeVc7"&gt;Other admins like Katylin are thrilled to begin the transition away from Facebook toward something custom built for the Buy Nothing mission. The move has helped her prepare to leave Facebook, a platform she’s spent countless hours on while building a community she believes in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKqap5"&gt;“On the app, I will have to teach people the water is fine,” Katylin says. “You don’t know all your neighbors yet. But within time, you probably are going to be comfortable enough to show all the sides of yourself you showed in your Facebook group.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJZaoU"&gt;A fresh platform owned and operated by people dedicated to Buy Nothing feels like a blank slate to build on, Clark says. For instance, she says the borderlessness is an attempt at correcting a phenomenon of Facebook group boundaries that recreated historic redlined maps. Leadership is considering what it might look like to have participants have equity in the project or how Buy Nothing could partner with municipalities and states on educational programs around reuse and recycling efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1dWYt"&gt;Even though Clark has high hopes for how the app can evolve in the future, she says the less social media platforms are needed to do this work, the better. And though she hears the trepidation from people who worry having another platform could dilute the existing communities, Clark believes both can thrive — the point is that people are exposed to the ethos of a gift economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="baQmyl"&gt;“What we want to do is bring about behavioral change,” Clark says. “That is our number one agenda.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNajyh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvHuOp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NorUqz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnLeqM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3Upbs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q2AeCS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to mute a word or phrase on Twitter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K9L9qO_CtfLAzWvVWNfupkuPkNE=/0x0:900x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378592/twitter.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tweet-user-name"&gt;In February 2020,  I found that that it was possible not only to mute conversations or other accounts on Twitter, but (courtesy of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nonprofWHIT/status/1229964006330380289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1229964006330380289%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F2%2F19%2F21144097%2Ftwitter-mute-tweets-word-name-tag-how-to-settings-phone-desktop"&gt;a tweet by @nonprofWHIT&lt;/a&gt; ) that you could also mute a specific &lt;em&gt;word&lt;/em&gt;. And you could do it straight from a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZRtti"&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1480958895287939072?s=20"&gt;Twitter has announced&lt;/a&gt; it is expanding this feature so that when you mute a word or phrase, it will not appear in your Explore tab or Event-based notifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CalAyd"&gt;Here’s how you go about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cPBAYz"&gt;Mute words or phrases on an iPhone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kiOUjU"&gt;If you’re using the Twitter app on an iPhone, it’s a quick and easy process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WDHN6T"&gt;Long-press on the word you want to mute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="olIheA"&gt;Choose “Mute” from the pop-up menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PEzRpO"&gt;You’ll be sent to a page where you can choose from where you want to mute the word (your timeline or notifications), from whom (anyone or people you don’t follow), and the duration (forever, 24 hours, seven days, or 30 days). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Long-press on the word you want to mute. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ct4FjssBFbrPRlqSFHRIEaTYgSg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19731703/IMG_589D3687AA11_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-press on the word you want to mute. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select where you want to mute it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dDH9hXswL9-N6bXW-V0tYJdiQvU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19731705/IMG_BB887E06D435_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select where you want to mute it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VevJJq"&gt;Mute words or phrases on an Android phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QEISnd"&gt;If you’ve got an Android phone, don’t despair. You can also mute words from the Android Twitter app (or, for that matter, from the iOS Twitter app) through the app’s settings. It’s not quite as fast as doing it directly from a tweet, but it’s just as effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="dioGVM"&gt;Select your icon on the upper left corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="86FxuH"&gt;Select “Settings and privacy” &amp;gt; “Privacy and safety” &amp;gt; “Mute and block.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aUmPGy"&gt;Tap “Muted words.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IWrdR2"&gt;Tap the plus sign and enter the word you want to mute. You then get the same choices as to where, from whom, and duration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In Android, you mute using settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nTl99kR7ncdZUAn443VgaOsHAHw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161869/Screenshot_20220111_164607.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Android, you mute using settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Enter each word or phrase separately." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h4oiyYduCftQXYz_BYEYRnba7lA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161872/Screenshot_20220111_164831.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enter each word or phrase separately.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="78Fb6s"&gt;If you no longer want to mute the word or you want to extend the mute time, return to the “Muted words” screen, tap on the word in question, and choose the corresponding option (“Delete word” or “Change mute time”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can always delete the muted word." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MJM9RKxdhhrJusCZm98IBsSy0b8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161887/Screenshot_20220111_164953.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can always delete the muted word.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Are you sure?" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0RO26hyhtA6H-OU6WSHsyeWV9GM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161886/Screenshot_20220111_165009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you sure?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yGqJr7"&gt;Mute words or phrases on your desktop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kIw7dK"&gt;And finally, if you’re tweeting directly from Twitter’s website, you can mute a word from there as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mUDyjq"&gt;On your desktop, from the left-hand menu, click on “More” &amp;gt; “Settings and privacy” &amp;gt; “Privacy and safety” &amp;gt; “Mute and block.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PlrwIF"&gt;In the right column, click on “Muted words.” Click on the plus sign in the upper right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0x5wni"&gt;Now you can enter the word or phrase you want to mute. As with the mobile Twitter apps, you can choose whether to mute from your timeline or notifications, from anyone or people you don’t follow, and for how long. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="On a desktop, you first find the “Mute and block” section." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sLiNAOQx6_OtIxogeghXdLHom1o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161973/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_4.59.14_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On a desktop, you first find the “Mute and block” section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1BIzId"&gt;When you’ve made all your choices, click on “Save.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4rpSnz"&gt;If you want to unmute any words, go back to the “Muted words” column. Click on the red crossed-out volume symbol to the right of the word, and then click “Unmute” on the pop-up window that appears.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s simple to go back and unmute a word or phrase." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R66EzpN58QfNo7ElEtgaP5xvr2Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161974/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_5.01.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s simple to go back and unmute a word or phrase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7KYdrh"&gt;Some additional notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MIsPI2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/advanced-twitter-mute-options"&gt;Twitter has a number of ways&lt;/a&gt; you can mute different types of info in your timeline and notifications. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Tr9Tbt"&gt;You can also mute specific mentions of specific accounts (but not mute the account itself) by using the @ in front of the account name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hRELIu"&gt;If you mute a word, you will also mute that word’s hashtag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="znDiJJ"&gt;Muting is not case-sensitive (“spoilers” and “SPOILERS” will both work), and you can use a phrase with punctuation (“Hey, you!”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mdxx9i"&gt;Twitter is expanding the ability to mute words, phrases, etc. to areas other than timelines and notifications. Just yesterday, it announced that blocked or muted text would also no longer appear in Events-based areas:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="y91ggM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;First up, Events. Now across Android, iOS, and web, Events from accounts you’ve blocked or muted won’t appear in your Explore tab, “What’s happening” sidebar and emails, or Event-based notifications.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1480958895287939072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 11, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="56qsSQ"&gt;If / when the ability to mute is extended even further, we’ll add it to this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3o5ip"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 12th, 2022, 10:00AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on February 19th, 2020, and has been updated to allow for UI changes and new features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta’s real antitrust problems are only beginning</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yDBwde"&gt;Just over 13 months ago, the Trump-era Federal Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166978/facebook-ftc-antitrust-instagram-whatsapp-tiktok"&gt;sought to break up Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. The lawsuit was a long time in coming — it sought to unwind acquisitions that were made in 2012 (Instagram) and 2014 (WhatsApp) — and, in its initial form, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/06/28/ftc-facebook-antitrust-complaint-dismissed/"&gt;was laughed out of court&lt;/a&gt;. The FTC had not plausibly demonstrated that Facebook had a monopoly, Judge James E. Boasberg ruled at the time, and thus could not proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqpxt9"&gt;Still, Boasberg offered the FTC a second chance: re-file the case with more evidence to support its central claim, and perhaps it could go to trial. In the intervening months, President Trump had been dislodged from office, and antitrust crusader Lina Khan took the reins at the FTC. To no one’s surprise, she took Boasberg up on the offer to file a revised case. And in a ruling issued this week, Boasberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878808/ftc-meta-facebook-lawsuit-ruling-revised-complaint-discovery"&gt;ruled that the case can proceed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HMwws"&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/01/11/ftc-facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-move-ahead/"&gt;Cat Zakrzewski at &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3terHN"&gt;The revised complaint included enough facts to “plausibly establish” that Facebook has a monopoly in personal social networking, referring to services that allow people to maintain relationships with family and friends online, Boasberg said. Boasberg said the “Achilles’ heel” of the FTC’s first complaint was that it was devoid of data supporting its claim that “no other social network of comparable scale exists in the United States.” But the revised complaint included data from the analytics firm ComScore, and argued that Facebook’s share of daily active users of apps providing personal social networking in the United States has exceeded 70 percent since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxKFKJ"&gt;“In short, the FTC has done its homework this time around,” Boasberg wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fhNW0G"&gt;The homework, incidentally, was not particularly elaborate: this time the FTC simply included some Comscore data about the time people spend using Facebook products, along with numbers of daily and monthly active users for it and other products in the space. It remains noteworthy, if unsurprising, that the Trump FTC could not manage to clear even that low bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPJhdr"&gt;In any event, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; said Boasberg had handed the FTC “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/11/technology/facebook-antitrust-ftc.html"&gt;a major victory in its quest to curtail the power of the biggest tech companies&lt;/a&gt;.” At the very least, the judge helped the FTC save face: after more than five years of lawmakers and regulators decrying the size and influence of Facebook, it would have been beyond embarrassing for the agency to fail even to bring its case to trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JIdImb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it would have been beyond embarrassing for the agency to fail even to bring its case to trial&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Th7EqK"&gt;And yet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166978/facebook-ftc-antitrust-instagram-whatsapp-tiktok"&gt;as I wrote when the case was filed&lt;/a&gt;, each passing year has weakened the FTC’s monopoly case, and the agency spent all of 2021 struggling to keep it viable. While the agency flailed, TikTok was born and reached enormous scope — in 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-google-facebook-social-media-internet/"&gt;it was the most visited website in the world&lt;/a&gt;, according to Cloudflare. The government would argue that TikTok is fundamentally different than Facebook, alleging that the latter holds a monopoly in something called “personal social networking services.” And yet anyone can open up Facebook or Instagram and notice, day by day, how they are gradually assuming more and more features of TikTok, the app it is supposedly so distinct from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9gH6v"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;Facebook is now Meta&lt;/a&gt;, and “a metaverse company.” Questions about whether it’s possible to compete with Instagram or WhatsApp feel feel like questions of more interest to historians than to the next generation of entrepreneurs, which are contentedly (and perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/signal-gets-a-new-ceo"&gt;foolishly&lt;/a&gt;) now rebuilding the entire internet — &lt;a href="https://www.deso.org/"&gt;social networks included&lt;/a&gt; — on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5TtkS"&gt;One of the oldest arguments against breaking Facebook up was that the market would eventually end the company’s dominance anyway, and likely much faster than any lawsuit could. There’s no doubt that Facebook is still dominant in social networking. But there are cracks in its armor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buFFaE"&gt;All of which makes it notable that while Boasberg allowed the case to proceed, he wrote that “the agency may well face a tall task down the road in proving its allegations.” Over and over again in the 48-page complaint, he notes that he is not yet allowed to assess the accuracy of the facts presented in the FTC’s case. Instead, his job is to determine whether the facts, if true, make for plausible allegations of wrongdoing. And at this point, he decides, they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTNGdr"&gt;(He stood fast in rejecting another part of the lawsuit case, which argued that Facebook had illegally restricted the transfer of data to third-party developers. That particular policy ended in 2013, making any wrongdoing feel like old news even by the standards of this case.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9a7at"&gt;Don’t get me wrong: I believe Facebook &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; make social networks less competitive when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp. And we’ll never know what consumer benefits we might have seen had those companies remained independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqECCa"&gt;But 2014 was a long time ago. And the coming lawsuit and inevitable appeals will stretch out for many more years. At this point, even if the government &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; successfully force a spinout of Instagram and WhatsApp, those companies will be reborn into a world that is moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBZHxd"&gt;The good news for consumers, and for competition, is that the FTC is moving on, too. Even if this lawsuit fails in the end, by filing it the agency has signaled that it will intensely scrutinize any future efforts by Meta to acquire other social networking products. And as new social networks rise up in the future, the lessons learned from Instagram and WhatsApp will almost certainly inspire much more rigorous reviews of future acquisitions in the space. (It’s already happening: in November the United Kingdom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22740272/facebook-giphy-acquisition-competition-and-markets-authority-uk-regulator"&gt;blocked Meta from buying a GIF search engine&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QnWfOZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;what Meta wants to buy in VR is far more important than what Facebook bought a decade ago&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p3KdGP"&gt;Even better, from my perspective, is that the FTC has begun to train its attention where it actually belongs: on&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537795/is-facebook-cornering-the-vr-market"&gt; Meta’s efforts to snap up all the biggest studios and talent in virtual reality and augmented reality&lt;/a&gt;. When I wrote about that subject last June, Meta had already acquired Big Box VR, Unit 2 Games, Beat Games, Sanzaru Games, and Ready at Dawn. Then, in October, it&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753403/supernatural-within-studio-facebook-meta-oculus-vr-fitness-experiences-metaverse"&gt; made one of its biggest purchases in the space to date&lt;/a&gt;: the Los Angeles VR company Within, makers of the breakout hit subscription fitness app Supernatural, for a reported $400 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0RNix"&gt;Meta owns the Oculus App Store, and has perfect knowledge about which games are selling well and converting Quest owners into daily users. In that sense, it’s the company’s sequel to Onavo,&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-onavo-gives-social-media-firm-inside-peek-at-rivals-users-1502622003"&gt; the Facebook app that once provided vital early warnings about upstart competitors&lt;/a&gt;. In 2022, what Meta wants to buy in VR is far more important to the future than what Facebook bought a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uBJQ5"&gt;That’s why I was heartened to see &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; report last month that the FTC has&lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ftc-slows-meta-platforms-metaverse-strategy-by-extending-antitrust-probe-of-vr-deal?utm_source=ti_app&amp;amp;rc=8aq5ai"&gt; opened a formal inquiry into Meta’s acquisition of Within&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LI9Frf"&gt;Meta’s first five VR app acquisitions went through without a hitch because they were too small to trigger a cursory review by U.S. antitrust regulators. But those regulators are slowing down the $400 million-plus Supernatural deal, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. Shortly after Thanksgiving, the Federal Trade Commission opened an in-depth probe of the acquisition, meaning Meta may not be able to finalize the acquisition for another year, assuming the agency doesn’t formally challenge the deal in court, causing additional delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VMiQYy"&gt;This is where the FTC’s attention actually belongs: not on the distant past, but on the still-up-for-grabs present, in which Meta pumps its profits into&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/oculus-will-sell-you-a-quest-2-headset-that-doesnt-need-facebook-for-an-extra-dollar500/"&gt; selling the Quest 2 below cost&lt;/a&gt; — to&lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/vr-player-sales-numbers-christmas-2021/"&gt; great success this holiday season&lt;/a&gt; — and in acquiring all the most-used software in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atcsE5"&gt;What happens to Instagram and WhatsApp still matters a lot. But what happens on next-generation platforms may matter much more. The bad news is that the FTC’s current lawsuit came too late to make a difference. The good news is that it seems determined not to make the same mistake twice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge guide to working from home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/brZ8fKGRgKKblQdPDmOpRyGJVv0=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70360136/Work_from_Home_hub_lede_social.6.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Qn3GIe"&gt;Working from home is normal now. For some of us, it has become a permanent change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYxFMp"&gt;Thankfully, in these days of videoconferencing, texting, and file-sharing, it has been possible for many of us to move to home desks and offices and thrive that way. It helps that remote working was already a part of many people’s lives before COVID-19 appeared. But that doesn’t mean it’s been easy. It’s been an adjustment for many of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWPojS"&gt;Now we’re taking the tech expertise of our staff, and the experience of our writers and editors, to put together our best tips and advice on working from home. For example, we give advice on looking for the best monitor, choosing a business-level file-sharing service, and buying a printer. (Yes, you might actually want a printer again!)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fTZRSG"&gt;The need for a home / office printer has increased as more of us are working or schooling from home. You could be a parent who needs to print out workbooks for your child. Or you may find that it’s easier to make notes on a business report using a pen or pencil rather than a keyboard. Or you’ve suddenly discovered that a government office is demanding that you snail mail a form to them. Or you’re tired of trekking to your local office supply store for printing out occasional forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrULau"&gt;Whatever the reason, if you find yourself in need of a printer, it’s not difficult to find one. Printers have not changed a lot over the past few years; they’ve just become more efficient and less expensive. You will still be choosing between laser and inkjet printers, color and black-ink-only printers, and print-only and multifunction devices. Because of all these decisions to make, it’s a good idea to figure out what you want before you click “buy” at your favorite shopping site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MeqcFN"&gt;In this article, I won’t be telling you which specific printer to buy. But I will go through some of the choices you are going to be faced with and some of the features you may want to make sure you’re getting, including inkjet versus laser, multifunction versus single function, and how to decide what to buy and where to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGVhWI"&gt;So let’s start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sTGRpk"&gt;Inkjet versus laser printers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6m8xC3"&gt;If you haven’t bought a printer lately — or if you haven’t needed a printer until now — you may want a quick refresher on the difference between inkjet and laser printers. What follows is a vast simplification, but it will give you a general idea of how they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="u4alml"&gt;Inkjet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="n04fvi"&gt;Inkjet printers spray tiny droplets of liquid ink onto a page. There are several types of inkjet delivery systems, but most consumer systems use separate ink cartridges, each fitted with a printhead that separates the ink into the nearly microscopic droplets. (Professional-level inkjets will usually have separate printheads that can be replaced on their own.) Colors are created by combining different colored inks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qSJmQ"&gt;The number of ink cartridges that a color inkjet printer uses varies. The least expensive printers usually use only two cartridges — one with black ink and one that contains cyan, magenta, and yellow ink. Most lower- to medium-priced inkjet printers offer four separate cartridges — cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink. More upscale printers will have a different black cartridge for text; printers used by photographers or businesses will have a wider selection of colored inks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXxvrh"&gt;But even the least expensive inkjets can end up running into serious money. The printer itself may not cost more than $50 or $100, but a single set of cartridges can cost nearly as much. And because most color inkjets will not run at all if any one of the cartridges is out of ink (for example, you can’t just print in black if the cyan cartridge runs out), you’ll need to replace any spent cartridges. (We’ll deal more with ink costs later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6zK42"&gt;There are a few inkjet printers out there known as supertank printers, which have refillable tanks that offer a lower cost per page than the traditional ink cartridges. They are sold by a few manufacturers such as &lt;a href="https://www.brother-usa.com/inkvestment-tank"&gt;Brother&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.usa.canon.com%2Fshop%2Fen%2Fcatalog%2Fprinters-all-in-ones%2Fg-series-megatank-inkjet-printers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fepson.com%2Fecotank-ink-tank-printers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Epson&lt;/a&gt;, and could be a consideration if you plan to do a lot of color printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VXBsd2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10946129"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="usxWmE"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4a31bH"&gt;Laser&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zKVgzp"&gt;These devices use lasers to create static electricity on a rolling drum inside the printer. The static electricity attracts toner (ink in the form of powder), which is melted onto the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1fKVka"&gt;While toner cartridges initially cost more than ink cartridges, they also last far longer than liquid ink; as a result, your cost per page will be less. Laser printers also tend to initially cost more than inkjet printers — but they can save money over the long term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IjUPwf"&gt;Laser printers have several other advantages over inkjet printers — unless you need color. They are faster than inkjets (especially low-end inkjets, which can be very slow), and the quality of their text printing is more precise (although current inkjets are certainly precise enough to suit most documents).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kda4sL"&gt;Color laser printers are also more available than they used to be. However, they are pricier, and unless they are professional-level printers, the color will not be as good as an equivalently priced color inkjet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1WJzVu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10946201"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Mge797"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NgG53g"&gt;So which should I buy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hnIqxZ"&gt;There are several other factors to consider before purchasing a new printer. Here are some questions to ask yourself while deciding what to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qSaci3"&gt;What am I using it for?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PaBtGE"&gt;One way to decide whether to buy a laser or an inkjet printer is to look into what you want to do with it. If color is not important to you, then it’s a no-brainer. A laser printer will be more cost-efficient and faster. But if you want to print out your kids’ computer artwork in color or print the occasional photograph, then you’re probably in the market for an inkjet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Dzf4ZV"&gt;Multifunction printers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8EIF3S"&gt;If you see yourself working from home for the foreseeable future — or even if you don’t — you may want to consider a multifunction (also known as an all-in-one or AIO) printer. These devices don’t just print from your computer, but they allow you to scan existing documents and either copy them or save them as files. (Some also let you fax a scanned document, but since faxing has become much less necessary, this feature is quickly disappearing.) They are very handy for keeping the paperwork around your home to a minimum since you can save PDFs of most of your papers (especially the ones you’ve had sitting around for years) and then dispose of the actual hard copies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLosWg"&gt;(Yes, you can use your phone’s camera to scan and upload documents, and if you only occasionally need to scan a document, that could be enough for you. However, the quality of a phone-scanned document doesn’t come up to the quality of a good scanner.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1EZELv"&gt;Most consumer-level multifunctions will let you copy anything up to an 8.5 x 11-inch paper (popularly known as letter-sized), but you can also buy printers that will let you handle an 8.5 x 14-inch (legal size) paper. If you see yourself doing a lot of copying or scanning, you should look for a multifunction with an automatic document feeder (usually referred to as an ADF) that lets you move a number of pages through the system quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="RcCw64"&gt;Input and output trays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lTJ3pa"&gt;Most current printers work by pulling paper in from the front, running it around the drum or roller, and then popping it out to the output tray. However, if you’re printing on heavier stock, you don’t want to bend the paper; in that case, you may want to look for a printer that has an input tray coming from the back of the printer, so that the paper is pushed through on a straight line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGyuHK"&gt;Some printers also allow you to have more than one paper tray in front, letting you choose different colored paper, for example, or having one tray hold letter-sized paper and the other legal-sized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8f6S3j"&gt;You also want to know how many sheets of paper your input and output trays are capable of holding. If you plan to, say, print out a 200-page manuscript, you don’t want an output tray that can only handle 50 pages, or you could find 150 of your pages strewn over your floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qdzEPd"&gt;Duplexing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f2jCES"&gt;The ability to duplex — to print on both sides of a single page — is more common than it used to be, but not all lower-priced printers include this feature. It’s very useful, especially if you do a lot of printing and want to save on the cost of paper. Of course, most printers let you print on both sides of paper by manually re-feeding the paper into the printer after the first side has been printed — but that can be a real pain in the neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OLCqoS"&gt;Price per page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2HT7QU"&gt;Without a doubt, the biggest expense for a printer isn’t the printer itself or even the paper — it’s the ink. There is a way to figure out how much a printer will cost you over the long term: calculate the cost per page by dividing the price of an ink cartridge by the cartridge’s page yield, or the number of pages you’re expected to get out of each cartridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrZqtr"&gt;You can usually find the page yield among the stats published by the printer’s manufacturer. For example, take two multifunction printers from the same manufacturer, one a color inkjet and one a black-only laser printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lCblbL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The biggest expense for a printer isn’t the printer itself or even the paper — it’s the ink&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e209CN"&gt;The yield of the &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-envy-6055e-wireless-inkjet-printer-with-6-months-of-instant-ink-included-with-hp-white%2F6454281.p%3FskuId%3D6454281&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP Envy Photo 6055e All-in-One&lt;/a&gt;, which sells for about $160, is about 240 pages for a high-yield black ink cartridge and about 200 pages for its high-yield tri-color ink cartridge. The high-yield black ink cartridge &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.staples.com/hp-67xl-black-ink-cartridge-high-yield-3ym57an-140/product_24430099" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs about $24&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.staples.com/hp-67xl-tri-color-ink-cartridge-high-yield-3ym58an-140/product_24430101" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;tri-color about $25&lt;/a&gt;. So that’s about 10 cents a page for the black ink and about 12 cents for the color. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iv1Aee"&gt;A similarly priced black-and-white laser printer, the &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-laserjet-m209dwe-wireless-black-and-white-laser-printer-with-6-months-of-toner-through-hp-white-slate%2F6452950.p%3FskuId%3D6452950&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$170 HP LaserJet M209dwe&lt;/a&gt;, cites about 1,100 pages for a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.staples.com/hp-141a-black-standard-yield-toner-cartridge-w1410a/product_24506782" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standard toner cartridge&lt;/a&gt;, at a cost of about $48. That comes out to about 4 cents a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdJFfY"&gt;So assuming you pump out about 1,100 text-only pages in a year (excluding the cost of the paper), that means you’ll have paid a total of $48 more for the laser printer and $110 more for the inkjet, a difference of $62. (And that doesn’t take into consideration the fact that, using a color inkjet, you can’t print black-only unless all the ink cartridges are useable. In other words, if your kids use up your color cartridges, you won’t be able to print unless you replace them — even if you’re just printing in black.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRWOaU"&gt;One more thing to throw into the mix: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Black-Bottle-135ml-1VV24AN/dp/B07Z1GPV7S?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a black ink tank&lt;/a&gt; for the $400 &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-smart-tank-7001-wireless-all-in-one-inkjet-printer-white-slate%2F6477854.p%3FskuId%3D6477854&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP Smart Tank 7001 Wireless All-In-One Inkjet Printer&lt;/a&gt;, which uses storage tanks instead of ink cartridges, costs $17 for a yield of up to 6,000 pages, well under a penny a page. (Because these types of printers — there are several — tend to use a differing number of tanks for color printing, it’s difficult to figure out an equivalent comparison for color printing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwLnKS"&gt;There are, of course, a lot of “ifs” here. For example, when you’re looking at lower-cost printers, some major printer manufacturers don’t publish the page yield. In addition, even when the page yield is available, you have to keep in mind that it’s being offered by the manufacturer — so the number of pages you get per cartridge is usually optimistic. Still, this can give you a fair idea of what you’re facing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7KsJAk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10951449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d3YstD"&gt;Wireless connectivity &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="G2LxKG"&gt;When you’re purchasing a printer, make sure it is capable of wireless connectivity via Bluetooth, NFC, and / or Wi-Fi — and make sure it is compatible with whatever computer or mobile device you plan to use with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frZS7W"&gt;If you’ve got a Mac computer, an iPad, and / or an iPhone, make sure your printer is compatible with &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201311"&gt;Apple AirPrint&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xn4DS0"&gt;If you’re using a Chromebook, make sure your printer is Chrome OS-compatible by checking the manufacturer site. (For example, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fepson.com%2FAccessories%2FPrinter-Accessories%2FChromebook-Printing%2Fp%2FCHROMEBOOKPRINT%23worksWithAccessories&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Epson has a page&lt;/a&gt; that lists all its Chrome OS-compatible printers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dYEKW"&gt;Until recently, another alternative was to use Google’s Cloud Print service, which let you easily print from computers and Android phones. Unfortunately, with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning"&gt;usual disregard for well-loved features&lt;/a&gt;, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20977888/google-cloud-print-shut-down-date-support"&gt;shut down its Cloud Print service&lt;/a&gt; as of December 31st, 2020. The company’s &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9633006"&gt;rather unsatisfactory advice&lt;/a&gt; (“we recommend the respective platform’s native-printing infrastructure or working with a printing partner”) will probably not be much help for those with older printers that depended on Cloud Print. You can check to see if your printer’s manufacturer has a mobile app that will allow printing from devices wirelessly in lieu of Cloud Print. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDDwMV"&gt;Finally, some printers have NFC capabilities. This lets you connect one to your phone by simply touching the phone to the NFC label on the printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qPtu4n"&gt;Touch and non-touch LCDs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XG6cZr"&gt;Most printers today, even the most basic, come with LCDs that allow you to easily connect to your wireless network and tweak the printer settings — for example, if you want to always print double-sided, or to pull paper from a specific paper cassette. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4G0Ig7"&gt;Unless you’re really into saving money, you’ll find it easier to deal with a touchscreen. Non-touchscreens usually mean having to hit a combination of buttons to navigate to the feature you want to access, selecting the feature, navigating to the setting, selecting it, and then getting back to the main menu. Touchscreens make that process a lot simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s35ufT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10496647"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ex62QD"&gt;Photo printers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="V9rrsD"&gt;Unless you plan to fill up several albums with physical photos, a photo printer is probably not necessary. Some photo printers offer features like the ability to remove red-eye in photos of people, but this same functionality is commonly available in a number of photo apps (and is probably easier to deal with in software). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdTda8"&gt;There are exceptions. For example, there are small, portable printers such as the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084CMMHVV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon SELPHY QX10 photo printer&lt;/a&gt; that let you immediately print small (2.7 x 2.7-inch) pictures. These are fun for family gatherings and parties. (Although be aware that you will have to buy special photo paper and ink for this one.) And if you’re a professional or would-be professional photographer, you may want to invest in a high-level photo printer. But otherwise, most midlevel color printers will — if you use good photo paper — do quite an adequate job. If you’re intending on printing a lot of photos, you’ll spend less and get better results from a photo printing service such as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shutterfly.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shutterfly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XePZ98"&gt;Where should I buy it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NMiB13"&gt;Printers are available at almost any online or in-store venues that sell laptops and other computer equipment, such as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=printers&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740374987942209261" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fbrowse%2FPrinters-Accessories%2Fci%2F18317%2FN%2F4042754070%3ForigSearch%3Dprinters&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;. You can also usually purchase a printer directly from the manufacturer — for example, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeChoosingPrinters051221&amp;amp;platform=dl&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fcv%2Fprinters" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usa.canon.com%2Finternet%2Fportal%2Fus%2Fhome%2Fproducts%2Fgroups%2Fprinters&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fepson.com%2Fprinters&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Epson&lt;/a&gt; all sell from their websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obEQMV"&gt;As with any tech device, it’s always a good idea to check out the product in person before you buy — you may decide, for example, that the inexpensive printer you saw online feels too cheap when you examine it on the shelf. But for the most part, if you’ve checked all the specs online and read a few reviews, you’re pretty safe in ordering your printer remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
