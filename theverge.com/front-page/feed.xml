    <title>EA is opening the patents for some of its accessibility tech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshot of Apex Legends, showing a dessert landscape and a hand holding a knife, with text in the upper right corner that says “you pinged shield battery.”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pirQy0r_WzxfAEQ88WgRFV6sKss=/96x0:1607x1007/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69767263/Shield_Battery_Ping.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SbuZYk"&gt;Electronic Arts is pledging to open the patents for some of its accessibility-related tech, including the much-celebrated &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; ping system, the company announced today. EA says it won’t file infringement lawsuits against people or companies for using tech that falls under patents listed in the pledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYcajp"&gt;The ping system in Apex Legends, which allows people to play the team-based game without hearing or speaking, has been praised both as an impressive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213537/apex-legend-voice-chat-solo-play-xbox-ps4-pc"&gt;alternative to voice chat&lt;/a&gt; and as a great &lt;a href="https://www.cbr.com/apex-legends-ping-system-is-still-its-best-feature-and-its-most-accessible/"&gt;accessibility feature&lt;/a&gt; for players with a variety of disabilities. A patent that covers the system (&lt;a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&amp;amp;docid=11097189"&gt;US 11,097,189&lt;/a&gt;) was issued the same day as EA’s announcement of the pledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iesF0h"&gt;Along with the ping system patent, EA is opening patents for the tech it uses in &lt;em&gt;Madden&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt; to make them more accessible for people with colorblindness and low vision. The tech includes automated systems for improving visibility by detecting and modifying colors (&lt;a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&amp;amp;docid=10118097"&gt;US 10,118,097&lt;/a&gt;) and contrast ratios (&lt;a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&amp;amp;docid=10878540"&gt;US 10,878,540&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot from Madden 21, showing different options of plays, with color contrast adjusted for color blindness." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Czz5ZQ8J2PsH6I-EFtctXo8OMbk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801446/Ex._1___Deuteranopia_On__as_seen_with_deuteranopia_.png"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HGymNb"&gt;The pledge also includes a patent for a “personalized sound technology” (&lt;a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&amp;amp;docid=10878540"&gt;US 10,878,540&lt;/a&gt;) that will modify or create music for people based on their listening preferences and level of hearing, though EA says this tech hasn’t been developed yet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1Y5cu"&gt;In addition to opening some of its patents, EA is open-sourcing code that helps address issues with brightness, contrast, and colorblindness in digital content. Developers can find the code &lt;a href="https://github.com/electronicarts"&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and adapt or build on it for their own games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQeNK5"&gt;“We hope developers will make the most of these patents and encourage those who have the resources, innovation and creativity to do as we have by making their own pledges that put accessibility first,” says Chris Bruzzo, EVP of Positive Play, Commercial and Marketing at EA. “We welcome collaboration with others on how we move the industry forward together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRdQVg"&gt;EA says it plans to add patents for future accessibility-related tech to the pledge, as well as open-sourcing more of its tech. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the first trailer for Spider-Man: No Way Home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A50RyE9AHqutRolA_sbnFnuQsoE=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69766839/nwh.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w9tptL"&gt;After it &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/sony-block-alleged-spider-man-no-way-home-trailer-leak-1235001375/"&gt;leaked&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend, Sony Pictures has released the first official teaser trailer for the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt;, the third Spider-Man movie to be part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8fP5e"&gt;I will just say up front that if you consider the basic premise of &lt;em&gt;No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; to be a spoiler, you probably shouldn’t watch this trailer. There are already reveals in it that big Spider-Man and Marvel fans might want to save for the theater, though I’m not sure how practical that’ll be in the lead-up to release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZMr0sq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;shout-out to the real ones who are watching the trailer for the first time right now&lt;/p&gt;— Spider-Man: No Way Home (@SpiderManMovie) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpiderManMovie/status/1429982989228810249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yoq9p1"&gt;Suffice it to say for now that &lt;em&gt;No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; follows on directly from the mid-credits scene in the last movie, &lt;em&gt;Far From Home&lt;/em&gt;, which was released in 2019. Peter Parker is dealing with the fallout of being exposed as Spider-Man and, well, there is just a whole lot going on with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTXezy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; is set to be released on December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden reportedly hosting cybersecurity meeting with Tim Cook, Satya Nadella, and Andy Jassy attending</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At 2019 Dreamforce Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q_ns6qHpSM2ZQEkHxNJqcg898cE=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69766544/1183490754.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p03RW0"&gt;President Joe Biden plans to host a meeting on Wednesday to discuss how companies are improving cybersecurity after the waves of recent security breaches and ransomware attacks, and Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy will be attending, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-23/apple-s-cook-microsoft-s-nadella-plan-to-visit-white-house?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Google, IBM, JPMorgan Chase, and the energy firm Southern Company have also been invited, and Southern Company CEO Tom Fanning is also set to attend, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYxElX"&gt;While it’s not clear exactly what the president and any attendees plan to discuss, there will surely be a lot to talk about given incidents like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288961/solarwinds-hack-100-companies-9-federal-agencies"&gt;massive Solarwinds hack&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22564054/ransomware-revil-kaseya-coop"&gt;Kaseya ransomware attack&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;the Colonial Pipeline shutdown&lt;/a&gt; resulting from a cyberattack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isr1jL"&gt;Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, IBM, JPMorgan, and Southern Company all declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg,&lt;/em&gt; and a Southern Company spokesperson declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The other companies and the White House have not replied to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Offline playback on Spotify’s Wear OS app is rolling out now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aAwtAPEBWT8hyKGNMPeRGomg0_g=/0x7:883x596/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69766296/Spotify_wearOS_banner01_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify’s Wear OS app.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bhwuSr"&gt;Support for offline playback in Spotify’s Wear OS app is rolling now, the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. As spotted &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/spotify-wear-os-update-offline-listening-coming-soon?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+androidcentral+%28Android+Central%29"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, some users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/p9wy9s/got_the_new_spotify_update/"&gt;on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; report that they are already able to use the feature, so if you’ve been waiting for it, you might want to check and see if it’s already rolled out to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtApg4"&gt;There’s a couple caveats to offline playback on Wear OS, though: &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-08-11/enjoy-all-your-music-and-podcasts-offline-on-smartwatches-running-wear-os/"&gt;according to a Spotify blog&lt;/a&gt;, your watch will need to be on Wear OS 2.0 or newer to be able to use the feature, and only Spotify Premium subscribers will be able to download and albums and playlists for offline listening. Both paid and free users can download podcasts for offline playback, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WT3w3D"&gt;Spotify revealed on August 11th that its Wear OS would be getting offline playback &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621394/spotify-wear-os-2-app-offline-playback-smartwatch"&gt;“over the coming weeks,”&lt;/a&gt; so it’s nice to see that it’s now starting to roll out. Offline playback for Spotify was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447222/spotify-adding-feature-music-downloads-offline-apple-watch"&gt;also recently added to the Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443522/deezer-apple-watch-offline-listening"&gt;Deezer beat Spotify to the punch&lt;/a&gt; by adding the feature to its Apple Watch app just a couple days before. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook tries adding video and voice calls back into its main app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qrhBz1dNzp3NWhrrIO9dPVR4NR4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69766292/acastro_180522_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D8EEFX"&gt;Facebook is testing adding voice and video calls to the main Facebook app, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-23/facebook-retools-messaging-again-by-adding-calling-to-main-app?sref=dZ65CIng"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The features are currently part of the standalone Messenger app, which Facebook originally &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/09/facebook-launches-standalone-mobile-messenger-app-and-it%E2%80%99s-beluga/"&gt;spun out of its big blue main app in 2011&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/9/5598440/facebook-will-turn-off-messaging-in-its-mobile-app-forcing-you-to-download-messenger"&gt;officially removed in 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2MdCV"&gt;Voice and video calls are two of several Messenger features that Facebook has introduced in its other products like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20913653/facebook-portal-10-inch-2019-review-price-specs-features-whatsapp-video-calling"&gt;Portal video cameras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440086/facebook-oculus-connect-recap-biggest-announcements-quest-rift-games"&gt;Oculus virtual reality headsets&lt;/a&gt;. The company hasn’t shared if it plans to bring other parts of Messenger back into the fold, but Messenger’s director of product management did tell &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that “you’re going to start to see quite a bit more of this over time.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZQTBSd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Messenger features in everything might make Facebook a harder knot to untangle&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k84gSk"&gt;Facebook confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it is testing voice and video calls in “several countries, including the US.” The company did not share how many users will see the features or what this means for the standalone Messenger app in the future other than “for a full-featured messaging, audio and video call experience, people should continue using Messenger.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hMmQj"&gt;Adding voice and video calls to the Facebook app makes about as much sense as spinning off Messenger in the first place. Yes, it means there’s one less app to switch between while you’re doing other things on your computer or phone, but it also means you’ll have to interact with (or at least see) Facebook on the way — something I’m not sure everyone is interested in doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPUIgw"&gt;There’s also the risk that weaving Messenger into Facebook draws the same kinds of criticism that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495068/facebook-messenger-instagram-cross-platform-messaging-integration"&gt;unifying Messenger and Instagram direct messages&lt;/a&gt; did. It seems like it makes a giant company like Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/10/1/21495514/facebook-account-center-instagram-messenger-direct-integration-adam-mosseri-interview"&gt;even harder to break up&lt;/a&gt; — which may be the point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="st3RHJ"&gt;This isn’t the first suggestion that Facebook was considering getting Messenger back into Facebook, either. In 2019, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18307443/facebook-messenger-app-integration-manchun-wong-standalone"&gt;tested bringing text chats back into the main app&lt;/a&gt; with a dedicated inbox &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/2/20752324/instagram-whatsapp-renamed-adding-facebook-branding"&gt;and splashed “from Facebook”&lt;/a&gt; across Oculus, Instagram, and WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9K77RS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney fires back against Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ijkW7eaYUVr5qZir9sn7wGQgyB8=/7x0:4096x2726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69766064/7845a8b610b38e85a4395b809d7764c6_4096x2726_322c95ed.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WYeIVR"&gt;Disney has filed a motion to have Scarlett Johansson’s lawsuit against the company moved to private arbitration, the latest in the ongoing saga of her complaint against the company over &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;’s streaming release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kh8617"&gt;Disney’s lawyers &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21046887-disney-motion-to-compel-arbitration"&gt;filed the motion&lt;/a&gt; Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court on the grounds that Periwinkle Entertainment, which negotiated her deal, agreed that any claims related to her role in the Marvel film would be handled in confidential arbitration. But the motion also took several swipes at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"&gt;Johansson’s complaint&lt;/a&gt; that argued Marvel, compelled by its parent company Disney, breached an agreement when &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; debuted on Disney Plus through Premier Access the same day that it premiered in theaters. &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; earlier &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/disney-makes-first-move-in-scarlett-johanssons-black-widow-suit-1235001093/"&gt;reported the motion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZTTiq"&gt;Johansson’s complaint argued that the film’s hybrid release cut into her potential earnings, as a simultaneous streaming release hampered the film’s box office permanence and therefore impacted her bonuses. At issue is whether the film should have debuted as a theatrical exclusive. But according to Disney’s motion, Periwinkle’s contract with Marvel “does not mandate theatrical distribution — let alone require that any such distribution be exclusive.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3MxF1"&gt;Furthermore, the motion states, the contract stated that any theatrical obligations would be met with showings on “no less than 1,500 screens.” The motion stated the film in fact debuted on more than 9,600 scenes in the US and 30,000-plus screens worldwide. Additionally, Disney’s lawyers also took issue with Johansson’s claim that she’d lost earnings under the hybrid release model — though it’s still unclear what specifically was promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzXd96"&gt;Echoing comments made by Disney boss Bob Chapek during the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22622604/black-widow-lawsuit-disney-defends-release"&gt;most recent earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, the motion stated that the “hybrid release pattern was the best thing” for &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; as well as everyone attached to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2NU8D"&gt;Disney also provided updated figures on Black Window’s performance, showing that it’s continued to bring in big figures at both the box office and through early access rentals. As of August 15th, &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; has raked in more than $367 million in box office receipts worldwide and more than $125 million in streaming and download receipts, the motion stated, offering seldom-shared figures about the success of a hybrid release in both theaters as well as on a streaming service itself. Accounting for the $55 million the film pulled in on Premier Access and the $80 million in domestic box office receipts during its opening weekend, &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;’s numbers surpassed the opening weekend figures of other Marvel films released pre-pandemic, the company argued, including &lt;em&gt;Ant-Man and the Wasp&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t02TFI"&gt;Disney’s lawyers revealed in the motion that it served Periwinkle a demand for private arbitration on August 10th, a little over a week after Johansson’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"&gt;initial complaint&lt;/a&gt; was filed. The motion stated Periwinkle had yet to respond. Disney also reiterated its previous position that the complaint had “no merit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kw1DDA"&gt;Johansson’s lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment. However, in a statement cited by &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;, her attorney John Berlinski said that Disney “knows that Marvel’s promises to give Black Widow a typical theatrical release ‘like its other films’ had everything to do with guaranteeing that Disney wouldn’t cannibalize box office receipts in order to boost Disney+ subscriptions. Yet that is exactly what happened – and we look forward to presenting the overwhelming evidence that proves it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5A4jE"&gt;In response to the initial complaint in late July, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"&gt;Disney said&lt;/a&gt; there was “no merit whatsoever to this filing.” The company also characterized the suit as “especially sad and distressing in its callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,” adding that Johansson had earned $20 million to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ibgs7z"&gt;A number of organizations in the entertainment industry organizations — including Women in Film, ReFrame, and Time’s Up — have criticized Disney’s response to the lawsuit, saying the “gendered character attack has no place in a business dispute and contributes to an environment in which women and girls are perceived as less able than men to protect their own interests without facing ad hominem criticism.” Last week, fellow Marvel Cinematic Universe star Elizabeth Olsen also &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/08/awards-insider-elizabeth-olsen-and-jason-sudeikis-bring-their-characters-to-the-world-of-streaming"&gt;spoke out&lt;/a&gt; in support of Johansson in an interview with &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqL8GB"&gt;“I think she’s so tough and literally when I read that I was like, ‘good for you Scarlett,’” Olsen said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Fitbit Charge 5 and its features are shown off in leaked video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KpcaskhFFHUkG0j6iM_RCilR4CA=/0x0:2403x1602/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69765895/Screen_Shot_2021_08_23_at_1.12.21_PM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8JbScN"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_snoopytech_/status/1429512996510912516"&gt;leaked video&lt;/a&gt; seems to show off the rumored Fitbit Charge 5, just over a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626752/fitbit-charge-5-leaked-images-specs-news"&gt;we saw renders of it hit the internet&lt;/a&gt;. The video shows off some of the features of the new wearable, including daily readiness and stress management scores, as well as ECG capabilities. The leaker also reveals that the device will cost $179.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqcOh0"&gt;The $179 price tag is $50 more than &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitbit.com%2Fglobal%2Fus%2Fproducts%2Ftrackers%2Fcharge4%3Fsku%3D417BKBK&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22638452%2Ffitbit-charge-5-leak-features-premium-fitness-tracker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a Charge 4 costs now&lt;/a&gt;, but the new version features a color screen instead of a monochromatic one, and adds support for ECGs. Like the Charge 4, the Charge 5 will also have built-in GPS, according to the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wT2JKE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Fitbit Charge 5&lt;br&gt;179 USD&lt;a href="https://t.co/6bhJFPBI6x"&gt;https://t.co/6bhJFPBI6x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Snoopy (@_snoopytech_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_snoopytech_/status/1429512996510912516?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Em46YC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The concept of rest days is something that the Apple Watch sorely lacks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8XZWr"&gt;The main new feature appears to be the Daily Readiness Score, which is only available to those with a $10 a month or $80 a year &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitbit.com%2Fglobal%2Fus%2Fproducts%2Fservices%2Fpremium&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22638452%2Ffitbit-charge-5-leak-features-premium-fitness-tracker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitbit Premium subscription&lt;/a&gt;. The video shows that the score will be calculated based on your exercise history, sleep, and heart rate, and that Fitbit will recommend what kind of exercise you should do for the day. For example, if you went hard at the gym the day before, or didn’t sleep well, the Fitbit may recommend a light yoga workout instead of a 15-mile run.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z6cLBHed_JwnOeU7REiC_dPt3sI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801309/Screen_Shot_2021_08_23_at_1.28.44_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Readiness Score telling you to take a break.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P4KJbN"&gt;The concept of rest days, or days where you’re just not feeling well is something that the Apple Watch sorely lacks, and a color screen would definitely help push the Charge 5 closer to the smartwatch side of the wearable spectrum. Fitbit Premium also competes with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;Apple’s Fitness Plus service&lt;/a&gt;, as it also offers audio / video workouts that you can follow along with (as well as access to a health coach for an extra $45 a month). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ME1rUS"&gt;The leaked video doesn’t mention a release date, but this leak (along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626752/fitbit-charge-5-leaked-images-specs-news"&gt;the recent renders of the device&lt;/a&gt;) seem to imply that the device is coming sooner rather than later. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Oculus Quest feature can automatically sync VR photos and video clips to your phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HTtyXKMQ1Y5G3IvBELdzxy3TV34=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69765336/akrales_200904_4160_0390.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7C411b"&gt;Oculus has begun rolling out a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fa-more-flexible-oculus-move-improved-gifting-and-more-in-the-latest-oculus-software-update%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;set of new software features&lt;/a&gt; for Quest and Quest 2 virtual reality headsets. The v32 update introduces some small, but important tweaks to the in-headset user experience, as well as to the Oculus Move health tracking app. The feature that most piqued my attention is an option to automatically sync saved photos and videos captured within VR to the Oculus mobile app for iOS and Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8IBUO"&gt;In an earlier update, Oculus let you upload files from a headset through the Browser app within VR, an improvement over the original method of plugging the headset into a PC. But this update goes a step further in removing friction for viewing or sharing content, as it lets you do it without a headset on. To sync items from your headset (running v32 software, of course) to the app for the first time, open up the Files app from your Quest’s app library within the headset, then click the cloud icon that will appear at its top-right corner. It’ll ask you to turn on the syncing feature. Once you’re finished, your clips and pics will be viewable and shareable within the “Devices” pane in the Oculus mobile app. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4yY7Yhqi8ngeKk4GQGFWwqxel9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800904/oculusv32.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6YL3Zm"&gt;Oculus has made a few other changes, including the ability to gift apps and games while you have a headset on. Previously (and frustratingly), gifting had to be done by the Oculus app or through a browser, but you can do it all in one place now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmQJuF"&gt;If you like to chat with your Oculus friends while in virtual reality, you’ll soon find these contacts in the “People” tab within Facebook Messenger in VR, not as a separate section. Oculus contacts will be placed in the same list as your Facebook friends, but Oculus says that the friends you made in VR won’t be able to see Facebook activity unless you add them as friends on Facebook, so they remain separate despite how it may appear within the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1J1jb6"&gt;Oculus told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that this will be the new setup for everyone who installs the v32 software, though you can use a filter that can display your Oculus or Facebook friends instead of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNnqXj"&gt;Lastly, Oculus is making tweaks to its Move fitness platform that can monitor your movements within games to report metrics, much like a fitness tracker does. Instead of only tracking daily goals, Oculus added a new weekly goal metric that lets you select how many days you’re aiming to work out in VR each week. It’s also letting you share Oculus Move workout stats that you’re proud of to your Facebook timeline, groups, or within Messenger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nvMYg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 23rd, 4:47PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Oculus clarified that, while all Quest users who have v32 software will see Oculus and Facebook friends listed together in Messenger within VR, they will be able to use a filter within Messenger to display either Oculus or Facebook friends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google plans to customize Play Store app ratings for users’ country and device</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/63cSpH_4TeCyYeJfG168C4M1ma0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69765618/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s7cn2N"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/08/making-ratings-and-reviews-better-for.html"&gt;announced changes&lt;/a&gt; to how it calculates and displays app ratings on the Play Store on Monday that could make them more useful and relevant to users and developers (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/23/google-play-ratings-country-form-factor/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). In place of one rating for an entire app, which can come in a variety of forms and levels of relative goodness depending on the device, Google plans to break things down with specific ratings for the country your device is registered in and specific ratings for the form factor of the device you’re using to browse the Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yE5JAW"&gt;There are some clear-cut reasons why this change might be helpful. First, not every app offers the same features or functionality everywhere because of national laws, and one universal law — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20847758/google-android-update-problem-pie-q-treble-mainline"&gt;Android fragmentation&lt;/a&gt;. If I’m a developer selling a messaging app in the Play Store, I don’t want my ratings to be bombed because the payment feature I only offer in a single country is currently borked. The other, even more important reason: some apps just suck in larger tablet or foldable forms. Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18700394/google-tablets-android-chromeos-priorities-cancellation"&gt;had issues with anything larger than a phone&lt;/a&gt;, so specific ratings for alternative form factors mean you can be warned in advance when you’re downloading something for your Android tablet that might not work as well as you remember it working on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cTxwXQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An incentive to make apps work better on devices other than phones?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYolTJ"&gt;Google plans on rolling out the country-specific ratings this November and form factor-specific ratings in 2022 (for tablets, foldables, Chrome OS, Wear OS, or Android Auto). The company will also notify developers ahead of both changes if Google’s new method of calculating ratings meaningfully changes their apps’ rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="BrudT0"&gt;At least 10 weeks before any change in Play Store, we’ll automatically analyze the change your app can expect to see and reach out to any developer that will see a change of more that 0.2 stars on any device type in a key market (one with greater than five percent of your store listing visitors). This will give you time to plan if you want to make key changes to your app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="E8ibQB"&gt;Both changes should be helpful, but particularly the upcoming device form factor considerations. Foldables like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617206/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-features-specs-price-hands-on"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; are becoming more popular, but not every app has adapted to them yet (looking at you, Instagram). Now there’ll be a slightly stronger incentive to do so or risk a worse rating from the people actually using the app on those devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxHP9V"&gt;As part of Google’s announcement, the company is also surfacing more Play Store data and metrics for developers to pour over in the Google Play Console, including device type insights that break down ratings based on what device is using an app. You can &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/08/making-ratings-and-reviews-better-for.html"&gt;check Google’s blog&lt;/a&gt; for all of the other changes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sex workers made OnlyFans valuable —  then it sold them out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EuvzyisksNlUPeNnSn_XHnUN4uU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69765584/jbareham_180207_2293_0057.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Graphic by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Pressure from payment processors is leaving OnlyFans creators with nowhere to turn&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="AlNOrM"&gt;In 2019, OnlyFans, a content subscription platform founded three years prior, had about &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/business/onlyfans-pandemic-users.html"&gt;120,000 creators&lt;/a&gt; registered with the site. But after the pandemic left millions of people out of work and sex workers unable to safely meet with clients in person, people flocked to the platform, which was already well-known for its adult content. By the end of 2020, OnlyFans boasted 1 million creators and 90 million users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NcY2Sm"&gt;Creators liked the control the platform gave them over the kind of work they wanted to do — but the more the site grew, the more nervous they got. “OnlyFans is not going to last, but it is a hell of a ride,” OnlyFans creator Kimberly Kane told the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/18/magazine/onlyfans-porn.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in May. “They’ll take it away from us, just like they do everything else. It’s only a matter of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Aep61W"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’ll take it away from us, just like they do everything else.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yhng2V"&gt;She was right. On Thursday, the site announced it would ban sexually explicit content beginning in October, in order to “comply with the requests of [the platform’s] banking partners and payout providers” as it seeks to attract outside investors. OnlyFans said &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-19/onlyfans-to-block-sexually-explicit-videos-starting-in-october?sref=nF2P89s4"&gt;it would still allow&lt;/a&gt; its now more than 2 million creators to post nude photos and videos that comply with the platform’s new policies — though many creators on the platform are still confused about precisely what will be allowed. It’s part of a longtime confusion in how sex workers interact with the app, which is known for X-rated content but rarely marketed as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfGrVs"&gt;Put another way, OnlyFans had buckled under pressure from companies &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/business/visa-mastercard-block-pornhub.html"&gt;like Mastercard and Visa&lt;/a&gt;, which last year implemented more stringent requirements for banks that process payments for sites where adult content is sold. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.xbiz.com/news/258606/heres-what-the-new-mastercard-rules-mean-for-adult-sites-producers"&gt;new guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, banks must ensure that sellers have provided documentation about their age and obtained consent from anyone else who appears in their posts. Though these verification processes were already standard for OnlyFans, the specter of liability looms large for companies that have become targets of the &lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160488/nick-kristof-holy-war-pornhub"&gt;longstanding conservative war&lt;/a&gt; on internet pornography and sex work. Finding it somewhat difficult to win their battles legislatively — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21026787/sesta-fosta-congress-study-hhs-sex-work-ro-khanna-elizabeth-warren-ron-wyden"&gt;though they have managed that, too&lt;/a&gt; — religious groups have zeroed in on individual websites and apps, as well as the banking institutions they rely on to enact their agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="aTgruB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a softer version of censorship”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tkyT4c"&gt;“Banking institutions are tremendously conservative — much moreso than the general culture — and they’re risk averse,” said Mike Stabile, the director of public affairs at the Free Speech Coalition, an advocacy group for workers in the adult industry. “What they’re doing is a softer version of censorship. It doesn’t come from the government; it happens at the credit card level. They set the terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UByWTg"&gt;Banks’ and credit card companies’ influence over adult content has been a slow creep, spanning years. PayPal, Chase, and Mastercard have shut out sex workers &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-02-paypal-square-and-big-bankings-war-on-the-sex-industry.html"&gt;for well over a decade&lt;/a&gt; and have only continued to make their policies more stringent. In 2014, Melissa Gira Grant reported on the payment processor WePay, which at the time was &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/05/30/spying_sex_and_finance_what_banks_and_payment_processors_are_secretly_watching_to_avoid_risk/"&gt;blocking sex workers&lt;/a&gt; from using its services — even when they weren’t using them for sex work. The result is almost always the same: platforms end up banning sexual content, driving sex workers off the site and forcing them into unsafer situations. During the pandemic, that might mean doing in-person sex work that increases their risk of contracting COVID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkYsMj"&gt;Mary Moody, a cam model and board member of the advocacy group Adult Industry Laborers &amp;amp; Artists, called the move “a workers rights and human rights disaster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QjcmCT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the privileged few are able to move and adapt”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GIvsBR"&gt;“When you rip a huge market share out of the adult industry — such as PornHub or OnlyFans — suddenly they have no way to interact with fans, no way to sell or market their content,” she says. “So what happens is the privileged few are able to move and adapt, while more marginalized workers, who may have worked in riskier street-based sex work prior to OnlyFans are pushed offline, and into the streets.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rBKOs"&gt;As betrayed as sex workers may feel by OnlyFans specifically, Moody called for most of the focus to be put on the forces exerting pressure on the platform. Unless advocates and organizers can tamp down on the groups influencing sites’ policies, sex workers will continue hopping from one platform to another, losing huge portions of their fan base — and therefore huge portions of their income — each time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UiwsGE"&gt;What the new policies mean for OnlyFans is still yet to be seen. When PornHub &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/pornhub-visa-mastercard-major-changes-platform-rules-revenge-porn-2020-12"&gt;altered its community standards&lt;/a&gt; last year, the site expanded its content moderation team and prohibited unverified users from uploading new content. But while it was a significant shift for the site and the creators who use it, the changes didn’t necessarily change the essential nature of the platform — PornHub is still a porn site. The same goes for a platform like Patreon, which &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-27-patreon-adult-content-crowdfunding-uncertainty.html"&gt;cracked down on adult content&lt;/a&gt; in 2017; Patreon wasn’t necessarily &lt;em&gt;known&lt;/em&gt; for its adult content. But if sex workers vanish from OnlyFans over the next couple of months — as well as their vast fan bases — it would seem that much of the site’s value could disappear, too. Who would be left? The fitness instructors, influencers, and celebrities OnlyFans has promoted over the sex workers who form the foundation of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mb5lYE"&gt;“What sex workers have learned to do is find platforms where the conditions are at least somewhat amenable and make them their own,” Stabile said. “Sex workers really did build this up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="Zdx0SE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They want to remove discussions of sex and sexuality from the public sphere”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UjSK8g"&gt;Other sites, like FanCentro, have remained more loyal to sex workers over time, by more readily embracing their identity as a website for adult content. When FanCentro launched in 2017, its founders built its own payment processor to ease some of the complications that can arise when contracting services like PayPal. “We don’t have to see who’s going to help us this time, what are their rates,” said Kat Revenga, FanCentro’s vice president. “It can make things less complex since it’s seen as a high-risk industry.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="veAPSh"&gt;Since the OnlyFans announcement, FanCentro has seen a massive boom in people registering with their platform. Whereas before they were averaging less than 70 new signups a day, over the last few days that number has jumped to 5,000, Revenga says. But while FanCentro may be more welcoming of sex workers on their platform, it’s not immune to Mastercard’s and Visa’s policies, since users will still pay for content using those credit card companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAAwMv"&gt;That’s why advocates are sounding alarm bells about banks, censorship, and net neutrality, emphasizing a larger narrative about who controls the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HTMap"&gt;“OnlyFans deplatforming legal sex work is a perfect example of why we need an Internet with fewer choke points for censorship,” Lia Holland, the director of campaigns and communications at Fight for the Future, a digital rights advocacy group, said in a statement last week. “Big Banks and payment processors should never be the arbiters of who or what can exist online, and it’s disturbing that in the year 2021 these behemoth monopolies are still throwing their weight around to censor consensual, legal, online self expression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKjaAm"&gt;The deplatforming of sex workers on sites like OnlyFans, TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter has the most immediate and life-threatening consequences for sex workers. But for the reasons Holland says, these policies have the potential to change the way everyone uses the internet, dictating what we can see, sell, buy, and say online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="P9yWml"&gt;The conservative groups behind the anti-porn and anti-sex work campaigns “actually want to turn back time,” Stabile said. “They want to remove discussions of sex and sexuality from the public sphere — which of course disproportionately targets women, LGBTQ people, and other marginalized people. And that hurts all of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
