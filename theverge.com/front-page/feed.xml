    <title>Google settles with worker allegedly fired for his workplace activism</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z09WWoC_zhwdLcsWCe8VaMjVrZc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831999/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6N0gM6"&gt;Google reached a settlement with a fired employee who the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) claims was let go from the company for his workplace activism, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-08/google-settles-with-employee-allegedly-fired-for-activism?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The employee, Laurence Berland, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20983053/google-fires-four-employees-memo-rebecca-rivers-laurence-berland-union-busting-accusation-walkout"&gt;fired in 2019&lt;/a&gt; allegedly for violating Google’s data security policies. He had been a vocal critic of Google’s work with the US Customs and Border Protection and was terminated amid internal organizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nS1ix5"&gt;The settlement was approved in July by the NLRB, though the terms haven’t been revealed, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. Google hasn’t replied to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JGpO7"&gt;The NLRB has accused Google of violating labor law &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421969/google-illegally-firing-three-workers-nlrb-president-biden"&gt;in firing Berland and four other workers in 2019&lt;/a&gt; over organizing activities and is still battling Google over those accusations. One employee, Kathryn Spiers, was allegedly fired for creating an internal pop-up message reminding workers of their labor rights; Google said she didn’t have the proper approval for sending that code, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21024472/google-employee-fired-labor-rights-notification-tool"&gt;according to Spiers&lt;/a&gt;. The other employees, including Berland, Sophie Waldman, Rebecca Rivers, and Paul Duke, say they were fired for &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/google-fired-us-for-organizing-were-fighting-back-d0daa8113aed"&gt;participating in protected labor organizing&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/12/3/20992786/google-workers-fired-nlrb-laurence-berland-rebecca-rivers-sophie-waldman-paul-duke"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; they were let go for violating the company’s data security policies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood opens up a slow and steady approach to crypto investing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JAx739oeJkBvBYXjsyshW26hazM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831985/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dDfHN7"&gt;Robinhood is &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/9/8/crypto-recurring-investments-are-here"&gt;rolling out a new feature&lt;/a&gt; that lets you automatically invest in cryptocurrencies on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule. The investment app says this service will let you automatically invest in things like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and &lt;a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/commission-free-cryptocurrency-investing/"&gt;other supported cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt; without a commission fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNfTJL"&gt;Before we go any further, though, I should warn you that nothing in this article is qualified or expert financial advice. It’s probably wise to talk with an expert who can help you come up with an investment strategy that’s right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJnKju"&gt;Robinhood’s approach here is automatic investing, not trading. It won’t sell the crypto for you when an algorithm decides it’d make financial sense to do so. Instead, it’s just steadily building your crypto portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9ULJEeFxrxuBnYWeERs0Vog40w8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835317/Recurring_Flow_9_8_Update.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Robinhood&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A view of what recurring crypto investments looks like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Q26ozn"&gt;Robinhood pitches this as a way to do “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdJgJqEOOQ4"&gt;dollar-cost averaging&lt;/a&gt;,” which is more or less financial speak for not worrying about what the market is doing and instead investing the same amount regularly, letting the gains and losses come out in the wash. In other words, you’re adhering to the financial maxim “time in the market beats timing the market.” Of course, in this case, the market isn’t an index fund or anything like that; it’s cryptocurrencies, which have a reputation for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660932/crypto-exchanges-el-salvador-bitcoin-price-dip"&gt;being rather volatile&lt;/a&gt;. Whether the strategy works for Bitcoin et al. is probably a question for &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/crypto-ceo-uses-dollar-cost-averaging-to-buy-bitcoin.html"&gt;more finance-focused publications&lt;/a&gt; and experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3acWX"&gt;The concept of “HODLing,” or holding, has long been a meme in the crypto and WallStreetBets communities. They’ll sometimes encourage people to keep their stocks through whatever losses may come in hopes of selling them for a profit in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TGdjbQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Robinhood’s approach is a traditional finance method applied to crypto&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nYdwIQ"&gt;There are other cryptocurrencies that try to reward users for holding in different ways. Coinbase has been giving users extra coins for &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/07/coinbase-will-now-reward-users-for-holding-this-cryptocurrency/"&gt;keeping certain cryptocurrencies since 2019&lt;/a&gt;. That kind of system is actually the basis of an alternative mining system called proof-of-stake, which looks to solve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;the energy demands&lt;/a&gt; of the more traditional proof-of-work systems. In proof-of-stake systems, miners put up their crypto as collateral for a chance to create a block, and if they're chosen, they’ll get a reward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rV35pI"&gt;However, Robinhood’s approach is much more in the vein of traditional finance methods, just applied to new tech. It’s somewhat ironic, then, that the feature isn’t available to users in New York, a major financial center in the US. The company says that the feature will be “gradually” rolling out to its users throughout the month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Addison Rae signs Netflix film deal after going from TikTok to He’s All That</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="“He’s All That” Special Screening" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V1BHQXVzFpM6AHTUMpvA-grxOMc=/0x0:4988x3325/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831966/1336432090.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vivien Killilea/Getty Images for Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xd8D2W"&gt;Netflix is doubling down on TikTok star Addison Rae with &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/addison-rae-enters-multi-picture-creative-partnership-with-netflix"&gt;a new multi-picture film deal&lt;/a&gt; that could see the social media celebrity bringing even more eyes to the streaming service, As part of the deal, Netflix will develop projects specifically for Rae to star in and executive produce (&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/addison-rae-tiktok-netflix-hes-all-that-1235052075/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e15qed"&gt;The motivation seems to be the early success of &lt;em&gt;He’s All That&lt;/em&gt;, the gender-swapped remake of &lt;em&gt;She’s All That, &lt;/em&gt;which&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433195/tiktok-influencer-addison-rae-miramax-gender-swapped-shes-all-that-remake"&gt;first announced in September 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The company projects the film will be watched by more than 55 million households in the first month of release and says it reached #1 on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21151327/netflix-top-10-list-homepage-subscribers-originals-licensed-movies-tv-shows"&gt;the company’s chart&lt;/a&gt; “in 78 countries, including Brazil, France, and Saudi Arabia.” Critical reception to&lt;em&gt; He’s All That&lt;/em&gt; has been mixed, from &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22643642/hes-all-that-review-netflix-remake"&gt;surprisingly positive&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.avclub.com/tiktoker-addison-rae-promotes-some-brands-in-netflix-s-1847556794"&gt;rightfully dismissive&lt;/a&gt;, but that might not matter. Netflix’s director of family film Naketha Mattocks believes Rae’s promise is “undeniable as evidenced by&lt;em&gt; He’s All That &lt;/em&gt;and her already passionate fan base.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Ixn1G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Social media stars are breaking through on streaming platforms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NZjLOB"&gt;Netflix’s numbers have to be taken with a grain of salt, though. The company doesn’t open its full data up to others, and its metrics for what counts as a “view” are very different from a box office receipt or Nielsen rating. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075927/netflix-the-witcher-viewer-numbers-length-metrics-q4-2019-earnings"&gt;watching at least two minutes of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;counts as a view by Netflix’s standards. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313325/apple-tv-plus-billie-eilish-documentary-numbers-box-office-streaming-netflix-hulu"&gt;Some of that opaqueness&lt;/a&gt; and “flexibility” is par for the course in the streaming era, but it’s worth noting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shYtPN"&gt;Still, Rae is immensely popular, with around 84 million followers on Tiktok alone, so it follows she’d bring some kind of audience to whatever future projects Netflix cooks up. Along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189180/charli-damelio-dixie-hulu-reality-series-documentary-tiktok-kardashians"&gt;the similarly TikTok famous D’Amelio family&lt;/a&gt;, Rae is part of a recent wave of influencers and creators trying to push into other mediums. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/02/damelio-rae-netflix-hulu/"&gt;There’s been concern they’d falter&lt;/a&gt; in ways similar earlier online stars did while transitioning to old-school forms of showbiz razzle-dazzle, but Rae’s deal may be a sign things are changing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The LAPD built collecting social media info into its interview process for civilians</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="LAPD officers being under an order to wear masks." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1qA8OuTp22bc7nB0wd2upDSAiYw=/0x0:2069x1379/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831830/1234644879.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zANvuB"&gt;The Los Angeles Police Department asked officers to gather social media information as a standard part of their interviews with civilians, whether or not the people were implicated in a crime. The practice, revealed in public records &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/lapd-documents-reveal-use-social-media-monitoring-tools"&gt;obtained by the Brennan Center for Justice&lt;/a&gt;, is part of a larger LAPD social media monitoring strategy — one that’s similar to other US police department policies but may go beyond them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JigbTU"&gt;As the Brennan Center notes, &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/D.%20Beck%20FI%20Memo%202015.pdf"&gt;a 2015 memo&lt;/a&gt; from LAPD Police Chief Charlie Beck told the department that “similar to a nickname or an alias, a person’s online persona or identity used for social media and communication can be highly beneficial to investigations and possibly even future outreach programs.” Beck said that officers should collect “social media and email account information” when filling out field interview report forms — which were updated to specifically ask about social media data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KK3Ip3"&gt;Previous reporting has indicated that the LAPD aggregates field interview information &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/training-documents-palantir-lapd"&gt;into a database&lt;/a&gt; run by surveillance company Palantir. Officers are allowed — but not required — to enter field interview cards for &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-26/lapd-division-gang-framing-scandal"&gt;anyone they come into contact with&lt;/a&gt;. Broadly collecting social media data could leave people who are stopped by police vulnerable to additional online surveillance regardless of whether they’re officially under investigation. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/08/revealed-los-angeles-police-officers-gathering-social-media"&gt;An LAPD spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the interview forms were being “updated” but didn’t describe what the update includes, and the LAPD’s press office did not immediately respond to a request for clarification from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyn3Pj"&gt;The newly released documents also offer more details about how the LAPD has worked with online surveillance companies — a practice many police departments participate in. In 2016, the &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/Dataminr.pdf"&gt;LAPD apparently employed&lt;/a&gt; Twitter analytics firm Dataminr (whose access Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/15/13969110/twitter-dataminr-fusion-center-geospatial-data-surveillance"&gt;later limited&lt;/a&gt;) to receive alerts around shooting and bomb threats, but also to track the movements of anti-Trump protesters on May Day. The department also used tracking service Geofeedia (which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/13/14909248/facebook-platform-surveillance-policy-developers-data"&gt;cut off by Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram&lt;/a&gt;) to &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/H.%20Search%20terms.pdf"&gt;monitor protest-related keywords&lt;/a&gt; including #BlackLivesMatter and #FuckDonaldTrump. More recently, the LAPD has apparently entered a contract with Media Sonar — &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/2.%20Media%20Sonar%20Promotional%20Material.pdf"&gt;which pitches&lt;/a&gt; the ability to “automatically find digital footprints in the matter of seconds.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos’ Earth Fund pledges $150 million to climate justice groups</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon.com Inc. CEO Jeff Bezos Speaks At The National Press Club" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rDGwDVk8r-l4vlGbUGagQtt6r8c=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831745/1169506493.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jeff Bezos speaks during a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, Sept. 19, 2019. | Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v96T8M"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ $10 billion Earth Fund just doled out millions more in funding to groups fighting off climate change. This time, a lot of the cash is going to groups that advocate for communities of color and low-income neighborhoods, which often face the first and worst effects of climate change and fossil fuel pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmBMCI"&gt;The fund &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-grants-from-the-bezos-earth-fund-emphasize-climate-justice-pro-jobs-climate-action-and-innovation-in-decarbonization-301370952.html?tc=eml_cleartime"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a total of $203.7 million in new grants today. Of that, more than $53 million will go toward communications on climate change and efforts to cut emissions from businesses. Another $20 million will go to groups focused on climate justice — a movement to stop climate change from taking a disproportionate toll on already marginalized communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mbgybv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A movement to stop climate change from taking a disproportionate toll on already marginalized communities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1XzwR0"&gt;The Earth Fund plans to work with the Biden administration to disburse the biggest chunk of funding, $130 million, by the end of the year. That’ll go to organizations supporting a Biden administration initiative called Justice40 that the White House &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-executive-actions-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad-create-jobs-and-restore-scientific-integrity-across-federal-government/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in January. It’s a plan to ensure that disadvantaged communities receive 40 percent of the “overall benefits” from federal investment in new infrastructure and climate solutions.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RMR1kQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today the Bezos Earth Fund announced its commitment of $150M this year in support of environmental justice groups implementing the Justice40 Initiative. Disadvantaged communities have borne the brunt of environmental damage for too long and are key actors in driving solutions.1/2&lt;/p&gt;— Andrew Steer (@DrAndrewSteer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrAndrewSteer/status/1435574312401096704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKvhEv"&gt;The announcement comes after Bezos faced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266225/jeff-bezos-climate-change-earth-fund-amazon-pollution"&gt;flak from activists&lt;/a&gt; for not earmarking enough funding for communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis. The fund allocated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569902/jeff-bezos-first-recipients-10-billion-climate-change-fund"&gt;$791 million&lt;/a&gt; to environmental organizations in its first round of giving last year. A majority of that went to big green groups, including the World Wildlife Fund and Environmental Defense Fund, with deeper pockets than scrappier climate justice-focused organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vjz6ej"&gt;“We have to run and put our finger in so many different holes,” says Dwaign Tyndal, executive director of the Boston-based nonprofit Alternatives for Community and Environment. “We carry so much of this work, relative to the resources that are allocated ... Many of our groups are Black and brown, Indigenous groups and somehow that money has not trickled down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="vFIsG0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Many of our groups are Black and brown, Indigenous groups and somehow that money has not trickled down.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IfLmmg"&gt;While activists say today’s announcement makes good progress on climate justice, it still falls short of the level they’d like to see when it comes to investments in the most vulnerable communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1aljsi"&gt;“The Bezos fund is improving, but they still have some ways to go,” says Maria Lopez-Nuñez, a deputy director of organizing and advocacy at the Newark, New Jersey-based Ironbound Community Corporation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5q3fTx"&gt;She wants to see at least 40 percent of investments from both Bezos’ Earth Fund and Biden’s Justice40 initiative flow into communities hard hit by climate disasters and pollution. Currently, roughly 30 percent of all the Earth Fund grants (including the “pledge” to give an additional $130 million later this year) have gone toward environmental justice initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XeVqUd"&gt;The Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, which advocates for Gulf Coast communities like Louisiana’s “cancer alley,” is one of the Earth Fund grantees named today. Cancer alley earned the moniker because of how its residents have coped with the health &lt;a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/03/1086172"&gt;hazards from more than 150 refineries and chemical plants&lt;/a&gt; in the region. After &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/06/us/hurricane-ida-cancer-alley-pollution/index.html"&gt;Hurricane Ida hit the area hard&lt;/a&gt; last week, local organizations like RISE St. James are scrambling to &lt;a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2021/9/8/hurricane_ida_sharon_lavigne"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; oil spills and chemical releases that the storm unleashed. The aftermath of Ida is an example of why similar grassroots groups need funding, activists tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RQDScD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We want the real deal.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8RPUKw"&gt;Surrounding Bezos’ new round of funding is a much larger national debate over how to ensure that the Justice40 program serves those most in need. Activists and policymakers are still working to define &lt;a href="https://grist.org/equity/new-york-environmental-justice-policy-defining-disadvantaged-communities-clcpa-justice40/"&gt;what constitutes a disadvantaged community&lt;/a&gt;. Once that’s hammered out, they’ll also need to figure out what it looks like for those communities to receive 40 percent of “overall benefits” from federal investments. The language doesn’t necessarily mean that they’ll get 40 percent of the actual funding, so community organizers like Lopez-Nuñez aren’t sure exactly what they’d be given. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niXPcs"&gt;“We don’t want byproducts. We want the real deal,” says Lopez-Nuñez. The real deal for Lopez-Nuñez is direct investment in vulnerable communities, not the undefined “overall benefits” of funding streams that communities themselves don’t control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vwRIsJ"&gt;Even though Bezos has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22563671/andy-jassy-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos"&gt;stepped down&lt;/a&gt; from his role as Amazon’s CEO, his climate legacy is still marred by the retail giant’s pollution, say activists like Lopez-Nuñez. The company has been the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453516/amazon-workers-pollution-petition-letter-demand"&gt;target&lt;/a&gt; of campaign after campaign by residents living with pollution from Amazon’s warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Efg75W"&gt;“The Earth Fund is a complicated fund, given how Bezos has made his wealth on the exploitation of workers and the environment,” Lopez-Nuñez says. “[The money] comes from our communities; it’s been extracted from our communities, at the cost of our health.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0b7sTV"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? There are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654621/apple-watch-series-7-new-watchfaces-bigger-screens"&gt;lots of expectations for a new Series 7 model&lt;/a&gt; ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22648593/apple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch"&gt;Apple’s “California Streaming” event on September 14th&lt;/a&gt;, however, the new editions might bring larger sizes in addition to higher price points than we often see with the current models. Each Apple Watch offers ample functionality, and has seen more than its fair share of discounts over the last year. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model — and the highest end — is the Apple Watch Series 6, which starts at $399 for the GPS model or $429 with cellular connectivity. If that seems too expensive, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which also launched nearly a year ago at $279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, there’s the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt; and the current update process for the Series 3 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience"&gt;become a bit of a pain point&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hdRa4b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741666"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a good entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and excellent build quality, especially if the SE and Series 6 seem out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $169 at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in either white or black, which is $30 off its usual retail price. If you are looking for the Series 3 in the larger 42mm configuration, both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-38mm-Space-Aluminium/dp/B07K3HG6T9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have knocked the price down from $229 to $199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zc5j8W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s flagship, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qq3ebV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ikPbUG"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped white version of the SE for $249 at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XX59T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F555062032%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Both retailers are also currently offering the same model in black for $269 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5W9QWZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Space-Gray-Aluminum-Case-with-Black-Sport-Band-Regular%2F585668092%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDCEnn"&gt;If you’re looking for the larger 44mm model with GPS, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-44mm/dp/B08J5QB5QT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=38733&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-44mm%2Fprod25100056" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt; are offering it at a slight discount of $299, though, the latter is only exclusive to Sam’s Club members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="23GjQy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741223"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="rUGNYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Apple Watch Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Deals often come and go quickly on the Series 6. If you don’t mind a bit of vibrancy on your wrist, however, the 40mm, GPS-enabled red configuration usually sees the biggest discounts with the most frequency. That said, the 40mm blue and pink models have the biggest discounts at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5LPB6G?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now, with each retailing for $329. The overall prices among all Series 6 watches can wax and wane on nearly a day-to-day basis, so keep your eyes peeled and be sure to check our usual daily deal roundups as well as weekly newsletter for the latest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8KuZ3"&gt;If the larger, 44mm Series 6 is your fancy, it’s available in red at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $349, slightly more than its best-ever price and evidence of the major discounts the red versions can sometimes see. Other colorways, including the &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F253347819%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F351352991%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white models&lt;/a&gt;, are available for $379 and $371, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rn8JJi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10598305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum, Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings have similar designs to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel, brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above, and they are functionally the same, save for some exclusive digital watch faces Apple reserves for these premium models. Overall, the upmarket stainless, titanium, and Hermès edition Apple Watches don’t usually get the discounts and sales as the aluminum models, where the deals are often to be had.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA sets new date for James Webb Space Telescope launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8I905fOz9SxBpBKEzLuMrxZeB68=/0x500:7466x5477/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831613/webbcomplete3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JxScVZ"&gt;The James Webb Space Telescope, humanity’s next big space-bound eye on the cosmos, has a new launch date of December 18th, NASA announced on Wednesday. It’s the latest among dozens of other delays for a telescope that was originally planned to go to space as early as 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HK0luF"&gt;The $8.8 billion observatory, named after NASA’s second administrator, is a tennis court-sized successor to NASA’s famed Hubble telescope. Its 18 hexagonal gold-plated mirrors will allow the spacecraft to view distant planets and the far reaches of the universe with a level of detail that far surpasses Hubble’s capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeY4hp"&gt;Astronomers have been looking forward to the telescope’s launch for years, but its development has been set back by years of delays, development challenges, and cost overruns. NASA and Northrop Grumman, the telescope’s prime contractor, initially set a $1 billion budget for James Webb and a launch date for sometime in 2007. By 2011, the launch date had slipped to 2018, but that was pushed ever further, with development accidents driving up costs. Early last year, NASA’s inspector general &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21112504/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-delay-gao-audit-march-2021"&gt;foresaw delays due to a handful of technical challenges&lt;/a&gt;. And the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327601/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-delay-october-31-2021"&gt;pandemic added more delays last year&lt;/a&gt;, pushing the launch date to October 31st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDMJ7r"&gt;The latest delay had nothing to do with the telescope. The Ariane 5 rocket James Webb will launch on was effectively grounded for nearly a year due to problems with its payload fairings that were detected in two separate commercial missions in 2020. The rocket successfully launched a batch of satellites in July. In the same month, the European Space Agency — NASA’s partner on the telescope — signed off on James Webb’s new launch plan in a key review that showed “positive results” during technical evaluations, the agency said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7s67ZZ"&gt;NASA &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-readies-james-webb-space-telescope-for-december-launch"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the new date was set in consultation with Arianespace, the French company whose Ariane 5 rocket will send James Webb to space from a launch site in Kourou, French Guiana managed by the European Space Agency (ESA). The observatory, a joint project between NASA, ESA, and the Canadian space agency, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/nasa-s-james-webb-space-telescope-has-completed-testing"&gt;wrapped up final tests&lt;/a&gt; late last month, and now it’s undergoing shipment operations. Engineers will enclose the spacecraft in a custom (and very expensive) shipping container before it’s sent to Kourou. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odGG6K"&gt;While it &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; has a new launch date to space, the exact timing of when the spacecraft sets sail to South America is still being kept under wraps as a security precaution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuTGoT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4eZfj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="1TIDKy"&gt;Fitness company Whoop has a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/introducing-whoop-4-0-and-whoop-body-featuring-any-wear-technology-301371503.html"&gt;new tracker&lt;/a&gt; that squishes five LEDs, four photodiodes, a pulse oximeter, skin temperature sensor, and more into a package that is 33 percent smaller than its predecessor — all while still offering five days of battery life. But a particular change to the tracker’s battery chemistry is one of the biggest reasons Whoop was able to do all this in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzdMa6"&gt;The change was pioneered by a Silicon Valley company called Sila Nanotechnologies, which was co-founded in 2011 by Gene Berdichevsky, one of Tesla’s earliest employees. And it’s one that, if it scales up, could help break some of the biggest limitations currently facing lithium-ion technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXy9i0"&gt;On paper, it’s a simple change: the battery’s anode is now made of silicon instead of graphite, which allows for greater energy density (up to 20 percent, Sila claims). Greater energy density means device makers can use a smaller battery to accomplish the same tasks — or free up more space to do things they couldn’t before. And it doesn’t require any hardware changes to the cell production process. In fact, that’s one of Sila’s biggest selling points to battery makers: its silicon anode is more or less plug-and-play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rj3zcV"&gt;In practice, though, this change was only possible after years of trial and error and millions of dollars spent. Sila toiled with a number of different so-called “precursors,” or raw materials, in order to find the right mix to be able to create its breakthrough silicon powder. And it did this with a mandate from Berdichevsky that those precursors had to be widely available — even if that made it harder to reach the theoretical performance jumps silicon anodes can provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="7917MH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Far greater energy density, which means more room for new features&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eK1f0p"&gt;“Those constraints, they sharpen the innovation,” Berdichevsky tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “[But] they make it harder. So you have less degrees of freedom&lt;em&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4JJbF"&gt;As a result, Berdichevsky says it took Sila about twice as long as he originally hoped to get into a consumer product. But considering the supply chain shortages currently strangling just about every industry imaginable, it was a prescient decision to build on such a foundation. He also says it’s helped Sila attract a deep roster of smart minds from multiple highly competitive fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JxnRx6"&gt;“Creative people love those really, really hard problems. And so I think that’s really what distinguishes us from from so many other [startups in the space],” he says. “You have less competition when you solve the hardest problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fsKJdY"&gt;Sila also had to fight the natural tendency of silicon to expand and break down when used in a battery, because the reason it can store more lithium ions is that they actually briefly bond with the silicon — meaning the ions sort of have to be ripped out of the anode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHJHSy"&gt;All of this is why Berdichevsky is so visibly happy to finally get his company’s battery science into the first consumer device when we talk via videoconference. It’s both a proof of the concept &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;of the myriad benefits that come with a more efficient battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrlXFU"&gt;Berdichevsky says he originally envisioned the first place Sila’s tech would appear would be in smartphones, since the batteries they use occupy so much space that could otherwise be allocated for flagship features like advanced camera systems. What he didn’t expect when founding Sila, though, was the boom in wearable tech, which opened up a lot of new doors. Whoop first started talking to Sila roughly two years ago, Berdichevsky says, and the company’s tech is coming to a few other consumer devices soon (though he declined to say what those would be). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYUzG5"&gt;“Having innovative technologies where size really matters is a really great place for a technology like ours,” Berdichevsky says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTz1VM"&gt;The biggest potential for Sila’s silicon anode could be with much larger batteries, like the ones that power electric vehicles. It could help automakers create smaller, more affordable EVs without sacrificing range, or get even more miles out of the big battery packs found in larger cars. And as long as the company has in fact found a way to make sure the silicon powder it’s creating can withstand being constantly charged and discharged, it’s possible that Sila-powered EVs could fill up faster than modern ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I9rAGQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sila’s capacity will be limited until it builds a new factory later this decade&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zMAGNs"&gt;At the consumer device level, Berdichevsky says that Sila doesn’t necessarily offer companies like Whoop a shot at cost savings, since right now the production of its silicon powder is so limited. Sila would have to make far more of its material if it were to provide enough to help power fleets of EVs, but the benefit of scaling up to that level is that the relative cost of production would go down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gu7ZTc"&gt;None of that will happen until at least mid-decade, though. Berdichevsky says his company is planning to build a much larger production facility, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/sila-nanotechnologies-raises-590m-to-fund-battery-materials-factory/"&gt;using the $590 million it raised in January&lt;/a&gt;. Until then, Berdichevsky says the company will have “very limited capacity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ho2gCS"&gt;By the time that new facility is up and running, Sila is destined to have some company. Tesla CEO (and Berdichevsky’s former boss) Elon Musk said late last year that Tesla is working to increase the level of silicon in the anode of the batteries it uses. Other companies are working to swap graphite for silicon, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVUYdv"&gt;But Berdichevsky says he thinks there’s plenty of space for Sila to keep growing — not only because of the performance gains, but also because of how Sila’s business is currently structured. “We help [battery companies] deliver a higher performing battery that we do charge a premium for, and then we split that premium with them,” he says. “At the end of the day, if you’re making a better product, and customers just want to buy it, then there’s plenty to go around.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coinbase says SEC threatened lawsuit over Lend feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Na1dk2p7WjRbXvf-yIjf9wv01Qc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831310/acastro_170726_1777_0007_v5.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uFYqWA"&gt;Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase seems to have some issues with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over a planned feature that lets people lend cryptocurrency through its platform. &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009"&gt;In a Medium post&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, Coinbase’s chief legal officer wrote that the regulatory agency threatened to sue the company if it launched the feature. Coinbase’s CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1435439291715358721?s=20"&gt;posted a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday evening saying that the SEC wasn’t clear about what it wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSmRbh"&gt;According to Coinbase’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, the company told the SEC about its new Lend feature as a courtesy but didn’t anticipate pushback, based on his impression that similar features exist on other platforms. However, according to Armstrong, the SEC informed the company that the lend feature would be considered a &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp"&gt;security&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it would be regulated as an investment. Coinbase disputes that classification, but they weren’t able to make their case in the same informal channels. Instead, according to Armstrong and the company, the SEC opened an investigation into Coinbase, asking for employee testimony and &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009"&gt;the names and contact information&lt;/a&gt; of people who had signed up for the Lend waitlist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;
&lt;div id="lFgz34"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;5/ They responded by telling us this lend feature is a security. Ok - seems strange, how can lending be a security? So we ask the SEC to help us understand and share their view. We always make an effort to work proactively with regulators, and keep an open mind.&lt;/p&gt;— Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1435439543692365828?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="86NDM3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;7/ Look….we're committed to following the law. Sometimes the law is unclear. So if the SEC wants to publish guidance, we are also happy to follow that (it's nice if you actually enforce it evenly across the industry equally btw).&lt;/p&gt;— Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1435439676429537281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xUQm2F"&gt;Armstrong says that Coinbase is looking for clearer information from the SEC and a written explanation of how it's judging Lend to be a security. According to the Medium post, the SEC told Coinbase that it had assessed Lend against two benchmark securities cases tried in the Supreme Court: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_v._W._J._Howey_Co."&gt;&lt;em&gt;SEC v. W. J. Howey Co.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/casebrief/p/casebrief-reves-v-ernst-young#"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reves v. Ernst &amp;amp; Young&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The former set the standard that investments would be considered securities if there’s “a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others,” &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp"&gt;according to Investopedia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ru4eMf"&gt;Coinbase’s upcoming Lend feature, according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coinbase.com%2Flend&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F8%2F22662826%2Fcoinbase-sec-lend-regulation-crypto-lawsuit-exchange" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/sign-up-to-earn-4-apy-on-usd-coin-with-coinbase-cdad79e5f5eb"&gt;a Medium post&lt;/a&gt;, is meant to let people lend out their cryptocurrency and earn interest doing so. Coinbase says that the loans would go to “verified borrowers” and that the company would guarantee the initial value (so if you lent $100 through the program, Coinbase promises you’d get $100 back). It also says you can expect a return of 4 percent APY. &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009"&gt;The company says&lt;/a&gt; that, in light of its SEC troubles, it won’t launch Lend “until at least October.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVPga4"&gt;A spokesperson for the SEC told &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;that the agency “does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sarthakgh/status/1435624549576499207?s=20"&gt;Many have&lt;/a&gt; seen a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SEC_Investor_Ed/status/1435606347807006728"&gt;recent tweet&lt;/a&gt; from the SEC’s Investor Education Twitter account as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chiaseedpuddin/status/1435633054488219651?s=20"&gt;trolling Coinbase&lt;/a&gt;, though: it contains a video explaining the concept of bonds, financial instruments that allow you to give a loan to a company or government, in return for interest payments. The tweet was posted Wednesday morning, after Armstrong’s Tuesday-night thread. However, the account regularly posts &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SEC_Investor_Ed/status/1433440325222154249?s=20"&gt;similar videos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SEC_Investor_Ed/status/1435623989129383944"&gt;tips&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s possible the timing is coincidental. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yjrGwG"&gt;The SEC’s tiff with Coinbase may be indicative of its move toward regulating crypto more heavily. The current chairman &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin"&gt;has said that Stablecoins&lt;/a&gt;, or cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to something else like the US dollar, may fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction. That could be relevant to Coinbase’s woes — the Lend feature that started all this was set to launch using USDC, a Stablecoin. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How a GameStonk YouTuber is shaking up the California recall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qQ8Jy52hudcA8QVHHoVhcOkRat0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831303/acastro_210831_kevinPaffrath_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Kevin Paffrath wants to be the candidate for the /r/wallstreetbets voter&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Th4KFr"&gt;Walking up to a podium in San Francisco this summer, Kevin Paffrath grabs the microphone. “Hodl that AMC,” he says with a smile, gazing out at the few dozen or so people, predominantly young men, attending the rally, a reference to the “meme stock” moment from earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwZckP"&gt;Paffrath, better known as MeetKevin on YouTube, is running to unseat Gov. Gavin Newsom in California’s recall election this month. It’s rare that a gubernatorial candidate would lead off a speech with such a painfully online reference, but that’s part of Paffrath’s appeal. He’s branded himself as the candidate for the r/wallstreetbets crowd — and so far, it’s working. As of publication, he’s the top polling Democrat at &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/california-recall-polls/"&gt;8 percent&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9AddDu"&gt;Since 2017, Paffrath has made YouTube videos full-time from his home in Ventura, streaming his takes on the financial and cryptocurrency markets to an audience of over 1 million subscribers. He’s also the only Democrat &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/24/trailer-bring-troops-home-why-afghanistan-crisis-isnt-reviving-gop-hawks/"&gt;spending big&lt;/a&gt; to win the election, and it’s made him the most viable candidate outside of Republicans like Larry Elder, a popular conservative talk radio host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ld6Y8V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s rare that a gubernatorial candidate would lead off a speech with such a painfully online reference&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gD7ysQ"&gt;Paffrath has no choice but to run as an outsider. He’s not a prominent figure in the Democratic Party or a well-seasoned politician. He’s a 29-year-old man in a suit, a real-estate guy, and a poster fluent in crypto-speak. Paffrath sees his outsider status as an advantage rather than a drawback, in the same vein as entrepreneurs like Donald Trump and Andrew Yang who turned their massive media followings into powerful political movements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtGLyT"&gt;The chaos of California’s recall system can reward that kind of outsider bid. Newsom remains deeply unpopular (although his polling has improved in recent weeks). If he loses the up or down vote, the actual gubernatorial vote will be split among a dozen different candidates, with only a plurality needed to win. In 2003, that same chaos saw Gary Coleman and Arianna Huffington throwing their hats in the ring — and Arnold Schwarzenegger becoming governor. In 2021, California has seen a more representative crop: a conservative radio host, a reality television star, and a social media influencer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z891xs"&gt;If Paffrath wins on September 14th, he says he wants to “bring YouTube to government,” he told me over the phone last Tuesday. “YouTube could be a transparency tool as much as it could be a transparency weapon,” he said. “To make sure Californians know what’s standing in the way of the legislature getting things done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wemmvm"&gt;Streaming in front of a colorfully backlit set, Paffrath earns more than “several million dollars a year in ad revenue alone” on YouTube, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-social-media-stars-who-move-markets-11630056601"&gt;a recent &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. His video thumbnails often show him donning shocked faces, and his titles use emotional or humorous phrasing like “the fed JUST froze over” or “Stock Market YOLO.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JzVJNO"&gt;At the height of the meme stock movement in February, Paffrath gained over 150,000 subscribers, &lt;a href="https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/kevinpaffrath"&gt;according to SocialBlade&lt;/a&gt;. As that stock rush slowed, so did his growth. A few months later, he launched his gubernatorial campaign. But just as the Wall Street Bets posters sought to send GameStop “to the moon,” Paffrath is leveraging many of their same strategies to win his own moonshot campaign this month. Or maybe it’s just another growth hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="5M2ic8"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zavcpL"&gt;At that same July rally, Paffrath lamented the loss of businesses and celebrities who had recently moved out of California due to what he said to be rising real estate prices.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPpUP7"&gt;“Gavin says he doesn’t care if Tesla leaves. He doesn’t care if businesses leave,” Paffrath said, holding an iPad to read off his remarks. “Joe Rogan left. Elon Musk left. Coinbase left. Snowflake left. Palantir left. Hewlett Packard left.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCO25c"&gt;When his mic stopped working, Paffrath told the crowd, “I’m shorting Sennheiser” with a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="zrc08D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Joe Rogan left. Elon Musk left. Coinbase left.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3G73TR"&gt;It’s this list of people and businesses Paffrath sees as representing his vision of California’s future. “We got to start by thinking big,” he told me over the phone last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0Gy1h"&gt;By big, he explains that he wants to end homelessness in 60 days by tasking the National Guard “with compassionately serving” the homeless community and moving them into vacant buildings. By big, he says he wants to incorporate “financial education” into the school system and partner with businesses in exchange for workers in “high-demand” careers like computer programming and electrical engineering. He wants to fully legalize gambling to help invest in “Las Vegas Strip style entertainment,” projecting $5–10 billion in tax revenue for the state. At his first debate earlier this summer, Paffrath touted these ideas along with others, like &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/A-water-pipeline-to-the-Mississippi-River-16412788.php"&gt;building a giant pipeline&lt;/a&gt; to the Mississippi river to solve California’s drought problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Id3Vi9"&gt;It may seem far-fetched for someone like this to be gaining ground, but he’s using a set of tactics that have proven to be immensely powerful for building a devoted base online. On YouTube, Paffrath calls on his subscribers to send texts for him to help get out the vote. Three months ago, he launched an app, notably listed in the “finance” category on the App Store, including a big “donate” button for his campaign. If someone uploads five screenshots of pro-Kevin posts they’ve made to the app, they score points. At one point, the highest scorers could win a meeting with Paffrath &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newsom-challenger-offers-1-000-000-for-2-hour-governor-debate-301350382.html"&gt;on a private jet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ks0uNI"&gt;“YouTube is very, very incredible because we can make a video and go ‘Hey, I need help for the next 48 hours,’” he says. “There’s just thousands of volunteers willing to do whatever it is we need. It’s very flattering.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76Z1Bm"&gt;More recently, Paffrath filmed himself attending, or trying to attend, a Newsom rally. Earlier this week, Paffrath posted a video of himself being turned away from one. &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-recall-kevin-paffrath-newsom-warren"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;wrote up the incident. He tweeted it, along with other posts about being “BANNED,” scoring almost one thousand likes on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcJg5w"&gt;“This is the 3rd time Fox National has cover the abuse of the Democratic process,” Paffrath &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realMeetKevin/status/1434346877072277505?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “Censorship by Instagram (deleting my initial announcement, CNN saying there’s no Democrat running vs Newsom (while a then current poll showed me beating Elder, + this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXEn23"&gt;These outrage posts, giveaways, and gamification have helped boost Paffrath in the polls. He’s using tactics familiar to his finance audience online, but in a way that expands his influence outside of that insular community. It’s a growing tactic over the last few election cycles as influencers spanning the gamut of right-wing reactionary &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20689402/joey-salads-youtube-campaign-congress-trump-republican-political-bias"&gt;YouTube pranksters&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21067086/joshua-collins-joshua4congress-tiktok-discord-campaigning-bernie-sanders-aoc"&gt;socialist TikTok stars&lt;/a&gt; have decided to throw their hats into the electoral ring, finding plenty of hype and little success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JbF0Ih"&gt;“If a politician can speak to that constituency through skillful (and not cringey) use of insidery memes and language, it signals that they understand and are committed to all of that,” Lana Swartz, an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, told me last week. “It can be a very powerful message that transcends traditional partisan divides and eclipse other issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ElTHk5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It can be a very powerful message”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HuDefq"&gt;Next Tuesday is the last day for Californians to decide whether Newsom will remain as governor, and if not, who will replace him. This week, Arnold Schwarzenegger said that Newsom was in &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/arnold-schwarzenegger-newsom-is-in-a-dangerous-place-politically-2021-9"&gt;a “very dangerous” position&lt;/a&gt;, comparing the current recall climate to the one that ultimately launched the &lt;em&gt;Terminator&lt;/em&gt; star to the governor’s office back in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEVFaB"&gt;But for Paffrath, the model is less Arnold and more Elon. He talks about Musk constantly — when I asked him why, he said simply: “He’s brilliant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyhHjU"&gt;“You should see what Elon Musk said this morning,” he told me, pointing me to a video he retweeted earlier in the day of Musk in Berlin complaining about the state of politics. “He recognizes and is willing to say what’s wrong,”&lt;/p&gt;
