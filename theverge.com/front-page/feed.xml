    <title>Nothing company now owns the Essential brand, for some reason</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mwBx1i"&gt;Nothing, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22250653/nothing-brand-oneplus-carl-pei-announcement-consumer-technology-smart-devices"&gt;recently-launched startup&lt;/a&gt; from former OnePlus executive, Carl Pei, has acquired the Essential brand, according to a &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/15/essential-carl-pei-nothing-technologies/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; citing &lt;a href="https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003234098"&gt;filings at the UK Intellectual Property Office&lt;/a&gt;. Essential, of course, was the company started by Android creator Andy Rubin after he left Google. It launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16165040/essential-phone-review-android-andy-rubin"&gt;single smartphone&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134985/essential-phone-shutting-down-andy-rubin-startup"&gt;shuttering its doors&lt;/a&gt; due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/12/17004278/essential-phone-2017-sales-90k-units-sold-six-months-post-launch"&gt;poor sales performance&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing’s acquisition, which was completed on January 6th, 2021, ahead of Pei’s formal announcement of Nothing, apparently includes all of the trademarks, logo, and other branding of Essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAEZBC"&gt;It’s not clear what Pei’s new company plans to do with the Essential brand (or anything else for that matter; the information on what exactly Nothing’s product plans are is as scant as the company’s name itself), but as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes, there isn’t much aside from the brand left at Essential, since the company closed its doors last year. Essential had planned to release a follow up to the one smartphone it did bring to market, as well as launch an ambitious new smart home platform, but neither of those ever made it out of planning phases and were obviously scrapped.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9jvWFjQekW0Spop3_Vz3AWcexzc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9070829/vpavic_170815_1924_0035.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Essential Phone was the only product Essential brought to market before closing its doors in 2020.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dgEnw2"&gt;It’s also not clear &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; exactly Nothing would want to acquire the Essential brand, which can best be described as “tarnished” after a failed product launch and association with Rubin’s name. A 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;detailed allegations of sexual misconduct levied against Rubin during his time at Google and a massive $90 million buyout he received for leaving the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="peQk1K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google’s&lt;/em&gt; article says that Nothing will reveal more information about its forthcoming products in the near future, so perhaps we’ll learn more about what it plans to do with the Essential brand sooner rather than later. We’ve reached out to Nothing for comment on the matter and will update this article should the company respond.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Overcooked All You Can Eat is coming to more platforms, with expanded crossplay on the way</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GPfMkbFARFsl0VUM2RDYBe4bGSc=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68821402/50582485598_3a5a9ab18f_o.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Team17 (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2020/11/10/how-the-dualsense-wireless-controller-immerses-you-in-the-culinary-chaos-of-overcooked-all-you-can-eat/" target="_blank"&gt;via the PlayStation Blog&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TSa8Kt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overcooked All You Can Eat&lt;/em&gt;, which bundles all of the content from &lt;em&gt;Overcooked&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Overcooked 2 &lt;/em&gt;into one big package, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Overcookedgame"&gt;will be released&lt;/a&gt; on Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Steam on March 23rd, developer Ghost Town Games announced on Monday. Right now, the game is only available on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, so a lot more players will be able to jump into this combined bundle with the wider release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahNETK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overcooked All You Can Eat &lt;/em&gt;also serves as a remaster for the games, running at 60fps and a 4K resolution. The game also has faster loading times, which I personally am happy to hear about. Levels in the Switch version of &lt;em&gt;Overcooked 2&lt;/em&gt; sometimes loaded frustratingly slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="suTQ2S"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; HOT NEWS JUST IN &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overcooked! All You Can Eat comes to Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One &amp;amp; Steam March 23rd!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both original games &amp;amp; new content&lt;br&gt;New kitchens &amp;amp; chefs&lt;br&gt;New accessibility options &amp;amp; assist mode&lt;br&gt;Online multiplayer for ALL kitchens&lt;br&gt;Cross-play coming soon&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE SCANDAL!  &lt;a href="https://t.co/ndh8cGwWVz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ndh8cGwWVz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Overcooked   (@Overcookedgame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Overcookedgame/status/1361314435273547776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oinIl7"&gt;Ghost Town Games also announced that &lt;em&gt;Overcooked All You Can Eat&lt;/em&gt; will be getting support for crossplay multiplayer on all platforms in an update coming “soon.” The game already supported &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/20/21331231/overcooked-all-you-can-eat-xbox-series-x-ps5"&gt;crossplay on PS5 and Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s great to see that it will be expanded to all platforms. &lt;em&gt;Overcooked&lt;/em&gt; is a fantastic multiplayer game, and being able to play with friends no matter what platform they’re on will make it that much easier to experience some cooking mayhem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGRUtC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overcooked All You Can Eat&lt;/em&gt; also has some assist mode options and new accessibility features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JoiK64"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parler is back online after a month of downtime</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Parler" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AeYclZRfXJchCHXOKzXGg4qDDk8=/0x3:5300x3536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68820866/1297682530.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1Y4kKA"&gt;The alternative social network Parler has reopened after a month offline. The company announced in a press release that the site is now accessible for users with existing accounts and will accept new signups starting next week. It’s also announced a new interim CEO: Mark Meckler, who previously cofounded the right-wing group Tea Party Patriots. The relaunch comes after Apple, Google, and Amazon suspended service in the wake of January’s attack on the US Capitol, citing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;violent threats on the platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVZkbU"&gt;Old Parler user accounts have been restored, but old “parleys” — the site’s term for posts — don’t appear to have carried over. Some high-profile users, like Fox News host Sean Hannity, have begun posting on the new site already. The timelines for other major accounts, like fellow host Tucker Carlson or Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), remain empty. Many posts were previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224689/parler-posts-gps-data-archived-independent-researchers-amazon-apple-google-capitol"&gt;archived by an outside researcher&lt;/a&gt; who scraped them before its takedown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ukacpx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Parler’s lawsuit against Amazon remains ongoing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dKjNeB"&gt;Parler describes itself as politically unaffiliated, but the loosely moderated site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;became popular with conservative users&lt;/a&gt; who were either banned from larger sites or disagreed with the fact-checking and moderation policies of platforms like Twitter and Facebook. After the election, it became a hub for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552752/facebook-stopthesteal-ban-twitter-parler-discord-trump"&gt;pro-Trump “Stop the Steal” campaign&lt;/a&gt;, which escalated into a deadly attempt to overturn the US election on January 6th. The site went offline on January 10th, when its old host Amazon Web Services suspended its account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMTHka"&gt;The platform has now relaunched with what a press release calls “robust, sustainable, independent technology.” Parler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22236178/parler-resurfaces-sunday-app-banned"&gt;transferred its domain registration&lt;/a&gt; in January to Epik, a registrar known for &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/08/965448572/meet-the-man-behind-epik-the-tech-firm-keeping-far-right-websites-alive"&gt;providing a haven&lt;/a&gt; to “deplatformed” far-right-friendly sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zgDCqW"&gt;However, Parler remains in an uncertain position. Apple and Google haven’t restored its app to their stores, and it’s still fighting an &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/29095511/parler-llc-v-amazon-web-services-inc/"&gt;ongoing lawsuit against Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, where a judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22231457/parler-amazon-web-services-lawsuit-judge-preliminary-injunction-denied"&gt;appeared unsympathetic to its claims.&lt;/a&gt; Its previous CEO John Matze &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/ctech-us-parler-ceo-idCAKBN2A33B0-OCATC"&gt;said he was fired&lt;/a&gt; in early February, and the company is now “conducting a thorough search for a permanent CEO” who will replace Meckler. It’s also under scrutiny in Congress — where House Oversight Committee chair &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272562/parler-carolyn-maloney-fbi-financing-mercers-trump"&gt;Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) has requested documents&lt;/a&gt; on Parler’s financing and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jaguar will be an all-electric car brand from 2025</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DuTEHCrYB7okSS0xvvVr6Z_P_8s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68820591/jaguar_i_pace_ev_electric_0094.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o7XDdM"&gt;UK automaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) says its Jaguar luxury brand will be &lt;a href="https://www.jaguarlandrover.com/reimagine"&gt;all-electric by 2025&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, its Land Rover brand will release its first all-electric vehicle in 2024, the first of six fully electric models planned for release over the next five years. JLR’s transition will be funded by a £2.5 billion (around $3.5 billion) a year investment into electrification and related technologies, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-15/jaguar-going-all-electric-marks-new-ceo-s-turnaround-plan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHwCRH"&gt;JLR’s plans are ambitious, but the automaker has previously been slow to embrace electrification. It’s only fully electric car to date is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2018/3/30/17172678/jaguar-i-pace-drive-suv-new-york-auto-show"&gt;Jaguar I-Pace SUV&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes has struggled to make inroads against more established electric carmakers. Even then, the car is built by a contractor, rather than being produced by JLR in-house. The company had to pay a £35 million (around $48.7 million) fine in the EU for missing emissions targets last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="31lMx1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thierry Bolloré, CEO, launches new Reimagine strategy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See us reimagine the future of modern luxury. Over the next five years, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LandRover?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@LandRover&lt;/a&gt; will welcome six all-electric variants and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jaguar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Jaguar&lt;/a&gt; will undergo a renaissance as a pure electric luxury brand.&lt;a href="https://t.co/EcJzaiSk9Y"&gt;https://t.co/EcJzaiSk9Y&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Lp1DdKeuBB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Lp1DdKeuBB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jaguar Land Rover (@JLR_News) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JLR_News/status/1361259873950965764?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b6S3H6"&gt;The advantage JLR has is that Jaguar is still a premium car brand, allowing it to charge the high prices necessary to cover the cost of modern batteries. It also plans to share more technology with parent company Tata Motors to reduce development costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7aHGJ"&gt;If all goes to plan, JLR expects all Jaguars and 60 percent of Land Rovers sold to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2030, the year its home market the UK will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21572312/uk-ban-combustion-engine-vehicles-sale-electric-cars"&gt;ban the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. JLR hopes to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2039. Bans of internal combustion engine vehicles have been announced with a variety of targets around the world, such as in Norway by 2025, France by 2040, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;California by 2035&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new two-factor authentication prompt now has dark mode on Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GpMYszpAqouDdghspGVUVsRFaqA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68820538/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0ItVXI"&gt;Google is rolling out a new update for its two-factor authentication prompt on Android, which adds support for dark mode (along with a new Material Design-style look), &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/11/google-prompt-dark-theme/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7HLdQ"&gt;Is this objectively a minor cosmetic update in the great scheme of things? Yes. Is it nice to not be blasted with retina-searing white light when your two-factor authentication prompt comes up while you’re trying to log into something in pitch-black darkness? Also yes. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The old (left) and new (right) two-factor authentication prompts on Android&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N47OKL"&gt;In addition to the less blinding hue, the new update also features a couple of other minor cosmetic changes, including Google’s custom Google Sans font for the UI, and colorful red and green icons on the log-in buttons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9E7LDO"&gt;The new update appears to be rolling out slowly for Android owners — &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports that its available on personal Google accounts, but not for those with Google Workspace accounts. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A New Frontier for a year at home&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="nfc2Pr"&gt;In a Sundance Film Festival &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22262520/sundance-film-festival-2021-pandemic-these-days-pink-cloud"&gt;defined by the coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, the New Frontier section — devoted to experimental projects like virtual reality films and interactive performance art — was also radically reimagined. The section is often one of Sundance’s most intensely physical experiences; in 2020, it included a series of VR films viewed while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21125284/sundance-best-vr-ar-film-festival-new-frontier-2020"&gt;floating in a swimming pool&lt;/a&gt;. In 2021, during an entirely remote festival, it pushed for something different: making our own homes feel otherworldly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29vwJs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://fpg.festival.sundance.org/film/ntf/catalog"&gt;Pared down to 14 projects&lt;/a&gt;, this year’s New Frontier focused on web art and social media alongside virtual and augmented reality experiences. The result was a show that felt intimate and intriguing — and set a model for showcasing interactive art online.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lC860C"&gt;&lt;a href="https://fpg.festival.sundance.org/new-frontier-info/5fd1a55f04818b094f6494d0"&gt;Beyond the Breakdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OhiCnB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Created by Tony Patrick, Lauren Lee McCarthy, and Grace Lee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MnRVkW"&gt;It’s tough to make a Zoom call feel profound, but &lt;em&gt;Beyond the Breakdown&lt;/em&gt; comes close. Like &lt;em&gt;Tinker&lt;/em&gt;, the experience involves only a few people, all of whom dial into a web-based video chat. The chat is moderated by a Siri-like voice bot (controlled largely by a human operator), and it’s devoted to answering a simple question: what should Earth look like in 2050?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sl3ftG"&gt;My session of &lt;em&gt;Beyond the Breakdown&lt;/em&gt; felt like an attempt to figure out the philosophical underpinnings of a better world, rather than predict the most plausible future or imagine the specifics of a utopia. That probably depends in part on the participants, but it’s helped by gentle prodding from the “AI”, which asks open-ended questions and chimes in with an occasional request to delve deeper. The whole experience benefits from its film festival context — while it might take place on the same screen as all your normal work meetings, it’s got an unusual sense of playfulness and optimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Rich Kids: A History of Shopping Malls in Tehran Still" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0aJeoLFrhm5HbRAgQN4TPCFAKoU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22304946/50642699891_95cd68f0ae_k_d.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PBcgTR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://fpg.festival.sundance.org/new-frontier-info/5fd1897b63d677798fc3a7f1"&gt;Rich Kids: A History of Shopping Malls in Tehran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8Acuko"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Created and performed by Kirsty Housley and Javaad Alipoor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Rd17O6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shopping Malls in Tehran&lt;/em&gt; is a tragic love story about the rich kids of Instagram — or more specifically, the rich kids of Tehran, a group of wealthy teens and twentysomethings shopping and partying under the shadow of social instability in Iran. Like a social media feed, it plays out in reverse: from two lovers’ fatal car crash just before dawn, through late-night drives and fights with disappointed parents and a surreal trip into the desert, all told through a combination of live narration and posts on a fictitious Instagram account. Slowly, the story expands from the doomed couple to a history of Iranian politics, the global oil industry, and the eponymous Tehran shopping malls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MtPmQS"&gt;The piece was originally intended as an in-person performance, but the pandemic pushed it fully online, with Housely and Alipoor narrating the show alternately on a YouTube channel and in live Instagram broadcasts. The result perfectly channels the distraction of online social interaction — as audiences juggle their phones and laptop browser tabs to keep up with the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tinker Still" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a-UtKbShHRf9qCMG21hjdLUGlqU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22304944/50642742376_4cfb875ac4_k_d.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W9MvUR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://fpg.festival.sundance.org/new-frontier-info/5fd1a66947af89d68fb3175a"&gt;Tinker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Yz2fSF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Directed by Lou Ward&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4sk2Mj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tinker&lt;/em&gt; puts a twist on immersive VR theater, a genre where live actors play characters in virtual reality experiences, like &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/the-under-presents-impressions/"&gt;Tender Claws’ &lt;em&gt;The Under Presents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Oculus Quest project is about an affable inventor in a cozy late-’90s house. A handful of audience members join the scene. Most are invisible spectators, but one plays the man’s grandchild — who can take Polaroids, assemble toys, draw on walls with crayons, and talk to their grandfather over two decades’ worth of vignettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tv2cCX"&gt;If you’re the participant, the “acting” is pretty simple; you’re not literally pretending to be a toddler or a teenager. But it blends the feeling of having a personal conversation about your family with the understanding that you’re playing to an audience and want to make your scene at least a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; entertaining. And the setting is a great sandbox of toys that encourage engaging with the environment and actor. It’s a worthwhile followup to projects like the &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/draw-me-close-childhood/"&gt;2017 Tribeca Film Festival experience &lt;em&gt;Draw Me Close&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://vrscout.com/news/sundance-scarecrow-vr-theater-with-live-actor/"&gt;2020 Sundance installation &lt;em&gt;Scarecrow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — with no physical contact but a more spontaneous feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="HOB3ox"&gt;&lt;a href="https://fpg.festival.sundance.org/new-frontier-info/5fd19cdc63d677735dc3a98f"&gt;To Miss the Ending&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wdJnF2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Created by Anna West and David Callanan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="v77H7Q"&gt;The physical world is dying. Machines have made human effort obsolete, and the only future is a virtual environment that approximates their old reality. The problem? None of the uploaded souls can agree on what reality was. While musing about their last days on Earth, they argue about whether a river is actually a road, whether an apartment’s stairs should lead to anything, and whether a tree belongs in the middle of a living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eN346a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;To Miss the Ending&lt;/em&gt; is a melancholy, unsettling VR experience. Animated in jittering neon voxels that reflect the stories being told in voiceover, it turns a familiar dystopian science fiction conceit into a series of personal and bittersweet reflections on living to see the end of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="4 Feet High VR Still" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IEj4o9Umm7Xvgw30nIOLNfBEZxw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22304958/50642047891_2d9d2bffbc_k_d.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h2 id="hnfcEa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://fpg.festival.sundance.org/new-frontier-info/5fd1a09663d67772e5c3aa4d"&gt;4 Feet High VR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WNgkMh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Created by María Belén Poncio, Rosario Perazolo Masjoan, Damian Turkieh, and Ezequiel Lenardón&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4HLxaz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;4 Feet High VR&lt;/em&gt; is the bigger, more ambitious followup to another &lt;a href="https://www.sundance.org/projects/4-feet-blind-date"&gt;Sundance project from 2018&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a series of short VR films about Juana, a teenager in Argentina who’s navigating sex and romance after showing up at a new school. Juana uses a wheelchair, and the film is shot so we’re level with her height. But its unique cinematography is just a small part of the appeal. It’s a sweetly funny coming-of-age story about being young, awkward, passionate, and relentlessly sure that you can change a hostile world by having fun. The film would still be compelling without VR, but its 360-degree video completely shuts out reality and pushes you into Juana’s world — something that, during a year without movie theaters, traditional film simply can’t do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s a first look at Microsoft’s xCloud for the web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DP1Wv8S_T0dNMcaasdlgmvV4D40=/0x6:2622x1754/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68819784/xcloudweb.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VxdYqx"&gt;Microsoft has started testing its xCloud game streaming through a web browser. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s Xbox plans tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that employees are now testing a web version of xCloud ahead of a public preview. The service allows Xbox players to access their games through a browser, and opens up xCloud to work on devices like iPhones and iPads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANaVsq"&gt;Much like how xCloud currently works on Android tablets and phones, the web version includes a simple launcher with recommendations for games, the ability to resume recently played titles, and access to all the cloud games available through Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Once you launch a game it will run fullscreen, and you’ll need a controller to play Xbox games streamed through the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vlYl-dLRsmIZ5_D9eZLjdPSAo0c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22304617/xcloudweb_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s xCloud service on the web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Hcxoj7"&gt;It’s not immediately clear what resolution Microsoft is streaming games at through this web version. The software maker is using Xbox One S server blades for its existing xCloud infrastructure, so full 4K streaming won’t be supported until the backend hardware is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295326/microsoft-project-xcloud-xbox-series-x-servers-hardware-2021"&gt;upgraded to Xbox Series X components this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="094V2I"&gt;Microsoft is planning to bundle this web version of xCloud into the PC version of the Xbox app on Windows 10, too. The web version appears to be currently limited to Chromium browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, much like Google’s Stadia service. Microsoft is planning some form of public preview of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165280/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-launch-spring-2021-announced"&gt;xCloud via the web in the spring&lt;/a&gt;, and this wider internal testing signals that the preview is getting very close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C5euQ1MaLWSkAHCY0qUy1Bo0n7k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22304618/xcloudweb_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starting an xCloud stream inside a browser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6pjVs_NNK9g2Qzji1Wad2jphNec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22304619/xcloudweb_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox games run fullscreen in a web browser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AfwZ3T"&gt;The big drive behind this web version is support for iOS and iPadOS hardware. Apple imposes limitations on iOS apps and cloud services, and Microsoft wasn’t able to support the iPhone and iPad when it launched xCloud in beta for Android last year. Apple said Microsoft would need to submit individual games for review, a process that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433071/microsoft-apple-app-store-rules-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-game-pass"&gt;Microsoft labeled a “bad experience for customers.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy F62 is coming to India with huge 7,000mAh battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4d9rW3fCZhK062zMykED1k3ef10=/0x0:9999x6666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68819662/FSeries_Shot3_Front_Blue.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy F62 will be available in blue, grey, and green.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="79hrjT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/in/samsung-launches-galaxy-f62-the-fullonspeedy-smartphone-with-flagship-exynos-9825-processor-64mp-quad-camera-and-7000mah-battery"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy F62&lt;/a&gt; is a new affordable handset that’s releasing in India on February 22nd. It features a massive 7,000mAh battery and the same Exynos 9825 processor that powered the Galaxy Note 10 back in 2019. It’s available in two variants: one with 6GB of RAM that costs ₹23,999 (around $330), and a second with 8GB of RAM that costs ₹25,999 (around $358).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="waWhSY"&gt;Around front you’ll find a 6.7-inch 1080p OLED display with a 32-megapixel selfie camera contained within a hole-punch notch, while on the back there’s a quad camera array. Here there’s a 64-megapixel main camera, a 12-megapixel ultrawide with a 123-degree field of view, a 5-megapixel macro camera, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. There’s a side-mounted fingerprint sensor on the phone which is available in green, grey, or blue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JRdjoIe1iGqJiehVAEq7dCFstbE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22304603/FSeries_Shot8_Back_black.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Around back there are four cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NXgyNZ"&gt;Internally, alongside the Exynos 9825 processor, the Galaxy F62 has 128GB of storage, which is expandable by up to 1TB. There’s space for two SIM cards, and the battery can be fast-charged at 25W using the charger that comes in the box. The phone is running Samsung’s OneUI 3.1 software out of the box, and there’s support for the NFC Samsung Pay service, as well as “Single Take,” Samsung’s camera software that automatically assembles a series of photos and videos simultaneously for you to select from after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWdSp0"&gt;From its specs, the Galaxy F62 sees Samsung’s past flagship features trickle down to an affordable handset, accompanied by a huge battery. Samsung says it’ll be available from a variety of retailers including its own online store, Flipkart, Reliance Digital, and My Jio. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nissan says it’s not in Apple car discussions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2018 nissan leaf" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B9CRTG2kR4apNpQ_S-7KLYBdTiM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68819313/DSCF5396.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DZgQam"&gt;Nissan has issued a statement denying that it’s in discussions to work with Apple on the US company’s long-rumored autonomous car project. Earlier today &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/29d4aa6b-fba5-4a53-876e-3f097fdef1d2"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Apple had approached the Japanese automaker about a potential partnership “in recent months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWQHhr"&gt;“We are not in talks with Apple,” a Nissan spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-tech-apple-nissan/update-2-nissan-says-not-in-talks-with-apple-over-autonomous-car-project-idUSL1N2KL01Y"&gt;tells Reuters&lt;/a&gt;. “However, Nissan is always open to exploring collaborations and partnerships to accelerate industry transformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2LzT1u"&gt;That statement doesn’t address whether the talks ever took place, which means it doesn’t directly contradict the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;’ story. That report said that “the contact was brief and the discussions did not advance to senior management levels following divisions over branding for the iPhone maker’s electric vehicles.” The breaking point was said to be Apple’s request that Nissan manufacture cars carrying Apple’s branding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6CK8Ol"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Hyundai and Kia downplay Apple car rumors","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/7/22271748/hyundai-apple-car-talks-stopped-report"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PQHSwK"&gt; “We have our own customer satisfaction, which comes by car. No way we are going to change the way we make cars,” Nissan COO Ashwani Gupta tells the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times, &lt;/em&gt;again stating that talks aren’t happening now without confirming if they ever did. “The way we design, the way we develop, and the way we manufacture is going to be as an automotive manufacturer, as Nissan.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6pnpc"&gt;The recent speculation over Nissan comes after Hyundai &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/7/22271748/hyundai-apple-car-talks-stopped-report"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it wasn’t in talks with Apple on the project. Hyundai has been the primary subject of rumors over the partnership of late, not least because the Korean carmaker itself issued and swiftly retracted a statement saying it had entered discussions with Apple. Analyst Ming-chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261893/apple-electric-car-hyundai-ming-chi-kuo-rumor-report"&gt;believes&lt;/a&gt; the first Apple car will be built on Hyundai’s E-GMP platform and ship in 2025 at the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The original hatchback Bolt EV is also getting a refresh&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="kqaXnk"&gt;The Chevy Bolt is undergoing a growth spurt. General Motors unveiled two new versions of the Bolt on Sunday: an updated Bolt EV hatchback with longer range and new high-tech features, and the brand new Bolt EUV — essentially a compact SUV — with more legroom room and less range than the Bolt EV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wg4NYp"&gt;Due out this summer, the refreshed Bolt EV will sell for $31,995 — or about $5,000 less than the current model year Bolt EV. The Bolt EUV (which stands for “electric utility vehicle”) will also be less expensive, costing $33,995. A limited-edition “Launch” version, with unique wheels, special badging, and an illuminated charge port, will be available for $43,495. The Bolt EV and EUV were expected to go into production at the end of 2020 but were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203020/refreshed-chevy-bolt-delay-coronavirus-covid-19"&gt;delayed until this year&lt;/a&gt; due to the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cXLimUhOVZMNlmAMNPL2BIt3hzY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22301957/2022_Chevrolet_BoltEV_008.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="chvoA4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/13/12899752/chevy-bolt-driving-impressions-review"&gt;First introduced in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, the Chevy Bolt was intended to be General Motors’ first stab at a mass-market, purely battery-electric vehicle with 200-plus miles of range and an affordable price tag. &lt;a href="https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/12/chevrolet-bolt-ev-sales-numbers-figures-results-third-quarter-2020-q3/"&gt;But sales have been anemic&lt;/a&gt; since the release of the Tesla Model 3 in 2018, which has come to dominate the EV market in the US and abroad. The Bolt’s compact hatchback size is not what most American car buyers are looking for these days. And a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;recent recall of 2017-2019 model year Bolts&lt;/a&gt; related to a flawed battery certainly hasn’t helped GM’s image problems with the EV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mfRxEk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GM hopes to lift the Bolt’s fortunes with these two new versions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J5XJ88"&gt;The automaker hopes to lift the Bolt’s fortunes with these two new versions, but that may be difficult given that the technology that powers the Bolt is quickly becoming obsolete. Both the Bolt EV and Bolt EUV will be built on GM’s BEV2 platform, which is distinct from the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439374/gm-unveils-ultium-drive-family-of-electric-motors"&gt;“Ultium” battery pack&lt;/a&gt; announced in early 2020. The recently unveiled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;Cadillac Lyriq&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;GMC Hummer EV&lt;/a&gt; will be the first vehicles to be built on this new architecture. GM has said that Ultium’s advanced battery chemistry will enable its future electric vehicles to travel further on a single charge and re-charge at a faster rate. But the automaker has no plans to move the Bolt over to the Ultium platform, according to Chevy’s lead engineer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kyLTWl"&gt;As a consolation for its approaching irrelevance, both versions of the Bolt will come with Super Cruise, the “hands-free” advanced driver assist system that previously has only been available in Cadillac vehicles. The Bolt EV and EUV are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226098/gm-chevy-bolt-electric-car-tease-super-cruise-release-date"&gt;the first non-Cadillac vehicles&lt;/a&gt; and first electric vehicles to have Super Cruise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEinKj"&gt;The price helps make up for the Bolt’s shortcomings. When it was first introduced five years ago, the automaker was still eligible for the federal government’s $7,500 tax credit, which effectively made the Bolt a $30,000 vehicle. But in 2019, GM sold its 200,000th EV in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166619/gm-ev-tax-credit-bolt-sales"&gt;triggering a phase out of the tax credit&lt;/a&gt;. No longer eligible for that incentive, GM decided to stick with the reduced price for these latest versions, which is encouraging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/INmZ2T4Mvc1iPZqoFMOmQsG7pLU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22301960/2022_Chevrolet_BoltEUV_013.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5D8TD4"&gt;GM claims that the Bolt EV’s 65 kWh battery pack will enable 259 miles of range on a single charge, while the slightly heavier Bolt EUV will have 250 miles of range — basically the same as the current year model. The original 2018 Bolt had 238 miles of range, but typically got less due to cold weather or other external factors. Neither vehicles’ range has yet been certified by US or European regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zyh3ru"&gt;Chevy is also including an active thermal management system that uses coolant to maintain the battery’s temperature. Late last year, General Motors was forced to recall over 68,000 Chevy Bolts manufactured between 2017-2019 after several battery fires were reported. Federal regulators are investigating and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22135764/chevy-bolt-batteries-catching-fire-class-action-lawsuit"&gt;a class action lawsuit was filed&lt;/a&gt; alleging that the Bolt’s battery is “prone to burst into flames.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8iB5GZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the new Bolts utilize a different battery chemistry that will help prevent fires&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c5Xpna"&gt;According to Jesse Ortega, chief engineer at Chevy, the new Bolts utilize a different battery chemistry that will help prevent future incidents, the same chemistry that allowed the automaker to increase the range from 238 miles to 250 miles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLziuU"&gt;Both versions of the Bolt come with a single-motor drive unit that can deliver 200 horsepower thanks to 150 kW of power, and 266 pound-feet (360 Newton meters) of torque. Like previous models, the new Bolts will have regenerative braking and a one-pedal driving mode that is fairly common among EVs today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTcvX1"&gt;The Bolt EUV and redesigned Bolt EV share an architecture, but their designs are unique. No exterior sheet metal parts are shared between the two vehicles, after some owners complained about lackluster sheet metal in previous versions. The EUV is approximately 6 inches longer and will have about 3 inches of extra rear legroom than the Bolt EV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bhUfINP2_xp2HzKFAQRL0ctkAYI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22301961/2022_Chevrolet_BoltEUV_014.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ow9pR"&gt;The grille has been tweaked, swapping the dual-tone look of the previous Bolt with a more monochromatic fascia. Chevy is keeping small ventilation panel rather than embrace the completely flat front-end of other EVs like the Tesla Model 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXMnJt"&gt;The Bolt’s interior has always been more practical than inspiring, with hard plastic abound. Now the Bolt EV and EUV’s interior has been redesigned to include more screens and sensors, mostly to help power Super Cruise’s promise of “hands-free” driving. Chevy has even ripped out the Bolt’s oft-criticized seats and replaced them with seats that feature a triangular geometric pattern and contrasting color stitching, which the automaker claims is a “premium design that gives a consistent and upscale atmosphere.” Not words you typically see used to describe a $30,000 vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VoUsIt"&gt;The main 10.2-inch infotainment screen is still embedded in the dashboard, but is integrated more seamlessly into the center console than the original Bolt’s design. The physical buttons are smoother and less chunky. And Chevy swapped out the gear shifter for a series of electronic buttons to free up more interior space. There’s also a new one-pedal driving button that keeps the system active between drive cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eaq64Nfasa3cxTWI0Rh3rAoaRWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22301962/2022_Chevrolet_BoltEUV_015.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0QJlTOkMrD0E9xSZYaYDzSxhIxo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22301963/2022_Chevrolet_BoltEUV_017.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NjrDdD"&gt;Other new additions include the light bar in the top of the steering wheel and the infrared sensor on the steering column. These are components of GM’s Super Cruise assisted driving system, which uses cameras, radar, and mapping data to allow users to drive hands-free on divided highways. Super Cruise is not a self-driving system, in that it still requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road and engaged enough to be able to take over at a moment’s notice. Notably, the Bolt EV and Bolt EUV will only come with the standard version of Super Cruise, not the enhanced version that includes automatic lane-changing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2x6TKA"&gt;EV charging in the US is a bit of a mess, and while Chevy can’t solve some of the more intractable problems, it is doing what it can to make charging a little less of a headache. A dual-level charge cord is included with the Bolt, which Chevy said will eliminate the need for many people to purchase a separate charger for their home. The changeable plug allows customers to plug into a standard 120-volt three-prong outlet for Level 1 charging and a 240-volt outlet for Level 2 charging up to 7.2 kilowatts. Both vehicles are also capable of 11 kW Level 2 charging, but separate charging equipment is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="s64GUY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bolt owners will get free installation of a Level 2 home charger&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eFsDaW"&gt;As an added perk, anyone who buys or leases a Bolt EUV or Bolt EV will get free installation of a Level 2 charger in their home through &lt;a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/ev.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/gm_green/2019/0812-gm-partners.html"&gt;GM’s partnership with Qmerit&lt;/a&gt;, a home charger installer. For charging on the go, GM is partnering with public charging station operator EVgo to include over 80,000 public chargers in the My Chevrolet app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3QBBC"&gt;But charging times will still be subject to the power levels of each individual charger. When plugged into a normal 120-volt system (ie, most home outlets), the Bolt EV and EUV will only get four miles of range for every hour of charging. Plugged into a 240-volt outlet will get the Bolt to a full charge in seven hours. And a DC fast charger will add up to 100 miles in 30 minutes for both vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zmcBX"&gt;Affordability has always been the Bolt’s strongest selling point, offering a decent size battery and adequate range for under $35,000. Chevy wanted to ensure the Bolt stayed affordable even as it added new features, like Super Cruise, or leveled up to crossover status, said Steve Majoros, vice president of Chevy marketing. Keeping the price low will help spur EV adoption from its current status of only 2 percent of US sales to upwards of 15-20 percent of the overall car market, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="4ypKqx"&gt;“ICE [internal combustion engine] vehicles will be around a long time,” Majoros said. “But the EV movement is real.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="akHLXU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
