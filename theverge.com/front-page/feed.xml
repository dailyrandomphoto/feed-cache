    <title>Razer Book 13 review: stop gaming, and get to work</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Business on the lid, party in the keyboard&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="EcpNYl"&gt;For years, Razer has made some of the best gaming laptops on the market. They’re not uniquely famous for their high performance (Blades are powerful machines but not the fastest out there) or their prices (which are high). They’re famous for their high-quality build and their premium design. In short, Razer makes the best-looking gaming laptops on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3lwJh"&gt;Razer has decided this year that this aesthetic shouldn’t be limited to gaming laptops. In its first notebook designed for productivity instead of gaming, Razer has combined its signature look and feel with a 60Hz 16:10 touchscreen and a lower-power processor with integrated graphics. The Razer Book aims to be a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade&lt;/a&gt; on the outside and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; on the inside — and it mostly succeeds. Razer has made an excellent laptop with performance rivaling that of the top Windows clamshells on the market. That said, it’s pricey for what it offers, and it has a few drawbacks that mean it won’t be the right choice for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Razer Book 13 keyboard seen from above. The keys display a green backlighting." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fe8-f1VUQmxBbLTr9bDvEZgu_z4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290553/akrales_210203_4381_0116.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are 16.8 million colors in this keyboard, according to Razer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="s63e6v"&gt;On the outside, the Razer Book 13 borrows many of the Blade Stealth 13’s signature features. Razer’s three-headed snake adorns the lid. You may also recognize the customizable per-key RGB keyboard with speaker grilles on each side. (Unlike what you’ll see on some more &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536996/msi-ge66-raider-dragonshield-edition-gaming-laptop-review-rtx-2070-super-300hz"&gt;garish gaming rigs&lt;/a&gt;, the lighting on these keys looks professional and adds to the sophisticated vibe.) The chassis is CNC-machined aluminum, with a smooth metallic finish. This is a fancy way of saying it’s quite nice; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; is made of the same material, as are many of the best Windows laptops including the XPS 13 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP’s Spectre x360 14&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="txtLcT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10347563"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QISdSb"&gt;But some subtle differences make clear that this laptop is for the office, not for gaming. It’s slightly lighter than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21340554/razer-blade-stealth-13-review-keyboard-specs-price-features"&gt;Blade Stealth&lt;/a&gt;, at 0.6 inches thick and 3.09 pounds. The port selection is also better than that of the Stealth: there are two Thunderbolt 4 ports, one USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, one HDMI 2.0, one microSD slot, and one combo audio jack. This is also a big advantage the Razer Book has over the XPS 13 and MacBook Pro, both of which have comparably limited selections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="320Zfr"&gt;The biggest change, though, is the 16:10 touch display. This makes the screen taller than the 16:9 panels you’ll find on the Blade (and on almost all dedicated gaming laptops). It lends you plenty of extra room for multitasking, with less scrolling and zooming necessary to see everything you need to. Aspect ratio aside, the 1920 x 1200 display on our review unit was quite bright, maxing out at 494 nits in my testing. It’s quite vibrant as well, with sharp and bright colors. While the panel has a glossy texture, it kicks back little to no glare in bright settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left edge of the Razer Book 13’s keyboard deck." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CQGnRfrYVKp-Zhr7MPVUVTDyx4Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290557/akrales_210203_4381_0142.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;USB-C, USB-A, headphone jack on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the right side of the keyboard deck of the Razer Book 13." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2zEtLPFL7yaY1oqVBA4CPecyuoE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290558/akrales_210203_4381_0154.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HDMI, USB-C, microSD on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UKABSF"&gt;Miscellaneous laptop stuff: the glass touchpad is roomy and quite smooth — definitely one of my recent favorites. The speakers sound great, with strong percussion, though I did hear some distortion at higher volumes. And I almost never get to say this, but the webcam isn’t that bad; it delivers a decent and fairly accurate picture, though there’s no privacy shutter or kill switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92for2"&gt;In a vacuum, I have very few complaints about the Razer Book’s chassis. I will point out that I find it slightly worse than the XPS 13 in a few (subjective) areas. Not only is it thicker and heavier than Dell’s flagship, but it just looks and feels clunkier, lacking the XPS’s sleek portability. And while Razer’s keyboard and touchpad are both fine, they’re not as exceptional as either on the XPS; Dell’s keyboard has more travel and a more satisfying click, and its touchpad is a bit more comfortable. Most frustratingly to me, Razer provides less storage for the price. You only get 256GB of storage in the base and midrange models and can only get 512GB in the top-end $1,999 configuration — 512GB XPS models come as low as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fnew-xps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fxn9310cto230h%3Fview%3Dconfigurations&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22287698%2Frazer-book-13-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,399&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fnew-xps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fxn9310cto230h%3Fview%3Dconfigurations%26configurationid%3D2c75050c-0f34-4b0a-9555-2e3dc8a34439&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22287698%2Frazer-book-13-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,599 XPS&lt;/a&gt; has 512GB of storage while the &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Book-13%2FRZ09-03571EM1-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,599 Razer Book&lt;/a&gt; has just 256GB (their specs are identical otherwise). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3drA6"&gt;There’s one area where the Razer Book solidly beats the XPS, and that’s performance. All Razer Book models are Evo-verified, meaning Intel vouches for them as top performers. And our test model includes a high-clocked (up to 28W) version of one of the chipmaker’s top ultrabook processors, Intel’s Core i7-1165G7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Razer Book 13 seen perpendicular from the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8EWthHs7TT66XAstkdKpge4M9RY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290560/akrales_210203_4381_0181.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evo is the 11th Gen version of Intel’s Project Athena program.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0a1GCk"&gt;This system flew through the demanding tasks we threw at it. It took nine minutes and 21 seconds to complete our Premiere Pro media test, which involves exporting a 5-minute, 33-second 4K video. That’s the fastest time I’ve ever gotten from a system with the quad-core 1165G7 (which powers many of the best ultraportables on the market). The XPS 13 took 10 minutes and 43 seconds to complete the same task; the more powerful &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; took 10 minutes and five seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orSIl5"&gt;Razer still hasn’t quite caught Apple’s M1 systems, though. The most recent MacBook Pro finished the test in seven minutes and 39 seconds. And of course, integrated graphics can’t hold a candle to a midrange GPU, even in a thin and light chassis. The Blade Stealth 13 with a GTX 1650 Ti knocked out the export in just five minutes and 50 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Razer Book 13 open. The screen displays the Razer logo on a green and black background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yat_hMv_Hvxrn5o4CNrZbyNj60U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290549/akrales_210203_4381_0015.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Book’s processor is powered up to 28W, with turbo boost speeds up to 4.7 GHz.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="P6zDeY"&gt;In real-world performance, the Razer Book also shines. The laptop handled my fairly demanding load of Chrome tabs, Zoom calls, and other apps with no issue. It boots up from standby almost instantly and very quickly from the powered-off state as well. Of course, the XPS 13 is also quite good in these scenarios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="girmav"&gt;While the Book 13 is decidedly not a gaming laptop, it is a Razer-branded product, so some might wonder how it games. The answer is it delivers some of the best integrated graphics performance I’ve seen from a Windows clamshell. It solidly beats the XPS 13 clamshell and is about on par with the more powerful 2-in-1. In practice, it’s most suitable for lighter gaming and heavier titles at lower settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id="uvptkf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10347621"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="TQy403"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It delivers some of the best integrated graphics performance I’ve seen from a Windows clamshell&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m7YpQr"&gt;The Razer Book averaged 142fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;’s maximum setting without dipping below 125; the XPS put up 111fps with a minimum of 100. Razer also wins on &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, averaging 219fps to the Dell’s 205fps. Of course, since both machines have a 60Hz screen, you won’t observe a difference in the quality of these games — but these numbers should give you a sense of the Razer Book’s power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMTffF"&gt;Graphic performance will make something of a difference on heavier titles. The Razer Book beat the XPS on the more demanding &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; at Ultra settings, averaging 65fps to the XPS’s 48fps. It also averaged 32fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at its lowest settings, where the XPS averaged 22fps. That’s significant because it means you could feasibly play &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; in 1080p on the Razer Book, which would be unpleasant to do on the XPS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Razer Book 13 seen from the back, open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QU9hD99paF-tukNgurBLGeqkxjk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290555/akrales_210203_4381_0130.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The color is called “mercury.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0FAgvv"&gt;That result also makes clear that — to reiterate — despite aesthetic similarity, this laptop is not a Blade. The Stealth 13 averaged 45fps on &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;’s highest settings. If you want to game with this form factor, buy the Blade. You’ll also get &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-Stealth-13%2FRZ09-03102E02-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;way more storage&lt;/a&gt; for the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="glaHb9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10347610"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w79oyR"&gt;When it comes to cooling, the Razer Book has chops. It did a significantly better job of keeping its CPU cool than the XPS did in my testing. During the Adobe export, the 1165G7 stayed comfortably in the mid-60s to mid-70s (Celsius) with occasional spikes as high as the low 90s. It largely remained in the high 50s during the &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; benchmark, with spikes up to the mid-70s. All in all, I didn’t see any throttling or slowdown, and the keyboard never got uncomfortably hot under load. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2DFpNp"&gt;But you’re making a trade-off for all this power: battery life. It’s not terrible, but it’s nothing to write home about. I got an average of six hours and 45 minutes while using the Book 13 for standard office work with occasional Zoom calls and streaming at 200 nits of brightness. (This was in the Battery Saver profile, which you can toggle in Razer’s Synapse software.) That means I can’t go a full day without charging, though your mileage will vary based on your tasks and settings. I’ve gotten over nine hours putting plenty of machines through that same workload, including the XPS 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOQMdw"&gt;The Razer Book 13 has a lot of things going for it, especially for Razer fans. It’s certainly one of the best ultraportable laptops you can buy — but whether it’s &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;best is a complicated question to answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f4GAOZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10347607"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wwm23S"&gt;In some areas (keyboard, touchpad, portability), the Razer Book is slightly worse than the XPS 13. In others (display quality and build quality) it’s about on par. And it brings a few nifty features (the port selection and the RGB keyboard) that Dell’s clamshell doesn’t have — but I doubt those are making or breaking the purchasing decision for most people. On net, I think Razer comes out slightly worse on the chassis front. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXJkoh"&gt;But that’s not where the Razer Book makes its case. That category is performance. Compared to other Windows clamshells I’ve tested in the past year, the Razer Book is top of the class. It stands out in productivity and media work as well as gaming. On the other hand, you’re making some sacrifices for that power, in addition to the hefty price tag it carries. You can get a few hours more battery life from a number of laptops in the Razer Book’s class (including the XPS 13) and significantly more storage as well. For folks in the Book’s intended audience (users looking for a portable work or entertainment driver) those trade-offs are probably worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ntrRMj"&gt;Ultimately, the Razer Book 13 is an impressive new laptop from Razer with a lot to like, and I’m sure many customers will be happy with it. But those trade-offs mean I can’t quite call it the best product for most people.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Spinning’ is trademarked, and Peloton isn’t happy about it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7lPZORmtwdltbnE0aw261CfGn9w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68835578/akrales_170407_1569_0200.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jx4gUe"&gt;Peloton is fighting to have the terms “spin” and “spinning” treated as generic terms, arguing that they’ve entered into common usage in spite of being trademarked since the late 90s, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/peloton-dominates-home-spinning-but-rival-won-t-let-it-say-so?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. This week it &lt;a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92076463&amp;amp;pty=CAN&amp;amp;eno=1"&gt;filed petitions&lt;/a&gt; with the US Patent and Trademark Office’s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to try and cancel both trademarks owned by Mad Dogg Athletics, arguing that “spin class and spin bike are part of the fitness lexicon” and that they’re “generic terms to describe a type of exercise bike and associated in-studio class.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rixrua"&gt;Mad Dogg had earlier filed a lawsuit against Peloton, alleging that its products infringe upon its exercise bike patents. While the lawsuit doesn’t make claims on trademarks, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; characterizes Peloton’s attempt to cancel Mad Dogg’s trademarks as a “retaliatory effort.” Mad Dogg has challenged Peloton’s use of the term “spin” in the past, and last year asked it to remove a video from its YouTube channel that referenced the phrase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eaUljR"&gt;There are numerous examples of product names that started out as trademarks, but which eventually entered common usage as product categories and lost their legal protections. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that “escalator” and “murphy bed” are two high profile examples of so-called “genericide.” But understandably, companies with trademarks are keen to hold on to the exclusive right to use and profit off them, and often go to great lengths to avoid terms like “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/smarter-living/how-a-brand-name-becomes-generic.html"&gt;Band-Aid&lt;/a&gt;” or “&lt;a href="https://www.worldipreview.com/article/xerox-avoiding-a-genericide-headache"&gt;Xerox&lt;/a&gt;” from becoming generic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1kUiM3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mad Dogg says the terms “should be treated with the care and respect” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jKFZJd"&gt;Mad Dogg Athletics devotes a &lt;a href="https://spinning.eu/legal-trademark/"&gt;page on its website&lt;/a&gt; to how the terms should be used. “These marks are brand names that serve to identify the unique fitness products and programs offered by Mad Dogg Athletics, Inc,” the company says, noting that they’re “important business assets” that should be treated with “care and respect.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CVS6OG"&gt;Mad Dogg’s website argues that consumers would be harmed alongside the company if the terms became generic. “Loss of a trademark,” it says, “denies consumers the opportunity to identify an original, quality product developed with years of experience for repeat satisfactory purchases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oJoyk"&gt;Peleton, unsurprisingly, disagrees. In its filing it says Mad Dogg “has spent years engaged in a bullying campaign of demand letters and litigation to force people and companies to stop using the very terms they have every right to use.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJR3P9"&gt;“Enough is enough. It is time to put a stop to Mad Dogg’s tactic of profiting by threatening competitors, marketplaces and even journalists with enforcement of generic trademarks,” Peloton’s filing argues.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will add a new label to some climate change posts in the UK</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook is expanding its “Climate Science Information Center.” | Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q7LmGN"&gt;Facebook will start labeling posts about climate change with a banner that directs people to its information page on climate change. It’s the company’s latest effort to weed out lies and myths about the climate crisis, and it follows criticism from lawmakers and scientists concerned that the social media giant allowed false information to proliferate on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHrY84"&gt;For now, the labels will only appear on Facebook posts in the UK. But the company plans to start rolling them out elsewhere “soon,” it said in an announcement on Thursday. Facebook debuted its “Climate Science Information Center” in the US, Germany, the UK, and France back in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437208/facebook-climate-change-misinformation-greenhouse-gas-pledge"&gt;September&lt;/a&gt;. Now, Facebook is also expanding that page to include new information debunking common myths about climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zIlUB"&gt;The company’s strategy for tackling climate misinformation is similar to what it’s done about COVID-19. Facebook started putting vetted information about the novel coronavirus at the top of its news feed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21185538/facebook-coronavirus-news-feed-information-center-covid-19"&gt;last March&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCMxeP"&gt;Facebook came under a lot of pressure last year to do a better job at fact-checking posts about climate change and stop misleading content from spreading. The new labels seem to be one way to answer calls for Facebook to take more action, although it doesn’t address original concerns that legislators like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) had about Facebook last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="shFgy5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There should be no company too big, too powerful, and too opaque to be held accountable.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8Xf6XZ"&gt;The whole saga started in August 2019 after Facebook reversed a decision by its fact-checkers to rate an op-ed as “false” for including inaccurate information and cherry-picked data on climate change. &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063436369"&gt;&lt;em&gt;E&amp;amp;E News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; consequently reported that Facebook had created a sort of loophole that exempted opinion articles from fact checking. That’s been a part of its policy the entire time, spokespeople for Facebook have told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/climate/climate-facebook-fact-checking.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdixOp"&gt;“The future of our planet is at stake, and there should be no company too big, too powerful, and too opaque to be held accountable for its role in the climate crisis. Facebook is no exception,” Warren and other senators said in a statement last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cm0sAz"&gt;Warren and others &lt;a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/warren-carper-whitehouse-schatz-call-on-mark-zuckerberg-and-facebook-to-stop-the-deliberate-spread-of-climate-disinformation-on-the-companys-social-media-platforms"&gt;demanded&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook answer questions about its fact-checking policies. In a letter from Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368136/facebook-climate-change-fact-check-senators-warren"&gt;shared exclusively with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;, the company maintained that “clear opinion content” wasn’t typically subject to fact-checking on their platform. It also said that &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;speech from politicians” was not eligible to be fact-checked in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5OEJJ"&gt;Facebook hasn’t specified how it will decide which posts should carry the new “informational labels” launching in the UK today. “We’re continuing to learn from other informational labels that we’ve applied to COVID-19 posts and posts during the US election,” a Facebook spokesperson&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;said in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGwPuc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mW9u1P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>White House now says 100 companies hit by SolarWinds hack, but more may be impacted</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fgkd16Gy_uEppfX1wBTYzXJEZ9w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68835358/acastro_170621_1777_0006_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cC4u7v"&gt;The US government has released updated figures on the number of companies and federal agencies it believes were impacted by the recent SolarWinds hack. “As of today, 9 federal agencies and about 100 private sector companies were compromised,” Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/02/17/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-and-deputy-national-security-advisor-for-cyber-and-emerging-technology-anne-neuberger-february-17-2021/"&gt;said in a briefing&lt;/a&gt;, though she declined to name specific organizations. Although the hack was “likely of Russian origin,” Neuberger said the hackers launched their attack from inside the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgsB19"&gt;The latest figures revealed are lower than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210667/solarwinds-hack-worse-government-microsoft-cybersecurity"&gt;250 federal agencies and businesses&lt;/a&gt; that were previously reported to have been infected, though Neuberger cautioned that the investigation is still in its “beginning stages” and that “additional compromises” may be found. In particular, the technology companies compromised gives hackers potential footholds for future attacks. Up to 18,000 SolarWinds customers are thought to have originally received the malicious code, though hackers did not attempt to gain additional access to all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QQsF8Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“As of today, 9 federal agencies and about 100 private sector companies were compromised”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v542Z4"&gt;The hack originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188060/microsoft-president-solarwinds-orion-hack-breach-brad-smith"&gt;came to light late last year&lt;/a&gt;, when it emerged that hackers had compromised SolarWinds’ monitoring and management software, which is used by multiple government agencies and Fortune 500 companies, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/solarwinds-hacks-perpetrated-from-inside-u-s-white-house-says?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;. Companies including Intel, Nvidia, Cisco, Belkin, and VMWare have all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22194183/intel-nvidia-cisco-government-infected-solarwinds-hack"&gt;reportedly seen computers on their networks infected&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the US Treasury, Commerce, State, Energy, and Homeland Security departments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3x63G"&gt;The scale of the attack means that it may be many months before the government completes its investigation. As part of the process, Neuberger said the government is planning an executive action to fix the security problems identified, and that “discussions are underway” about how to respond to the perpetrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vkzk2x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLXdaP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s next major Windows 10 update focuses on improving remote work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VEXy_MjqsS_sYQZcb8mwU8m8MVA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68835274/acastro_180504_1777_microsoft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FMJvOO"&gt;The next major update to Windows 10, version 21H1, will be delivered in the first half of 2021 and focuses on improving remote work scenarios. Microsoft traditionally delivers two major Windows updates per year, with most of the bigger features dropping in the spring and a smaller update in the fall. While IT admins are used to this approach, Microsoft appears to be reversing this cadence for 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eIuFIh"&gt;“Windows 10, version 21H1 will have a scoped set of features improving security, remote access and quality,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/02/17/introducing-the-next-feature-update-to-windows-10-version-21h1/"&gt;explains John Cable&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s head of Windows Servicing and Delivery. “The features we are releasing in this update are focused on the core experiences that customers have told us they’re relying on most right now.” These improvements will include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vpjo57"&gt;Windows Hello multicamera support to set the default as the external camera when both external and internal Windows Hello cameras are present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nGUMwO"&gt;Windows Defender Application Guard performance improvements including optimizing document opening scenario times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ac1Wit"&gt;Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Group Policy Service (GPSVC) updating performance improvement to support remote work scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8sFLQA0rrBivkKRIdZ0z3N00jl4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22311903/brio_og_image_new.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logitech’s Brio webcam will work better on devices with built-in Windows Hello cameras soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BXjIFA"&gt;The Windows camera changes mean you’ll soon be able to plug in an external Windows Hello camera and get the benefits of facial detection on a laptop that already has a Windows Hello camera built in. Currently, Windows doesn’t support this scenario well, and it means cameras like Logitech’s Brio do not work correctly with devices like Microsoft’s Surface range that also have Windows Hello cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="auuLLb"&gt;Microsoft’s other improvements for this 21H1 version are clearly designed for IT admins to improve support for remote working. This includes improving document opening times for Microsoft’s built-in anti-virus software, and performance improvements for the management and configuration side of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9LdL7"&gt;This 21H1 update will also install very quickly, much like a monthly cumulative updates to Windows. Microsoft has started testing this 21H1 update with beta testers today, and it’s planning to make it available to all Windows 10 users “later in the first half of this calendar year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5xHN2"&gt;Microsoft is also expected to deliver a larger Windows 10 update later in 2021. The company is planning a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;,” which is codenamed Sun Valley. Microsoft is planning to detail its next big changes to Windows at a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261997/microsoft-news-events-gaming-cloud-windows"&gt;special event in the coming months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei Mate X2 teaser hints at new folding screen design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Opn_LzVdsY-ozdAuEUQo8VEKXec=/0x0:1035x690/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68835165/matex2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wb4L6R"&gt;Huawei has posted another teaser for its upcoming Mate X2 folding phone &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/1839167003/K2tgLpqKW?from=page_1006061839167003_profile&amp;amp;wvr=6&amp;amp;mod=weibotime&amp;amp;type=comment#_rnd1613632260891"&gt;on Weibo&lt;/a&gt;, offering the strongest hint yet that it’ll move away from the original Mate X’s design. The first Mate X, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18238269/huawei-foldable-phone-mate-x-price-release-date-specs-mwc-2019"&gt;announced in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21145519/huawei-mate-xs-foldable-phone-news-features-quad-layer-screen-hinge-kirin-990-5g"&gt;refreshed in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, had a single large screen that folded in half so that the display was on the outside of the device. The follow-up phone, however, looks like it’ll fold the other way, more like Samsung’s Galaxy Folds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvXmab"&gt;Making reference to a new design for the Mate X2, the teaser image shows the phone from the side open at an angle, with a glow on the inside of the hinge. The picture is also a reference to the timing of the event, which will take place at 8PM China time (7AM ET) on February 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mMWdo"&gt;Here’s the full teaser image:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rp9DtGl3_dMvfOUHNHq15oYYg_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22311866/0020sXlVgy1gnrgbvs0qrj60u01hck6502_copy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Hpwj9e"&gt;The announcement will coincide with Mobile World Congress Shanghai next week, which has swapped its traditional summer slot with the larger Barcelona event. As of now, the GSM Association still plans for MWC Barcelona to take place in person from June 28th, but  those plans could of course change depending on the pandemic situation, and phone companies are likely to have planned new device launches for around February and March as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s One UI 3.1 update brings some S21 camera features to last year’s flagships</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy S20" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BLpsb-IWvpqOFNhWf4n8j5FV0xk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68834359/bking_200303_3928_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X3yWys"&gt;Samsung has announced that its &lt;a href="https://smsng.news/2ZmI4EW"&gt;latest One UI 3.1 software update&lt;/a&gt; is rolling out to some of its older phones. The update will trickle down some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Galaxy S21 lineup’s&lt;/a&gt; newer software features to last year’s Samsung flagships, including the Galaxy S20, Galaxy Note 20, Galaxy Z Fold 2 and Galaxy Z Flip phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZRYHR"&gt;Most of the new features are focused on bringing some of the software enhancements that Samsung debuted for the camera on the S21 lineup back down to its older devices. Those include the “enhanced single take” option that automatically captures and generates a variety of still images and videos with just one click, the smart object eraser tool for quickly removing unwanted parts of your photos, and the option to use both your phone and a separate Bluetooth microphone to record audio simultaneously. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CLI8uJ4Oj5nqsV1hhBokHiPwmX8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22311071/One_UI_3.1_Update_Object_eraser.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Samsung’s object eraser feature&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jTrQvk"&gt;The update brings the S20 / S20 Plus and S21 / S21 Plus models — which already shared virtually identical camera hardware — even closer together in terms of overall functionality, although there are still some features that remain exclusive to the newer device, like the director view feature for easily previewing and switching between different lenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbDE5o"&gt;Also being added to the 2020 devices is Samsung’s “Eye Comfort Shield,” which automatically adjusts the blue light output on the phones based on the time of day. There’s also Private Share, Samsung’s blockchain-based encryption option for more securely sending files and photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wC8cXz"&gt;The One UI 3.1 update will begin rolling out tonight “in select regions.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump’s campaign app was suspended from the Google Play Store because it didn’t work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TOPSHOT-US-POLITICS-TRUMP" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c1xsOYP1nzIkQYaEJqthMVeX1uw=/16x0:2716x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833887/1221046780.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rjT9Ft"&gt;Google removed former president Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign app from Google’s Play Store earlier Wednesday. It wasn’t removed for any of the many other reasons that Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218805/donald-trump-platforms-bans-facebook-twitter-youtube"&gt;has been removed from the world’s largest platforms&lt;/a&gt;, but rather because it just didn't work, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/17/donald-trumps-official-app-has-been-suspended-from-the-google-play-store-no-longer-works/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUtFBm"&gt;Prior to its suspension, the app provided campaign news, an event schedule, and ways to donate to the campaign, but at some point, it stopped working, prompting Google to take it down. &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; confirmed that the app was non-functional before Google removed it. When &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; tested the app, it was “unable to load content, reporting a network error or simply spinning a loading ‘T’ circle endlessly.” The iOS version of the app is still on the Apple App Store and still working, however.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yNxIo_sRyDHGT9dXb3-OqPbV0MU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22311132/chrome_2021_02_17_14_30_25.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Official Trump 2020 app page in the Play Store, prior to its removal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ILMd9j"&gt;It might not be surprising, but apps do need to maintain “minimum functionality” as part of  of the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9898783#zippy=%2Cexamples-of-common-violations"&gt;Play Store’s policies&lt;/a&gt;, which means they should both load and be responsive. Google provided a statement to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; about why it removed the app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kz6oc1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Trump 2020 campaign app recently stopped working and we reached out to the developer multiple times in an attempt to get them to address the issue. People expect that apps downloaded from Google Play provide a minimum level of functionality and our policy is to remove non-working apps from the store if they are not fixed.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="x7nHGL"&gt;While there could be a desire to connect the app’s removal to larger political motives like &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22223972/trump-impeached-house-senate-trial-former-president"&gt;Trump’s second impeachment&lt;/a&gt; or even earlier instances of the former President getting removed from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook, Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22218757/youtube-trump-account-video-deleted-uploads-suspension-indefinite"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, this is simple app store moderation at work: when an app doesn’t function and the developers don’t update, it gets removed until further notice. Since the 2020 campaign is over, don’t expect the app to get updated — at least until 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome OS now has a built-in screen recorder</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yxxAdeuDg-lwcLzWTy5IhVRE7GM=/297x0:1284x658/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833756/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CotvHx"&gt;Google has announced that a built-in screen recorder is coming to Chrome OS in March. Google hopes the tool will make it easier for students and teachers to record virtual lessons. “Teachers have long recorded lessons to help students do homework and study for tests, but in the past year it’s become downright critical for virtual learning,” reads Google’s &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/learning-with-google-chromebook/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6kyI5t"&gt;It looks pretty simple. Once you’ve pressed the appropriate button on your Chromebook, you’ll see a countdown in the center of your screen. While your Chromebook is recording, a red circle will appear on the right side of the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OJZ6cvTTrahRisjg1GPrW7cvG0s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22311214/image.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fFMCfA"&gt;A few other tools for Chromebook learners are in the works as well, and some have already arrived. Chrome OS’s screen reader, ChromeVox, has some new features: The voice now changes based on the language of the text it’s reading, and you can now search its menus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emt0PZ"&gt;Additionally, parents can now use &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9900467?hl=en"&gt;Family Link&lt;/a&gt; (Google’s parental-control app) to manage their children’s school accounts in addition to their personal accounts. This means screen-time limits, bedtimes, and other restrictions parents place on their children’s personal accounts can apply to their school accounts as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuWhvc"&gt;On the hardware side, Google has announced that it’s launching over 40 new Chromebooks this year. It claims every model is “equipped to deliver exceptional Google Meet and Zoom experiences”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wot6kp"&gt;To help schools navigate the new releases, the company has put out &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15MBdfJTqKZaqymPKYV8JMBxneqshFT7OGpolxFbHiL8/edit#slide=id.gb78f293965_1_464"&gt;a list of available Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt;, which includes configurations from Samsung, Lenovo, HP, Dell, Asus, and Acer, and tips for selecting the right one. The company recommends a number of basic models, such as Acer’s Chromebook Spin 511 and Lenovo’s 300e, as well as fancier devices like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s top Chromebook pick) and Samsung’s $1,000 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOC9pL"&gt;A number of these units include LTE connectivity — Google is referring to these as “Always Connected” devices, and emphasizes their importance for students with limited internet access (though buying a device with LTE can bump the price up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RcnI2e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Equipped to deliver exceptional Google Meet and Zoom experiences”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eOZ79i"&gt;Chromebooks are big sellers in the education market, due in part to their affordability and districts’ widespread use of Google Classroom, Google’s online education portal. 2020 was the Chromebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22256873/chromebook-best-year-ever-double-yearly-sales"&gt;best year ever&lt;/a&gt;, due largely to increased demand from schools providing at-home instruction for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gksHUR"&gt;Google has been building out its services for remote school and meetings since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21240509/google-meet-video-conferencing-free-gmail"&gt;early months of remote schooling&lt;/a&gt;, Google made Meet meetings with up to 100 participants available to anyone with a Google account. It’s added a number of features to Meet as well, in an effort to keep up with large competitors Zoom and Microsoft Teams. The company has rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/31/21543261/google-meet-custom-backgrounds-video-calls-zoom"&gt;custom backgrounds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/27/21305434/google-meet-background-blur-captioning-video-microsoft-teams-zoom"&gt;blur effects&lt;/a&gt;, real-time captioning, low-light mode, and hand-raising in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 20 biggest announcements from today’s Nintendo Direct </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-iWGptzv1FpWw4OQqTGzOn3AVXk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833726/acastro_190530_1777_switch_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrations by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wRFJUh"&gt;For the first time in over a year, Nintendo hosted a full-fledged Direct presentation. The latest presentation was focused mostly on games slated to hit Nintendo’s hybrid gaming console, the Switch, sometime during the first half of 2021, though there were a few announcements for games that will hit later than that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94ET2C"&gt;The nearly hour-long event included a slew of titles slated to hit the Switch before the year is half over, including ports for indie games such as &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt; and new installments in franchises like &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Splatoon&lt;/em&gt;. Here are the biggest news announcements and trailers from today’s Nintendo Direct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9UBAd2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GUYDXVDLmns?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NESyIL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288279/splatoon-3-nintendo-switch-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Splatoon 3 inks its way onto Nintendo Switch in 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PByR6X"&gt;The third installment in the &lt;em&gt;Splatoon &lt;/em&gt;franchise is slated to launch in 2022. Not much is known about the game, aside from a new desert locale, but game appears to feature the same paint-shooting action from previous entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tBYc9v"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X27t1VEU4d0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="POcoAs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288267/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-switch-re-release-nintendo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD slashes onto Nintendo Switch July 16th &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Ylym4X"&gt;Nintendo announced &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD, &lt;/em&gt;a re-release of the 2011 Wii U exclusive. The game will launch alongside a new pair of &lt;em&gt;Zelda-&lt;/em&gt;themed Joy-Cons. Nintendo also said it would share more information about the sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild &lt;/em&gt;later this year&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gdsYim"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aucAzFWpvMc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KSVWDQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288222/mario-golf-super-rush-nintendo-release-date-june-25"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Golf Super Rush is the latest installment in the Mario Golf Series and it arrives June 25th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lJrJl1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Golf Super Rush&lt;/em&gt; is the first &lt;em&gt;Mario Golf&lt;/em&gt; title for Nintendo’s hybrid console. The game will feature motion controls, new modes, and a story campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YwKaYM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SDyY_N0eloQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qvpTlw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288246/animal-crossing-new-horizons-mario-update"&gt;&lt;em&gt;First look at the Super&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Mario-themed items coming to Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="446TAb"&gt;Several &lt;em&gt;Mario&lt;/em&gt;-themed items and furniture will be purchasable via the Nook Shop in &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; beginning March 1st. Nintendo also confirmed that a free update will arrive on February 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0awwc5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aaIs_tQBMKc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YBFspT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288187/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-nintendo-switch-mediatonic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fall Guys Ultimate Knockout is getting ported to Nintendo Switch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yqyAv1"&gt;Mediatonic’s goofy platformer battle royale title &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout&lt;/em&gt; will receive a Nintendo Switch port. No release date was announced, but the game is targeting a summer launch window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m12xSx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A new DLC fighter for Super &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SmashBrosUltimate?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SmashBrosUltimate&lt;/a&gt; has been announced! This fighter will release in March, so stay tuned for more information soon. &lt;a href="https://t.co/5yBSEMOyx9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5yBSEMOyx9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1362163801890590722?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

Ultimate roster&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZXNvo"&gt;Both characters are set to be playable beginning in March, but Nintendo promises to share more details closer to release. The pair will count as a single character, making them both the fourth DLC character available in the second Fighters Pass for &lt;em&gt;Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xO82bj"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IjzfW6UB7zc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0TkiTA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity is getting an expansion pass &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Kn9H5p"&gt;The expansion pass will include two “waves” of content, with the first one launching this June and the other coming sometime in November. It costs $20 and preorders are now available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="phvXEd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indie darling Outer Wilds is coming to Switch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1ck1U"&gt;The 2019 action-adventure game by Mobius Digital will arrive on the Switch sometime this summer, according to Nintendo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GAJcIg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Qw_6v9xN7s?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="9XhVVe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Famicom Detective Club is coming to North America on May 14th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6iqjre"&gt;Two old-school murder-mystery games are getting the remake treatment for the Nintendo Switch and will be localized in English. The two detective games originally released on the Famicom Disk System in the late ‘80s and task players with solving mysteries. Both games will receive modern graphics, gameplay, and voice acting, yet retain the same mysteries that were found in the originals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YEXoDg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JnxoHOXqkiE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CzqOWA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No More Heroes 3 will launch on August 27th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="vu8CXP"&gt;The third title in the &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes Trilogy&lt;/em&gt; will arrive in late August exclusively on the Nintendo Switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bD5txS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K0ZMycpBCsg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gCTZzm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise launches March 26th &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XwzsIv"&gt;The latest trailer for &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; focuses on new story details and the monsters you’ll encounter in the game. A &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt;-themed Nintendo Switch will also release the same day as the console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="r6MTXK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uDsfRuz_4mY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="JBewLO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22044500"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stubbs the Zombie is getting a remaster for modern consoles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2i5Fir"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse &lt;/em&gt;is a third-person action game where players take control of a zombie and devour brains and wreak havoc in a city. Asypr Media, who previously remastered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301436/star-wars-episode-1-racer-ps4-switch-release-price"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars Episode 1: Racer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to modern consoles, is developing the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="S3teqC"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fDD17TfIn7Y?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Zvjt9P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neon White is a first-person action platformer developed by the creator of Donut County&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FqxZZI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Donut County &lt;/em&gt;creator Ben Esposito is working on a new project. &lt;em&gt;Neon White&lt;/em&gt; will task players with killing demons in Heaven. Based on the art style and first trailer, the new game is a far cry from Esposito’s previous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fVBGCZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBYW0p6jGZY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
