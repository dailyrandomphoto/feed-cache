    <title>The LG Wing’s dual screens get a little easier to use in a new software update</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KLSpKX"&gt;LG’s screen-swiveling Wing was one of the most interesting looking smartphones of 2020, but its unique design was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;held back&lt;/a&gt; by poor software support. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsupport%2Flg-wing-update%2F%3FAID%3D11365093%26SID%3D76086X1526367X31585b5296a3eb04e20a82fb2646967f%26vendorid%3DCJM%26PUBID%3D100036542%26cjevent%3Dfa23ec194ae411eb821b096f0a24060b%26cjdata%3DMXxOfDB8WXww&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F30%2F22206901%2Flg-wing-software-update-verizon-dual-screen-apps-media-controls#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A new software update&lt;/a&gt;, out today for the Verizon-exclusive device, looks to help address those issues by adding some new dual-screen functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xu6CK7"&gt;Specifically, &lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2020/12/30/verizon-lg-wing-gets-big-update-to-take-advantage-of-its-double-screen-fun/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Droid Life&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the new update makes it much easier to send apps to and from the smaller display to the main one (a process that previously involved some convoluted menu wrangling.) With the new update, there’s now a “send” button that shuttle apps from one display to the other, along with a “restart” button to relaunch apps that transition over poorly. You can also use a third-finger gesture to accomplish a similar task. Finally, LG has added app names to the homescreen when the phone is swiveled open, making it better resemble the standard Android homescreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8uSOyZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"LG Wing review: learning to fly, failing to soar ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Tdnp0o"&gt;LG has also fixed one of the biggest pet peeves about the second display, adding media controls for all apps to the second display when watching (instead of just a handful of select apps, like YouTube.) Now, apps like Netflix will offer similar functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDHIwt"&gt;There’s also a few other additional features in the update, including the ability to automatically scan QR codes in the camera app, a new wallpaper, a matching 5G icon, and a November security patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MELXe9"&gt;If you own an LG Wing, you’ll be able to install the update now by checking for a software update in the settings app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trade-in site Gazelle is ending trade-ins</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bnf7zuGsmcDZfvpAoMyJvczOgGU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68599613/akrales_190914_3628_0060.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ayb8pY"&gt;Gazelle, one of the longest-running used smartphone buyers in the US, has announced the end of its core trade-in program, which let phone owners mail in phones and other electronics devices in exchange for cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iw3O0x"&gt;The news, revealed in an email Gazelle sent to some customers on Wednesday and shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, means any prospective Gazelle customers will have to receive a quote and initiate the trade-in process by January 31st, 2021 (allowing 30 days to mail in the phone) if they want to take advantage of the program. The service will shut down officially on February 1st, while any active trade-ins will be honored, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7Ugn2S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gazelle will still accept used smartphones through its ecoATM kiosks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nHFO9c"&gt;This isn’t the end of Gazelle’s business. Gazelle’s parent company ecoATM, which has been around since 2006, &lt;a href="https://www.ecoatm.com/a/devices"&gt;operates kiosks&lt;/a&gt; that let you get instant cash for a used device, and the Gazelle website is now used as a retailer for selling those devices at reduced prices after they’re then refurbished. (The catch is that ecoATMs may not pay out as much as the traditional Gazelle mail-in program, which typically has offered more than $300 or so for a prior year’s flagship like the iPhone 11 Pro.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTva5M"&gt;Gazelle doesn’t give a reason for the decision, but there are a few major trends in the US mobile business that point toward a general decline in the benefits of cash trade-in services. For one, many more people now than in years past lease their smartphones instead of buying them outright, a broad shift from the days when US carriers offered reduced price phones in exchange for firm two-year contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbPuot"&gt;Now, it’s quite easy to pay a modest monthly fee for a phone through a program like AT&amp;amp;T Next Up or Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Program, with the option to trade that device in for a new one after a designated amount of time. Unless you decide to pay off your leased phone early, you can’t turn around and sell it to Gazelle — and you wouldn’t necessarily want to do that as it doesn’t make much financial sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7WgfZ"&gt;Additionally, Gazelle’s early business boomed on iPhone trade-ins back when selling your phone to get the latest Apple product was a popular strategy for early adopters. Now, Apple has a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in%3Fafid%3Dp238%257Cs4wibFo6O-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_427418702567_pgrid_80259604234_%26cid%3Daos-us-kwgo-brand--slid---product-&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F30%2F22206779%2Fgazelle-smartphone-used-trade-in-program-shut-down#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;robust trade-in program of its own&lt;/a&gt; (in addition to the leasing program) that pretty much gets you the same result. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Metro: Last Light Redux is free on GOG</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gallery Photo: Metro: Last Light screens" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1erKwqCLH7bwrJdkYJY_gD9wbGU=/86x0:1015x619/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68599607/METRO-LL-E3-2012-ONLINE-2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJ3ohH"&gt;If you’ve never gotten around to buying and playing &lt;em&gt;Metro: Last Light&lt;/em&gt;, the remastered version is &lt;a href="https://www.gog.com"&gt;free on the GOG store&lt;/a&gt; today and tomorrow (&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/30/22206196/free-games-metro-last-light-cd-projekt"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The game has been out for a while now, but it’s still as terrifying as ever, even if you’re playing it for a second or third time. And, when you get a game from GOG, it comes without any DRM, so your copy of the game isn’t tied to any particular platform. You can download the files to your hard drive, and it’ll still run without GOG’s launcher installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IelMzT"&gt;The process of claiming the game is a little non-obvious, as the “&lt;em&gt;Metro: Last Light&lt;/em&gt; giveaway” link at the very top of the page just leads to GOG’s search screen. To claim the free game, you’ll first want to log in (or create an account if you don’t have one), then go to the homepage. Scroll down until you see banner with a button that says “Yes, and claim the game”. The “yes”, by the way, is you opting in to marketing emails from GOG, so be aware of that before clicking. Clicking the button should add the game to your library, where you can then go and download it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot from the GOG website showing the claim game button" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UWiISaTacNpKVq2WmkveDGV-seE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22204877/Screen_Shot_2020_12_30_at_10.11.40_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That big green button is the only thing you can click that will actually get you the game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9GTdJA"&gt;Offering a free, genuinely very good game may be an attempt by GOG’s owner, CD Projekt Red to try to earn back some of the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22178913/cyberpunk-2077-launch-controversy-cd-projekt"&gt;goodwill that it’s lost this month&lt;/a&gt;. The company has been dealing with the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22178913/cyberpunk-2077-launch-controversy-cd-projekt"&gt;botched release of Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a PR crisis concerning GOG itself: there are concerns by some that the company capitulated to the Chinese government by rolling back its decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178453/gog-devotion-cancels-release-cd-projekt-red"&gt;carry Red Candle Games’s &lt;em&gt;Devotion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which contained unflattering references to the Chinese president in an early version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E28kKC"&gt;If you’ve decided not to use CD Projekt Red’s services for whatever reason, and don’t mind the game being stuck on a single platform, you can still pick it up pretty cheap on Steam — &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/287390/Metro_Last_Light_Redux/"&gt;it’ll be $3.99 there&lt;/a&gt; until January 5th. No matter which platform you pick, &lt;em&gt;Metro: Last Light&lt;/em&gt; is a great game with a solid story — and a lot of tense and heart-pounding moments. I played it when I was admittedly maybe a bit too young, and it resulted in a fair share of nightmares, so it may not be for the faint of heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8TXj3"&gt;If you’re itching for more free games, &lt;em&gt;Torchlight II&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/torchlight-2/home"&gt;free on the Epic Games Store today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Maneater and the latest Tomb Raider are among the latest free games for PS Plus subscribers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shadow of the Tomb Raider" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aO2QvLJwBGdSGnOil7JElxyVoPo=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68598791/sottr_review02.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vS1H2R"&gt;Sony has &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2020/12/30/januarys-playstation-plus-games-maneater-shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-and-greedfall/"&gt;announced its January lineup of games&lt;/a&gt; that are free for PS Plus subscribers to download. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ce5F3B"&gt;Starting January 5th, you’ll be able to get the PS5-only version of &lt;em&gt;Maneater&lt;/em&gt;, the eat-em-up game that &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;’s Chris Plante described &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/5/22/21266348/maneater-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"&gt;in his entertaining review&lt;/a&gt; as “the best shark game... ever?”, as well as two other PS4 games, &lt;em&gt;Greedfall &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider &lt;/em&gt;—&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;both of which are playable on PS5. Unfortunately, the PS4 version of &lt;em&gt;Maneater &lt;/em&gt;isn’t available for people who haven’t yet made the jump to the PS5, so PS4 owners get just two games this month. This bundle will no longer be available after February 1st, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nx7tso"&gt;It seems like Sony has established a formula for its monthly batch of complimentary games, with one PS5 game serving as the highlight and two PS4 games to round it out (and to keep doling out some small gifts for people who don’t yet have a PS5). Speaking of PS5 games, go ahead and download &lt;em&gt;Bugsnax &lt;/em&gt;for free while you can. It will no longer be available as a perk for PS Plus subscribers after January 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arTvzF"&gt;We don’t usually know what will be in each monthly collection of games, but Sony has already shared that its &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534475/destruction-all-stars-ps5-launch-title-delayed-ps-plus-february-2021"&gt;the vehicular combat game that was delayed past the console’s launch date&lt;/a&gt;, will be February’s freebie for the PS5. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon buys Wondery, setting itself up to compete against Spotify for podcast domination</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gO-hNwecce3wxvQIJ8p4UM14fP0=/0x0:2342x1561/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68598739/amazonwondery.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OJEZtt"&gt;Wondery, one of the last major independent podcast networks, might soon be owned by Amazon. The companies &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/wondery-to-join-amazon-music"&gt;announced an acquisition deal&lt;/a&gt; today, ending speculation about who might eventually buy the network, which is most well-known for true crime podcasts like &lt;em&gt;Dirty John&lt;/em&gt;. (Apple and Sony were also reported to have at least discussed a possible purchase.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwEFhv"&gt;Amazon didn’t disclose the acquisition price, although earlier reports from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-06/apple-sony-said-to-hold-talks-about-buying-podcaster-wondery"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-in-talks-to-buy-podcast-maker-wondery-11606931396?mod=e2tw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggested Wondery’s value was at least $300 million. Wondery would technically be part of Amazon Music, which launched podcast support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439531/amazon-music-podcasts-prime-titles"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt; this year. Wondery CEO Hernan Lopez will step down and leave the company when the deal closes, and COO Jen Sargent will take over, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BenMullin/status/1344374604987576321"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reporter Ben Mullin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QD3Pf7"&gt;The acquisition is a notable one, if only because it sets Amazon up to better compete against Spotify, which has been acquiring networks and exclusive talent for over a year. Amazon says this Wondery deal doesn’t change existing shows — they’ll still be available through “a variety of providers.” But Amazon says it hopes buying Wondery will “accelerate the growth and evolution of podcasts by bringing creators, hosts, and immersive experiences to even more listeners across the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0b9PD"&gt;Of course, Amazon Music would likely promote Wondery shows over other programs and possibly put even more marketing spend behind them, especially globally. Interestingly, Audible isn’t mentioned in the news release, even though the Amazon-owned company creates its own &lt;a href="https://chorus.voxmedia.com/compose/feed584f-0b76-4a54-b052-f58a32ffe942"&gt;exclusive podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, as well as publicly available ones, and recently launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/24/21398875/audible-plus-premium-subscription-membership-plan-credit"&gt;a cheaper price tier&lt;/a&gt; specifically for people who might want to hear Audible exclusives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UswHds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction 12/30, 1:29 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story previously stated that Wondery is now owned by Amazon, but the deal has not yet closed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnbgn4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12/30, 3:13 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to reflect that Hernan Lopez will leave Wondery when the deal closes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A quirk of COVID-19 tests can track the new coronavirus variant  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Travel Increases Ahead Of Christmas Holiday" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ErmsKEPKrRMkAI8D7anQIcy4G1k=/0x87:7687x5212/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68598562/1292639188.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A traveler at Los Angeles International Airport takes a COVID-19 test December 22nd.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Mario Tama / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mmb7GM"&gt;Health officials in the United States may be able to use a fluke of COVID-19 testing to monitor the spread of a more contagious form of the virus, which was identified in the country for the first time this week. The variant is spreading widely across the United Kingdom, and has been found in over a dozen countries so far — including the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14pb1a"&gt;Experts don’t think the coronavirus variant is more deadly than other forms of the virus, and the vaccines already developed should still protect against the new strain. But the variant does appear to spread more easily, and uncontrolled outbreaks would overwhelm hospitals more quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YE0uRI"&gt;So far, two US cases have been detected in patients with COVID-19, one &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GovofCO/status/1344031800230780933"&gt;in Colorado&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/public-health-san-francisco-california-coronavirus-pandemic-fd105d8f3eeb91edff4b3e6f263b919b?utm_source=Twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow"&gt;in California&lt;/a&gt;. Colorado health officials said that the Colorado patient hasn’t traveled out of the country, indicating that the variant may have been circulating before now, and that it may already have a foothold in the country. Unlike the UK, the US is doing &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/12/23/us-leads-world-coronavirus-cases-ranks-43rd-sequencing-check-variants/"&gt;very little analysis&lt;/a&gt; of virus samples from COVID-19 patients to check for mutations and variants, which is why it may have gone undetected until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vgJ2kd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The US is doing very little analysis of virus samples from COVID-19 patients to check for mutations and variants&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BQDQh5"&gt;In the absence of widespread viral analysis, officials may be able to track the variant, known as B.1.1.7, through standard COVID-19 testing. “It’s a serendipitous thing, not something we intended to happen,” says Theo Sanderson, a geneticist at the Francis Crick Institute in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5QUO7"&gt;Most typical, gene-based COVID-19 tests work by searching for evidence of the coronavirus genetic material in a swab of spit and mucus collected from patients. The virus has a long genome, and the tests aren’t looking for evidence of the whole thing. Instead, they usually search for two or three sections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VMn29"&gt;In some COVID-19 tests, one of the snippets is on the coronavirus S gene — the gene that codes for the virus’s spike protein, which lets the virus bind to cells. That’s also the gene where one of the mutations in the new variant occurred. If a patient was infected with a virus with that specific mutation, the test — which is designed based on the non-mutated form of the gene — won’t be able to see the variant version. Since the test would still be able to see the other sections of the virus, it would still come back positive — just without the S gene. Researchers call it an S gene dropout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sIL3tT"&gt;In the UK, experts have been able to use S gene dropout as an unofficial measurement for the amount of the coronavirus variant circulating in different parts of the country. “It’s been very useful,” Sanderson says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6BUlK"&gt;It’s not a perfect metric: mutations in the S gene also appear in other variants that don’t share B.1.1.7’s characteristics. Not every S gene dropout flagged on a test is a B.1.1.7 virus, but researchers in the UK have managed to untangle the data and figure out how much dropout is from the new variant. As the infection rate of the B.1.1.7 variant has increased, the rate of the S gene dropout has &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948152/Technical_Briefing_VOC202012-2_Briefing_2_FINAL.pdf"&gt;tracked with it&lt;/a&gt; more and more closely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="8Iq3F9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;6/ The PHE report also provides a nice breakdown of this, which better accounts for anything else that might also cause S-dropout (but it's not split by area) &lt;a href="https://t.co/0Cen6TRZtl"&gt;https://t.co/0Cen6TRZtl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/vj0aQEcTSV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/vj0aQEcTSV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Theo Sanderson (@theosanderson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/theosanderson/status/1343567435614531584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 28, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i8umV9"&gt;Some labs in the US are starting to adopt the strategy. Both the Colorado and California variant cases were found after labs &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.gov/governor/news/3856-gov-polis-and-state-public-health-officials-announce-first-case-covid-variant-covid-19"&gt;flagged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/K_G_Andersen/status/1344399869889269761"&gt;COVID-19 test results&lt;/a&gt; that had S gene dropouts for a full analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHJIqE"&gt;The California-based genomics company Helix, which conducts COVID-19 testing, is also analyzing their samples for evidence of S gene dropout. In October, the Helix research team found that 0.25 percent of their tests had an S gene dropout, which rose to around 0.5 percent in early December. (In some parts of the UK, &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948152/Technical_Briefing_VOC202012-2_Briefing_2_FINAL.pdf"&gt;over 75 percent&lt;/a&gt; of tests show this pattern.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLyQJR"&gt;Based on that data, the variant is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1343592970247831554"&gt;probably still rare&lt;/a&gt; in the US. “You can sort of put an upper bound on how much of the B.1.1.7 would be in a place, because if you’re not seeing the dropout, then you do know that the B.1.1.7 isn’t there,” Sanderson says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtjoKH"&gt;Helix is planning to analyze its virus samples to check for the B.1.1.7 variant, said James Lu, co-founder and president of Helix. “We are still determining the percent correlation between samples with S gene dropout and the B.1.1.7 variant. We’re hoping to learn from sequencing how strong of a proxy it is,” he wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dpPRY1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re hoping to learn from sequencing how strong of a proxy it is”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MuBLcX"&gt;If there proves to be a strong relationship between them, Helix will track the rate of S gene dropout on a regular basis, Lu said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MRDRud"&gt;The key thing to watch for is a sharp increase in the amount of S gene dropout in a particular region, Sanderson says; that was the indicator in the UK that the new variant was spreading widely. “If you saw that in some particular area of the US that would be very worrying,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmb7kq"&gt;Ideally, the US will scale up its viral analysis to more closely follow the spread of the B.1.1.7 variant, as well as flag any new variants that occur. “Genomic surveillance is always going to be better,” Sanderson says. But in its absence, monitoring S gene dropout could be a good start, he says. “It’s always useful to have more data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRD5lh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 30th, 5:01PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with information on the California case. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton tests its own exclusive music with three Elvis remixes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elvis Presley" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xjYKID_cHUkj8BRz7fWMAKBiIcU=/0x140:2758x1979/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68597968/517216004.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XgfjHt"&gt;Peloton is now a place to debut music. The popular fitness startup, already known for its use of popular music during its classes, announced today that it’s debuting new Elvis remixes in its app that’ll be exclusive to the platform for a month. The company worked with Chromeo, Big Boi, and DJ Dillon Francis to create the remixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="951ZHJ"&gt;The songs premiere in the app today as part of an “ultimate remix collection,” which includes yoga, strength, core, and outdoor running classes. As part of a New Year’s promo, the company is also extending its 30-day free trial to two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mNUd5"&gt;A spokesperson says the idea behind starting with Elvis was to find a “new expression of the  classic catalog in a contemporary way” — which to me reads as finding a way to make Elvis music something you’d actually want to hear when working out. Sony, however, owns the rights to the songs, and might choose to release the tracks more widely after the month-long exclusivity window expires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InNjzj"&gt;Exclusive music makes sense for Peloton. The company already has its own hardware and video content, meant to keep users hooked and fend off competitors. If people want to use a Peloton bike or take a class from a Peloton instructor, they need to stay in the company’s ecosystem — and the same will now be true for these tracks, at least for the first month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3mvkA"&gt;Peloton has worked to secure deals with musicians to include their tracks in classes. The company pays per music stream, similarly to companies like Spotify, and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21559541/beyonce-peloton-themed-class-music-bike-treadmill-lawsuit-settled"&gt;signed deals with artists&lt;/a&gt; like Beyoncé to stream their music. Hyping up Peloton as a place to hear exclusive music for the first time could be a way to court new subscribers and keep current ones tuning in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWps1t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12/30, 2:43PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peloton originally hyped in its press release that the company will have the exclusive rights to the three tracks and that it would be “the first time that any artist has created music just for Peloton classes.” But the company later said in an email to The Verge that the music will only be exclusive to Peloton for “an initial launch window”, and that Sony can publicly release all three tracks after that period.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Most of 2020’s best holiday deals could end later this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/McuDC-LV8bmUUfURSD491F3eOm0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68597706/DSCF2108.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="85TXFa"&gt;When the calendar flips over to 2021 this Friday, January 1st, some of the best deals that we’ve been featuring for the past few months could come to an end. Assuredly, not every single one will end, but judging from previous years, the start of a new year means the holiday season is over and most companies will likely want to raise their prices. Here are a few mainstay deals that might not be around for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7RE9uP"&gt;If you &lt;a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/"&gt;sign up for YouTube TV by December 31st&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll get a free Google Chromecast with Google TV (pictured above), the latest streaming device that supports 4K HDR playback and includes a remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WZP8P"&gt;Next up, this great Walmart-exclusive deal combines a Switch Pro controller with a download code for &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; for just $70. This deal is likely to sell out, but keep an eye on it, as it occasionally restocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="smzaDe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10057685"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Rqp5Gt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10258792"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="iaWzvK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625473"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oKT2cu"&gt;Some of the best deals this holiday season have been on flagship wireless headphones from Bose and Sony. They’re not what I’d call cheap — even at their discounted prices — but if you value great sound quality and hushing some outside distractions with noise cancellation, either are worth your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8QOmY8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9586877"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="1HsHsj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9523565"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="WCL4bG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="VL716V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505867"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="krHknS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XBRYzq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="FwZpr2"&gt;It’s not easy to make it to a library right now, and with a long winter stuck at home looming ahead for many of us, there’s never been a better time to hunker down with a good book. If you’ve been lucky enough to receive a new Kindle (or a non-Amazon-branded e-reader or just a device with an e-book app on it), you might be looking for some new books to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pl42W2"&gt;To help, here are some of the best new science fiction books released in 2020 (along with some additional recommendations for other books in a series, where applicable), which should be the perfect pairing with your new e-reader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2DmLGh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve rounded up our favorite and most-used games, apps, and entertainment.

&lt;em&gt;The City We Became&lt;/em&gt; by N.K. Jemisin &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YPxOpFISLLFdLxsEYNyVkQVbNOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22188746/51aTZ37G1rL.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OfKlS2"&gt;N.K. Jemisin is best known for her astounding &lt;em&gt;Broken Earth&lt;/em&gt; trilogy (which is well worth adding to your reading list, too). &lt;em&gt;The City We Became — &lt;/em&gt;a novel-sized spinoff of an &lt;a href="https://www.tor.com/2016/09/28/the-city-born-great/"&gt;earlier short story by Jemisin&lt;/a&gt; — reimagines New York City as a living, breathing entity, personified by a diverse collection of people from across the five boroughs as they fight to save the city from an otherworldly foe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qST3mZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"The City We Became","description":"$14.99 for Kindle from Amazon","label":"Buy now","url":"https://www.amazon.com/City-We-Became-N-Jemisin-ebook/dp/B07MFKQDJM/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;qid=&amp;amp;amp;sr="}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TF1HM8"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NgXm86"&gt;If you haven’t read &lt;em&gt;Gideon the Ninth&lt;/em&gt;, the first book in Muir’s &lt;em&gt;Locked Tomb&lt;/em&gt; trilogy, read that first. You probably won’t need any encouragement at that point to dive into the second book, &lt;em&gt;Harrow the Ninth,&lt;/em&gt; which picks up right where the first book left off, while managing to outdo its predecessor in baffling puzzles, inventive sci-fi horror, and Muir’s personal brand of crackling style and wit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TKfNyu"&gt;A love letter to &lt;em&gt;The Empire Strikes Back&lt;/em&gt; (much as the original &lt;em&gt;From a Certain Point of View&lt;/em&gt; is to &lt;em&gt;A New Hope&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;em&gt;From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back &lt;/em&gt;features 40 short stories from 40 authors, diving into new facets of the film, from the Wampa ice creature to Boba Fett to &lt;a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Willrow_Hood"&gt;Willrow Hood&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor&lt;/em&gt; by Hank Green&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/htx_XgASp7jd61U2XeaO62AKVDA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22188733/A1U37Kql2lL.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BsJT1L"&gt;Another sequel here, so you’ll likely want to seek out Green’s first book, &lt;em&gt;An Absolutely Remarkable Thing, &lt;/em&gt;before you dive in. (Think of this as two recommendations for the price of one!) Both books examine the fallout that happens when April May encounters a strange, alien statue (named Carl) — while also exploring how social media and fame can change how we interact with and view the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SSEwfH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor ","description":"$14.99 for Kindle from Amazon","label":"Buy now","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Beautifully-Foolish-Endeavor-Novel-Carls-ebook/dp/B081Y4Q86K/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;amp;keywords=a+beautifully+foolish+endeavor&amp;amp;amp;qid=1608582063&amp;amp;amp;s=digital-text&amp;amp;amp;sr=1-1"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8el0x8"&gt;

&lt;em&gt;To Sleep in a Sea of Stars&lt;/em&gt; by Christopher Paolini&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cHVpprXQft1bup0qvH_JWG6xjsU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22188728/51LV5uH7NmL.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j7RhjI"&gt;Paolini’s first novel since his popular &lt;em&gt;Inheritance Cycle&lt;/em&gt; moves on from dragons to deep space and from YA novels to a more adult audience. Xenobiologist Kira Navárez encounters a strange alien relic, and things quickly spiral into a war that could decide the fate of humanity’s interstellar civilization. At nearly 900 pages, it’s a perfect book to hide away in over the holidays. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The Hidden Girl and Other Stories&lt;/em&gt; by Ken Liu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xKYeoTgHeFWzOYCuliOUYg1msvs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22188749/71T_maWeLsL.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qEXvrP"&gt;Liu has already become one of the biggest names in sci-fi and fantasy short stories, dating from his first collection, &lt;em&gt;The Paper Menagerie&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Hidden Girl and Other Stories&lt;/em&gt;, his latest collection, features 17 new tales that look at artificial intelligence, classical mythology, and more in a new light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MpNB2J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"The Hidden Girl and Other Stories","description":"$13.99 for Kindle from Amazon","label":"Buy now","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Girl-Other-Stories-ebook/dp/B07TD6GJNT"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oQdzoJ"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="krWNqJ"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Subcutanean&lt;/em&gt; by Aaron A. Reed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KDzUdvvPhy9xkUVRLgB81M0xoM4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22188726/52691223._SX318_SY475_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RKqAGf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subcutanean&lt;/em&gt; may be the most unique book of 2020 — or perhaps ever — literally. Reed describes it as a “permutational novel,” with each copy of the novel containing its own unique text. Some differences from copy to copy will be big, others small, even as the overall story stays largely the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="U3t5et"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Subcutanean","description":"$9.95 for Kindle from Amazon","label":"Buy now","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Subcutanean-30287-Aaron-Reed-ebook/dp/B084KLL5PP"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="nVYlte"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tC7ZUo"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Network Effect&lt;/em&gt; by Martha Wells&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D0bUzluWu5FsbOZ5AVv_4_GjuM4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22188727/52381770._SX0_SY0_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hFPriL"&gt;Murderbot — a self-aware artificially intelligent killing machine — is one of the best sci-fi heroes in recent memory. Murderbot has already been the star of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/13/17928580/martha-wells-murderbot-exit-protocol-artificial-condition-exit-strategy-science-fiction-book-review"&gt;Wells’ &lt;em&gt;Murderbot Diaries&lt;/em&gt; novellas&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;Network Effect &lt;/em&gt;gives a proper full-length novel to the cynical TV-marathoning robot who just wants a break. Best of all, it’s a standalone, so you won’t have read the first few novellas — but you probably should, seeing as they’re just as excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="OxhgPh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Network Effect","description":"$13.99 for Kindle from Amazon","label":"Buy now","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Network-Effect-Murderbot-Novel-Diaries-ebook/dp/B07WZ7SB5D"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="XUDRBq"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kAXG0V"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Ballad of Snakes and Songbirds &lt;/em&gt;by Suzanne Collins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/znd3B28RtnbXQcHUB1Uqy-Uu-mU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22188725/220px_The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_and_Snakes__Suzanne_Collins_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6S7tyn"&gt;The return to &lt;em&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/em&gt;’ world of Panem comes almost a full decade after the release of &lt;em&gt;Mockingjay&lt;/em&gt;. But instead of another action-packed dive into the arena, &lt;em&gt;The Ballad of Snakes and Songbirds&lt;/em&gt; is a prequel that focuses on the future President Snow’s rise to power — and the political and social forces that forged the Hunger Games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="B7frHx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"The Ballad of Snakes and Songbirds","description":"$17.99 for Kindle from Amazon","label":"Buy now","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Ballad-Songbirds-Snakes-Hunger-Games-ebook/dp/B07V5KKSZT"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="UyfP3J"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EaY0Pc"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Shorefall&lt;/em&gt; by Robert Jackson Bennett&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OaHj_z2gt7yyTJwSIjBa2gSCxSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22188724/45309582._SY475_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqt3Wa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shorefall&lt;/em&gt; is technically a fantasy novel, but I’m including it anyway because it’s set in a magical world that’s based far more on computer coding and AI than it is on swords and elves. It’s an almost cyberpunk take on the genre in a city filled with sorcerous computers and augmentations. Practically everything in the city of Tevanne is a programmed AI of some sort, and massive, looming megacorporations spar with each other as they rule the city. Start with &lt;em&gt;Foundryside&lt;/em&gt;, the first book in the series, before you head to &lt;em&gt;Shorefall&lt;/em&gt;, which ratchets everything up another notch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Np2Y0n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Shorefall","description":"$12.99 for Kindle from Amazon","label":"Buy now","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Shorefall-Novel-Founders-Trilogy-Book-ebook/dp/B07QVH2Q2K"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s One UI 3.0 update starts rolling out to Galaxy Note 10 devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oMIsb63bJ0PYoJlxpceku4NkzQ8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68597426/akrales_190827_3620_0175.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GwUp9e"&gt;Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437681/samsung-android-11-one-ui-3-0-update-first-look-screenshots-improvements"&gt;One UI 3.0 update&lt;/a&gt; has started hitting older Samsung devices, starting with the Galaxy Note 10 and Galaxy Note 10 Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-note-10-one-ui-3-0-stable-update-released/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The update, which brings Android 11-specific feature changes and some small visual and interface tweaks to Samsung smartphones, is only arriving on last year’s Note 10 devices in Germany, Spain, and Switzerland for now, but a wider release is expected at some point early next year if not in just a few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvdHNg"&gt;Samsung first began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505517/samsung-one-ui-3-0-s20-plus-ultra-android-11-update-t-mobile"&gt;beta testing One UI 3.0 this past fall&lt;/a&gt; following the release of Android 11, and it’s been at various stages of availability for different smartphones depending on your region. The Note 10 and Note 10 Plus versions have been available in beta since October, and in early December Samsung began its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150143/samsung-android-11-one-ui-3-update-rollout-announced"&gt;official rollout of the update&lt;/a&gt; to phones in its Galaxy S20 line, with plans to bring the update to its foldables and Samsung’s 2019 devices in the “coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDfxfq"&gt;That would imply we’ll see a One UI 3.0 release for the Z Fold, Z Fold 2, and Z Flip shortly, as well as wider availability of the update on the Note 10 line beyond Europe. We’ve reached out to Samsung to ask whether the company has a concrete timetable for this broader release outside the initial three markets. &lt;/p&gt;
