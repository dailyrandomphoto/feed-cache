    <title>New York City selects Bird, Lime, and VeoRide for its coveted e-scooter pilot</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u2VOWg"&gt;New York City’s days as one of the last remaining holdouts in the dockless electric scooter boom is finally at an end. The city’s Department of Transportation (DOT) announced the selection of Bird, Lime, and VeoRide as the participants in its inaugural e-scooter pilot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KOIwXf"&gt;The companies are expected to begin operations in the Bronx by early summer with 1,000 scooters each. The pilot is only expected to last for one year, but DOT has the option to renew the licenses at the end of the term. The department also said it expects most scooter rides to cost less than $5 for customers on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6DpHcg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NYC’s days as a stubborn holdout are over&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PLwF7p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21204232/new-york-legalizes-electric-bikes-scooters"&gt;It’s been over a year since New York State finally lifted its ban&lt;/a&gt; on throttle-based electric bikes and scooters, removing the last obstacle that kept the scooter companies at bay from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/11/17553508/scooter-sharing-nyc-bird-lime-law"&gt;the largest and possibly most lucrative market in the country&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2017, companies like Bird, Lime, Spin, Scoot, and others have deployed hundreds of thousands of Chinese-made e-scooters in cities across the world — and yet New York City stubbornly remained scooter-free because of the state law barring their use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNtNNw"&gt;At the time, legalizing e-scooters and e-bikes was seen as a huge boon for immigrant delivery workers who had been targeted in a crackdown by police for their use of e-bikes. Under the new rules, scooters would stay illegal in Manhattan, though the city could eventually overrule that provision. But the legalization also opened the debate over how New York City should regulate shared scooters on its streets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARvIof"&gt;Ultimately, the city landed on a one-year pilot with three companies in just one borough, the Bronx. After the first year, assuming everything goes well, the city will expand the service area to new neighborhoods and will allow the participating companies to increase their number of scooters in operation to 2,000 each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqXixw"&gt;The permit winners include two big names — Bird and Lime — and one smaller one, Chicago-based VeoRide, which offers both standing and sit-down versions of its scooters. All three will be barred from using “gig” labor to charge and rebalance their scooters under the rules of the pilot. The companies will also be prohibited from forcing customers to agree to terms of service that include binding arbitration or class action waiver provisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TaJxNH"&gt;Despite these restrictions, the companies sound super pumped about their selection. All three companies used some variation of the word “honored” in their prepared statements. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20977840/electric-scooters-illegal-law-legislation-micromobility-london-new-york"&gt;Next up is London&lt;/a&gt;, which is expected to soon announce the choices for its shared-scooter pilot. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is giving away a custom Flight Simulator PC that won’t play Flight Simulator at max settings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ouIU4B1RXsAsCGQOpCyNcP2yLAs=/0x0:1013x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69126585/flight_sim_custom_pc_3_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h9q9xC"&gt;If I were the Microsoft marketing executive pitching a once-in-a-lifetime giveaway of an incredible custom-built &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; PC (via &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/microsoft-flight-sim-jet-engine-pc-contest/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), I would do two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngT09S"&gt;1) I would probably make it look like a &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt; jet engine, not half an exposed jet engine, to avoid reminding people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/20/22293208/united-airlines-ua328-denver-engine-failure"&gt;how airplanes can rarely (but terrifyingly) fail&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lgGNWx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vT4_A82kBsI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EzwhOx"&gt;2) I would make sure it has the very best parts on the market, both for wow factor and so my one-of-a-kind &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator &lt;/em&gt;PC can hopefully play the notoriously demanding game at max settings someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8LRSJ"&gt;Weirdly, this PC will come with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 (not a 3080 or 3090!), as well as a Core i7-11700K rather than Intel’s new flagship Core i9-11900K. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357949/intel-core-i9-11900k-review"&gt;We recently tested that Core i9 with an RTX 3090&lt;/a&gt;, and it still wasn’t enough to hit 60fps in &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; at max settings, though I imagine the Core i7 won’t be far off our results with &lt;a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/compare.html?productIds=212047,212325"&gt;its very similar specs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c62uO7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;Envie de voyager ? ✈️&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On te fait gagner un PC unique Microsoft Flight Simulator conçu pour le vol à l'occasion de la nouvelle mise à jour France/Benelux !  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pour participer :&lt;br&gt;➡️ RT + Follow &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxFR?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@XboxFR&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;➡️ Commente avec &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MicrosoftFlightSimulator?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MicrosoftFlightSimulator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/aeDk4nnOWH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aeDk4nnOWH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xbox FR (@XboxFR) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxFR/status/1382011655509381123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gnasb1"&gt;Does this PC still have great specs? Absolutely. Should you question them if you’re the lucky winner of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxFR/status/1382011655509381123"&gt;this Microsoft France / Gigabyte Aorus&lt;/a&gt; collab? Definitely not. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;That RTX 3070 is worth upward of $1,200 all by its lonesome&lt;/a&gt;. I’m just telling you what &lt;em&gt;I &lt;/em&gt;would do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFTu4M"&gt;Oh, and 3) I would absolutely make that giant fan go all the way around and spin, so it can serve as an epic, brag-worthy case fan for the entire PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3M4Kvw"&gt;Speaking of epic Microsoft giveaway items, do you remember &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538654/microsoft-xbox-series-x-fridge-competition"&gt;the Xbox Series X fridge&lt;/a&gt;? Not only is Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/2/22364073/microsoft-xbox-series-x-mini-fridge-skittles-twitter-brand-poll"&gt;actually now putting a real Xbox Series X mini-fridge into production&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s apparently going to be designing them from scratch. That’s according to Xbox marketing head Aaron Greenberg, who dropped the tidbit in a Clubhouse room yesterday evening where &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TayNixster"&gt;my colleague Taylor Lyles&lt;/a&gt; was listening.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PS5 and Xbox Series X bundles are in stock at GameStop [UPDATE: Sold Out]</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LfFuyG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: April 14th, 2021 3:04PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Bundles for both the PS5 and Xbox Series X are now sold out at GameStop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AiEdIl"&gt;Due to the global electronic component shortage, it has been extremely difficult to buy any next-gen hardware. Whether you want Sony’s PS5 or Microsoft’s Xbox Series X, the restocks are far and stock is limited. Fortunately, GameStop is restocking a &lt;em&gt;limited&lt;/em&gt; number of bundles for both systems today, while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tkmAH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-with-ps-plus-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225171T.html%3Futm_source%3Drakutenls%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_content%3DTwitter%26utm_campaign%3D2%26utm_kxconfid%3Dtebx5rmj3%26cid%3Dafl_10000087%26affID%3D77777%26sourceID%3D0wLgH49VWzI-1Nhp5T89_Iaz.MFPc7w6_A" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The PS5 Digital Edition bundle&lt;/a&gt; — which includes the console, plus one-year subscriptions for PS Plus and PS Now, an extra DualSense controller, and a $20 GameStop gift card — is selling for $600, which may sound like a lot until you factor the retail price for each item separately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y95vhT"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-spider-man-ultimate-edition-and-call-of-duty-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225170F.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second bundle costs $730&lt;/a&gt;. At that price, it nets you one PS5 with a disc drive, two $70 games (&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ultimate Launch Edition&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War&lt;/em&gt;), an extra DualSense controller, and a $20 GameStop gift card. There is also &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-action-collection-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225170G.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a third bundle for $745&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the disc drive console, three games (&lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Avengers&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Launch Edition&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt;), an extra controller, plus a $20 gift card to GameStop.&lt;/p&gt;

It includes a copy of &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt;, plus a three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Additionally, an extra controller and a $20 GameStop gift card are included with the purchase. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Q4 E-Tron is Audi’s best shot yet at selling a lot of EVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/04tIBPz1z1uJfp7tRE73kuWsd2U=/188x0:2213x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69125831/Q4_etron_SP_0041.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Audi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Built on Volkswagen’s EV tech&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Lt6nW6"&gt;Audi is taking wider aim at the growing market for electric vehicles with two new compact EVs: the Q4 E-Tron and the Q4 Sportback E-Tron. Revealed on Wednesday and due out later this year, the two electric SUVs are far more affordable than the flagship E-Tron but also don’t skimp on things like range (up to around 300 miles) and futuristic tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTTzFO"&gt;The new electric SUVs also represent a strategic shift of sorts because they’re the first models Audi will build on the modular electric vehicle platform designed by parent company Volkswagen. This architecture, which Volkswagen refers to as the MEB platform, is powering everything from the entire VW ID lineup of electric cars and SUVs, to EVs from sub-brands like Škoda and Seat, and even &lt;a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/electric-cars/new-2023-meb-based-ford-ev-will-be-small-suv"&gt;a Europe-focused SUV from Ford&lt;/a&gt; that’s part of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20690722/ford-vw-alliance-self-driving-argo-investment-valuation"&gt;alliance the created in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="R0QXJW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Starting at €41,900, or around $50,000&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9RTSk8"&gt;The new Q4 E-Tron will start at €41,900 and the Q4 Sportback E-Tron at €43,900 when they go on sale in Germany in June, with sales spreading wider into Europe after that and to the US before the end of the year. That timing may just be perfect. The original E-Tron (and its own Sportback variant) were struggling mightily near the end of 2020 in the US, but &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/498568/audi-etron-sales-us-q12021/"&gt;sales have shot up dramatically&lt;/a&gt; despite the higher price tag. President Biden is making a big push to encourage electric vehicles, including potentially &lt;a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a36075542/biden-ev-customer-rebates/"&gt;extending or expanding the $7,500 federal tax credit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8urGop"&gt;Audi’s actually spent about two years teasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251528/audi-q4-etron-ev-concept-geneva-auto-show-2019"&gt;electric versions of its popular Q-series SUVs&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the more remarkable things about the Q4 EVs announced Wednesday is just how much they resemble the concepts the German automaker revealed in 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21316580/audi-q4-etron-sportback-suv-2021-volkswagen-meb"&gt;and 2020&lt;/a&gt;. They both retained the same large faux front grille and aggressive body work that the concepts featured, which should help them stand apart from competing electric SUVs that are more likely to blend in — like the original E-Tron, the Mercedes-Benz EQC, or even to some extent the VW ID 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vvsKYF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10446191"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="35bXc8"&gt;Audi says the Q4 E-Tron measures 4,588mm (about 15 feet) long, 1,865mm (about 6 feet) wide, and 1,632mm (about 5.4 feet) tall. While the company calls it a “compact SUV,” it has a wheelbase that’s more comparable to a midsize SUV and interior space on par with a full-size SUV, which is thanks to all of the EV tech being moved to the underlying MEB platform. It’s a bit smaller overall than the original E-Tron and the Tesla Model Y. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPZmhc"&gt;The base models are built on a 55 kWh version of the MEB battery pack (with 52 kWh of usable energy), and Audi says they’ll get about 341 kilometers (212 miles) and 349 kilometers (217 miles) on a full charge, respectively. While that’s a healthy chunk of range  for the size of the battery pack, those estimates are based on the less stringent European WLTP test cycle, meaning their EPA range estimates will likely be a bit lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6AW9Y"&gt;Buyers who want to take their Q4 E-Tron farther (or drive them longer between charges) will have to pony up for one of the more expensive configurations, all of which are built on an 82 kWh battery pack (with 77 kWh of usable energy). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LiF0TJ"&gt;The midrange Q4 E-Tron will travel the farthest, offering 520 kilometers (323 miles) of range. (There is no midrange Sportback.) Then there’s the top-of-the-line Q4 E-Tron and Sportback E-Tron, which can respectively travel 488 kilometers (303 miles) and 497 kilometers (309 miles) on a full charge. The VW ID 4 also uses an 82 kWh battery (and even has the same amount of modules — 12 — in its pack), and it &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/04/13/volkswagen-id4-pro-electric-suv-260-mile-epa-range/"&gt;just got rated for 260 miles by the EPA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tux09t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Q4 E-Trons are cheaper and more efficient than the flagship E-Tron&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bz7cIy"&gt;Audi didn’t reveal US pricing, and it will be a while before we get official EPA estimates for the range of each model. But it does look like there is more value in the new Q4 EVs as far as range goes when compared to the E-Tron. The original E-Tron starts at $65,900 and currently gets an EPA-rated 222 miles from its 95 kWh battery, though that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21356342/2021-audi-e-tron-price-drop-range-bump-epa-electric-suv"&gt;after Audi decided to increase the usable energy from 83.6 kWh to 86.5 kWh for this year’s model&lt;/a&gt;. The Q4 is likely to start at a lower price point and at the very least will be around 50–60 percent more efficient with its energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WudZRJ"&gt;One of the reasons the top models don’t get quite as much out of that larger battery pack as the midrange Q4 E-Tron is that they come with all-wheel drive powered by a pair of electric motors, one on each axle. This setup makes these most expensive models the quickest, but that extra weight — the top-line Q4 E-Tron weighs 2,135kg (4,707 pounds), versus 1,890kg (4,167 pounds) for the base model, and the Sportbacks are five kilograms heavier — means they won’t be lightning-quick. They can make the run from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour (62 miles per hour) in 6.2 seconds, which is about three seconds faster than the base models but still slower than some of Audi’s competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZkFmi"&gt;While the starting price is lower, buyers will have to pay extra if they want the most fanciful tech features that Audi is promising in the new Q4 electrics. The headliner is an augmented reality heads-up display system that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320190/audi-q4-etron-suv-interior-augmented-reality-ar-photos"&gt;Audi first showed off in March&lt;/a&gt;, which has a larger viewing area and more advanced (and animated) overlays than the typically static options found on many modern cars — including navigation markers that “float” on the road ahead of the Q4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57Pnq9"&gt;There’s also an optional 11.6-inch touchscreen, the largest Audi’s ever put in one of its vehicles. The standard screen is the same 10.1-inch version found in Audi’s recent cars, but regardless of which main screen buyers choose, there will be a 10.25-inch driver display behind the steering wheel. Audi is also offering a Sonos sound system as an option — which is a first for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322827/sonos-audi-q4-e-tron-auto-sound-partnership"&gt;the speaker company&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4YTFhG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10382048"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MfSBgv"&gt;Audi has, for now, abandoned plans to roll out a hands-free driving feature like GM’s Super Cruise or Ford’s BlueCruise, but the Q4 E-Trons will have a suite of optional driver assistance features that leverage three radar sensors (one in front, two in back), eight ultrasonic sensors, and five cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NSFZ4v"&gt;Those who don’t want to pay extra will still get features like a wireless charging pad for their smartphones, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Audi has also revamped the steering wheel in the new Q4s to include backlit touch surfaces and flat buttons for a sleeker look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="r1ElEB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Buyers will have to pony up to get the full suite of advanced tech features in the Q4&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TTmwNN"&gt;Audi found success with the original E-Tron, especially outside of the United States, despite its high price tag and unremarkable range. The company delivered &lt;a href="https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/press-releases/audi-ends-2020-with-the-most-successful-quarter-in-the-companys-history-13592"&gt;nearly 50,000 E-Trons and Sportback E-Trons in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, making it the second-best-selling EV in the larger Volkswagen Group’s stable last year behind the far-cheaper ID 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKSmvm"&gt;But the Q4 E-Tron and Q4 Sportback E-Tron are the German automaker’s best chance yet at going truly big in the electric vehicle space. By leveraging Volkswagen’s more efficient and more cost-effective MEB platform, Audi is ready to make a far more compelling pitch with these new EVs — one that will look all the more attractive as governments around the world continue to emphasize and incentivize a consumer shift to electric vehicles. It may still be far behind Tesla when it comes to total EV sales, but Audi’s not in bad shape to capitalize on the rise of electric vehicles considering its role &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/17/18187558/audi-charges-dieselgate-scandal-indictment-cheating"&gt;at the heart of the Dieselgate scandal just a few short years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apex Legends now has more than 100 million players</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pT-RpJCBqQrFc_n2CG49awYyFQU=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69125740/apex_legends_screenshot_season8_wargames_02_pathfinder_clean.jpg.adapt.1024w.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Respawn&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z5p5bV"&gt;Battle royale shooter &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; now has more than 100 million unique players globally, EA and Respawn announced on Wednesday. The free-to-play game surpassed the big milestone just over two years after its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/4/18209895/fortnite-apex-legends-respawn-ea-battle-royale-free-release-date-hands-on"&gt;February 2019 launch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUURTr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apex Legends’&lt;/em&gt; success is just the latest indication that free-to-play battle royale shooters remain very popular, despite the genre becoming quite crowded over the past couple of years. Activision’s &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; hit &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/08/04/call-of-duty-warzone-hits-75-million-downloads-in-less-than-5-months/"&gt;more than 75 million players last August&lt;/a&gt;, reaching that mark less than five months after its March 2020 launch. And Epic Games said that its smash hit &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; had an eye-popping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249497/fortnite-350-million-registered-players-hours-played-april"&gt;350 million registered players&lt;/a&gt; last May — presumably, that number has only climbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymjUTq"&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends’&lt;/em&gt; launch on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, Respawn has continued to add new content and updates to the game, and it even released a (&lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/steam-switch-launch-updates"&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323591/apex-legends-switch-port-cross-progression-purchases-fortnite"&gt;port to the Nintendo Switch in March&lt;/a&gt;. The game now has 16 playable characters, three different maps, and is currently in its eighth season.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin launches New Shepard again, with first crewed flight ‘soon’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/teDUeJAPnr3JLMAu3e1jk1YJk2w=/204x0:1578x916/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69125736/Screen_Shot_2021_04_14_at_12.57.45_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Blue Origin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RQyPOM"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin carried out another suborbital launch of its New Shepard rocket on Wednesday, testing its reusable booster and capsule system, which is designed to carry humans to the edge of space and back. Like the last 14 launches, no humans were aboard this time. But with an extensive pre-launch exercise with “stand-in astronauts” on Wednesday, the company indicated its first crewed flight may be around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcgRJE"&gt;The five-story-tall New Shepard rocket lifted off from Blue Origin’s test launch facilities in Van Horn, Texas, at 12:49PM ET on Wednesday. It soared roughly 65 miles above the ground before jettisoning its crew capsule, which sat atop the rocket booster carrying the company’s test dummy named “Mannequin Skywalker.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OOxtrzH6qS4iHx5eJxcuSoKmuL4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22443814/Apr_14_2021_13_05_12.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Blue Origin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;New Shepard lifts off&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CpAupu"&gt;“A beautiful launch and landing for both the crew capsule and the booster,” said Ariane Cornell, Blue Origin’s director of astronaut strategy and host for the mission’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=domwsgorRW0&amp;amp;ab_channel=BlueOrigin"&gt;live stream&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDP5U7"&gt;Parting with the capsule, the New Shepard booster fell back toward land and reignited its single BE-3 engine to touch down on a slab of concrete about two miles from its launchpad. Meanwhile, the crew capsule basked in roughly three minutes of weightlessness at the edge of space before making its own return roughly 10 minutes after liftoff. The capsule’s descent was soft, slowed by a set of three parachutes before hitting ground in Van Horn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDCUej"&gt;This NS-15 mission, Blue Origin said, was “a verification step for the vehicle and operations prior to flying astronauts.” A team of four company executives — or “stand-in astronauts” — rehearsed a number of pre-launch procedures on the launchpad before liftoff. That included walking up the New Shepard launch tower, boarding the capsule, closing its hatch, and testing communications with CAPCOM, or the Capsule Communicator who’d be in contact with the crew before and during flight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yPaQF"&gt;The employees left the capsule and departed the launchpad about 15 minutes before liftoff. The rehearsal team included Blue Origin’s vice president of sales Clay Mowry, VP of legal and compliance Audrey Powers, the “architect of New Shepard” Gary Lai, and Blue Origin CFO Susan Knapp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHX5hF"&gt;With these New Shepard launches, Blue Origin has been gradually testing new hardware tailored for flying humans. The last mission, NS-14 in January, included little screens and push-to-talk buttons for each of the capsule’s six passenger seats. That capsule also had upgraded “acoustics and temperature regulation” as well as microphones and speakers to “test a number of astronaut communication and safety alert systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQ1g7C"&gt;Blue Origin hasn’t said when exactly it’ll fly humans for the first time, and during the broadcast today, the company’s spokespeople only said that the first crewed flight would happen “soon.” The company, founded in 2000, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/blue-origin-launch-this-year-d2526213-80c3-435d-a89b-85e763833a52.html"&gt;hoped to launch&lt;/a&gt; humans for the first time before the end of 2020, but its launches &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509198/blue-origin-new-shepard-test-launch-nasa-payload-watch-live-time"&gt;last year were delayed&lt;/a&gt;. Blue Origin doesn’t appear to be in any rush, though. The company’s motto is “Gradatim Ferociter,” which is Latin for “step by step, ferociously.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GR69TQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdvQT1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ soundtrack has seven CDs’ worth of island vibes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="K.K. Slider" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6R7JrgRf8UdCEJsS18vOqCdVRic=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69125703/kksliderlede.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZcLtvu"&gt;You can put down your Switch, you can retire from &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, but you can never quite leave the island behind. Now, thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092DP9JFQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new a multi-CD imported soundtrack&lt;/a&gt; for the game, you won’t have to. With seven — yes, seven —  compact discs of &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; music, you can quite literally change your life’s theme music as often as it changes in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEEA9d"&gt;Seven CDs seems like a lot, but &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, like other &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; games before it, is almost constantly scored, with multiple variations of music in the game for every hour of the day (“3PM” fans, rise up), multiple locations, and weather conditions. The series’ music is one of the big reasons why it’s so beloved. Having a song for almost every situation only furthers the game’s “I could really stay here forever” power. That’s why Nintendo dropping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/5/15/21259948/animal-crossing-new-horizons-theme-song-nintendo-virtual-performance"&gt;a live version of the theme&lt;/a&gt; can be a little mini event in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GxH04E5rRgFTMJmU-6ZOv1-IXQQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22443578/71BdpRhKrEL._SL1366_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Columbia Japan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can own K.K. Slider’s entire discography AND the music for every hour of the day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9JqXnW"&gt;Details on the limited edition imported &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons &lt;/em&gt;soundtrack are slim, but referring to the image above, the complete package appears to come with seven CDs, custom albums to hold them, and what appears to be a K.K. Slider-themed headphone case&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The soundtrack &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092DP9JFQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is available for preorder&lt;/a&gt; now from Amazon with a current release date set for this Friday, April 16th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1p003t"&gt;Till then, join me in strolling your island (mentally) at precisely 3PM wherever you are.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL’s Fold ‘n Roll concept transforms a 6.87-inch phone into a 10-inch tablet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tvGy1RXa0aBF2FkOb_d4TjLdFVM=/179x0:1822x1095/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69125577/Fold__n_Roll_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL’s concept uses a folding hinge and extendable mechanism to expand from phone to tablet.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="csIn7W"&gt;TCL is once again teasing a foldable phone concept — and it’s a Frankenstein’s monster of some previously showcased flexible concepts. Called Fold ‘n Roll, it combines the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18237259/tcl-foldable-phone-prototype-video-dragonhinge-mwc-2019"&gt;“dragonhinge” technology&lt;/a&gt; with an extendable display panel. The result is a 6.87-inch phone that can expand to an 8.85-inch phablet size or fully extend to a 10-inch tablet. Outside of that, the company isn’t offering any other detailed information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P58r4i"&gt;TCL says it’s “still exploring the technical specifications” of this type of device, which doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence that the Fold n’ Roll will hit the market anytime soon. But TCL did say it plans to launch some kind of foldable phone before the end of 2021. The company has offered no shortage of foldable display concepts; most recently, it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;several to show off&lt;/a&gt; at this year’s virtual CES. But there’s a long distance between creating concepts and turning them into mass-market products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5Ha5Xj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10446091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fU3Lng"&gt;Still, TCL might be in a good position to address a gap in the rollable market: affordable devices. Flexing, rolling phones are mostly reserved for the high end of the market right now, and TCL may be well-positioned to offer a less costly option. Samsung has hinted at a lower-cost flexible device coming soon, but until then, its current &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt; options are still very pricey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrdhAn"&gt;LG’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;rollable concept&lt;/a&gt; may have been destined for a flagship device, but with the manufacturer’s exit from the smartphone business, we’ll never know if that tech might have trickled down to a midrange device. If it is TCL’s intention to offer something more affordable in the space, then there’s certainly some room to jump in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s latest batch of Switch indie games includes Fez and a sequel to Oxenfree</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PAOX5Wi8Ue466TDMel2ZCy4_AL4=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69125478/ss_38a73fa1ebe9fcf4f7c8ee3b80e5de067a6e8897.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fez.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XeSEkh"&gt;Nintendo broadcast its latest “Indie World Showcase” today, and the 20-minute event was pretty packed full of announcements for upcoming Switch games. There’s a good amount of variety, too: everything from fantastical skateboarding worlds to procedurally generated road trips to a puzzle classic that’s available later today. If you missed out on the presentation, here are the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oQb_9mRLI9qBnfMhubqyXYAA1xU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22443598/ss_33c4c5e2c578064942b6e32f7df4b57b9f4a066b.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Road 96.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="n7vf4a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Road 96&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pjpCld"&gt;Described as “a narrative-focused game with a mix of adventure, exploration, and puzzle-solving,” &lt;em&gt;Road 96&lt;/em&gt;’s story features procedurally generated elements, meaning no two road trips will be exactly alike, and choice will also play a big part in how it unfolds. It’s expected to launch on the Switch later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s due out this winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Gm9lEz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield &lt;/em&gt;is a runner, but one with an incredible amount of style. It takes place in a futuristic take on Detroit, one inspired in part by Tokyo, and it has a soundtrack that jumps between hip-hop and jazz. It’ll be available on the Switch starting on May 19th, with a demo out later today.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rMJGQz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Longing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ynNWxG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Longing&lt;/em&gt; is already &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/893850/THE_LONGING/"&gt;out on PC&lt;/a&gt;, but the Switch version — which is out today — gives a new audience a chance to experience this strange game that takes 400 real-world days to finish. Seriously. Here’s the basic premise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="QqS0aj"&gt;Play as a lonely Shade, the last servant of a king who once ruled an underground kingdom. The king’s powers have faded and he falls asleep for 400 days to regain his might. It is your duty to stay in the earthen palace until he awakens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fEAp1a"&gt;As soon as you start, the game inevitably counts down the 400 days: even when you stop playing and exit the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utgJeh"&gt;It is now up to you to decide what to do with your solitary existence beneath the soil. Don’t stress yourself, you have plenty of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jJbXW4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fez&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ehSvPd"&gt;One of the most influential indie games of all time, the perspective-shifting puzzle game &lt;em&gt;Fez&lt;/em&gt; is making its much-belated debut on the Switch. Even better: it’s out today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wBPZgcKvuzDw_8raRFUxae3ttvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22441917/ss_7ea63072f5d548b17d23cc0d5fd986092db40f5c.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last Stop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tGtmMi"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Hindsight&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Last Stop&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nyGbXV"&gt;Annapurna Interactive — a publisher with an incredible track record, thanks to games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/14/17007592/florence-iphone-ipad-review-monument-valley"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Florence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882183/sayonara-wild-hearts-interview-switch-ps4-apple-arcade-simogo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sayonara Wild Hearts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — revealed that two of its upcoming games are headed to the Switch. They include &lt;em&gt;Hindsight&lt;/em&gt;, a game about discovering memories through objects, and &lt;em&gt;Last Stop&lt;/em&gt;, the next release from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2016/9/22/13001942/virginia-game-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virginia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; studio Variable State. Both are expected to launch this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Assistant can now help order takeout from restaurants online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AI1RUPXflYoqEqzqSJ7UI1oMSiQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69125325/acastro_180510_1777_google_assistant_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A8hYPJ"&gt;The pandemic has made ordering restaurant takeout a little less of a guilty pleasure, both because it’s safer and it helps support local businesses. Google is now trying to make the process faster, too, by having Google Assistant fill in contact information and payment details automatically on Android phones after you find a restaurant via Google Search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hoS5q2"&gt;To use the new feature, you have to search for whatever restaurant you’d like to order from in the Google app, then select the “Order Online” button on the restaurant’s information card. After making your food selections, you can tag in Google Assistant to complete the order using your stored contact and payment information from Google Pay and Chrome Autofill. Assistant then confirms you’re ready to pay, and the order is placed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdAiSZ"&gt;There are also some big limitations to be aware of: Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Assistant will only be able to help with pickup orders for now, with deliveries coming at some point in the future. It also only works with restaurants Google has partnered with for online ordering, and it can only be initiated from the Google app on an Android phone. Google plans to add more restaurants in the US later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vvVlSP"&gt;Google claims &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17332070/google-assistant-makes-phone-call-demo-duplex-io-2018"&gt;Duplex&lt;/a&gt; is what powers this new takeout trick, which might seem unusual given the tech’s origins. Duplex was initially introduced as a way to automate making reservations and appointments over the phone, only to have the name later applied to automated form-filling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18531195/google-duplex-web-update-car-rentals-movie-tickets-io-2019"&gt;for online car rentals and movie ticket purchases&lt;/a&gt;. As what Google says Duplex does has expanded, voice has become less central, but the basic theme is still that it’ll handle some busywork automatically for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icrG6V"&gt;All of these newer Duplex features have less immediate wow-factor than the original phone reservation demo, but could be more convenient: parsing and filling out online forms is an all too common online activity, especially when dealing with a restaurant you might only order from once. Having Assistant do the busywork makes sense — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18538194/google-duplex-ai-restaurants-experiences-review-robocalls"&gt;is less creepy and confusing than a robotic phone call&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-sIieTv8iH8Z5lgEEJD8TP61Rwg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22442275/Find_my_iPhone_lifestyle.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Assistant’s “find my phone” notification will even work with iPhone’s as long as notifications are enabled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AtDHEg"&gt;Google also has a couple of other new Assistant features coming in the near term: Smart home automated routines that can be set to trigger at sunrise or sunset, and there’s a more useful “find my phone” feature for Apple devices, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRujDv"&gt;You’ve been able to ask a Google Home device to find find iPhones and iPads for a while now, but the feature didn’t work if the missing device was set to silent or didn’t have an internet connection. Now if you opt into receiving “notifications and critical alerts” from the Google Home app, Assistant can ring a missing Apple device even if it has Do Not Disturb turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpBko4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
