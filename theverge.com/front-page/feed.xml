&lt;p id="RwE26E"&gt;Security isn’t just about passwords and databases. It cuts down to the most basic questions of what we need to protect ourselves and the people we care about. So this week, we’re bringing you stories about how people protect themselves in the most extreme conditions — whether it’s Muslims navigating FBI surveillance or refugees trying to secure a working SIM card. There’s fun stuff too, like TikTok teens solving a mysterious car crash, but the overall message is clear: it’s rough out there, and you’ll need every trick you’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofxZY4"&gt;Still, it’s not all bad news. We’ll also be showing you some of our best advice on how to navigate your online life — whether it’s recovering your hacked Facebook account or hiding your email from data brokers. This isn’t quite as glamorous as fighting off ransomware, but we’re betting you’ll find it a whole lot more useful. These aren’t the skills you’ll need when things get serious, but they’re the kind of skills you need right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XV8tLb"&gt;Stay safe out there.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toshiba’s new 4K Fire TVs might beat out Amazon’s on picture quality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e18FtKfhGwC8FOEZgtNjSevenUU=/0x7:2687x1798/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234357/5BD114DD_2731_4221_9DC1_64B368AD1A62.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Toshiba&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6geeH2"&gt;One of Amazon’s Fire TV partners just announced a new model that might outshine the tech giant’s own self-branded TVs that launched only weeks ago. Today Toshiba is introducing the first Fire TV 4K TVs to feature local dimming, a backlight technology that produces improved contrast and black levels compared to the direct LED method used by cheaper sets and Amazon’s new Fire TV Omni series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CquKrK"&gt;Toshiba says the new M-Series contains “up to 48” dimming zones. The TV comes in 55, 65, and 75-inch screen sizes. So assuming that 48 number applies to the biggest model, it’s not exactly going to compete with high-end Vizios or TCLs, which pack more dimming zones into their backlighting systems, but it should still make for a significant improvement to overall picture quality. Despite including features like Dolby Vision on its largest-size Omni sets, Amazon didn’t built full-array local dimming into the devices. As the name suggests, local dimming allows the backlight to illuminate and dim at different areas of the display based on the content, so dark scenes appear the way they should without everything looking gray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVkRkv"&gt;The new M-Series Fire TVs from Toshiba also have a “120Hz native panel,” so I’ve asked whether this means they’ll indeed support more fluid gaming from the Xbox Series X, S, and PS5. The TVs will go on sale this month at Best Buy retail stores for $799.99 (55-inch), $999.99 (65-inch), or $1,199.99 (75-inch). One thing Toshiba’s sets share in common with the Omni line is that both have embedded microphones for hands-free Alexa voice commands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVfazK"&gt;Compared to Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22785648/amazon-fire-tv-omni-review-alexa"&gt;aggressively-priced Omni line&lt;/a&gt;, you’re definitely paying more for the “flagship” local dimming feature; a 65-inch Omni TV usually goes for $829.99, for example. Still, it’s good to see these improvements coming for TVs with Amazon’s software built in. As more sets with local dimming (and eventually maybe even Mini LED) are released, TCL’s higher-end Roku and Google TV sets might finally start to get some real competition from the other side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6Y34G"&gt;There’s obviously more to a TV than its backlighting, so I look forward to seeing a Toshiba M550KU TV in person to gauge where the overall viewing experience ranks for the price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to hide your email from data collectors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N5vhCl8EkWf647Uvjj0ykfT8Hjw=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234353/VRG_Illo_4902_Security_hide.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ori Toor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Preventing spam and tracking&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="xDVSsO"&gt;Nowadays, it seems like everyone on the web wants your email. When you give your email address to a site in order to log in or just get some info, many companies will take that as a free pass to do anything from relentlessly spamming you with newsletters to selling your email address to advertisers, who will in turn track you relentlessly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yE4nzG"&gt;Thankfully, there are also people building tools that can make things harder for the companies trying to get your email address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2Xnwz"&gt;There are two ways you can keep your real email address more private in different situations: relay services and temporary inboxes. By the time we’re done, you’ll hopefully be able to fill in fields asking for your email without worrying about who’s getting your “real” digital address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="te8KCq"&gt;Email relay services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WgI909"&gt;One way to keep your email address private and keep spam out of your inbox is by using an email relay service. The basic concept behind these services is that they generate a “virtual” email address you can give to apps and websites; any emails sent to that address will automatically get forwarded to your real inbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MyWIX"&gt;Many of these services will let you create and manage multiple aliases — for example, you could have one alias for all your newsletters, and another that you give out to shopping sites. With services that allow unlimited aliases, there’s nothing to stop you from creating a new one every time you give your email to a company, if you really want to make it difficult to aggregate your email presence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sIsJGz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Email relay services let you hide your personal email address and can make spam management a breeze&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aZPPMN"&gt;Another common feature these services provide is letting you turn off email forwarding, so that you won’t get any spam or other email from that site. Using our previous example, you could turn off forwarding when you use your shopping sites alias, keeping any tempting sales out of your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6dzyy"&gt;There’s no shortage of these relay services available, but we’ve rounded up a sampling of them that are either built into tools you may already have available, or that are well-regarded platform agnostics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6IoK1l"&gt;Apple’s Hide My Email / Sign In With Apple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxfduQ"&gt;If you use Apple devices, the company includes an email relay service called Hide My Email with its &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201318"&gt;paid iCloud Plus plans&lt;/a&gt;. If you have iCloud Plus and are using an Apple device, you should see a “Hide My Email” option pop up when you select the email field on a website’s signup page. Selecting the option will auto-generate a private email address for you, which will then be forwarded to the email address you use for your Apple account.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BNFs5RgBtUC3VWJc8-Qw9fV47bo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23029220/Screen_Shot_2021_11_19_at_18.17.59.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s iCloud Plus plans include an email forwarding service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="La38hT"&gt;You can also create a private email address outside of the signup process if you want to use it on a signup form for, say, a game console or an app on Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9w9cj"&gt;To do so using your iPhone or iPad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zwYO5a"&gt;Go to Settings and tap your name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="STfb6b"&gt;Go to iCloud &amp;gt; Hide My Email &amp;gt; Create New Address. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="xOHzaY"&gt;On a Mac: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zJHpdB"&gt;Go to System Preferences &amp;gt; Apple ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ghMnro"&gt;Select iCloud from the sidebar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mPVG2x"&gt;Click Options next to Hide My Email &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="twheUo"&gt;You can add a label and notes to help you remember what the address is for, and you can manage your existing email aliases from the Hide My Email screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o1TlLbzI5xiXff-za_tQIRc1BcE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23034814/Screen_Shot_2021_11_22_at_09.21.12.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes can help you remember what you’re using the alias for, making it easier to manage multiple ones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fvcpZK"&gt;While Hide My Email is only available via the paid iCloud Plus plan, you can also use a form of it for free with Apple’s Sign In with Apple service. On supported sites, you’ll see a Sign In with Apple button, which lets you use your Apple ID to set up and log into accounts. If you use Sign In, Apple also lets you hide your email address from the actual site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIUFex"&gt;To take advantage of this, when you’re setting up your account using Apple’s UI (it will pop up after hitting the “Continue with Apple” button that supported sites use), select the Hide My Email option instead of the Share My Email option. This will more or less work the same way as the paid service — Apple will give the website a randomly generated email address, and forward any email sent to it to the address associated with your Apple ID. Since you’ll be logging in using the Continue With Apple button, you won’t have to keep track of the private email address Apple generates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/305uez6zEoDPAGP69Q8KpTsrcPE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23029230/IMG_C7400B86A4E2_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Checking the Hide My Email option will have Apple forward you emails.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n7tFjO"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210426"&gt;manage the email settings for apps and services&lt;/a&gt; you use with Sign In with Apple from either a mobile device or a desktop.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mtxcR"&gt;To do so using iOS: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QH0H3B"&gt;Go to Settings and tap your name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lQpFme"&gt;Go to Password and Security &amp;gt; Apps Using Apple ID. (If you have iCloud Plus, go instead to iCloud &amp;gt; Hide My Email.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EgoTnT"&gt;To stop receiving emails from a service, tap its name, then turn off the Forward To toggle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="md3MIr"&gt;If you have iCloud Plus, this process will look slightly different. On iOS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yQAf7r"&gt;Go to Settings and tap your name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="X4mZaO"&gt;Go to iCloud &amp;gt; Hide My Email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ArnfYK"&gt;To stop receiving emails from a service, tap the service’s name and turn off the Forward To toggle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L7ZnN6uleqdizg2NsuQjMW-Pnxg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23037705/Screen_Shot_2021_11_23_at_09.31.59.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turning off email forwarding can be done on the Mac or iOS devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yhc9nZ"&gt;On a Mac, the process is the same whether or not you pay for iCloud Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="GSymut"&gt;Go to System Preferences &amp;gt; Apple ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0bOaoA"&gt;Select Password and Security from the sidebar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AONsbf"&gt;Click the Edit button next to Apps Using Apple ID, and select the app you want to change settings on from the sidebar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iuNYCm"&gt;If you’re using email forwarding, there will be a button labeled “Turn Off” in the Forward To section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FCpiiQ"&gt;You can also manage your email settings on the web by going to &lt;a href="http://appleid.apple.com"&gt;appleid.apple.com&lt;/a&gt;, clicking Sign In with Apple, selecting the app you want to manage, and clicking the Manage Settings button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="o7TjeI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://relay.firefox.com/"&gt;Firefox Relay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UCU1dhRjQghKwG9ftcBRDFJFPxM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23029844/Screen_Shot_2021_11_20_at_00.22.07.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firefox Relay may not be the most feature-rich option, but that makes it very easy to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o3hQLI"&gt;Firefox Relay is an alias service made by Mozilla, the same company behind the popular web browser. With the Firefox Relay extension installed in your Firefox browser, you get a button that’ll show up in email fields, letting you automatically generate an alias. The extension also provides a quick link to a settings page you can use to manage your aliases: turning them off or on, renaming them, or deleting them outright. You can also use the settings page to generate a new alias a la carte, and can access the page to view and manage your aliases on other browsers if you want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UeI2c4"&gt;One of the obvious advantages (assuming you’re a Firefox user) of Relay is that it’s tied to your Firefox account — that way, you can sign in once when you’re setting up a new device and get all your bookmarks, preferences, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325316/mozilla-vpn-android-windows-launch-firefox-private-network-price"&gt;VPN service&lt;/a&gt;, and email relay controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e9onHp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Relay’s free tier only allows five aliases&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XuzQgI"&gt;Unfortunately, its free tier is very limited — you can only have up to five aliases, so you’d very likely be using each alias as a category (shopping, social, etc) rather than assigning individual sites their own alias. You also can’t reply to the emails the service forwards to you using the free tier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="td7V6X"&gt;Mozilla has recently introduced a 99-cent-per-month premium tier, which lets you create as many aliases as you want, and reply to forwarded emails that are less than three months old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YX3a9m"&gt;You can read Firefox’s &lt;a href="https://relay.firefox.com/faq"&gt;FAQ about the service here&lt;/a&gt;. While Relay is not as feature-rich as the next service we’ll cover, it is by far one of the simplest options (if you’re a Firefox user, of course). Installing the extension is as simple as going to its page on the &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/private-relay/"&gt;Firefox add-on store&lt;/a&gt; and clicking install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="F7z8Ks"&gt;&lt;a href="https://anonaddy.com/"&gt;AnonAddy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HSZF43kCNuk6zYIrCAxHoWqqSOI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23029836/Screen_Shot_2021_11_19_at_23.47.14.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AnonAddy has a clean, simple dashboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Iofayk"&gt;AnonAddy is a web-based forwarding service that you can use with any device or browser. The free tier lets you create unlimited aliases and manage them however you need — you can deactivate an alias associated with any sites whose emails’ unsubscribe button doesn’t seem to do its job (or doesn’t exist at all), and enjoy not being bombarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hVYqig"&gt;A standout feature of AnonAddy is that you can have emails for a specific alias forward to multiple addresses (up to two using the free tier). This could be useful if, for example, you wanted to create a “bills” alias that you use for subscription services, and whose emails get sent to both you and a partner.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qp17lS90gP42h3OdjqqXK4kTSkA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23029835/Screen_Shot_2021_11_19_at_23.46.09.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AnonAddy puts a useful header above forwarded messages. You even get a link to deactivate the alias if you’re getting too much spam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AGnrxt"&gt;The free version of AnonAddy probably isn’t the best option if you expect to be getting a lot of media-heavy emails sent to your aliases — it has a 10MB a month limit, which is generous for text but could be eaten up quickly by pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbs4dh"&gt;AnonAddy has browser extensions for Firefox and Chrome-based browsers like Edge, Brave, and obviously Chrome (though sadly, it doesn’t offer one for Safari).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSajSZ"&gt;If you’ve got a lot of technical skill, you can also &lt;a href="https://anonaddy.com/self-hosting/"&gt;self-host AnonAddy&lt;/a&gt; on your own server. If you want to use an email aliasing system, but don’t want your emails being handled by someone else (or don’t want to pay a $1 per month fee for a 50MB bandwidth cap, or a $3 per month fee for unlimited data), the fact that you can roll your own AnonAddy instance makes it worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4cFiwS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://simplelogin.io/"&gt;SimpleLogin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l05W_IyAFGOBUog8LExXbghsUhA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23029842/Screen_Shot_2021_11_19_at_23.57.17.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can add a SimpleLogin alias with a single click of a button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zu6WZT"&gt;SimpleLogin is another project similar to AnonAddy, though there are different tradeoffs; for example, you get unlimited bandwidth with the free tier, but can only have up to 15 aliases. While it doesn’t have an easy way to replicate the multi-delivery setting of AnonAddy, it’s got tons of settings you can change, so if you’ve got very particular needs it may be the way to go. You can also self-host it, if you’re technically able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgk7FD"&gt;SimpleLogin also has iOS and Android apps for managing your aliases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lmemwl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-email-protection-beta/"&gt;DuckDuckGo Email Protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vqUK0DE73RxXDcmAnucRc-yt6IQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22764461/Email_Banner___static.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DuckDuckGo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DuckDuckGo’s email protection service is still in beta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NDfH4B"&gt;DuckDuckGo, the privacy-focused search provider, also has its own email relay service that you can set up using its mobile app. In addition to giving you an adorable “@duck.com” email address to use as an alias, the company also promises that its service will strip out trackers embedded in any emails it’s forwarding you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMDlW9"&gt;We have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22609841/duckduckgo-email-spam-prevent-trackers-how-to"&gt;a separate guide on how to use the service&lt;/a&gt;, but before you click over to it there are a few caveats to note. Email Protection is still in beta, so you might not want to use it for absolutely critical emails just yet. It’s also got a waitlist to join (DuckDuckGo says the wait time is “less than a month”), so it may not be the best option if you’re looking to start on this journey right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8cW3C1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698013/1password-hide-my-email-feature-fastmail-integration"&gt;1Password and Fastmail’s Masked Email&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KHh3Z2"&gt;If you subscribe to both 1Password and Fastmail, you can use your password manager to easily create new aliases using Fastmail’s built-in Masked Email feature. To start, go to Fastmail’s website and log in to your account. Then go to Settings and select Masked Email from the Account section in the sidebar. If you don’t use 1Password, you can use this screen to set up an alias (and manage existing ones) by clicking the New Masked Email Address button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqAl0O"&gt;To set up 1Password integration, click the Connect to 1Password button in Fastmail, and log into your account. You’ll then get prompts from both 1Password and Fastmail, asking you to confirm that you want your accounts connected, and you may need to enter your 1Password password one last time. Then your accounts will be linked, and the 1Password browser extension should start letting you create masked emails when you’re on a site’s signup page — unless you use Safari, but we’ll touch on that in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k8hFfwrIyHoMDREhM_Y-_O3qgI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23040565/Screen_Shot_2021_11_24_at_09.30.36.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clicking Create Masked Email will give you a popup showing the generated address.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WxxHXW"&gt;Now, clicking the Create Masked Email button in your browser’s iPassword extension will generate an alias for you. You can then click the “Fill Email” button to plug it into the signup form you’re filling out. Of course, 1Password will offer to save the login to your password manager, and generate a random password for your new account as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmJoOC"&gt;Unfortunately, this experience is a bit murky for Safari users. The 1Password app in the App Store includes a Safari extension, but it’s different from the one you’ll find for other browsers like Firefox and Chrome. Currently, it doesn’t support the Masked Email feature. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GJmxPP7dLEd2IyE4gS-p3nCE6pE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23040689/Screen_Shot_2021_11_24_at_10.01.34.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The default 1Password Safari extension doesn’t support Masked Email, but the alternate extension has some serious drawbacks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbbfcG"&gt;You can, however, download the separate &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/1password-for-safari/id1569813296?mt=12"&gt;1Password for Safari extension&lt;/a&gt; from the Mac App Store. After installing it, you’ll have to enable it by going to Safari &amp;gt; Preferences &amp;gt; Extensions and checking the box next to 1Password for Safari (and unchecking the box next to regular 1Password, or else they’ll fight). This method does have some serious drawbacks; 1Password for Safari doesn’t integrate with the current Mac desktop app, so you can’t unlock it with Touch ID. 1Password &lt;a href="https://1password.community/discussion/123766/trying-to-make-masked-email-work"&gt;says this should be changing in the future&lt;/a&gt;, but for right now you may just want to go with another solution if you use Safari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="py07wj"&gt;Use a temporary burner email&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n5umNBCM-OWfRITStq9EM2s5I_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23029068/Screen_Shot_2021_11_19_at_17.16.50.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Temporary email services are good for situations where you only need to receive an email from a sender once.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nZUxDW"&gt;There are some times when you really only need to receive an email or two from a site — say, it wants to send you a confirmation code, or it stubbornly insists that you enter your email to get results instead of just showing them to you. In those cases, instead of spinning up an entire new alias, you could use a temporary email service like &lt;a href="http://guerrillamail.com/"&gt;GuerrillaMail&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://temp-mail.org/en/"&gt;TempMail&lt;/a&gt;. These services do what they say on the tin — provide you with a temporary email address that you can use to receive one or two messages, and then never think about again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxjnY4"&gt;In my experience, some sites may try to keep you from using a temporary email address, saying that they’re invalid. Usually that’s not a great sign, but you can sometimes get around it by trying a different service — if the signup form blocks &lt;a href="https://10minutemail.com"&gt;10MinuteMail&lt;/a&gt;, you could try &lt;a href="https://www.emailondeck.com"&gt;EmailOnDeck&lt;/a&gt;, or vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNS8Q7"&gt;While these methods are helpful for new services, if you want to keep people who already have your email address from tracking you, you can check out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22288190/email-pixel-trackers-how-to-stop-images-automatic-download"&gt;guide to blocking tracking pixels&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxugWE"&gt;We’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/3/6100893/how-to-make-your-email-address-as-hard-to-guess-as-your-password"&gt;also written before&lt;/a&gt; about Gmail’s built-in alias-like system, where you can give companies your Gmail address with a plus sign and ID tacked onto the end; something like “MyEmailAddress+amazonaccount@gmail.com.” The emails will still show up in your MyEmailAddress inbox, and it could make it more difficult for hackers that obtain one of your logins to guess others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMyOSg"&gt;However, we wouldn’t recommend it if you’re concerned about privacy. While it could currently help prevent companies from automatically aggregating your footprint, you are still giving them your base email address — it would be trivial to have tracking systems filter out the plus symbol and extra info after it, if enough people start using this trick. Thankfully, plenty of the options above should help you get some email privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite campaign review: playing the hits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t9_NA-FasuoM3TpfsaUiMAiTaWs=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234298/HaloInfinite_Campaign01_3840x2160_WM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Infinite in name, not quite yet in scope&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ufl18l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s campaign has been a long time coming, and yet it’s been hard to know what to expect from it. Developer 343 Industries has described &lt;em&gt;Infinite &lt;/em&gt;as “the start of our platform for the future” and “the start of the next 10 years for &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;.” But after a notoriously poor demonstration last year prompted a delay into this one, Microsoft has shown very little of what’s intended to be a crucial entry in its best-known series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcYo0j"&gt;At the same time, the multiplayer portion of the game has already been released for free. You’ll be able to play &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s campaign on Game Pass, sure, but this was already a series where interest heavily skewed toward multiplayer, and now the only part of the game Microsoft is directly charging for is the single-player mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9OQYM"&gt;What, exactly, are you getting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGuS1T"&gt;It turns out the answer is… pretty much another &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; campaign. It’s clear that 343 is using &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt; as a soft reboot in an attempt to bring the series back to broader relevance, and it features the most radical changes to the core &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; design since the original game. At the same time, &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is almost explicitly a throwback to the series’ earlier days — it feels like it was designed to win back people turned off by the aesthetic and narrative left turns of 343’s &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;5&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DzQ5S4LIaYOpJN9VNXTs093A_44=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23066589/hi_mar_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ftAPUR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; begins in an uncharacteristic situation for the series’ iconic protagonist Master Chief: defeat. Floating in space after an encounter with a leader of the Banished — essentially a coalition of bad guys from alien races found in the early &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; games — he’s picked up by an unsuspecting pilot and ends up exploring an uncharted &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; ringworld in an effort to gain ground and fight back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="usrlZY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s easy to get the sense that ‘Halo’ is back to its best&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5y8QnC"&gt;Despite appearances, &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is not really an open-world game. At certain points in the campaign, you do have a lot of freedom to roam Zeta Halo, the new ring, and there are side quests dotted around the map. You can discover items that let you upgrade your equipment, and various optional actions in the world earn you “valor” that can be used to call in for reinforcements. But these moments are sectioned off by the story, and there’s no sense of a singular world that you ever get to explore. Zeta Halo feels more like the incidental hub areas &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20848867/gears-5-review-pc-xbox-one-release-date"&gt;introduced in &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than a genuinely open game, and there’s very little visual diversity. Like the original &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, you will also spend a lot of your time roving around neon blue underground corridors fighting endless waves of enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8If7Q6"&gt;To be clear, this isn’t a big problem, because &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; plays incredibly well. &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; never needed an open world to give you a sense of freedom and creativity with its combat, and that’s even more true with &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. The addition of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22789035/halo-infinite-campaign-preview"&gt;the Grappleshot&lt;/a&gt;, a grappling hook tool that lets you zip around the environments with abandon, is transformative and brings&lt;em&gt; Halo&lt;/em&gt; right up to date with more recent first-person shooters that prioritize the joy of movement. And the more open design, at least for missions situated outside, gives you plenty of freedom to approach them the way you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zuX8AS"&gt;There’s a mission called “The Sequence” midway through the game that’s the perfect example. Ultimately, it’s a simple design — you need to activate four separate buildings to get access to the one you’re coming from. But they’re all several kilometers away from each other, and you have to improvise how to get there. In my case, that meant hijacking various vehicles and getting back to my starting point in a Banshee, a small alien flying craft that was close to exploding. At its highest moments, &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; evokes and elevates the blueprint set by classic missions like “The Silent Cartographer” to a whole new level of freedom. Combined with a colorful art style and environmental design more reminiscent of the earlier games, it’s easy to get the sense that &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; is back to its best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sL0qZ4k7Wb0bpV52dPxm6bzI9ec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23066590/hi_mar_8.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8zCIZj"&gt;The side quests are essentially just enemy bases with more aliens to shoot, but they do at least give you something to think about when traversing the landscape. &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; has always best played to its strengths when its combat opens up to wider environments, and Infinite takes that idea even further, enabling much more flexibility in how you take on your objectives. Unfortunately, too much of the campaign is spent in narrow, repetitive indoor settings. It’s not like the combat isn’t still fun, but frankly these sections can sometimes feel like filler given the promise of how well the game plays outdoors. You will spend far too much time in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; looking for batteries to plug into terminals in order to open doors, which is pretty much all the game ever asks you to do inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vH06Hw"&gt;One of the biggest criticisms of &lt;em&gt;Halo 5&lt;/em&gt;’s campaign was the repeated boss battles against the Warden Eternal, which felt punishing and tedious. &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt; has a lot of boss fights, but it feels like 343 put in serious effort to make them more interesting than &lt;em&gt;Halo 5&lt;/em&gt;’s. The battles are well-designed and often require you to make use of recently unlocked abilities or weapons, which is a big improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2pqTG"&gt;But Infinite can’t fully escape &lt;em&gt;Halo 5&lt;/em&gt; in other areas. While the narrative is seemingly designed to bring in players less familiar with &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;’s complex lore by shaking up the setting, the fallout from the previous game’s big twist ultimately ends up driving the plot, and that’s where &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt; loses me. This is by no means a game where you have to care about the story in order to enjoy it, but even as a fan of the series myself, it does feel like it was written more for die-hards than newcomers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VbRsuY6zJmg7dAhNIV8TBwAE7n4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23066591/HaloInfinite_Campaign04_3840x2160_WM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qHAzwA"&gt;That’s the thing about &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. It’s the best &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; has been in a long time, but it could easily have been called &lt;em&gt;Halo 6&lt;/em&gt;. There are clear possibilities for potential expansion down the line, of course, and what’s already here will be very replayable. (It’s worth noting here that the campaign won’t be playable in co-op until at least May next year). I do plan on getting around to the side quests I didn’t finish before, which should at least be more of a varied experience than running through “The Silent Cartographer” for the 300th time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kk5HHW"&gt;But while there’s a lot to this &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, its scope is far from infinite. This isn’t really a game like &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt; where even though it was lacking in content at launch, I’d still feel that urge to replay missions and grind endlessly to make progress. It’s also not a huge open-world game that will take dozens of hours to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="yEsdBb"&gt;343 Industries has laid some really solid groundwork here and deserves a lot of credit for managing to modernize the series while focusing on what people loved most about it. At this point, though, it’s not so much a reinvention as simply a very good &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54LR6f"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;’s campaign will be available on Wednesday, December 8th for Xbox One consoles, Xbox Series consoles, Windows, and Steam. Microsoft provided &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Verge &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;with early access to the campaign for review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok drama channels are turning into online intelligence agents</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new class of creators is using OSINT techniques to solve online mysteries&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="J0o9gb"&gt;In October, a TikTok user named Matthew Heller posted a video recorded moments after a small traffic accident at a Florida intersection. In the video, a woman named Maddy Gilsoul comes up to the window of Heller’s car and starts screaming at him. Heller captioned the video, “I got hit from behind. My car was hit from behind while I was stopped. #lamborghini #aventador #hornblasters.” The original video has since been deleted from TikTok, but Heller left a version of it up &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CUnGM4gKjwd/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"&gt;on his Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnpyQa"&gt;In a world without TikTok, the incident would have remained a small but contentious traffic accident, the fault of which would have been determined by insurance companies. Instead, thousands of users on the shortform video app argued about who was to blame. Was it Gilsoul, who, according to Heller’s video, seemed to have clearly clipped the back of Heller’s Lamborghini? Or was Heller at fault? At one point in the “news cycle,” TikTok users accused him of “gaslighting” them, after new footage surfaced from a nearby security camera that seemed to show him hitting Gilsoul first. Or was this incident even real? Heller appeared to be the founder of a company called &lt;a href="https://hornblasters.com/"&gt;HornBlasters&lt;/a&gt;, which sells custom car horns. A car horn salesman suddenly finds himself at the center of a viral traffic accident? It all seemed too perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hVgKrx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Young users pore over random trending videos, constructing elaborate conspiracy theories&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GolGwj"&gt;As the numbers on Heller’s video began to climb into the millions, TikTok’s army of commentators rushed into the trending topic to debate and analyze what was happening. A TikToker named @ugolord, who calls himself “The TikTok Attorney,” &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ugolord/video/7016060242303683846"&gt;asked his followers&lt;/a&gt; to watch the footage of the accident and decide who was liable. A user named @pushpeksidhu from Toronto &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pushpeksidhu/video/7015995807971216646"&gt;posted an update&lt;/a&gt; on the accident that was watched half a million times, sharing footage from Gilsoul’s account that users hadn’t seen yet, seemingly proving Heller was at fault. A user who goes by @doctor.ryan &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@doctor.ryan/video/7015897477412932869"&gt;made another video&lt;/a&gt; combining Heller’s account with the new security camera footage for a definitive look at the whole scandal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVwV21"&gt;Drama-reaction accounts like these are riding a huge wave of popularity right now, thanks to an obsession within the TikTok community with investigating, analyzing, and passing judgment on the content going viral on the platform. The app’s young users pore over random trending videos, constructing elaborate conspiracy theories and even doxxing the people featured in them. Most often, these campaigns to unmask other users are driven by some sense of justice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YXza9S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A teenage version of the OSINT community&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E2OBdG"&gt;In each of these instances, the app’s aggressive recommendation algorithm awakens, pushing the controversies to millions of users, generating hundreds of videos, thousands of comments, and too many views to count. The app has become home to a teenage version of the OSINT (or “open source intelligence”) community, made famous by outlets like the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFR Lab) or investigative site &lt;em&gt;Bellingcat&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5U2ANw"&gt;The biggest account weighing in on the “Lambo crash” trending topic was @TizzyEnt, an account with 3.8 million followers run by a film director named Michael Mc. During the course of the Lamborghini content cycle, Mc posted several updates, at one point even &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/foryou?is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;item_id=7016417722649087238&amp;amp;lang=en#/@tizzyent/video/7016417722649087238"&gt;connecting with Heller&lt;/a&gt; and sharing additional details about what happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvGwPt"&gt;If you’re on TikTok, you’ve no doubt seen Mc’s videos. On an app defined by permanently teenage Hype House dancers, Mc’s graying beard and low baritone voice definitely stand out, as does his presentation style. He specializes in what right-wingers might call “cancel culture” or what mainstream journalists might call “internet drama.” He’s part of a network of popular TikTok users who have risen to prominence thanks to the TikTok community’s current fixation on crowdsourced investigations into matters both real and conspiratorial or imaginary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37RuA5"&gt;Mc and his collaborators unmask racists, report anti-vax nurses to their respective hospitals, and help “cancel” members of TikTok’s rogues’ gallery of conspiracy theory truthers, fascists, and viral main characters. But with a massive young audience hungry for accountability, or more accurately, viral justice, these TikTokers are finding there is a fine line between citizen journalism and vigilante information warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="ytL7hz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mc and Paterno spent days locked in a feud, dueting videos with each other&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7gi4ow"&gt;In the case of the Lamborghini saga, TikTok users drew lines and took the side of either Heller or Gilsoul, flooding their accounts with nasty comments. Heller’s TikTok account is no longer active and Gilsoul hasn’t posted since October. But this kind of work can get much more intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbyC9Y"&gt;Shortly before Mc waded into the Lamborghini drama, he &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tizzyent/video/7011258812845788421?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;led a campaign&lt;/a&gt; against a FedEx delivery driver named Vincent Paterno, who claimed in a TikTok video that he would not deliver packages to any homes without an American flag or with a Biden/Harris sign in the front yard. Mc posted Paterno’s Facebook page on TikTok and said he would be reporting him to FedEx. Then Mc and Paterno spent days locked in a feud, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tizzyent/video/7011657306534399237?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;dueting&lt;/a&gt; videos with each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OS3Ddk"&gt;“You’re such a piece of shit,” Mc says in one video. “Do you know your wife messaged me to tell me how she and her children do not agree with you? How she begged you not to post this? And now you’ve posted a second time — and she’s getting threats, by the way.” Then Mc scolds his own audience for sending threats to Paterno and his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UomuRL"&gt;The whole episode ended with Paterno &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/09/27/fedex-driver-fired-after-not-delivering-to-biden-supporters/"&gt;reportedly getting fired&lt;/a&gt; from FedEx. In a final update, Mc &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tizzyent/video/7012747260199030021?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;jokingly threatens&lt;/a&gt; to brand “@tizzyent” on Paterno’s back. This kind of content is far from anything you’re going to get on a mainstream media outlet — maybe on Substack — but Mc’s audience can’t get enough of it, flooding his comment section with tips for more video investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WB5c8y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I look at the internet like one giant small town”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dmeCOI"&gt;Mc told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he’s trying to bring some accountability back to how people behave on the internet. He isn’t actively trying to get people fired — though he does, and isn’t quiet about it on his account when it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37bSqx"&gt;“There’s an old expression that ‘bad gas travels fast in a small town.’ If you live in a small town and you do something terrible, everyone knows about it,” he said. “I look at the internet like one giant small town in the sense of: If I put something out there, my objective is not to get someone fired unless their job is directly harming people. So like a nurse refusing to get vaccinated. She could be infecting people. That’s a thing. Or a police officer harming people. That’s the thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlgQEo"&gt;According to Mc, he started out making videos just trying to debunk misinformation and conspiracy theories that came across his For You page, the central feed where TikTok users see content recommended to them. He said earlier this year, as America began its vaccine rollout, the app became inundated with anti-vax content. In August, a user sent him a video of a woman who went by @antivaxmomma, who was bragging about selling fake vaccination cards on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9MBP5"&gt;“[Users] find someone doing that sort of thing, and they don’t know how to deal with it themselves,” he said. “They reach out to people like me, and go, ‘Hey, can you see what this person is doing? Can you help with this kind of thing?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DGrnHl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The algorithm kind of promotes tribalism”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JpaGAx"&gt;Mc and the network of other TikTokers he works with sprang into action, identifying the woman as Jasmine Clifford, who &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-coronavirus-pandemic-c14ce28edda2593b0b3819acec97089e"&gt;was then charged&lt;/a&gt; by law enforcement with conspiracy, and offering and possession of a forged instrument. According to Mc, his regular collaborators include &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/online-sleuth-danesh-thatdaneshguy-tiktok-anti-vaxxers"&gt;@ThatDaneshGuy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.dailydot.com/irl/aunt-karen-white-lives-matter-facebook/"&gt;@auntkaren0&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/she-called-out-health-care-misinfo-tiktok-then-trolls-found-n1265011"&gt;@rx0rcist&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom who have made headlines in the last few months for their flashy videos exposing and publicly shaming various villains within the progressive-leaning world of TikTok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGElj9"&gt;There is a feeling, one Mc shares, among many long-time TikTok users that individual accounts have to step up and personally deal with the app’s rampant misinformation, extremism, and conspiracy theories. As Mc sees it, his account wouldn’t need to exist if TikTok actually moderated its platform properly. “The algorithm kind of promotes tribalism,” he said. “You get inside of the bubble when you start believing that your perspective is the only one that matters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3NYy0o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Something fundamentally changed in this work about 10 years ago”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qXjSvG"&gt;But the videos these users post are a tightrope walk of investigative journalism, punditry, and open source intelligence that could easily fall into the same trap as Reddit’s libelous and disastrous &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-22263020"&gt;r/FindTheBostonBomber experiment&lt;/a&gt;. But according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/etbrooking"&gt;Emerson T. Brooking&lt;/a&gt;, a resident senior fellow at the DFR Lab, we are well past the point where journalistic institutions can decide who can and cannot conduct OSINT research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDHm0A"&gt;“I’m not gonna position myself as a legacy gatekeeper; I think something fundamentally changed in this work about 10 years ago,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “You need to use communities and enthusiasm to try to accomplish some good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdSYq9"&gt;Brooking clarified, though, that performing this kind of work out in the open — or at least on an app like TikTok, which has a trending topic-focused algorithm that blurs together responsible TikTokers like Mc and more rogue accounts that are doing it for clout — could easily spin out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2CyNG"&gt;“If you look into how &lt;em&gt;Bellingcat&lt;/em&gt; is structured,” Brooking said, “whether their most famous, prominent analysts have this public presence, they’re doing their work on a Slack channel, actually. They’re not doing every bit of it on Twitter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsuWOL"&gt;Making things even more confusing is when large media organizations begin to weigh in on these fairly low-level TikTok dramas. Being the subject of a TikTok spat is one thing, but it’s another to elevate it into a news story and turn a local incident into international headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="xsd9J3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think I’m gonna have to start saying in every video, ‘Hey, don’t, don’t threaten them’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qseBdn"&gt;Both Mc and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sophiasgaler"&gt;Sophia Smith Galer&lt;/a&gt;, a London-based senior news reporter for &lt;em&gt;VICE &lt;/em&gt;who also runs a personal TikTok account with over 275,000 followers, said traditional media has a habit of turning the volume up on these minor naming-and-shaming campaigns happening on TikTok. Smith Galer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the media often legitimizes the vigilante justice being carried out by random TikTok users when they turn these viral scandals into news stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWc3fv"&gt;“We saw this with the rush to cover TikTok users investigating the disappearance of Gabby Petito, or the reporting around TikTok users erroneously claiming that a furniture company was somehow trafficking children during the US presidential election,” she said. “TikTok users overanalyzing videos going viral on the app is nothing new.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYWfFC"&gt;During Mc’s crusade against Paterno, the FedEx driver, the two men traded barbs across their social media platforms and Mc did share Paterno’s Facebook information and reported Paterno to FedEx. But the ensuing media swarm, kicked off by &lt;a href="https://toofab.com/2021/09/24/fedex-fires-driver-who-refused-to-deliver-to-homes-with-biden-or-camel-toe-harris-flags/"&gt;this article from &lt;em&gt;TooFab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, brought the story to a national stage, eventually getting coverage &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/09/27/fedex-driver-fired-after-not-delivering-to-biden-supporters/"&gt;in the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Paterno is still on TikTok, by the way, where he’s now &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vincentmrworldwid/video/7029130139740982574?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;posting anti-vax content&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YL0WG7"&gt;But according to Smith Galer, when mainstream media outlets cover these stories, the more responsible users like Mc, the genuinely nefarious bad actors spreading disinformation, and just the random shitposters get swirled together into a trend that typically makes the chaos on TikTok worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJHFTT"&gt;Like Brooking, Smith Galer sees the current wave of amateur OSINT happening on TikTok as a net positive, but also a recipe for chaos. There &lt;a href="https://wallaroomedia.com/blog/social-media/tiktok-statistics/#:~:text=U.S.%20Audience%20%E2%80%93%20As%20we%20mentioned,between%20the%20ages%2025%2D44."&gt;are currently&lt;/a&gt; around 80 million active users on TikTok in America, but &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095186/tiktok-us-users-age/"&gt;Statista estimates&lt;/a&gt; that roughly a quarter of those users are between ages 10-19. That is a lot of children learning how to doxx each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RewUGY"&gt;“What’s fun about all of these is how they are universalizing OSINT skills, but what is not fun about all of these is the lack of media literacy and the innocence in which content creators commit contempt of court, libel, or spread harmful misinformation,” Smith Galer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPVAGt"&gt;And this is the central dynamic Mc said he’s been struggling with recently. He said he was committed to using his TikTok account to exposing various bad actors, but he has noticed that, regardless of how even-keeled his presentation style is, his followers — or users who find his videos in their For You pages — aren’t as interested in making sure things are done the right way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tvlBc1"&gt;“I think I’m gonna have to start saying in every video, ‘Hey, don’t, don’t threaten them. No death threats, no violence.’ If you want to write to someone’s employer and say you don’t like what that employee did, that’s your prerogative to do that. But no, you calling an oncology department and saying, ‘I’ll kill all of you’ — I don’t believe that my followers did that,” he said. “But I’m still going to put it out there just in case any of my followers get really upset about something or someone who sees one of my videos.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Should abuse survivors have to disappear from the internet?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0HuuxyN84x0LuXc6WEvcb0BFtkM=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234086/VRG_Illo_4902_Security_Abuse.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ori Toor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Some survivors are challenging the conventional wisdom about how to stay safe online&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="GIVsoL"&gt;For more than two decades, Lorraine* has known her ex-boyfriend is watching her. She cut contact with him 20 years ago, but in Facebook posts and intimidating emails, he makes sure she knows he’s still keeping tabs, from the birth of her children to her most recent wedding anniversary. After years of abuse that resulted in a PTSD diagnosis and intense nightmares, the notes are chilling, and make her uncomfortable putting any personal information in an online space where he could see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83wubm"&gt;“It’s affected my relationship with my friends,” Lorraine says. “It’s affected my relationship with my partner. It’s affected my ability to feel safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D86rJm"&gt;The advice many survivors like Lorraine receive when they look for help is to leave their online life behind and delete themselves from the internet entirely. There are many tutorials on how to delete your online presence. Given how often abusers use digital channels to harass their targets, erasing yourself can seem like the obvious choice. But interpersonal abuse thrives on the alienation of its victims, and some kind of online presence can be a crucial lifeline for people trying to escape their abusers and rebuild a new life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y52Qp0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s easy to think you need to disappear, but you don’t need to.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SvgytB"&gt;Tony Hunt, chief development officer of Operation Safe Escape, a nonprofit organization that helps victims of domestic violence escape their abusers, says deleting yourself from the internet could be exactly what the stalker wants. “It’s about control, they want to isolate you because that gives them absolute control over everything you do,” Hunt explained. “It’s easy to think you need to disappear, but you don’t need to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="py1LZT"&gt;It’s an urgent question for thousands of people quietly struggling with domestic violence. One in four women and one in nine men will experience severe intimate partner physical violence at some point in their lives, &lt;a href="https://ncadv.org/statistics"&gt;according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence&lt;/a&gt;. One in seven women and one in 18 men have been stalked by an intimate partner during their lifetime, to a point where they felt very fearful or believed that they or someone close to them would be harmed or killed. &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0886260515614283"&gt;A 2015 survey&lt;/a&gt; of college students found that nearly 75 percent had experienced some kind of tech-assisted intimate partner victimization in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkrBI2"&gt;For Lorraine, deleting herself from the internet didn’t feel like a solution. “It felt like I was removing my online liberty because of someone else’s abuse,” she said. “Both my husband and I have worked in various countries, so social media is brilliant for keeping in contact with people that we rarely see. We wouldn’t want to lose that ability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lcQrLi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It felt like I was removing my online liberty because of someone else’s abuse.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b9nglq"&gt;Julia’s* ex-partner surveilled her even when they were together and continued to do so after they had broken up, which made online spaces particularly dangerous. But instead of retreating, the threat inspired her to learn more about internet security, and to be more careful with how and where she logged on. For her, &lt;a href="https://goaskrose.com/guide-secure-comms/"&gt;establishing safe communications with trusted people&lt;/a&gt; was particularly essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Hai0I"&gt;“An abusive relationship is already devastating, and shrinking afterwards adds to the devastation,” Julia said. “We can develop intentional boundaries on the internet, it doesn’t have to be all or nothing. It was better for me to learn more about internet security, privacy, and different tools stalkers can use than retreating, because that knowledge empowered me to have a more realistic sense of what is possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKlBQ8"&gt;Some survivors also worry that disappearing entirely will escalate the situation, according to University of Kentucky professor &lt;a href="https://behavioralscience.med.uky.edu/users/tklogan#profileTab4"&gt;TK Logan&lt;/a&gt;, who researches cyberstalking. “I’ve had victims say, he was threatening me and doing all this stuff through social media so I got off social media,” she explained. “And now all the survivor can think about is, ‘Oh, my God, what is he doing? Is he just going to show up physically?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bpPHgu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If the abuser has the right tools and he has physical access to the device, in 30 to 60 seconds there’s a lot he can do.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="07EE2c"&gt;Hunt frames the security measures survivors should employ as a new kind of lifestyle where survivors are intentional about their online presence, rather than a disappearing act. “The priority is making sure that nobody’s advertising everything about their personal lives,” he said. “Because [the abuser] will have something that will give them access to the kids or their location or their regimen throughout the day. Once you’ve established those boundaries and you start living your life again, you’ll be glad you did it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJyl6K"&gt;Though Operation Safe Escape trains survivors on more general security protocols rather than only focusing on online security, Hunt says technology-facilitated abuse comes up often. Part of the organization’s job, in partnership with the Coalition Against Stalkerware, is to identify developers that claim their software is for law enforcement, but actually sell their products to individuals looking to coerce and control their victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVsO6Q"&gt;“What happens is, you have boyfriends who will pay contractors to install a keylogger on their girlfriend’s computer, and all of a sudden, a whole new world opens up,” Hunt said. “If the abuser has the right tools and he has physical access to the device, in 30 to 60 seconds there’s a lot he can do.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFBWbV"&gt;With regard to these higher-level security threats that include hacking and surveillance, Hunt recommends survivors get directly in contact with &lt;a href="https://safeescape.org/help/"&gt;Operation Safe Escape&lt;/a&gt; so they can be guided on what options they have to leave safely and regain their life and autonomy. “We are really selective about who we work with and how much information we put out there,” Hunt explained. “Once that information is out there, guess who tries to use it against survivors?” Logan also recommends setting up multiple-factor authentication, and directs survivors to the &lt;a href="https://ukcdar.uky.edu/cdarlime25/index.php/survey/index/sid/57925/newtest/Y/lang/en"&gt;Stalking and Harassment Assessment &amp;amp; Risk Profile (SHARP) tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JfXDe"&gt;The most reliable way to detect stalkerware on an Android device is to run an antivirus app and do a scan. For iOS users, Apple provides a &lt;a href="https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1976/en_US/device-and-data-access-when-personal-safety-is-at-risk.pdf"&gt;step-by-step&lt;/a&gt; guide for detecting invasive apps. The &lt;a href="https://stopstalkerware.org/information-for-survivors/"&gt;Coalition Against Stalkerware also recommends&lt;/a&gt; that potential victims keep a log of what they are experiencing, to help detect patterns and show the history of what has been happening if they choose to get help from law enforcement or a survivor assistance charity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQDHHb"&gt;But even given the threat of malicious software, the most effective protections still rely on a strong support network, which is much easier to build when you’re connected. “The goal is to put up as many barriers, make it as difficult as possible for the stalker,” says Logan, “and then the other step is to get support.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5Zuaw"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Some names have been changed to protect sources who have been targeted by abuse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is fighting Russian regulator’s demands on alternative app payments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SUUtKRbOpZjwnXWJ2gxbQ8gU0X4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70233966/acastro_180130_1777_0005_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IUbSSC"&gt;Apple is challenging antitrust action taken by Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), which wants iOS developers to be able to tell customers about alternatives to Apple’s in-app payment option, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-starts-legal-action-against-russian-regulator-app-store-dispute-ria-2021-12-06/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Apple wants a judicial review of the regulator’s warning, &lt;a href="https://www.rt.com/business/542257-apple-takes-russia-court/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russia Today&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally issued with a &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.ru/tekhnologii/438557-fas-predupredila-apple-iz-za-zapreta-soobsat-o-vozmoznosti-oplaty-vne-app-store"&gt;deadline of September 30th&lt;/a&gt; for the US tech giant to change its anti-steering policies. When Apple didn’t comply, FAS announced it was opening an antitrust case against the company &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-opens-case-against-apple-over-app-store-payment-restrictions-2021-10-27/"&gt;at the end of October&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgnoWb"&gt;The US tech giant’s policies on in-app payments are contentious, to say the very least. Apple requires iOS developers to use its own in-app payment system, which in many cases allows it to collect up to a lucrative 30 percent commission on any purchases. Not only does Apple ban developers from allowing third-party payment methods in their apps, it even limits their ability to tell customers when they accept alternative payment methods elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zkRd5p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;FAS is accusing Apple of “abusing its dominant position”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="50iGGg"&gt;It’s this policy that FAS is specifically objecting to. In an announcement at the &lt;a href="http://en.fas.gov.ru/press-center/news/detail.html?id=55296"&gt;end of October&lt;/a&gt;, the regulator said Apple was “abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of apps through its App Store” by not allowing developers to tell “in-app users about the possibility [of paying] for their purchases outside the App Store.” Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PuC9iZ"&gt;In August, in response to a class-action lawsuit, Apple said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;“clarifying” its policies&lt;/a&gt; about developers telling customers about alternative payment methods. It said that developers could use communications like emails to share information with customers about alternative payment methods. However, it stopped short of letting developers do this inside apps themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ntm1kO"&gt;Apple’s App Store policies are facing pushback around the world. In the US, the judge in Apple’s legal battle with Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;ordered the company to allow iOS apps&lt;/a&gt; to direct users to alternative payment options, and gave the company a deadline of December 9th to comply. Meanwhile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;lawmakers in South Korea passed a bill&lt;/a&gt; in late August banning platform holders like Google and Apple from limiting developers to using their first-party payment systems. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;European Commission has also issued antitrust charges&lt;/a&gt; over the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlpKbz"&gt;Russia’s antitrust authority has already clashed with Apple this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407293/apple-russia-antitrust-monopoly-fine-kaspersky-parental-control-app"&gt;fining the tech giant $12 million&lt;/a&gt; over complaints it unfairly cracked down on third-party parental control apps. With its latest legal action, FAS is tapping into a far more contentious policy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Duolingo interprets 2021, with TikTok and Squid Game inspiring users to learn new languages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TSZHj4tzG1JnmivcQqed7csWGVo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70233479/acastro_20200723_1777_duolingo_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V4N1Cu"&gt;Language learning app Duolingo said its phrase of the year is “I am mentally exhausted,” which appears as part of its Japanese course and does seem to nicely sum up 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9y5QWo"&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811900/spotify-wrapped-2021-music-recap-iphone-android"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812079/apple-music-year-in-review-spotify-wrapped-social-media"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, Duolingo is giving users a look back at the year that was. Starting today, anyone who completed at least 10 Duolingo lessons in 2021 can get a personalized look at what kind of language learner they are, based on when they practice their lessons, how many courses they’ve taken, and how many hours they spent learning on the app. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_u2mhVkQ2wtenSakDPmW3MEd6ns=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063133/duolingo_yir_learnerstylereviel.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Duolingo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Duolingo’s Year in Review will tell you want kind of language learner you were in 2021.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="joExSM"&gt;In its 2021 &lt;a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/2021-duolingo-language-report/"&gt;language report&lt;/a&gt;, Duolingo said the top five languages learned on the app this year were Spanish, English, French, Japanese, and German, with Korean rising in popularity worldwide. Among those who started a new language on Duolingo during the pandemic, 80 percent used the mobile app to conduct lessons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFWk73"&gt;More than two-thirds of users Duolingo surveyed said a “cultural event” might inspire them to try to pick up a new language, with 29 percent saying TikTok videos in other languages served as motivation That number was even higher among Gen Z users, at 40 percent. Among those who were inspired by a streaming show to learn a new language, 37 percent started lessons in Spanish after watching &lt;em&gt;Money Heist; &lt;/em&gt;28 percent decided to learn Korean after watching &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;, and 20 percent took up French after watching &lt;em&gt;Emily in Paris&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrGv28"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/language-learning-app-duolingo-pops-35percent-in-public-debut-on-the-nasdaq.html"&gt;Pittsburgh-based company, which went public in July&lt;/a&gt;, had a busy 2021. In May, founder and CEO Luis von Ahn, a native of Guatemala, joined Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/civil-rights-social-justice/duolingo-founder-a-pittsburgher-and-immigrant-puts-his-app-to-work-fighting-illiteracy-in-central-america/"&gt;push for businesses&lt;/a&gt; to invest in Central America. The app also&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22362723/duolingo-yiddish-language-classes"&gt; added its 40th language, Yiddish&lt;/a&gt;, in April.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A humanoid robot makes eerily lifelike facial expressions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xtkc7nfCk1gCHrJ5Wh8I2lKA2IY=/399x0:2381x1321/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70232539/humanoid_robot_facial_expression.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Engineered Arts via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPukuYb9xWw" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gy5qdC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.engineeredarts.co.uk/"&gt;Engineered Arts&lt;/a&gt;, a UK-based designer and manufacturer of humanoid robots, recently showed off one of its most lifelike creations in a video posted on YouTube. The robot, called &lt;a href="https://www.engineeredarts.co.uk/robot/ameca/"&gt;Ameca&lt;/a&gt;, is shown making a series of incredibly human-like facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N3ekFG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ameca opens its mouth and raises its brows in what it looks like is amazement&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RP8LbE"&gt;At the start of the video, Ameca appears to “wake up,” as its face conveys a mix of confusion and frustration when it opens its eyes. But when Ameca starts looking at its hands and arms, the robot opens its mouth and raises its brows in what it looks like is amazement. The end of the video shows Ameca smiling and holding a welcoming hand out towards the viewer — if that’s how you want to interpret that gesture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEUbI5"&gt;Sorry to disappoint, but Ameca doesn’t walk, flip, or do parkour like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628663/boston-dynamics-atlas-video-parkour-flips-falls-program"&gt;Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robot does&lt;/a&gt;. That said, we likely won’t see Ameca walking and talking among us anytime soon. Engineered Arts says the bot is currently unable to walk, although it wants to give it that ability at some point. As for whether Ameca operates using AI, Engineered Arts explains that it leaves AI capabilities up to developers — it just handles the ultra-realistic bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Lmwh1s"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTny-MYb4tE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xJvjka"&gt;If Ameca doesn’t creep you out enough, Engineered Arts also developed another realistic bot, named &lt;a href="https://www.engineeredarts.co.uk/robot/mesmer/"&gt;Mesmer&lt;/a&gt;. The company says that it used 3D scans of actual humans to give the bot accurate bone structure, skin texture, and lifelike facial expressions. In a video posted just days after the Ameca showcase, Mesmer makes a series of expressions that looks even more convincing, given that this bot has more lifelike skin and facial features than Ameca does at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8NESR"&gt;Since Engineered Arts focuses on creating humanoid robots for entertainment, Ameca and Mesmer will likely be the center of attention at venues and events, rather than robots designed to do a specific job or take over all of humanity. If you want to see Ameca in real life, Engineered Arts says it’ll be on display at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628787/ces-2022-covid-19-vaccine-proof-cta"&gt;CES 2022 in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clearview AI is closer to getting a US patent for its facial recognition technology</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vNVLdCyF7o8CbXOveUXadxcYvYg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70232333/acastro_210512_1777_deepfake_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8DEjBy"&gt;Clearview AI is on track to receive a US patent for its facial recognition technology, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/04/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-523735"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company was reportedly sent a “notice of allowance” by the US Patent and Trademark Office, which means that once it pays the required administration fees, its patent will be officially approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBbFf6"&gt;Clearview AI builds its facial recognition database using images of people that it scrapes across social media (and the internet in general), a practice that has the company steeped in controversy. The company’s &lt;a href="https://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;s1=20210042527.PGNR.&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html"&gt;patent application&lt;/a&gt; details its use of a “web crawler” to acquire images, even noting that “online photos associated with a person’s account may help to create additional records of facial recognition data points,” which its machine learning algorithm can then use to find and identify matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CisU2U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Critics argue that Clearview AI’s facial recognition technology is a violation of privacy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OcnlGq"&gt;Critics argue that Clearview AI’s facial recognition technology is a violation of privacy and that it may negatively impact minority communities. The technology is allegedly &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/11/21131991/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-database-law-enforcement"&gt;less accurate when identifying people of color and women&lt;/a&gt;, potentially leading to false arrests when used by law enforcement agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNfIc6"&gt;Last year, the company said that its technology was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402978/clearview-ai-ceo-interview-2400-police-agencies-facial-recognition"&gt;used by over 2,400 police agencies&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368930/clearview-ai-ice-contract-privacy-immigration"&gt;including the FBI and Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; — to identify suspects. In the aftermath of the Capitol riots this January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223349/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-law-enforcement-capitol-rioters"&gt;Clearview AI said the use of its technology by law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; sharply increased as detectives worked to identify those associated with the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6h4Rt"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273388/aclu-clearview-ai-lawsuit-facial-recognition-database-illinois-biometric-laws"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union sued the company&lt;/a&gt; last year for violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, resulting in Clearview &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21251387/clearview-ai-law-enforcement-police-facial-recognition-illinois-privacy-law"&gt;stopping the sale of its technology to private companies&lt;/a&gt; and non-law enforcement entities. In November, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761001/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-australia-breach-data-delete"&gt;Australian government ordered the company&lt;/a&gt; to clear its database of all its citizens, and earlier this year, a number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22455446/clearview-ai-legal-privacy-complaint-privacy-international-facial-recognition-eu"&gt;European agencies filed legal complaints&lt;/a&gt; against Clearview AI. In addition, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266055/clearview-facial-recognition-illegal-mass-surveillance-canada-privacy"&gt;Canadian privacy commissioner called the company’s technology&lt;/a&gt; “illegal mass surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUmOgV"&gt;Clearview AI hasn’t even been able to get on Big Tech’s good side. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126063/facebook-clearview-ai-image-scraping-facial-recognition-database-terms-of-service-twitter-youtube"&gt;Facebook, LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/technology/clearview-ai-twitter-letter.html"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21124172/youtube-clearview-ai-cease-and-desist"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; all sent cease and desist letters demanding that the company stop scraping images and videos from the platforms, as the practice is in violation of each site’s policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0QMR5m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Is there any way out of Clearview’s facial recognition database?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22522486/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-avoid-escape-privacy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
