    <title>Should abuse survivors have to disappear from the internet?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0HuuxyN84x0LuXc6WEvcb0BFtkM=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234086/VRG_Illo_4902_Security_Abuse.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Some survivors are challenging the conventional wisdom about how to stay safe online&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="GIVsoL"&gt;For more than two decades, Lorraine* has known her ex-boyfriend is watching her. She cut contact with him 20 years ago, but in Facebook posts and intimidating emails, he makes sure she knows he’s still keeping tabs, from the birth of her children to her most recent wedding anniversary. After years of abuse that resulted in a PTSD diagnosis and intense nightmares, the notes are chilling, and make her uncomfortable putting any personal information in an online space where he could see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83wubm"&gt;“It’s affected my relationship with my friends,” Lorraine says. “It’s affected my relationship with my partner. It’s affected my ability to feel safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D86rJm"&gt;The advice many survivors like Lorraine receive when they look for help is to leave their online life behind and delete themselves from the internet entirely. There are many tutorials on how to delete your online presence. Given how often abusers use digital channels to harass their targets, erasing yourself can seem like the obvious choice. But interpersonal abuse thrives on the alienation of its victims, and some kind of online presence can be a crucial lifeline for people trying to escape their abusers and rebuild a new life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y52Qp0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s easy to think you need to disappear, but you don’t need to.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SvgytB"&gt;Tony Hunt, chief development officer of Operation Safe Escape, a nonprofit organization that helps victims of domestic violence escape their abusers, says deleting yourself from the internet could be exactly what the stalker wants. “It’s about control, they want to isolate you because that gives them absolute control over everything you do,” Hunt explained. “It’s easy to think you need to disappear, but you don’t need to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="py1LZT"&gt;It’s an urgent question for thousands of people quietly struggling with domestic violence. One in four women and one in nine men will experience severe intimate partner physical violence at some point in their lives, &lt;a href="https://ncadv.org/statistics"&gt;according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence&lt;/a&gt;. One in seven women and one in 18 men have been stalked by an intimate partner during their lifetime, to a point where they felt very fearful or believed that they or someone close to them would be harmed or killed. &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0886260515614283"&gt;A 2015 survey&lt;/a&gt; of college students found that nearly 75 percent had experienced some kind of tech-assisted intimate partner victimization in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkrBI2"&gt;For Lorraine, deleting herself from the internet didn’t feel like a solution. “It felt like I was removing my online liberty because of someone else’s abuse,” she said. “Both my husband and I have worked in various countries, so social media is brilliant for keeping in contact with people that we rarely see. We wouldn’t want to lose that ability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lcQrLi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It felt like I was removing my online liberty because of someone else’s abuse.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b9nglq"&gt;Julia’s* ex-partner surveilled her even when they were together and continued to do so after they had broken up, which made online spaces particularly dangerous. But instead of retreating, the threat inspired her to learn more about internet security, and to be more careful with how and where she logged on. For her, &lt;a href="https://goaskrose.com/guide-secure-comms/"&gt;establishing safe communications with trusted people&lt;/a&gt; was particularly essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Hai0I"&gt;“An abusive relationship is already devastating, and shrinking afterwards adds to the devastation,” Julia said. “We can develop intentional boundaries on the internet, it doesn’t have to be all or nothing. It was better for me to learn more about internet security, privacy, and different tools stalkers can use than retreating, because that knowledge empowered me to have a more realistic sense of what is possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKlBQ8"&gt;Some survivors also worry that disappearing entirely will escalate the situation, according to University of Kentucky professor &lt;a href="https://behavioralscience.med.uky.edu/users/tklogan#profileTab4"&gt;TK Logan&lt;/a&gt;, who researches cyberstalking. “I’ve had victims say, he was threatening me and doing all this stuff through social media so I got off social media,” she explained. “And now all the survivor can think about is, ‘Oh, my God, what is he doing? Is he just going to show up physically?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bpPHgu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If the abuser has the right tools and he has physical access to the device, in 30 to 60 seconds there’s a lot he can do.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="07EE2c"&gt;Hunt frames the security measures survivors should employ as a new kind of lifestyle where survivors are intentional about their online presence, rather than a disappearing act. “The priority is making sure that nobody’s advertising everything about their personal lives,” he said. “Because [the abuser] will have something that will give them access to the kids or their location or their regimen throughout the day. Once you’ve established those boundaries and you start living your life again, you’ll be glad you did it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJyl6K"&gt;Though Operation Safe Escape trains survivors on more general security protocols rather than only focusing on online security, Hunt says technology-facilitated abuse comes up often. Part of the organization’s job, in partnership with the Coalition Against Stalkerware, is to identify developers that claim their software is for law enforcement, but actually sell their products to individuals looking to coerce and control their victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVsO6Q"&gt;“What happens is, you have boyfriends who will pay contractors to install a keylogger on their girlfriend’s computer, and all of a sudden, a whole new world opens up,” Hunt said. “If the abuser has the right tools and he has physical access to the device, in 30 to 60 seconds there’s a lot he can do.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFBWbV"&gt;With regard to these higher-level security threats that include hacking and surveillance, Hunt recommends survivors get directly in contact with &lt;a href="https://safeescape.org/help/"&gt;Operation Safe Escape&lt;/a&gt; so they can be guided on what options they have to leave safely and regain their life and autonomy. “We are really selective about who we work with and how much information we put out there,” Hunt explained. “Once that information is out there, guess who tries to use it against survivors?” Logan also recommends setting up multiple-factor authentication, and directs survivors to the &lt;a href="https://ukcdar.uky.edu/cdarlime25/index.php/survey/index/sid/57925/newtest/Y/lang/en"&gt;Stalking and Harassment Assessment &amp;amp; Risk Profile (SHARP) tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JfXDe"&gt;The most reliable way to detect stalkerware on an Android device is to run an antivirus app and do a scan. For iOS users, Apple provides a &lt;a href="https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1976/en_US/device-and-data-access-when-personal-safety-is-at-risk.pdf"&gt;step-by-step&lt;/a&gt; guide for detecting invasive apps. The &lt;a href="https://stopstalkerware.org/information-for-survivors/"&gt;Coalition Against Stalkerware also recommends&lt;/a&gt; that potential victims keep a log of what they are experiencing, to help detect patterns and show the history of what has been happening if they choose to get help from law enforcement or a survivor assistance charity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQDHHb"&gt;But even given the threat of malicious software, the most effective protections still rely on a strong support network, which is much easier to build when you’re connected. “The goal is to put up as many barriers, make it as difficult as possible for the stalker,” says Logan, “and then the other step is to get support.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5Zuaw"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Some names have been changed to protect sources who have been targeted by abuse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is fighting Russian regulator’s demands on alternative app payments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SUUtKRbOpZjwnXWJ2gxbQ8gU0X4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70233966/acastro_180130_1777_0005_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IUbSSC"&gt;Apple is challenging antitrust action taken by Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), which wants iOS developers to be able to tell customers about alternatives to Apple’s in-app payment option, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-starts-legal-action-against-russian-regulator-app-store-dispute-ria-2021-12-06/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Apple wants a judicial review of the regulator’s warning, &lt;a href="https://www.rt.com/business/542257-apple-takes-russia-court/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russia Today&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally issued with a &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.ru/tekhnologii/438557-fas-predupredila-apple-iz-za-zapreta-soobsat-o-vozmoznosti-oplaty-vne-app-store"&gt;deadline of September 30th&lt;/a&gt; for the US tech giant to change its anti-steering policies. When Apple didn’t comply, FAS announced it was opening an antitrust case against the company &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-opens-case-against-apple-over-app-store-payment-restrictions-2021-10-27/"&gt;at the end of October&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgnoWb"&gt;The US tech giant’s policies on in-app payments are contentious, to say the very least. Apple requires iOS developers to use its own in-app payment system, which in many cases allows it to collect up to a lucrative 30 percent commission on any purchases. Not only does Apple ban developers from allowing third-party payment methods in their apps, it even limits their ability to tell customers when they accept alternative payment methods elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zkRd5p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;FAS is accusing Apple of “abusing its dominant position”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="50iGGg"&gt;It’s this policy that FAS is specifically objecting to. In an announcement at the &lt;a href="http://en.fas.gov.ru/press-center/news/detail.html?id=55296"&gt;end of October&lt;/a&gt;, the regulator said Apple was “abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of apps through its App Store” by not allowing developers to tell “in-app users about the possibility [of paying] for their purchases outside the App Store.” Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PuC9iZ"&gt;In August, in response to a class-action lawsuit, Apple said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;“clarifying” its policies&lt;/a&gt; about developers telling customers about alternative payment methods. It said that developers could use communications like emails to share information with customers about alternative payment methods. However, it stopped short of letting developers do this inside apps themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ntm1kO"&gt;Apple’s App Store policies are facing pushback around the world. In the US, the judge in Apple’s legal battle with Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;ordered the company to allow iOS apps&lt;/a&gt; to direct users to alternative payment options, and gave the company a deadline of December 9th to comply. Meanwhile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;lawmakers in South Korea passed a bill&lt;/a&gt; in late August banning platform holders like Google and Apple from limiting developers to using their first-party payment systems. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;European Commission has also issued antitrust charges&lt;/a&gt; over the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlpKbz"&gt;Russia’s antitrust authority has already clashed with Apple this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407293/apple-russia-antitrust-monopoly-fine-kaspersky-parental-control-app"&gt;fining the tech giant $12 million&lt;/a&gt; over complaints it unfairly cracked down on third-party parental control apps. With its latest legal action, FAS is tapping into a far more contentious policy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Duolingo interprets 2021, with TikTok and Squid Game inspiring users to learn new languages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TSZHj4tzG1JnmivcQqed7csWGVo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70233479/acastro_20200723_1777_duolingo_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V4N1Cu"&gt;Language learning app Duolingo said its phrase of the year is “I am mentally exhausted,” which appears as part of its Japanese course and does seem to nicely sum up 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9y5QWo"&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811900/spotify-wrapped-2021-music-recap-iphone-android"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812079/apple-music-year-in-review-spotify-wrapped-social-media"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, Duolingo is giving users a look back at the year that was. Starting today, anyone who completed at least 10 Duolingo lessons in 2021 can get a personalized look at what kind of language learner they are, based on when they practice their lessons, how many courses they’ve taken, and how many hours they spent learning on the app. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_u2mhVkQ2wtenSakDPmW3MEd6ns=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063133/duolingo_yir_learnerstylereviel.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Duolingo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Duolingo’s Year in Review will tell you want kind of language learner you were in 2021.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="joExSM"&gt;In its 2021 language report and survey, Duolingo said the top five languages learned on the app this year were Spanish, English, French, Japanese, and German, with Korean rising in popularity worldwide. Among those who started a new language on Duolingo during the pandemic, 80 percent used the mobile app to conduct lessons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFWk73"&gt;More than two-thirds of users Duolingo surveyed said a “cultural event” might inspire them to try to pick up a new language, with 29 percent saying TikTok videos in other languages served as motivation That number was even higher among Gen Z users, at 40 percent. Among those who were inspired by a streaming show to learn a new language, 37 percent started lessons in Spanish after watching &lt;em&gt;Money Heist; &lt;/em&gt;28 percent decided to learn Korean after watching &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;, and 20 percent took up French after watching &lt;em&gt;Emily in Paris&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrGv28"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/language-learning-app-duolingo-pops-35percent-in-public-debut-on-the-nasdaq.html"&gt;Pittsburgh-based company, which went public in July&lt;/a&gt;, had a busy 2021. In May, founder and CEO Luis von Ahn, a native of Guatemala, joined Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/civil-rights-social-justice/duolingo-founder-a-pittsburgher-and-immigrant-puts-his-app-to-work-fighting-illiteracy-in-central-america/"&gt;push for businesses&lt;/a&gt; to invest in Central America. The app also&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22362723/duolingo-yiddish-language-classes"&gt; added its 40th language, Yiddish&lt;/a&gt;, in April.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A humanoid robot makes eerily lifelike facial expressions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xtkc7nfCk1gCHrJ5Wh8I2lKA2IY=/399x0:2381x1321/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70232539/humanoid_robot_facial_expression.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Engineered Arts via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPukuYb9xWw" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gy5qdC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.engineeredarts.co.uk/"&gt;Engineered Arts&lt;/a&gt;, a UK-based designer and manufacturer of humanoid robots, recently showed off one of its most lifelike creations in a video posted on YouTube. The robot, called &lt;a href="https://www.engineeredarts.co.uk/robot/ameca/"&gt;Ameca&lt;/a&gt;, is shown making a series of incredibly human-like facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N3ekFG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ameca opens its mouth and raises its brows in what it looks like is amazement&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RP8LbE"&gt;At the start of the video, Ameca appears to “wake up,” as its face conveys a mix of confusion and frustration when it opens its eyes. But when Ameca starts looking at its hands and arms, the robot opens its mouth and raises its brows in what it looks like is amazement. The end of the video shows Ameca smiling and holding a welcoming hand out towards the viewer — if that’s how you want to interpret that gesture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEUbI5"&gt;Sorry to disappoint, but Ameca doesn’t walk, flip, or do parkour like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628663/boston-dynamics-atlas-video-parkour-flips-falls-program"&gt;Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robot does&lt;/a&gt;. That said, we likely won’t see Ameca walking and talking among us anytime soon. Engineered Arts says the bot is currently unable to walk, although it wants to give it that ability at some point. As for whether Ameca operates using AI, Engineered Arts explains that it leaves AI capabilities up to developers — it just handles the ultra-realistic bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Lmwh1s"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTny-MYb4tE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xJvjka"&gt;If Ameca doesn’t creep you out enough, Engineered Arts also developed another realistic bot, named &lt;a href="https://www.engineeredarts.co.uk/robot/mesmer/"&gt;Mesmer&lt;/a&gt;. The company says that it used 3D scans of actual humans to give the bot accurate bone structure, skin texture, and lifelike facial expressions. In a video posted just days after the Ameca showcase, Mesmer makes a series of expressions that looks even more convincing, given that this bot has more lifelike skin and facial features than Ameca does at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8NESR"&gt;Since Engineered Arts focuses on creating humanoid robots for entertainment, Ameca and Mesmer will likely be the center of attention at venues and events, rather than robots designed to do a specific job or take over all of humanity. If you want to see Ameca in real life, Engineered Arts says it’ll be on display at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628787/ces-2022-covid-19-vaccine-proof-cta"&gt;CES 2022 in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clearview AI is closer to getting a US patent for its facial recognition technology</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vNVLdCyF7o8CbXOveUXadxcYvYg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70232333/acastro_210512_1777_deepfake_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8DEjBy"&gt;Clearview AI is on track to receive a US patent for its facial recognition technology, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/04/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-523735"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company was reportedly sent a “notice of allowance” by the US Patent and Trademark Office, which means that once it pays the required administration fees, its patent will be officially approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBbFf6"&gt;Clearview AI builds its facial recognition database using images of people that it scrapes across social media (and the internet in general), a practice that has the company steeped in controversy. The company’s &lt;a href="https://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;s1=20210042527.PGNR.&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html"&gt;patent application&lt;/a&gt; details its use of a “web crawler” to acquire images, even noting that “online photos associated with a person’s account may help to create additional records of facial recognition data points,” which its machine learning algorithm can then use to find and identify matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CisU2U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Critics argue that Clearview AI’s facial recognition technology is a violation of privacy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OcnlGq"&gt;Critics argue that Clearview AI’s facial recognition technology is a violation of privacy and that it may negatively impact minority communities. The technology is allegedly &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/11/21131991/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-database-law-enforcement"&gt;less accurate when identifying people of color and women&lt;/a&gt;, potentially leading to false arrests when used by law enforcement agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNfIc6"&gt;Last year, the company said that its technology was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402978/clearview-ai-ceo-interview-2400-police-agencies-facial-recognition"&gt;used by over 2,400 police agencies&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368930/clearview-ai-ice-contract-privacy-immigration"&gt;including the FBI and Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; — to identify suspects. In the aftermath of the Capitol riots this January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223349/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-law-enforcement-capitol-rioters"&gt;Clearview AI said the use of its technology by law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; sharply increased as detectives worked to identify those associated with the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6h4Rt"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273388/aclu-clearview-ai-lawsuit-facial-recognition-database-illinois-biometric-laws"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union sued the company&lt;/a&gt; last year for violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, resulting in Clearview &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21251387/clearview-ai-law-enforcement-police-facial-recognition-illinois-privacy-law"&gt;stopping the sale of its technology to private companies&lt;/a&gt; and non-law enforcement entities. In November, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761001/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-australia-breach-data-delete"&gt;Australian government ordered the company&lt;/a&gt; to clear its database of all its citizens, and earlier this year, a number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22455446/clearview-ai-legal-privacy-complaint-privacy-international-facial-recognition-eu"&gt;European agencies filed legal complaints&lt;/a&gt; against Clearview AI. In addition, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266055/clearview-facial-recognition-illegal-mass-surveillance-canada-privacy"&gt;Canadian privacy commissioner called the company’s technology&lt;/a&gt; “illegal mass surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUmOgV"&gt;Clearview AI hasn’t even been able to get on Big Tech’s good side. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126063/facebook-clearview-ai-image-scraping-facial-recognition-database-terms-of-service-twitter-youtube"&gt;Facebook, LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/technology/clearview-ai-twitter-letter.html"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21124172/youtube-clearview-ai-cease-and-desist"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; all sent cease and desist letters demanding that the company stop scraping images and videos from the platforms, as the practice is in violation of each site’s policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0QMR5m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Is there any way out of Clearview’s facial recognition database?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22522486/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-avoid-escape-privacy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Walmart’s in-store Gamer Drop will be a bust if you’re looking for new consoles like the PS5 or Switch OLED</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rt0PYBOnRxkLcojJ-czXOIwglQI=/0x24:672x472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70224897/k2__dd3aea10_166c_434f_9b7f_7b3287ed4b4e.v1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart’s Gamer Drop prominently features the big three new consoles that are difficult to get.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Walmart&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xEHRxJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 5th, 4:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Per &lt;/em&gt;IGN’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TayNixster/status/1467245203283140617"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taylor Lyles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and an updated message on the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/gamer-drop/7087317"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart Gamer Drop splash page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the event won’t have the new consoles you’re probably looking for, despite featuring them prominently in the artwork. The post below has been updated to reflect this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8XU9j"&gt;Walmart has announced a new &lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/gamer-drop/7087317"&gt;Gamer Drop event&lt;/a&gt; coming to select stores on December 11th, where the retailer is promising to have the “latest gaming titles and consoles.” It’s billing it as a holiday shopping event, complete with discounts and exclusive gear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prXoF1"&gt; &lt;a href="https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/4ff9c6c9-4866/k2-_331621d6-7642-4095-82d1-ecac1d3f3bc9.v1.pdf"&gt;The posted circular on Walmart’s website&lt;/a&gt; prominently features the major consoles, including the Nintendo Switch OLED Model, Xbox Series X / S, and both models of the PlayStation 5 with the note of “Available in-store or online at &lt;a href="http://Walmart.com/GamerDrop"&gt;Walmart.com/GamerDrop.&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBT87C"&gt;After the event was announced, Walmart added more text to the notice (you can see the original one in the image below), informing gamers that “PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch OLED will not be available during this event.” It’s unclear whether or not they will have any Xbox Series X consoles on hand, but if there are, then the notice says you will only be able to purchase them as part of an All Access subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jolFad"&gt;This event is exclusive to select Walmart stores. You can find the closest Walmart that’s participating in the Gamer Drop event on Saturday, the 11th, by searching your address or zip code on the &lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/gamer-drop/7087317"&gt;Gamer Drop&lt;/a&gt; page. Listed stores indicate Gamer Drop hours of 10:30AM to 7PM, which is a limited window compared to store hours of many Walmart stores. We have reached out to Walmart for further details and will keep an eye out for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/El80Hxes451sAXELbpszKPVjkDw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060926/Screen_Shot_2021_12_03_at_12.12.18_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Walmart Gamer Drop site allows users to search if their local store is participating. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

    <title>The Verizon app might be collecting your browsing history and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VTuYkY79miGTm3dxd_vXfaWPL7w=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70231632/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S0UWrO"&gt;The My Verizon app might be collecting information about your browsing history, location, apps, and your contacts, all in the name of helping the company “understand your interests,” first spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/verizon-customers-might-want-to-check-their-privacy-settings-asap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Input&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The program, which Verizon appears to automatically opt customers into, is called Verizon Custom Experience and lays buried in the privacy settings on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FEtwFY"&gt;The program introduces two different options that appear in the app, Custom Experience and Custom Experience Plus, each of which varies in terms of invasiveness. Verizon provides additional information about both settings within the app, as well as on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/verizon-custom-experience-programs-faqs/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; on its website. It appears that the Custom Experience option is a stripped-down version of Custom Experience Plus, and as Verizon states directly in the app, it helps Verizon “personalize” its “communication with you” and “give you more relevant product and service recommendations” by using “information about websites you visit and apps you use on your mobile device.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CUQBfA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My Verizon's "Custom Experience" and "Custom Experience Plus" settings appear to let the company collect your device location, phone numbers you call, and your browsing history. Via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inputmag?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@inputmag&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/nNMLOLqQGv"&gt;https://t.co/nNMLOLqQGv&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/M4CHchHmZi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/M4CHchHmZi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Emma Roth (@emroth08) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/emroth08/status/1467549460075094023?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ksz12I"&gt;Meanwhile, Custom Experience Plus has the same purpose — to help Verizon provide you with a more “personalized” experience. However, it not only uses information about the websites and apps you use on your mobile device, but it also says it uses your “device location,” along with “phone numbers you call or that call you” to help Verizon “better understand your interests.” This also includes your CPNI, which tracks the times and duration of your calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4sKvUM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It doesn’t appear that users are getting the chance to opt-in&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K8S3iG"&gt;As Verizon explains on its site, it might use your information to, say, present you with an offer that includes music content, or give you a music-related option in its Verizon Up reward program if it knows you like music. Verizon explicitly states that you “must opt in to participate and you can change your choice at any time,” but it doesn’t appear that users are getting the chance to opt-in themselves, or perhaps they’re doing so unknowingly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ToCtG"&gt;After checking the privacy settings on my own app, I found that “Custom Experience” and “Custom Experience Plus” were both already toggled on. I don’t recall ever turning either of these features on, or being asked about it. As Andrew Paul of &lt;em&gt;Input&lt;/em&gt; notes, he only discovered the feature after mistakenly opening a promotional email from Verizon that describes the new program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xx4PS9"&gt;To opt-out of the Custom Experience altogether, open your My Verizon app, and then hit the gear icon in the top-right corner of the screen. Scroll down and select “Manage privacy settings” beneath the “Preferences” heading. On the next page, toggle off “Custom Experience” and “Custom Experience Plus.” To erase the information that Verizon has already collected about you through the program, tap “Custom Experience Settings,” and hit “Reset.” The company says that it won’t sell your information to advertisers and that it will “use it only for Verizon purposes,” but it’s still unnerving either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fV3HkK"&gt;In April, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321733/t-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers"&gt;T-Mobile started automatically enrolling users&lt;/a&gt; in a program that shares your data with advertisers unless you manually opt-out from your &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fprivacy-center%2Ftake-control-of-your-data&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F5%2F22818783%2Fverizon-app-data-collection-browsing-history" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;privacy settings&lt;/a&gt;. On &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/privacy/full_privacy_policy.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s privacy center&lt;/a&gt;, the company says that it collects web and browsing information, along with the apps you use, and that you can manage these settings from &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/privacy/rights_choices.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Station Eleven, The Matrix Resurrections, The Book of Boba Fett, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U8egd3nYkAzv2HWHDWnLYtryjwo=/284x0:1592x872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70231469/mackenzie_davis_station_eleven_two.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Mackenzie Davis stars in Station Eleven | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaAG-SwEa7k&amp;amp;ab_channel=HBOMax" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y6lf8U"&gt;I finally finished &lt;em&gt;The Beatles: Get Back&lt;/em&gt;, and even though it meandered a lot, I found myself wanting more. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal’&lt;/em&gt;s Jason Gay &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/i-miss-my-new-best-friends-the-beatles-11638543379?st=0mjtpkgws5h1pit&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;nicely captures what it felt like&lt;/a&gt; to watch this 50-year old footage as a fan, like we were all kinda just hanging out with John, Paul, George, and Ringo as they worked on new material. Highly recommend watching, it will make you question some of the prevailing narratives about the Fab Four (like the widely held belief that they were at each other’s throats constantly as the band neared its breakup). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dk8hn5"&gt;Also! We got some late-breaking news Saturday about the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man:  Into the Spider-Verse. &lt;/em&gt;It’s going to be titled &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Across the Spider-Verse, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will actually be a two-parter, with part one to be released October 2022, and part two following in 2023. Hit that link for the first trailer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2xh02y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The first trailer for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) teases a stunning animated sequel","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817957/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-part-one-sequelanimated-multiverse-miles-morales"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="C8pqve"&gt;The rest of this week’s trailers include a new peeks at a few movies and shows we’ve seen previous trailers and teasers for, and a (fictional) new HBO Max series about people living in a post-pandemic world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6EoPs9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RaAG-SwEa7k?rel=0&amp;amp;start=1" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="JAa7dl"&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TDk3sf"&gt;Based on the Emily St. John Mandel novel, &lt;em&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/em&gt; is a series about the aftermath of a pandemic whose production was delayed by the real-world pandemic. Twenty years after most of the population was wiped out by the Georgia flu, a band of performers travels the post-apocalyptic landscape staging performances and encountering all manner of survivors including a mysterious person known as The Prophet. (One glimpse of a “museum of civilization” shows a display of some 21st-century relics including “the internet”, a “Switch, Nintendo,” and a “car key fob”). We see both the Before and After Times mainly through the eyes of Kristen, who was a child actress at the onset of the flu and is played by Mackenzie Davis as an adult. Himesh Patel, David Wilmot, Nabhaan Rizwan, Daniel Zovatto, Lori Petty and Matilda Lawler star in &lt;em&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/em&gt;, which begins its 10-episode run December 16th on HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tkKri9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IgYs_NDyaLs?rel=0&amp;amp;start=60" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="uuJiQz"&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="l8BVVu"&gt;I did a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812697/new-matrix-resurrections-trailer-warner-bros-keanu-reeves"&gt;quick&lt;/a&gt; review/appreciation for this trailer the day it came out and have watched it a few (OK many) times since. We don’t get a lot more insight into the movie’s plot here, except that a main element will be “change.” We do hear a voiceover mention that “maybe this isn’t the story we think it is,” and I hope the movie rolls with this idea! Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Yahya Abdul Mateen II, Jessica Henwick, Jonathan Groff, Neil Patrick Harris, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Christina Ricci, and Jada Pinkett Smith star in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix: Resurrections,&lt;/em&gt; which comes to theaters and HBO Max December 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TtNOOi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCAlNWNbN5c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="57TlAX"&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="X4KDVW"&gt;“I am Boba Fett, left for dead on the sands of Tatooine” this new teaser begins. We see our protagonist submerged in what looks like a &lt;a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bacta_tank"&gt;Bacta tank&lt;/a&gt; with a breathing apparatus attached to his face, likely explaining what happened to him post-Sarlacc ingestion in &lt;em&gt;Return of the Jedi&lt;/em&gt; (but not how he actually got out). A few characters look surprised to see Boba in this (very brief) new teaser titled “Message.” Temuera Morrison and Ming-Na Wen star in &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to Disney Plus on December 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7BS5ly"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WHXq62VCaCM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XEW1qb"&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XNt4ox"&gt;We got a teaser in October, and now we have a full trailer for the eight-episode &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/em&gt; series. John Cena reprises his role from James Gunn’s &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad &lt;/em&gt;(Gunn also created the &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/em&gt; series and wrote and directed most of its episodes), but he’s teamed up here with a new bunch of oddballs to try to keep the peace by assassinating people who are supposedly threats to the US. We see in the trailer that despite his bravado Peacemaker seems to question what he’s really doing and why. Along with Cena, Robert Patrick, Freddie Stroma, Danielle Brooks, Steve Agee, Jennifer Holland, and Chukwudi Iwuji star in &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker,&lt;/em&gt; which comes to HBO Max January 13th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="8aaE7e"&gt;Studio 666&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="W8QtU0"&gt;The premise of this horror/comedy flick: The Foo Fighters are recording a new album in a haunted mansion and some evil and bloody hijinks ensue. We don’t get a whole lot of clues about the plot, but we see Dave Grohl get the demon eyes and start levitating, along with glimpses of monsters, an ostensibly evil book, and other supernatural staples of horror flicks. It looks silly and fun as hell. Grohl, Taylor Hawkins, Nate Mendel, Pat Smear, Chris Shiflett, and Rami Jaffee, along with Whitney Cummings, Leslie Grossman, and Will Forte star in &lt;em&gt;Studio 666&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters February 25th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An interactive Doja Cat music video can introduce you to programming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sZmcFaepP24sNNY_r1haTHYAxr4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70231226/doja_code_woman_music_video.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Doja Cat codable music video. | Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://dojacode.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Girls Who Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R4RMua"&gt;Girls Who Code, the nonprofit organization that aims to get more women and girls interested in the field of computer science, has debuted what it calls the “first ever” codable music video. The organization partnered with Doja Cat, transforming her new music video for &lt;em&gt;Woman&lt;/em&gt; into an interactive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fS40l4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;HUGE NEWS: We just made the first ever codable music video with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DojaCat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@dojacat&lt;/a&gt;. You can control the story using code   Go try it now at &lt;a href="https://t.co/EgVStNr5om"&gt;https://t.co/EgVStNr5om&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dojacode?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#dojacode&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/q2MQhMDd0s"&gt;pic.twitter.com/q2MQhMDd0s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Girls Who Code (@GirlsWhoCode) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GirlsWhoCode/status/1466784319846944771?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YDVREX"&gt;You can try out the experience for yourself at &lt;a href="https://dojacode.com/"&gt;Dojacode.com&lt;/a&gt;, where you’ll be greeted by a futuristic image of Doja Cat that becomes pixelated as you drag your mouse over the screen. On the next page, you’ll see three stars, each of which represents a different programming language — yellow for CSS; blue for Javascript; and pink for Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zg7bkg"&gt;Once you click the music video, the experience begins. It plays just like Doja Cat’s original music video, only you’ll get to make decisions throughout, sort of like a choose your own adventure game, but with code. The timeline on the bottom of the screen contains four color-coded stars, showing when the video will pause and which programming language will be showcased.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cnCMJ4PtLW_BR5OKDMkhkLGuLc4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23064505/doja_code_video_nails.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Emma Roth / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Typing in a color changes the look of Doja Cat’s nails.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OmrJrz"&gt;When the video stops, you’ll be able to fill in the blanks besides lines of code. For example, the first break lets you change the color of Doja Cat’s nails using CSS; the color you type in alters the color of Doja Cat’s nails in real-time. In another scenario, entering the name of a city changes the time of day in the video, and it even stays true to that location’s current time — after I typed in “Tokyo” at around 10:00AM ET, the sky in the video turned dark and constellations became visible, all in line with Tokyo’s 12:00AM local time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtHBxF"&gt;At the end of the experience, you’ll get snapshots of how each area looked after you finished “coding” it, which the site then lets you download or share to social media. While the DojaCode video doesn’t involve any intense amounts of programming, I still found it fun to experiment with typing in different options and seeing my changes instantly take effect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite: Chapter 3 is now live with new island, Spider-Man, and plenty more changes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-1PfRxJvbR_4SbZkk8nvk0VbWU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70230178/19BR_KeyArt.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TexQAX"&gt;And then there were three. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22815391/fortnite-the-end-event-chapter-2-recap-highlights-news"&gt;a dramatic live event on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is moving on to Chapter 3, which introduces some big changes for the battle royale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7Bbec"&gt;This morning developer Epic launched &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/chapter-3-season-1"&gt;season 1&lt;/a&gt; of the new chapter, called “Flipped,” and the most dramatic change is the shift to a fresh, snow-covered island, one that features weather conditions, along with new locations like Sanctuary — which appears to play a large part in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; lore — and the Daily Bugle. Those who pick up the new battle pass will also be able to get their hands on characters like Spider-Man and (eventually) The Foundation, voiced by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. You can get the full run-down of the battle pass right here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="94buvi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/knAYcg7Tt8E?rel=0&amp;amp;start=1" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qPD4Fk"&gt;(It’s been a busy weekend for spider-news, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817957/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-part-one-sequelanimated-multiverse-miles-morales"&gt;a trailer for the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Into the Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt; also dropping&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYvIt7"&gt;It also appears that the core gameplay will be shaken up quite a bit. Chapter 3 features two new mechanics — sliding and swinging — that could make the experience even faster and more vertical, particularly for high-level players. And for those who spend time in the game’s creative mode, there’s now an option to earn battle pass XP in player-made experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDrIdT"&gt;Outside of that, developer Epic is introducing some persistent elements to the game. Here’s how the studio explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hD9tXF"&gt;This new chapter brings camps, where players and their squad can heal and store items from match to match — bringing new persistent, social gameplay options to&lt;em&gt; Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Plus, there are new weapons and items to help win a victory royale and earn the all-new, ultimate prestige — the Victory Crown. Keep winning to keep the crown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Fmcw69"&gt;Many of these details &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817525/fortnite-chapter-3-leaked-trailer-spider-man-new-island-gears-of-war"&gt;leaked out earlier on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of an intense live event that saw the previous island literally flip over. After that the game went down for hours as players stared at their characters adrift in a vast ocean. Once the downtime was over, players washed up on the shore of the new island before getting a pep talk from The Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dcpqea"&gt;You can check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22815391/fortnite-the-end-event-chapter-2-recap-highlights-news"&gt;our full recap&lt;/a&gt; of the event right here, or watch it all in the video below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uAoyWR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Rasl5UwwNY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xjiVOi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s second chapter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20905428/fortnite-chapter-2-season-1-release-date-battle-pass-black-hole"&gt;launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/13/20909812/fortnite-down-black-hole-chapter-2-the-end"&gt;a surprise black hole event&lt;/a&gt;, and similarly led to an all-new island. It spanned eight seasons that included everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670317/fortnite-alien-invasion-season-7-end-event-operation-sky-fire"&gt;an alien invasion&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;an Ariana Grande concert&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;a Marvel superhero takeover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
