    <title>Apple wants to build its first car in 2024, Reuters says</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hCaIgR"&gt;Apple once again appears to be seriously looking at making a car. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-autos-exclusive/exclusive-apple-targets-car-production-by-2024-and-eyes-next-level-battery-technology-sources-idUSKBN28V2PY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple is pursuing production of a passenger vehicle by 2024 as well as the creation of self-driving systems and a “breakthrough battery technology.” The report is vague on how it all comes together — it’s not clear that all of this tech is going into the first passenger vehicle Apple hopes to make — but it indicates that Apple is considering vehicle production, after previously shutting down plans to make a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="co7fxC"&gt;There have been rumors of Apple developing a car going &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-titan-car-project-to-challenge-tesla-1423868072"&gt;back to 2015&lt;/a&gt;. But in 2016, the project was scaled down significantly, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/17/13303710/apple-car-project-titan-self-driving-focus"&gt;development of a full car being scrapped&lt;/a&gt; and Apple’s team refocusing on providing software that could be licensed out to car manufacturers, according to reports at the time. Around 200 people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/24/18195598/apple-project-titan-200-employees-dismissed"&gt;were laid off&lt;/a&gt; from Apple’s car team just last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TZo6Yh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are a lot of vague details still, including whether this will actually happen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4qhcXN"&gt;Now it seems that Apple has renewed its focus on building an actual vehicle — though there’s a lot of uncertainty on when (and even if) it will happen. &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;says 2024 is the production goal for an Apple-made passenger vehicle, though it could be pushed back “into 2025 or beyond” because of pandemic-related delays. There is also still a chance Apple could scale its efforts back to just autonomous driving tech, the report warns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHKZEu"&gt;The report says that Apple is relying on third parties to provide some components of its self-driving tech, including its LIDAR systems. Apple’s battery technology reportedly relies on a “monocell” design that allows more capacity to be fit into the overall battery unit by not dividing it up into discrete cells. &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports that it could allow for “a potentially longer range” and lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAvXzX"&gt;Apple declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GuZwn"&gt;If Apple is planning to manufacture a self-driving car, it may also face regulatory hurdles before it can hit the road. There are no true self-driving vehicles available today, though some cars, like those from Tesla, offer a degree of advanced driver assistance driving in certain situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibrVaW"&gt;Earlier this month, Apple handed control of its self-driving car project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163939/apple-self-driving-car-john-giannandrea-ai-siri"&gt;over to John Giannandrea&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s head of AI. Giannandrea was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/3/17195076/google-ai-chief-john-giannandrea-joining-apple-machine-learning-siri"&gt;brought on board&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 to work on Siri, after previously working at Google as head of search and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzA2Mv"&gt;Just yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/20/sketchy-report-says-apple-car-coming-2021/"&gt;another report&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;em&gt;Economic Daily News&lt;/em&gt; in Taiwan, said that an Apple-made car could be released as soon as 2021 in what would be a stunningly ambitious timeframe if true. Back in 2018, reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted the launch of a car between 2023 and 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/08/14/ming-chi-kuo-apple-car-2023/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Generally, though, the impression has been that Apple was focused on self-driving technology for the past several years, rather than production of an actual Apple-branded vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s leaked Galaxy Chromebook 2 is oranger than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jhDht9-t5s5BVe0ElpEhEM2PEa8=/338x0:2162x1216/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68562779/17a1cca82fdaa085e6a7da0895a7b6855c33cd7b5943c466b0f539c1b260d8b4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-chromebook2-first-images-1608577621-196464122" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass / Voice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZgEl32"&gt;Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Chromebook 2 has been revealed in a new leak, showing off the return of the company’s unique bright orange coloring in an otherwise similar-looking design, &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-chromebook2-first-images-1608577621-196464122"&gt;via Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLhkdU"&gt;There are some visible changes to the new model, including minor adjustments to the port layout and the extension of Samsung’s application of the orange color. The keyboard on the second-generation model has been made a more neutral black, even as the orange hue has extended to the sides of the laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uSps3P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Chromebook review: beautiful to a fault","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="R7n8Gr"&gt;But any more substantial changes will likely be found in the internal specs, which presumably will see some sort of improvement from last year’s model — especially considering that there are new 11th Gen Intel laptop chips out. Combining the improved battery life and graphics performance from those chips with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;already good-looking Samsung Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; sounds like an intriguing possibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xT9x7D"&gt;The original Galaxy Chromebook was a premium device, with a design — and price tag — to match. But in her review, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Monica Chen was disappointed with the poor battery life and cooling — areas Samsung will hopefully be improving on in this newly leaked model. CES 2021 is right around the corner, so odds are that we’ll get an official reveal from Samsung in the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stardew Valley’s jam-packed 1.5 update reminds us why it’s our forever game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TdpxVihGwv5XufbehERSDZaQwn8=/75x0:885x540/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68562581/StardewScreenshot_1.5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: ConcernedApe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XABTSp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley &lt;/em&gt;is an idyllic digital space to escape to after a long year — and thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-5-update-out-now-on-pc/"&gt;1.5 update available today on PC&lt;/a&gt;, you can now bring friends and family along to your farm with local split-screen co-op. The &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/30/17304754/stardew-valley-multiplayer-mode-co-op"&gt;multiplayer update&lt;/a&gt; from a couple of years back made it possible to play and share farms online, but this local co-op addition lets you do the same with the people you actually live with, even if they don’t have their own copy of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pTGhk"&gt;You can add the ability for local co-op by having Robin the Carpenter build cabins on your farm, or if you’re starting from scratch, you can select to have the cabins already built when you make a new game. Once the cabins are built, you can start local co-op for up to three other people from game menu. The 1.5 update also adds a new “Beach Farm” map that includes sandy soil that can clog up sprinklers, and “Advanced Game Options” in character creation that let you randomize bundles in the Community Center and rewards in the Mine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S4p17ZhPA7IRI-I7vy26njscNq0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22188656/StardewValley_NewGameOptions.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ConcernedApe&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New game options in the 1.5 update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BK148w"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-5-update-full-changelog/"&gt;full release notes&lt;/a&gt; for the update contain even more surprises. The notable ones that had &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley &lt;/em&gt;fans at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; excited to return to the game are the ability to sit on chairs (yes, really), a change to the social tab in-game so that it shows you who you’ve already talked to each day, and a new coffee maker item that brews a fresh cup every morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1a5CQN"&gt;The special thing about &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; is that it’s so full of features and so consistently updated that every little change could mean something to someone. Having a routine that you follow each day in-game makes it easier to appreciate the little things that streamline those processes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFl46C"&gt;It was an updated social tab and a coffee maker in this update, but it could just as easily be something else next time. No matter how small the feature or fix, &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley &lt;/em&gt;updates are a reminder that the game is always exciting and surprising to return to. It’s a comfortable “forever” game in a normal year and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21178215/games-quarantine-coronavirus-play-pokemon-shield-sword-stardew-valley-pubg-persona"&gt;nice cure to pandemic blues if you need it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5562PE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt;’s 1.5 Update is available now on PC. The update will come to consoles in early 2021 and mobile phones sometime after that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sweeping new copyright measures poised to pass in spending bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pelosi And Schumer Speak To Press On COVID-19 Stimulus And Omnibus Spending Bills" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5cGBrmxDUNkC2v0ZKWwsBJwgQPw=/0x0:4100x2733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68562461/1292321546.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tasos Katopodis / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jXILH2"&gt;On Monday, &lt;a href="https://docs.house.gov/floor/Default.aspx?date=2020-12-21"&gt;congressional leaders unveiled&lt;/a&gt; their massive spending and coronavirus relief measure, including a handful of controversial copyright measures civil liberties activists fear could penalize internet users for everyday online behavior. Congress is expected to vote on the package as early as Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fC24OH"&gt;Congress’ $2.3 trillion spending and relief package includes controversial measures previously introduced as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20703742/case-act-copyright-office-online-designers-congress-bill"&gt;the CASE Act&lt;/a&gt;, the Trademark Modernization Act, and a &lt;a href="https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2020/12/tillis-releases-text-of-bipartisan-legislation-to-fight-illegal-streaming-by-criminal-organizations"&gt;felony streaming proposal&lt;/a&gt; — all significantly expanding the rights and powers of intellectual property owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGcuTF"&gt;Most controversially, the CASE Act would create &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20927545/copyright-bill-house-congress-hakeem-jeffries-case-act-dmca"&gt;a quasi-judicial tribunal&lt;/a&gt; of “Copyright Claims Officers” who would work to resolve infringement claims. As outlined in the bill, copyright holders could be awarded up to $30,000 if they find their creative work being shared online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V89GY0"&gt;Proponents of the CASE Act, like the Copyright Alliance, argue that the bill would make it easier for independent artists &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20927545/copyright-bill-house-congress-hakeem-jeffries-case-act-dmca"&gt;to bring about copyright claims&lt;/a&gt; without having to endure the lengthy and expensive federal courts process. Still, critics of the bill, like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Fight for the Future, argue that the CASE Act could fine ordinary internet users for engaging in everyday online behavior like sharing memes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5Cr4GB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The CASE Act is a terribly written law that will threaten ordinary Internet users”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4pSfSE"&gt;“The CASE Act is a terribly written law that will threaten ordinary Internet users with huge fines for everyday online activity. It’s absurd that lawmakers included these provisions in a must-pass spending bill,” Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future, said in a statement Monday. “We’re facing a massive eviction crisis and millions are unemployed due to the pandemic, but Congressional leaders could only muster $600 stimulus checks for COVID relief, but managed to cram in handouts for content companies like Disney?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSupEh"&gt;The multitrillion-dollar package also includes a provision authored by Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) that would allow the Justice Department to charge businesses for felony copyright infringement if they intentionally stream copyrighted material online. The &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/congress-year-end-parting-shots-at-big-tech-e26aede2-6566-49dd-94e6-3301e25904ca.html"&gt;Trademark Modernization Act&lt;/a&gt; would allow third parties to request the Patent Office to reject trademark applications in an effort to combat “trademark trolls” who make money off of trademarks they never planned to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3LuC9"&gt;As congressional leaders have worked to finalize this package over the last few weeks, a coalition of tech trade groups and advocacy organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Internet Association urged lawmakers to refuse inclusion of these measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="li616T"&gt;These groups claimed that the proposals could “have negative impacts on small- and medium-sized businesses, creators, libraries and their patrons, students, teachers, educational institutions, religious institutions, fan communities, internet users, and free expression,” in a letter first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/amp/copyright-provisions-in-spending-bill-2649260098"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoOnTy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbeSG0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slavery and overfishing on the high seas can’t hide from these researchers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Thailand’s Seafood Industry Under Scrutiny" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eAlmsRq9hre23iBXgqGcAPYyBT8=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68562296/507983002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fish are seen after being unloaded from a boat at the port in Songkhla on February 2, 2016. Around 100 people have been arrested by authorities in a recent crackdown on abuses involving Thailand’s multi-billion dollar seafood industry. The deep-rooted problem caused the huge global brand, Nestle in 2015 to admit that it had discovered clear evidence of slavery at sea in parts of the Thai supply chain.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Paula Bronstein / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kPTCzS"&gt;A tracking system designed to help ships avoid crashing into each other has become an important tool for spotting bad behavior on the high seas. Researchers can now put a spotlight on corporations that dominate fishing in unregulated international waters where it’s easier to get away with overfishing. And it’s giving us a better idea of how widespread slave labor could be on fishing vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TGwzLM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That all makes it easier to make companies answer for any abuses they commit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E8VutY"&gt;Two recently published papers use this technology, the maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS), to make high-seas fishing a little less mysterious. The first study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;One Earth&lt;/em&gt; on December 18th, traces the origins of thousands of high-seas fishing vessels back to big-time corporations that keep store shelves stocked with seafood. Other researchers use AIS to reveal telltale markers of forced labor on fishing boats, which were published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;). That all makes it easier to make companies answer for any abuses they commit at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlqfRq"&gt;The technology, the maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS), has actually been around for about two decades. Basically, vessels carry around a box that sends out radio signals that anyone else can pick up on. Those radio signals share information about the ship, an identifying number, and other things like its size, course, and speed. That’s supposed to help vessels spot each other so they don’t get in each other’s way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZIHS6"&gt;Satellites can pick up on those radio signals, too, giving researchers a new set of eyes on the vast high seas — international waters that make up almost two-thirds of the world’s oceans. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/14/7219261/global-fishing-watch-map-tracks-illegal-fishing-across-the-globe"&gt;In 2014&lt;/a&gt;, Google and environmental nonprofit organizations Oceana and SkyTruth launched Global Fishing Watch, an initiative to track fishing vessels around the world as a way to potentially prevent and hold vessels accountable for abusive practices. Global Fishing Watch, which is now its own nonprofit, uses AIS and smaller national vessel tracking systems to create a near-real time map tracing the movement of about 60,000 commercial fishing boats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="OWX999"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A game-changer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2ubRZh"&gt;That was a game-changer for Jennifer Jacquet, an associate professor in New York University’s Department of Environmental Studies. She turned to Global Fishing Watch to identify for the first time seafood companies that own vessels fishing on the high seas. “Just in the course of my project, new technology enabled the research in a way that wasn’t there when the project began,” Jacquet tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Her team put together a list of the top 10 corporate actors in high-sea fishing in 2018, which includes Dongwon Group, which owns the popular tuna brand StarKist.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwoFo"&gt;“There are few laws and regulations that apply to the high seas, and that is being used by these companies to do whatever they want,” says Daniel Pauly, an acclaimed marine biologist who has documented the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771419307644"&gt;demise of fish&lt;/a&gt; populations around the world. He has pushed for a &lt;a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/a-global-ban-on-fishing-on-the-high-seas-the-time-is-now#:~:text=the%20High%20Seas%3F-,The%20Time%20Is%20Now,of%20the%20fishing%20industry%20itself."&gt;complete ban&lt;/a&gt; on fishing on the high seas. (Pauly is on the board of directors for Oceana but was not involved in Jacquet’s study.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgMu14"&gt;Modern-day slavery is another problem on the high seas. Up to 26 percent of 16,000 industrial fishing vessels were likely to use forced labor, the &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt; study published today found. As many as 100,000 people are estimated to work on those ships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUjwYn"&gt;The study authors used AIS data from 2012 to 2018 to study the behavior of vessels that had already been documented using slavery. That allowed them to see how those ships behaved differently from other vessels: they stay away from ports and spend a lot more time on the high seas, for example. The researchers used that information to build a computer model that can identify vessels showing behaviors that suggest that they might also rely on forced labor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tQfVBv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It could not have been done five years ago.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jkDJWt"&gt;“This research, this paper, it could not have been done five years ago,” says Gavin McDonald, lead author of that study. “There would have just been no way to track this many vessels at a global scale without Global Fishing Watch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BM2hL"&gt;There’s still a lot of elbow grease that goes into turning the data from AIS into research that can have an impact on how responsibly the fishing industry operates. Data scientists at Global Fishing Watch had tried to automate this process in the past, but scraping the internet couldn’t get the same results. “You end up with one level, but you actually need to dig deeper,” says Nate Miller, a senior data scientist at Global Fishing Watch who was a co-author with Jacquet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWYz8E"&gt;Jacquet and Miller’s team for this project did just that. One of their colleagues found that several high-seas fishing vessels shared the same address, even though they listed different owners. She searched for the address on Google Maps, zoomed in to see the sign on the building, and tied all those ships to Pacific Fishing &amp;amp; Supply based in Hawaii. It fulfilled one of Jacquet’s hopes for this study, which was to identify new players on the high seas since a lot of the spotlight so far had been on Asia-based companies.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="eEUx4M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More transparency has already forced some companies to act&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r7tNg0"&gt;More transparency has already forced some companies to act. The Walmart Foundation funded McDonald’s study after a 2015 investigation by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/10/-sp-migrant-workers-new-life-enslaved-thai-fishing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/29784df39a66431a83e7c4ba2d2fcaaa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Walmart sold shrimp tied to slave labor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrWVGj"&gt;If the high seas aren’t so lawless in the future, we may have researchers like these to thank. Their work could inform a new treaty being negotiated by the United Nations. If it comes to fruition next year, it could establish protected areas in the high seas to safeguard marine life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UdBPJ6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QxaPHG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile won’t claim it has a more reliable 5G network following ad board decision</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/931zRO0Gh-AIwkcC0fag7OjUwyU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68562292/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TWEAvQ"&gt;T-Mobile has been asked to stop advertising its 5G network as more reliable than the competition by the National Advertising Review Board (NARB), which investigated T-Mobile’s claims made primarily in an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F405228998&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F21%2F22193839%2Ftmobile-5g-reliability-claims-verizon-competition-nad#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad featuring celebrity scientist Bill Nye&lt;/a&gt; after complaints from Verizon earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koZpLU"&gt;But the NARB also says T-Mobile shouldn’t have to mention the speed of its network when broadly discussing coverage superiority in future ads. T-Mobile has said it will comply with the recommendation. But it cast the recommendations as a partial win in a statement saying it “appreciates that the panel agreed that T-Mobile can continue to advertise its superior 5G coverage without qualification.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2X7Y2"&gt;T-Mobile’s compliance is notable because telecom giants don’t have to follow the recommendations offered by the NARB, which, as a self-regulatory body under the umbrella of a nonprofit organization, has no governmental regulatory power. For instance, AT&amp;amp;T flatly ignored a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265048/att-5g-e-misleading-advertising-recommendation-narb"&gt;request it stop using its misleading “5G E” logo&lt;/a&gt; to reference a superior form of 4G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="m4kXop"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile was using Bill Nye to tout its 5G networks as more reliable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TTIJbG"&gt;Today’s decision from the NARB breaks partly with the recommendation from the National Advertising Division (NAD), the other half of the self-regulatory body that oversees telecom advertising in the US. (The NARB is the appellate division, designed to settle disputes that arise when a company appeals a recommendation, as T-Mobile did.) The NAD &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/financial/t-mobile-advised-to-stop-claims-about-5g-reliability"&gt;ruled in August&lt;/a&gt; that T-Mobile should have to disclose the speed of its network when claiming its 5G network offers superior reliability. T-Mobile appealed, kicking the decision to the NARB and resulting in a slightly more favorable outcome for T-Mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aewelk"&gt;The video in question, one of a few starring Nye after he was hired by T-Mobile to be a king of 5G spokesman for the brand, features claims from Nye that Verizon’s 5G coverage, because it’s based on mmWave technology, has abysmal range equivalent to about the size of a bus stop. T-Mobile, because it was using much slower but more reliable low-band 5G, said its network had more reliable coverage while also making claims about superior reliability when compared to 4G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqHc8g"&gt;“Other carriers have 5G signals that drop if you move two feet. That’s because their 5G is based around millimeter wave, otherwise known as high band. For instance this is how far 5G reaches with our carriers,” Nye says in the video, showing a small red circle around an outdoor bus stop filled with mannequins. Nye then shows how moving the arm of one of the mannequins holding a smartphone from within the red circle to outside it would switch coverage from 5G to 4G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6en6Ft"&gt;The NARB says T-Mobile should “discontinue claims and an accompanying demonstration that imply that other carriers’ 5G coverage is so limited in any area as to cover only the space taken up by a single bench.” The board also recommended T-Mobile “discontinue claims that imply that its 5G service is generally available in locations that have traditionally been challenging for cellular service” unless it’s willing to say what speeds it can achieve in those locations. Lastly, T-Mobile can’t imply that its 5G coverage is more reliable than 4G coverage, either its own or that of competitors’ networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Yahy7"&gt;Here’s a more in-depth explanation from the NARB as to how it came to the conclusion that T-Mobile’s claims were misleading: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="zYegPw"&gt;The NARB panel determined that T-Mobile’s express reliability assertions would be understood as comparing its 5G network to 4G networks, and that this message cannot be supported based on coverage, as T-Mobile’s 5G network does not equal or surpass its own 4G coverage or that of competitors. Further, the panel concluded that, in context, the claim that T-Mobile’s low-band 5G signal is more reliable than competing 5G signals should be evaluated with at least some insight concerning network performance beyond coverage. Because T-Mobile offered no such support for its 5G network reliability claims, parity or otherwise, the panel recommended that T-Mobile’s 5G reliability claims be discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nSteVE"&gt;Much of this is semantics-based arguing that arises as a result of just how messy and confusing the 5G rollout in the US has been. Because 5G has been distributed across different wireless bands, each with its own trade-offs between coverage and speed, the major US telecoms have gone to great lengths to cast their own networks as superior to the competition. This often coincides with the same ads trying to mask the complexity of what type of 5G is being delivered and just how materially different from 4G it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgwUWP"&gt;This has led to quite a few advertising disputes between the major telecoms, with T-Mobile and Verizon sniping at one another in ads and in complaints to bodies like the NAD / NARB. By the time most consumers are actually using 5G, which requires they have a newer phone and live in an area with reliable coverage, most of these pointless ad squabbles will likely have been forgotten. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvLFiN"&gt;But that won’t stop these corporations from nitpicking one another’s advertising spots for any little discrepancy they can find, nor will it stop those same companies from complaining about inaccuracies from probably peddling one of their own in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Civil rights groups move to block expansion of facial recognition in airports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SlVLf6TwX4b3-NdL-Il6OICYKRI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68561466/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wNcmW4"&gt;A coalition of civil rights groups led by the American Civil Liberties Union have &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/immigrants-rights/cbps-plan-to-expand-face-surveillance-at-airports-is-a-civil-liberties-disaster-in-the-making/"&gt;filed an objection&lt;/a&gt; to the proposed expansion of Customs and Border Protections facial recognition at land and sea ports. The National Immigration Law Center, Fight for the Future, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation are also participating in the motion, alongside twelve others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E8N6QX"&gt;Filed in November, CBP’s proposed rule would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188526/airport-facial-recognition-us-customs-biometric-exit-expansion"&gt;expand the biometric exit system&lt;/a&gt;, authorizing the collection of facial images from any non-citizen entering the country. But in a filing on Monday, the final day of the comment period, the coalition argued that those measures are too extreme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJAsA4"&gt;“CBP’s proposed use of face surveillance at airports, sea ports, and the land border would put the United States on an extraordinarily dangerous path toward the normalization of this surveillance,” said Ashley Gorski, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s National Security Project, in a statement to reporters. “The deployment of this society-changing technology is unnecessary and unjustified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9LCfJX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The program “could enable systematic surveillance by other government agencies and foreign governments,” says ACLU&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0sd2bL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/comment-civil-society-organizations-opposition-cbp-nprm-expanding-biometric-data-collection-us"&gt;The filing&lt;/a&gt; raises a variety of legal objections to the expansion, in particular arguing that Congress did not intend to authorize long-term facial recognition when it mandated biometric exit tracking in 1996. At the time, Congress left the specific method open to interpretation, but the technology for algorithmic facial recognition from a video feed was not yet developed enough to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Sz5yo"&gt;The filing also points out that CBP’s proposed collection is more invasive than a simple photograph. Maintaining a facial recognition system will mean creating face prints from the collected images, which will be stored for 75 years and “may be used not only by DHS, but by foreign governments and federal, state, and local law enforcement to identify individuals for a variety of purposes, far removed from the reasons for CBP’s initial collection,” the filing reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3XMQp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-pia-cbp006-ats-december2019.pdf"&gt;CBP’s privacy assessment&lt;/a&gt; for the project details some of those additional purposes, stating that photographs collected by the program will also be scanned against the terrorist screening database, &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/tecs-system-cbp-primary-and-secondary-processing-tecs-national-sar-initiative"&gt;TECS alerts&lt;/a&gt;, and outstanding warrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVDm8o"&gt;“CBP’s collection of faceprints could enable systematic surveillance by other government agencies and foreign governments,” the filing argues. “It could expose where people go, who they associate with, and even what they believe, based on the religious services, protests, or meetings they attend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ya70m"&gt;On a procedural note, the civil rights groups also argue the proposal is unlawful because of broader concerns over the appointment of Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf. In November, a federal judge &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/federal-judge-rules-acting-dhs-head-chad-wolf-unlawfully-appointed-n1247848"&gt;ruled that Wolf’s appointment to the position&lt;/a&gt; violated the order of succession for active appointments, and overturned a memorandum from Wolf’s office as a result. It’s unclear whether this same logic could be successfully applied to CBP’s rule-making motion, which was not issued directly from Wolf’s office. Still, the issue is likely to shed further doubt on the proposed rule.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Zoom escape button is the holiday gift everyone actually needs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cnrsryHO39ZZ1Jm9BEcMN28hfNc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68561178/staples_easy_button.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Staples&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kz896u"&gt;The worst part of most Zoom meetings is the end. Not because it’s the moment when we have to lose human connection after being isolated for months during the COVID-19 pandemic. The end of a Zoom meeting is the worst because it’s so dang hard to quickly and gracefully end a call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJyzbZ"&gt;With a typical not-Zoom call on a smartphone, you bring the phone down from your ear and tap the end call button. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKW4Qh"&gt;On a Zoom meeting, you say your goodbye pleasantries, put your hand on your mouse, find your mouse on your screen, move it in the right direction toward the end call button, overshoot said button in your desperation to leave the meeting as soon as possible, and then finally click the button, all on video, where anyone who is still in the meeting can see the growing desperation in your eyes as you go through this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeJmDx"&gt;Brian Moore, a creative director at Anomaly, took it upon himself to make leaving Zoom meetings easier. He made a way to use a physical lamp cord that he can pull on to instantly leave the meeting. Just watch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lanewinfield/status/1339257875034566656"&gt;this thing of beauty&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2fQWMX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I always awkwardly struggle to get to the end call button on video calls. So I made this &lt;a href="https://t.co/4z4zsxNkeQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4z4zsxNkeQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brian Moore (@lanewinfield) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lanewinfield/status/1339257875034566656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kL5Xjc"&gt;And if this looked like something you want to have for yourself, I have good news for you: Moore shared all of the files you’ll need &lt;a href="https://github.com/lanewinfield/zoomout"&gt;to make something like it on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cbVhJ"&gt;Now I’m imagining other ways I could quickly escape Zoom meetings. Perhaps smashing a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2FStaples-Easy-Button%2Fproduct_606396&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F22193417%2Fzoom-escape-button-holiday-gift-brian-moore-cord-github#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Staples Easy Button&lt;/a&gt;? Throwing a giant switch like what you’d see in a &lt;a href="https://gifteee.com/products/frankenstein-light-switch-plate-3d-printed-turn-any-room-into-a-mad-scientist-lab"&gt;campy horror movie&lt;/a&gt;? Or, like David Zhou, making a way to end calls &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dz/status/1339600939980709893"&gt;after sighing loudly&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nmyA2q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;inspired by this, i made a script that automatically quits &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zoom_us?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@zoom_us&lt;/a&gt; when i sigh really loudly &lt;a href="https://t.co/tJUdSBPt1L"&gt;https://t.co/tJUdSBPt1L&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/jzsh5BCi8p"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jzsh5BCi8p&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— David Zhou (@dz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dz/status/1339600939980709893?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1X5Pls"&gt;The possibilities seem endless here, and I hope more people create fun ways to quickly get out of their Zoom calls. Maybe they will be the 2021 trend that replaces having a creative Zoom background.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix and Arthur Conan Doyle’s estate agree to dismiss lawsuit over Sherlock Holmes’ emotions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Enola Holmes still" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IaiL1XrLb9gYhEZrhJ77-AUL0EM=/669x0:2931x1508/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68560767/EbW13aZXkAImms8.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EGPxlT"&gt;Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s estate and the creators of Netflix movie &lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes&lt;/em&gt; have &lt;a href="https://copyrightlately.com/themencode-pdf-viewer-sc/?tnc_pvfw=ZmlsZT1odHRwczovL2NvcHlyaWdodGxhdGVseS5jb20vd3AtY29udGVudC91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjAvMTIvQ29uYW4tRG95bGUtRXN0YXRlLXYuLVNwcmluZ2VyLVN0aXB1bGF0aW9uLXRvLURpc21pc3MtV2l0aC1QcmVqdWRpY2UucGRmJnNldHRpbmdzPTEwMTEwMDExMDEwMTAxMTExMDAmbGFuZz1lbi1VUw==#page=&amp;amp;zoom=&amp;amp;pagemode=none"&gt;agreed to dismiss&lt;/a&gt; a copyright lawsuit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302942/netflix-enola-holmes-sherlock-arthur-conan-doyle-estate-lawsuit-copyright-infringement"&gt;over Sherlock Holmes’ emotions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://copyrightlately.com/enola-holmes-copyright-lawsuit-dismissed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Copyright Lately&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on the outcome today, noting that the court didn’t rule on the merits of the case, possibly indicating that the parties settled. So unfortunately, we don’t know if &lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes’&lt;/em&gt; take on Doyle’s famous detective violated copyright by showing a wider range of feelings and greater respect for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RHWDOP"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes&lt;/em&gt; case hinged on Sherlock Holmes’ complicated copyright status. Most Holmes stories sit in the public domain, and stories like &lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes&lt;/em&gt; — which reimagines Holmes (played by Henry Cavill) having a younger sister — can freely repurpose their elements. But 10 of Arthur Conan Doyle’s stories are still protected by copyright, and the Doyle estate argued that they depict a meaningfully different version of the character. (He’s more caring, less overtly contemptuous of women and friendship, and generally less of a jerk.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVDrtC"&gt;Doyle’s estate claimed that &lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes&lt;/em&gt; unlawfully used this copyrighted version of Holmes. And it sued author Nancy Springer, who wrote the original &lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes&lt;/em&gt; series of books, along with Netflix, Springer’s publisher, and the film adaptation’s production company. The lawsuit’s defendants &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/enola-holmes-producers-blast-copyright-infringement-suit-from-conan-doyle-estate"&gt;argued that Doyle’s estate&lt;/a&gt; was trying to copyright “generic concepts like warmth, kindness, empathy, or respect” — rather than any specific plot or character elements contained in those stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xD6kWN"&gt;This lawsuit has revived a complicated legal debate over Sherlock Holmes. But the detective likely won’t be under copyright much longer: Doyle’s final stories are set to &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-sherlock-holmes-public-domain-20140805-story.html"&gt;fall into the public domain&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eero Pro 6 review: less pro than expected</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Eero’s top-shelf mesh router is advertised for gigabit speeds, but it doesn’t quite deliver&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="I1efFs"&gt;Eero was the company that first popularized mesh networking for the home, fixing Wi-Fi for millions. It has built a reputation for its simple setup and minimal maintenance, reliably broadcasting a Wi-Fi connection throughout your home much better than a traditional standalone router could. Now that it is owned by Amazon, it promises to repeat that trick for customers who have access to gigabit internet speeds with its top-tier Eero Pro 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16pl2c"&gt;Fixing most home Wi-Fi problems doesn’t have to cost a lot. A basic mesh system can provide reliable Wi-Fi coverage in most homes without costing more than $250. If the speeds you’re getting from your ISP are 300Mbps or less, there’s no real need to buy anything more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VatBQS"&gt;But if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have the privilege of access to faster home internet, such as what gigabit fiber can offer, you might want something more. That’s where high-end Wi-Fi 6-enabled mesh systems like the Eero Pro 6 come in. They can spread your fast connection throughout your home without having to deal with pesky wiring and let you take full advantage of the bandwidth you’re forking money over for each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFZ4aj"&gt;Earlier this year, I looked at one of the first Wi-Fi 6 mesh routers to see if it could give me better speeds on my gigabit Fios service than earlier Wi-Fi 5-based systems could. And it did: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21283756/arris-surfboard-max-pro-wi-fi-6-mesh-router-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Arris Surfboard Max Pro&lt;/a&gt; was able to deliver more of the bandwidth I pay for to my devices, even if I wasn’t in the same room as the router. But each Arris node is a massive unit, the app to manage the router is clumsy at best, I ran into some frustrating reliability issues, and it cost $650 at the time of my review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r06bWq"&gt;The $599 Eero Pro 6 I’ve been testing, on the other hand, is compact, reliable, and just as easy to set up as Eero’s lower-tier models. But unfortunately, it doesn’t bring the performance that justifies its price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uj0Xoh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10245537"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aY6ehT"&gt;Eero Pro 6 pricing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Ao6yMm"&gt;The Eero Pro 6 system that I tested is the top-tier package, which includes three nodes and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-eero-pro-6-3-pack/dp/B085VNCZHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sells for $599&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s been marked down to as low as $480 during the holiday shopping season). Eero also sells single units for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eero-Pro-6-Router/dp/B085VNCZHL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$229 each&lt;/a&gt; or a&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eero-Pro-6-Router/dp/B08KXCKC4Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; two-pack for $399&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxMQxR"&gt;These pricing details are important because, frankly, every tri-band Wi-Fi 6 mesh system is expensive, and Eero is no exception. Compared to Eero’s prior-generation Pro model, the Eero Pro 6 is 20 percent more costly. It is also &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; more expensive than Eero’s non-“Pro” lineup, which starts at just $249 for a Wi-Fi 5-based system with three nodes (and can frequently be found for a lot less). Eero’s entry-level Wi-Fi 6 mesh systems are similarly approachable at $279 for a three-pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uCD0cv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Eero Pro 6 is 20 percent more expensive than the model it replaces&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IiX0Xd"&gt;How many nodes you require depends on the size and layout of your home. Eero claims each unit covers up to 2,000 square feet, but that’s in a perfect scenario, which your home most certainly is not. My test environment is a 2,100-square-foot split-level home built in the 1960s, with the internet connection coming in on the middle floor. I placed the other two nodes on the lower and upper floors, where my home office and the bedrooms are. The Eero Pro 6 system allows for hard-wiring each node together, which you can’t do with the base Eero 6, but my home is not wired up to support this, so I have to rely on wireless connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="on0cj9"&gt;Eero is not alone in charging a premium for a tri-band Wi-Fi 6 based system targeted at those with gigabit internet service. As mentioned, the Arris system I tested earlier this year is $650, while Netgear, Linksys, and others all have options in the $500 to $700 range and sometimes even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVDl5p"&gt;If you’re going to pay more for faster speeds, you damn well better get them. You should be able to get the majority of your gigabit bandwidth throughout your home. After all, that’s the whole point of a mesh system. And if you’re thinking of upgrading from a Wi-Fi 5 mesh system, you should see a measurable increase in speeds to your devices. Basically, any mesh system on the market can blanket thousands of square feet with a strong wireless signal and support dozens of simultaneously connected devices. What you’re paying for here is the speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HPeCMQR7l2ExIrS8Iq-giA-Aqa4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170468/dseifert_201213_4337_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eero Pro 6 is a simple-looking squarish white box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="18ZEHP"&gt;Eero Pro 6 performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="x8qTny"&gt;Unfortunately, speed is where the Eero Pro 6 disappoints the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7S3l1"&gt;I tested the Eero Pro 6 using gigabit Verizon Fios service and compared its performance to the Wi-Fi 5 Eero Pro, Linksys’ Velop MX4200, and the Arris Surfboard Max Pro AX11000 I reviewed previously. As this is a live home network (aka not a lab) and I have a lot of connected devices, there are anywhere from 60 to 70 devices on the network at the same time, of which half a dozen or so actually support Wi-Fi 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McaOfL"&gt;The Eero Pro 6 did perform slightly better than the Wi-Fi 5 version, but not significantly so. On average, speeds to my devices were about 10 to 15 percent better than the Wi-Fi 5 Eero Pro, averaging 300Mbps no matter how close to the router I was. Frustratingly, many times, my smaller Wi-Fi 6 devices, such as phones and tablets, couldn’t hit more than 200Mbps down, though they were able to double that speed on uploads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VZ48H7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pro 6 did perform better than Eero’s Wi-Fi 5 routers, but not hugely so&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rtcGVu"&gt;A note on Wi-Fi 6 itself: Wi-Fi 6 brings a long list of advancements to wireless networking, including support for many more connected devices on a single network, faster theoretical top speeds, and improved battery life on devices connected to a Wi-Fi 6 network. To take advantage of many of the features, such as the improved battery life and faster top speeds, you need to be using a Wi-Fi 6 device, such as a very recent smartphone or laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmaOTd"&gt;Wi-Fi 6 is specifically designed to address the changing dynamics of home networks where more and more devices are connected at the same time. But to get that improved network management and reliability, every device that’s connected needs to be Wi-Fi 6. (Wi-Fi 6 is backwards compatible with the older Wi-Fi 4 and Wi-Fi 5 technologies, so everything you currently have will connect to it just fine.) That isn’t to say using a Wi-Fi 5 device on a Wi-Fi 6 network will ruin the experience, but you won’t get the full benefit of everything Wi-Fi 6 has to offer until all of your devices are updated to support it. For more detail on what Wi-Fi 6 brings to the table, go read my colleague Jake Kastrenakes’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18232026/wi-fi-6-speed-explained-router-wifi-how-does-work"&gt;breakdown of it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9ToL4"&gt;What Wi-Fi 6 offers right now is the ability for the nodes of a mesh network to send data to the main router faster than what was available over Wi-Fi 5. Those speeds can then be sent directly to your smartphone, laptop, or gaming console that’s connected to a nearby mesh node, even if those devices aren’t using Wi-Fi 6 themselves. You can get even faster speeds if you connect your computer or console to the mesh node with an Ethernet cable, even if you are a few rooms away from where the internet connection comes into your home, an ideal benefit if your home isn’t wired up for networking, such as mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhaqhA"&gt;With a desktop computer hardwired into one of the secondary Pro 6 nodes (which then uses a Wi-Fi connection to link to the main router a floor above), I was able to get download speeds above 400Mbps and sometimes up to 500Mbps, or about half of my available bandwidth. That’s a good 100 to 200Mbps faster than I typically saw from the Eero Pro 5 system, but still makes a lot of my bandwidth inaccessible. Again, upload speeds were much stronger, but when you’re downloading a massive AAA game and just want to get playing, fast upload speeds are a small consolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXZRFO"&gt;The Linksys Velop MX4200, which has similar specs to the Eero Pro, performed almost identically, with speeds capping out at just over 300Mbps and most smaller devices not pulling more than 200Mbps down. That’s not enough of a difference for me to recommend spending $500 or $600 to upgrade from a Wi-Fi 5-based mesh system if you already have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5t0AQT"&gt;The Arris’ more complex antenna array did provide a significant speed bump over Wi-Fi 5 systems and both the Eero Pro 6 and Linksys units. My mobile devices were consistently able to achieve connection speeds over 400Mbps, while hardwiring into the remote node allowed me to see near gigabit downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="oOfMIJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like prior Eero systems, the Pro 6 proved to be very reliable over weeks of testing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Iqire5"&gt;Though the Eero disappointed me on actual speeds, it proved very reliable, with great stability throughout my weeks of testing. It hops devices from one node to another well as I move around the house, and it’s able to handle the load of remote working and schooling that often includes multiple concurrent video calls without dropping connections or choking. 4K video streams are possible anywhere in my home, and I never had to worry about what my kids were doing on the network if I needed to make a critical video call or upload a large file for work. It bested the Arris in this respect, which often needed to be rebooted to get its mesh node to reconnect to the main router and had trouble roaming devices from one node to the other as I moved through the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Idf8bD"&gt;But I was able to get that same kind of reliability with the older Wi-Fi 5 system and the same internet service, so you don’t need to buy an Eero Pro 6 setup to experience it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9vZgW"&gt;My test results are far from scientific. I’m testing in a single home with a single service and using internet connection speeds averaged across a variety of speed test services as a metric, which network administrators would turn their nose up at. But while some folks might be more concerned with how fast they can shuffle files around their home network, the vast majority of people just want to have a fast connection to the internet no matter where they are in their home. It’s why you’re paying for a gigabit internet connection to begin with. Dong Ngo’s&lt;a href="https://dongknows.com/amazon-eero-pro-6-tri-band-mesh-router-review/"&gt; testing over at DongKnows&lt;/a&gt; shows that in file transfer scenarios, the Eero Pro 6 sits about middle of the pack, despite its top-shelf pricing. Numerous &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/eero/comments/jt49f2/megathread_eero_issues/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf"&gt;user reports on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; also complain about modest to no internet speed increases over Wi-Fi 5-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bG8WkC"&gt;During my test period, the Eero Pro 6 system received a handful of software updates (which are delivered automatically; there’s no way to force an update), including a recent update to version 6.1. Some users have reported noticeable speed increases with the 6.1 update, but after redoing a number of tests, the speeds on my network have remained consistent with earlier software versions, with the most noticeable improvement seen when I am hardwired into a mesh node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SZVunxQc98OD80snx4xwCyQ1B8g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170472/dseifert_201213_4337_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compared to other tri-band Wi-Fi 6 systems, the Eero Pro 6 is much smaller and more discreet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="e8IUwW"&gt;Eero Pro 6 design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="fwYyQe"&gt;Something that the Eero Pro 6 has over all of its Wi-Fi 6 competition is aesthetics. The Eero Pro 6 node is so much smaller than any other tri-band system, which makes it easier to place in your home and doesn’t stick out like a sore thumb if you do have to keep it in a living area. It’s a little larger than the old Eero Pro and certainly not as discreet as the Eero Beacon, but it’s tiny compared to the high-end Wi-Fi 6 routers from Netgear, Linksys, and Arris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UjUn0"&gt;Another feature that sets Eero apart from most of the other Wi-Fi 6 mesh systems is you can mix and match the new Wi-Fi 6 units with older Wi-Fi 5 nodes. If you already own an Eero system and don’t want to wholly replace every unit, buying one or two nodes and integrating them into your existing network could be an appealing option, though you will only get the benefits of Wi-Fi 6 when you’re connected to one of the new nodes, which you can’t always predict or rely on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7A0YM"&gt;You give up some things, though. Just like the older Eero Pro, the Pro 6 has just two Ethernet ports on the back, one of which will be occupied by the cable coming from your modem. If you have any number of devices that you plan to hardwire into the router, you’ll definitely need to get a multiport switch. There is no way to hook up a storage drive directly to the Pro 6, either, as its lone USB-C port is used for its power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xIZJr9"&gt;There’s just one LED light on the front of the Eero. It glows blue during setup, is a static white when everything is working as it should, and glows red when there isn’t an internet connection. For any more detail than that, you’ll have to go to the Eero app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h738jxIjz2kPauKxnnnxmeHoxqU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170470/dseifert_201213_4337_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are just two Ethernet ports on each Eero Pro 6 node. Other routers offer up to four on each.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PVZk8xrf6ToXI3xz0GZmh0fkXY0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170473/dseifert_201213_4337_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lone visual indicator on the Pro 6 is a single LED that changes colors based on network status.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K9O182"&gt;The Eero Pro 6 is rated as an AX4200 system, which is an obtuse way of describing what its peak networking speeds are. That rating puts it in the middle of the pack of tri-band Wi-Fi 6 mesh systems: it’s the same as Linksys’ $499 Velop MX4200 but lower than the AX6600 and AX11000 systems from Netgear and Arris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="836nMn"&gt;As this is a tri-band system, the Eero Pro 6 supports three Wi-Fi bands: the standard 2.4GHz and 5GHz ones most Wi-Fi routers offer, plus another 5GHz band to allow the nodes to send data back and forth without competing with your device traffic. Unlike other systems, which separate device traffic and mesh node traffic between the two 5GHz bands, Eero’s system will just use whatever lane it determines is the most efficient, so it doesn’t have a “dedicated backhaul” band that others advertise. In theory, the two 5GHz bands should provide enough bandwidth for gigabit speeds to your devices, though one of them has half as many antennas as the other, which does have an impact on throughput. That’s why Eero’s AX4200 rating is lower than others, which offer more antennas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUYUUT"&gt;In addition to its Wi-Fi radios, the Eero Pro 6 has Thread and Zigbee smart home radio support, so you can use it as a hub for smart home devices, which are then managed through the Alexa app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SKM4qG"&gt;Eero Pro 6 app and setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TyXn1y"&gt;Setting up the Eero Pro 6 is just as easy and straightforward as the company’s prior models. You download the app to your phone, plug in the first node, and follow the prompts. The app walks you through adding the additional nodes, creating your network and password, and turning on features such as a guest network or Eero’s subscription-based security and parental control features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="gXe7zW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10245547"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FZhyx5"&gt;Unfortunately, the app is &lt;em&gt;the only&lt;/em&gt; way to manage the network. Eero doesn’t offer any web interface at all, and using the app requires you to create an Eero account and have an active internet connection on your phone before you set up the network. This is becoming a popular trend among mesh systems — both Arris and Google’s systems work the same way — but Eero was arguably the first to popularize an app-only experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gd3le3"&gt;The Eero app is also surprisingly limited, especially for a high-end system that’s ostensibly designed for power users. It offers very few network management controls, lacks things like Dynamic DNS, and doesn’t let you separate out the 2.4GHz network from the 5GHz one for greater transparency. It displays a list of all of my connected devices, but it does a poor job of automatically identifying them, so I had to go in and manually figure out which one was which through its IP address before I could apply parental controls or other filters to it. (Eero is not alone in this issue, every other router management app I’ve used struggles with it as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfWVVi"&gt;Most of these limitations are easy to ignore on entry-level mesh systems where the main thing that matters is reliable coverage. And Eero would likely argue that its algorithms are more effective at managing network load than the average person futzing with settings. Most people just want to turn the thing on and have it work. But on a $600 system that’s advertised for gigabit home internet service and has “Pro” in its name, the hands-off approach is frustrating and limits how much control over your own network you have. As it is, Eero offers the exact same app experience whether you pay $100 for an entry-level node or the full $600 for the top-tier system. It could do well to add more pro features to its “Pro” router.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vuUdM"&gt;The Eero Pro 6 does not support Apple HomeKit, even though Eero’s older models do. I asked Eero, and the company said it is working with Apple to get it certified for HomeKit, but there isn’t a specific release date for it. Another option not yet available on the Eero Pro 6 is the toggle for “optimizing for conference and gaming” in the Labs section of the app’s settings. This is the closest thing Eero offers to quality of service management and is designed to prioritize devices that are currently on video calls or playing games. The company says it is working on adding it to the Eero Pro 6 in future updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VRia9H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to excuse limited network management features on a system with “Pro” in its name&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9qyS5C"&gt;Like its other routers, Eero offers some subscription-based services on the Eero Pro 6. These include ad filtering, malware protection, content filters, and access to paid apps such as Encrypt.me and 1Password. The base Eero Secure plan costs $29.99 per year and includes everything but the paid apps; the Secure Plus plan runs $99 per year and adds those apps in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91EBMg"&gt;I’m hesitant to recommend paying for either of these services, as competing routers offer content filtering and parental controls for free, both of which are table stakes features. The other problem is Eero is not transparent at all about what the threat blocks and security features are actually doing. It just shows you a report of blocks it made on specific devices but doesn’t say anything about what they were or what caused the threats. The ad filtering is also less effective than content blockers on your browser in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zefoqfLSIUE_iWTsuKlSklqh02k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22187624/eero_app_screenshots_4up.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eero’s subscription plans offer security features but provide little info as to what they are actually doing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yuSg3N"&gt;The only way the subscription makes sense is if you were planning to pay for 1Password and Encrypt.me anyway, as the bundle is less expensive than parting them out separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYPzNH"&gt;Lastly, it’s important to note that Eero is wholly owned by Amazon and that using its routers requires an Eero account. You can further link an Amazon account to your Eero account to make use of Amazon’s Simple Setup features and the built-in Zigbee smart home hub. Eero outlines the data it collects in &lt;a href="https://eero.com/legal/privacy"&gt;its privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;, and, well, it’s a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="gKdbFS"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JqnwkkZ445LMOFk91wr6eKaG27I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170471/dseifert_201213_4337_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eero Pro 6 is a little larger and taller than the Pro 5 system it replaces.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pvnsLj"&gt;Thanks to rapid iteration over the past few years, mesh routers have reached levels of maturity and accessibility that were unthinkable just a short time ago. (Eero’s first model, which arguably broke the door open on mesh Wi-Fi routers, came out in 2016.) That means if a company is going to charge a significant price for a router and claim that it’s ideal for gigabit connections and “pro” uses (whatever that means), it has to really prove that worth with performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxQq3q"&gt;Unfortunately, based on my experience, the Eero Pro 6 doesn’t bring the performance I’d expect at this price tier. It’s slightly faster than the prior generation, but not nearly enough to make an upgrade worthwhile. And it’s not so much better or faster than the less expensive mesh router options currently available, even ones made by Eero itself. That’s not a huge surprise, as Eero’s older systems were never the fastest in the field, but I was hoping for a bigger jump in performance with the Pro 6 than I’ve seen so far, especially given the price increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bOG06b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The smart buyer might want to wait for Wi-Fi 6E routers to arrive&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ygC1oi"&gt;Eero isn’t alone here. My tests showed Linksys Velop MX4200 doesn’t carry its weight either. And even with the routers that do provide faster speeds, you compromise things like aesthetics, reliability, and features (not to mention having to pay even more). The Arris router brought the performance increases I’m looking for, but it’s bigger, uglier, needs more maintenance, and costs more. Wi-Fi 6 routers are still a new thing, only coming to market in the past year, and it seems like they have a ways to go before they are demonstrably better than their Wi-Fi 5 predecessors in everyday use cases (aka outside of a controlled lab).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="s5Zexe"&gt;If you’re thinking of making an investment and can wait, my recommendation would be to do just that. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"&gt;Wi-Fi 6E&lt;/a&gt;, which is the next step in the Wi-Fi technology chain, is expected to arrive in the near future and bring more significant speed and capacity increases. None of today’s routers (or devices) support it yet. But if you are in need of a mesh router right now, you might want to look at options other than the Eero Pro 6.&lt;/p&gt;
