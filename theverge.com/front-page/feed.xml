    <title>Disney Plus is increasing its price to $8 a month starting in March 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="disney+" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NURU4Jv2jhsbR3YmsOAKE7-FaUM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68494456/disneyplus.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zbakLd"&gt;Disney Plus is following Netflix and introducing a $1 price hike for subscribers in the United States, raising it to $7.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2Axkx"&gt;The move comes after a lengthy presentation showing what Disney is bringing to Disney Plus. As the company invests in content, the company has to raise prices to recoup that loss. This is the first time that Disney Plus has received a price hike. It arrives just a couple of months after Netflix announced it was increasing prices for subscribers in the United States, including raising its most popular plan from $13 to $14 a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A8d799"&gt;Although it seems early for a Disney Plus hike, the announcement comes amidst a flurry of other announcements over TV shows and movies heading to Disney Plus. The more that Disney spends on content for its service, the more revenue Disney needs to invest. When Netflix’s Greg Peters, chief operating officer and chief product officer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540346/netflix-price-increase-united-states-standard-premium-content-product-features"&gt;was asked about price hikes&lt;/a&gt;, he said Netflix will “occasionally go back and ask [customers] to pay a little bit more to keep that virtuous cycle of investment and value creation going.” Disney is now doing the same thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kB1pDN"&gt;It’s unclear if price hikes are coming to Disney Plus subscribers in other countries or if this will affect the bundle. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel will not recast Chadwick Boseman’s character in Black Panther 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="black-panther-still" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7sstMc_BQ8E2CdD-bdhq8ghmY-M=/201x0:860x439/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68494442/Screen_Shot_2018_01_11_at_3.47.24_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O4Fmd5"&gt;Marvel Studios is moving forward with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-panther"&gt;Black Panther franchise&lt;/a&gt;, but the studio will not recast Chadwick Boseman’s King T’Challa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjTT2C"&gt;Instead, the movie will pay tribute to the character and the late actor and rely on other characters that appeared in the film, according to Kevin Feige, Marvel Studios chief. Ryan Coogler is still on board to write and direct the film. It’s scheduled to be released on July 8th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ogCmdK"&gt;Boseman &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406395/chadwick-boseman-death-cancer-black-panther-marvel-jackie-robinson"&gt;died earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 43 after battling colon cancer for four years. The actor, who appeared in a number of films including Disney’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/3/11577406/captain-america-civil-war-review-marvel-avengers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain America: Civil War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktPlEn"&gt;“Chadwick’s passing is absolutely devastating,” Kevin Feige, head of Marvel Studios, said in a statement at the time of his death. “He was our T’Challa, our Black Panther, and our dear friend. Each time he stepped on set, he radiated charisma and joy, and each time he appeared on screen, he created something truly indelible. He embodied a lot of amazing people in his work, and nobody was better at bringing great men to life. He was as smart and kind and powerful and strong as any person he portrayed. Now he takes his place alongside them as an icon for the ages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSv7DA"&gt;More details about the film will be announced closer to the film’s release date. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Fantastic Four will join the Marvel Cinematic Universe in an upcoming movie directed by Jon Watts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ly5hbJW7kk7zZmCkQ14xVL8ru4E=/157x0:1792x1090/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68494423/Screen_Shot_2020_12_10_at_8.14.35_PM.5.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ooPxq4"&gt;Marvel Studios Kevin Feige has announced that the company is working on a new Fantastic Four movie, set to be directed by &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Homecoming&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Far From Home&lt;/em&gt; director Jon Watts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBNHxd"&gt;There’s virtually no information on the project outside of Watts’ name and a teaser logo, but the news is exciting, given the Fantastic Four’s history with the Marvel franchise. Known as “Marvel’s First Family,” the Fantastic Four have received several film adaptations in the past from 20th Century Fox already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Imsly3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Jon Watts will direct the new feature film for Marvel's First Family, Fantastic Four! &lt;a href="https://t.co/Eu26ghxbGT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Eu26ghxbGT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Marvel Studios (@MarvelStudios) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelStudios/status/1337200479063994368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rFVFYf"&gt;But the prospect of the characters being able to rejoin the Marvel Studios fold and interact with other characters and movies in the MCU has been one of the most anticipated aspects of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273142/disney-fox-acquistion-final-hulu-marvel-streaming-21st-century"&gt;Disney / Fox purchase&lt;/a&gt; (along with the X-Men, who were not mentioned in today’s investor event.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="amrAWz"&gt;The news comes alongside several major announcements from Marvel Studios, including new trailers for its upcoming Disney Plus shows WandaVision, &lt;em&gt;Falcon and The Winter Solider&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;What If?,&lt;/em&gt; casting news for &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;She Hulk&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Secret Invasion&lt;/em&gt;, new series &lt;em&gt;Ironheart&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Armor Wars&lt;/em&gt;, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsWZ9B"&gt;Marvel Studios has yet to announce a reason date for &lt;em&gt;Fantastic Four&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is now building the chip it needs to ditch Qualcomm like it ditched Intel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_k5lr6Yj4Zrztex-aGj00KL0v4w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68494405/acastro_170731_1777_0005_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wlq4QB"&gt;This fall, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;changed how we thought about laptops overnight&lt;/a&gt;. It replaced the Intel processors in its MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro and Mac Mini with its own homegrown ARM chips instead — and though we were initially skeptical about Apple’s silicon transition, the final product &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;blew us away&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9O24bs"&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/apple-starts-work-on-its-own-cellular-modem-chip-chief-says?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s chip chief has internally revealed that a &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; chip transition is also already in the early stages: a cellular modem that could mean far less need (if any) for Qualcomm chips in Apple’s products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JwfE6"&gt;“This year, we kicked off the development of our first internal cellular modem which will enable another key strategic transition,” Apple hardware SVP Johny Srouji reportedly said, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RRLybX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s only a matter of time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kbRI5t"&gt;If you’ve been following Apple’s struggles with Intel and Qualcomm, this won’t come as much of a surprise: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/8909671/apple-intel-5g-smartphone-modems-acquisition"&gt;Apple bought Intel’s smartphone modem business last July&lt;/a&gt;, which strongly suggested it was only a matter of time before Apple used that purchase to develop its own radio chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fDF3T"&gt;Qualcomm has more than physical radio chips going for it, of course; it also has a tremendous amount of intellectual property around cellular that it licenses to companies like Apple (and has been accused of using in anticompetitive ways, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363629/qualcomm-win-appeal-antitrust-ftc-lawsuit-frand-patents-chips"&gt;it recently won an antitrust suit&lt;/a&gt; against the FTC). Ahead of Apple’s purchase of Intel’s modem business, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18411332/intel-exiting-5g-smartphone-modem-market-apple-qualcomm-settle-dispute"&gt;it reached a surprise settlement with Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt; over patent infringement and struck a multiyear deal around the companies’ wireless IP — one where it wound up paying Qualcomm $4.5 billion, and where Apple wound up getting the Qualcomm chips it needed to build this year’s 5G iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQdu4U"&gt;With its own cellular radios, Apple could at least be less reliant on Qualcomm. At best, it could build a better performing radio and offer better battery life, like it did with its new ARM chips vs. Intel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvF4Xc"&gt;To be honest, the most surprising thing about the &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is that an Apple town hall meeting leaked &lt;em&gt;at all, &lt;/em&gt;considering how secretive the company typically is. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Apple CEO Tim Cook addressed &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-11/apple-s-cook-says-most-staff-won-t-return-to-office-until-june"&gt;when employees might return to the company’s physical offices&lt;/a&gt; during that meeting, saying it “seems likely” that most teams won’t return before June 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel’s Hawkeye TV show will debut on Disney Plus next fall </title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Raymond Hall/GC Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KqSQGx"&gt;Marvel Studios’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18304946/hawkeye-jeremy-renner-marvel-disney-plus-avengers-endgame-kate-bishop"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hawkeye &lt;/em&gt;TV series&lt;/a&gt;, which features Jeremy Renner reprising his role as Clint Barton and Hailee Steinfeld as Kate Bishop, will premiere on Disney Plus next fall.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uh5e7r"&gt;Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige confirmed the news during Disney’s big investor day event to help announce the date for their show. The show takes its inspiration from Matt Fraction’s acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye &lt;/em&gt;comics run that was published between 2012 and 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuSLr3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hawkeye &lt;/em&gt;was one of the many shows Disney Studios announced as part of the initial Disney Plus lineup, alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328889/falcon-winter-soldier-delay-disney-plus-marvel-studios-avengers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448709/wandavision-disney-plus-scarlet-witch-vision-tv-show-series-mcu-marvel-cinematic-universe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/19/17878526/loki-scarlet-witch-disney-streaming-tv-show-marvel-cinematic-universe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Both &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;were supposed to debut this year, but due to ongoing delays and production issues brought on by the pandemic, both were delayed to 2021. &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;will be the first Marvel Studios show to debut on the platform when it hits &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562411/wandavision-premiere-date-disney-plus-marvel-studios-elizabeth-olsen-paul-bettany"&gt;Disney Plus on January 15th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMjIAu"&gt;At Disney’s biennial fan convention in 2019, Feige also announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/23/20830548/she-hulk-moon-knight-disney-plus-streaming-kevin-feige-marvel-cinematic-universe"&gt;three new series&lt;/a&gt; that would also head to Disney Plus — &lt;em&gt;Moon Knight&lt;/em&gt;, which reportedly &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/10/moon-knight-oscar-isaac-marvel-1234602805/"&gt;stars Oscar Isaac&lt;/a&gt; in the lead role, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/ms-marvel-disney-plus-series-casts-iman-vellani-title-role-n1241624"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which stars Iman Vellani as the hero, and &lt;em&gt;She-Hulk&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pafGOg"&gt;More information about Marvel Studios’ roster of Disney Plus shows, including how they may integrate with the bigger Marvel Cinematic Universe-at-large, is expected in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black Widow will remain a theatrical exclusive, despite industry shifts </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Th0PxlP5NQr-G3Y74cpqRP7w7W0=/240x0:1197x638/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68494370/Screen_Shot_2020_11_23_at_9.28.36_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UrmyLx"&gt;Disney is moving several titles to Disney Plus, either for free or as part of its Premier Access window — but &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;isn’t one of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GsA7Gs"&gt;The film was rumored to have a simultaneous release, like Warner Bros. is doing with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;2021 movies on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, but Disney executives shut down those rumors today during a streaming event. &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;is still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21437889/black-widow-delayed-release-date-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-streaming-mulan"&gt;slated for May 7th, 2021&lt;/a&gt; (a release date that came after multiple delays this year). The May 7th date pushed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18264438/marvel-cinematic-universe-mcu-shang-chi-destin-daniel-cretton-direct-asian-led-film"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to July 9th, 2021. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/21/17888042/the-eternals-director-marvel-chloe-zhao"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eternals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;moved to November 5th, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbFXd8"&gt;It’s important to note that Disney is making crucial decisions on which films the company’s executives think can pull off box office wins and what games can be moved. &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;is a title that can generate enough revenue at the box office and through other traditional windows (like iTunes and Amazon) to keep it as a theatrical title. Plus, this keeps contracts with talent the same, and exhibitors happy. Movies that Disney doesn’t think will perform as well (like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167323/disney-live-action-adaptations-plus-streaming-pinocchio-peter-pan-wendy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peter Pan &amp;amp; Wendy &lt;/em&gt;or live-action &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) will move to Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0viMnp"&gt;Disney is making it clear that in order for films to get a full theatrical release, they have to be almost guaranteed blockbusters. The company certainly has a number of those titles left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2jtEw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfWBol"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="gYwgac"&gt;BioWare has released a new trailer for &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age 4&lt;/em&gt;. After virtually no news since the game was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18126070/dragon-age-4-trailer-teaser-ea-announcement-release-date-game-awards-2018"&gt;first announced&lt;/a&gt; at The Game Awards back in 2018 (short of a reassurance that the game was still “in early production” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21404442/dragon-age-4-behind-the-scenes-bts-bioware"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;,) the studio released a teaser of what it will be like for players to return to Thedas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JL8hRA"&gt;The new game will pick up where 2014’s &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age: Inquisition&lt;/em&gt; left off: with the reveal that the player companion (and generally rude person) Solas was in fact the Elven god of betrayal &lt;a href="http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Fen%27Harel"&gt;Fen’Harel&lt;/a&gt; — also known as the Dread Wolf — in disguise, and that he’s actively working to destroy the world. The new title will presumably see players face off against the Dread Wolf as they work to preserve Thedas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1DlPOE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragon Age 4&lt;/em&gt; will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X / S, although no date has been announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRURCi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus’ Loki show gets a trailer and a May release date</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f4jbIqct8HGAKOmGgxGlxYdVXOY=/305x0:1352x698/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68494359/Screen_Shot_2020_12_10_at_7.47.18_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nqxEcJ"&gt;Marvel has debuted a new trailer for &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;, it’s upcoming Disney Plus spinoff series that will give Tom Hiddleston’s fan-favorite &lt;em&gt;Avengers &lt;/em&gt;villain his own TV show. The company also announced a release date: Loki will debut on Disney Plus in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vw3sbr"&gt;The show is described as a “crime thriller,” and will see Loki facing off against the TVA, or Time Variance Authority. Owen Wilson’s unnamed character also appears in the trailer, sparring wits with Hiddleston in an elevator, before the trailer cuts over to plenty of action shots (that are harder to parse.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q_BMMVUAaiX47AlwQuI8jndehYY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22161593/Screen_Shot_2020_12_10_at_7.47.14_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mqkraq"&gt;Hiddleston’s Loki has been one of the longest-running recurring characters in Marvel’s connected film universe, starting off in 2011’s &lt;em&gt;Thor. &lt;/em&gt;Loki has since appeared as the main antagonist in the original &lt;em&gt;Avengers &lt;/em&gt;and has appeared as a sometimes ally, sometimes foe in subsequent &lt;em&gt;Thor&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; sequels through the years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEubBp"&gt;But the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; series (which follows some of the time travel shenanigans seen in &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;) is the first time that Hiddleston’s god of mischief will be getting top billing. We’ll find out more when Loki debuts releases this &lt;em&gt;May&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier return in first trailer for Marvel’s new show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X7PEbGEYfupM-OxCzg2U0fhx768=/362x136:1540x921/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68494345/Screen_Shot_2020_12_10_at_7.44.39_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QDRu26"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier &lt;/em&gt;was supposed to be Marvel Studios’ first big Disney Plus original series, but after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449314/falcon-winter-soldier-delay-premiere-date-marvel-disney-plus-wandavision-loki"&gt;ongoing delays and reshoots&lt;/a&gt;, the show will now premiere in March. Here’s a first look at what to expect.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dywdhq"&gt;The show, which has six episodes, had yet to receive a proper teaser trailer until now — all that fans have seen is a brief 30-second montage of &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448709/wandavision-disney-plus-scarlet-witch-vision-tv-show-series-mcu-marvel-cinematic-universe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/19/17878526/loki-scarlet-witch-disney-streaming-tv-show-marvel-cinematic-universe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that aired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/2/21119262/falcon-winter-solider-wandavision-loki-teaser-trailer-premiere-date-disney-plus-marvel-avengers"&gt;during the 2020 Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. Filming shut down in March because of the pandemic, Disney confirmed at the time, and was forced to remain closed until a couple of months ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6izA3"&gt;The show takes place after the events of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18513309/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review-marvel-cinematic-universe-iron-man-thor-captain-america-phase-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Steve Rogers has retired from his role as Captain America, choosing to live a simple life in an alternate reality with his longtime love, Peggy Carter. Sam Wilson (Falcon) has picked up the shield instead. The brief glimpses fans got from the Super Bowl spot also teased Bucky Barnes (Winter Soldier) reuniting with Zemo (Daniel Brühl), who first appeared in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/3/11577406/captain-america-civil-war-review-marvel-avengers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain America: Civil War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;back in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2U7a5"&gt;Although it’s a shame fans will have to wait another eight months for the series, at least there’s &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;to fill the Marvel Studios-shaped hole in our hearts. &lt;em&gt;WandaVision, &lt;/em&gt;which follows Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany’s characters, Wanda Maximoff and Vision, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562411/wandavision-premiere-date-disney-plus-marvel-studios-elizabeth-olsen-paul-bettany"&gt;premieres on January 15th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WandaVision gets a mind-bending new trailer ahead of its January 15th release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bf9hpBAyFs2F2-3BNlcDrBLMEns=/139x0:1522x922/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68494320/Screen_Shot_2020_12_10_at_7.42.19_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="At5Jdy"&gt;Disney has debuted a new trailer for its upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562411/wandavision-premiere-date-disney-plus-marvel-studios-elizabeth-olsen-paul-bettany"&gt;Disney Plus series &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;at its Investor Day, giving another look at the Marvel TV series ahead of its January 15th debut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lgln9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; will see the return of Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) — aka, Scarlet Witch — and Vision (Paul Bettany) from the Marvel Cinematic Universe films in a classic, sitcom-inspired series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeG7Yz"&gt;The show is definitely embarking into some weird territory, especially compared to the relatively normal superhero films that comprise the rest of Marvel’s film offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhaH2P"&gt;The show doesn’t just mark the start of a new era of Marvel TV shows, though; WandaVision will also kick off Marvel Studios’ “Phase 4” arc, due to the delays of both &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Solider&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8qu7N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; will be released exclusively on Disney Plus starting January 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="0EbirK"&gt;
&lt;aside id="szCRD9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Disney Plus","description":"$6.99 per month or $69.99 if you pay annually","label":"Subscribe","url":"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/OJDgN"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
