    <title>Googler who helped lead 2018 walkout will reportedly join the FTC </title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yn4D1okjhjETHWi5LmoGt9C6e-4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70081183/acastro_180320_1777_cambridge_analytica_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3OFSSD"&gt;Former Google employee Meredith Whittaker could soon be working at the Federal Trade Commission as an AI policy advisor, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/former-google-activist-whittaker-expected-to-join-ftc-as-ai-adviser"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Whittaker may be best known for helping to organize a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18057716/google-walkout-20-thousand-employees-ceo-sundar-pichai-meeting"&gt;2018 walkout at Google&lt;/a&gt;, where 20,000 employees protested against how the company handled alleged sexual harassment, and for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20695964/google-protest-leader-meredith-whittaker-leaves-company"&gt;leaving Google afterward&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512413/google-employees-walkout-organizers-retaliation-punishment"&gt;retaliated against her and other organizers&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the FTC seems to be in the process of hiring her to help shape regulations around AI and Big Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqcmYK"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;, Whittaker hasn’t been officially appointed yet, as steps like running a background check aren’t complete. If she is hired, though, she’ll bring a good deal of experience — she worked at Google &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/onward-another-googlewalkout-goodbye-b733fa134a7d"&gt;from 2006 to 2019&lt;/a&gt; and has done work around AI ethics since leaving the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RFaEuu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Whittaker accused Google of only caring about the appearance of ethics debate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xQp8u1"&gt;Besides helping with the walkout, Whittaker also advocated for Google to stop building AI for the military and spoke out against its ethics reviews, saying that it only gave the “appearance of an inclusive debate, rather than seriously contending with the problems in the company.” Upon leaving the company, she said that it was “clear” that it wasn’t a place where she could work toward tech accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wsa4S"&gt;Whittaker has also dealt with difficulties in the public sphere — she worked on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/15/18309437/new-york-city-accountability-task-force-law-algorithm-transparency-automation"&gt;New York City’s algorithm task force&lt;/a&gt;, which was designed to make sure that the city’s automated systems were equitable and had appropriate oversight and transparency. When NYC ended up releasing the report, though, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974379/nyc-algorithm-task-force-report-de-blasio"&gt;she called the effort “a waste,”&lt;/a&gt; echoing concerns raised by other members that dissenting opinions weren’t taken seriously or included. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XoNm1o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FTC has struggled to regulate Big Tech but now appears to be gearing up for a fight&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nKc6uW"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; points out, though, there are signs that the FTC could be a more hospitable place for her ideas if she actually ends up working there. The regulator’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;new chair, Lina Khan&lt;/a&gt;, has said she wants to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690176/ftc-chair-lina-khan-focus-antitrust-consumer-amazon"&gt;focus attention on tech giants and antitrust&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557456/amazon-lina-khan-recusal-petition-federal-trade-commission-antitrust"&gt;Amazon has even requested&lt;/a&gt; that she not be involved in cases involving the company because of her past statements about breaking it up. The current administration seems serious about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671880/biden-alvaro-bedoya-privacy-ftc-commissioner-facial-recognition"&gt;nominating experts to work at the agency&lt;/a&gt;, which has struggled to regulate Big Tech in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8O3CH"&gt;If the FTC is looking to bring on industry veterans like Whittaker, it could be a further sign that the agency is getting serious about regulating Big Tech. It could help give some say to people who have the technical knowledge and firsthand experience working at companies like Google, Amazon, Apple, or Meta, even if efforts to change things from within were largely ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 and Xbox Series X are now available at Walmart (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LIV5Tj6iVDIqYuSz-Hj4pHWRF4Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70075550/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WCirms"&gt;Walmart’s latest PS5 and Xbox Series X restocking event was back for a second day of console restocks at 4PM ET / 1PM PT, but it seems to be over now. Perhaps these near-holiday restocks will be happening with greater frequency than we expected, since Walmart did two consecutive events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAJ2nb"&gt;We expected to see Walmart’s new queueing system in action, which we saw for the first time during the November 1st restock. If you load one of these pages, you’ll get a place in line, and you can keep browsing Walmart’s site as a timer runs down to let you purchase a console, assuming there’s still stock left. However, that new queueing system wasn’t used for the November 2nd restock, for reasons unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wp20Qz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="grcrxs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="gdCyAD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LH4Kwf"&gt;The consoles may be the main course, but don’t forget to order some extra sides for when you have company over. Here are a few accessories to consider for both consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lLE0CZ"&gt;For PlayStation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="kfhO60"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499071"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="T46xYf"&gt;For Xbox&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Ford’s selling electric crate motors based on the one in the Mach-E</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4wcqEAdVyAvHIw8XhvoY8bzgaPU=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70080795/All_electric_Ford_F_100_Eluminator_concept_truck_05.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I8AnfG"&gt;Ford has &lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/11/02/all-electric-f-100-eluminator-concept.html"&gt;started selling&lt;/a&gt; an electric crate motor based on the one that powers the GT version of the Mustang Mach-E. The “Eluminator e-crate motor” makes 281 horsepower, 317 pound-feet of torque, and costs $3,900. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZXH8T"&gt;The motor is just the first in a series of EV building blocks Ford says it plans to sell, like battery systems, motor controllers, and inverters, all of which would make it easier to retrofit internal combustion engine vehicles with all-electric drivetrains. Right now, those types of conversions are still mostly limited to specialty shops and hobbyists who often cobble together parts from all sorts of random places in the supply chain. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J7fepr-zJu590NAW6x-TqIPptS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980204/Ford_Performance_Eluminator_electric_crate_motor_02.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oHLWgb"&gt;To promote the new motor, Ford built a one-off all-electric version of a 1978 F-100 pickup truck, which it brought to the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) trade show in Las Vegas. It’s an annual showcase for aftermarket suppliers and custom builders, but it’s increasingly become a place for automakers to tease some wild ideas in the electric vehicle space — like when Ford brought an all-electric Mustang with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20950148/ford-electric-mustang-manual-prototype-stick-shift-lithium-sema-2019"&gt;a six-speed manual gearbox&lt;/a&gt; to the show in 2019, two weeks before the debut of the Mach-E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wFvJ1w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10842088"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7CQsFY"&gt;The electric F-100 has two of the e-crate motors for a total of 480 horsepower and 634 pound-feet of torque — the same as the top spec Mustang Mach-E GT Performance — all wrapped in classic Ford truck styling. The inside also borrows from the Mach-E, as the truck has the same 15-inch portrait touchscreen on the dashboard, as well as the same 10.2-inch driver display. The electric F-100 even has a front trunk under the hood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUyyzR"&gt;It’s a gorgeous blend of old and new, and it’s too bad it’s a one-off. But as Ford follows through on its promise to bring more electric drivetrain components to market, it will open the door to more custom builds and retrofits in this same style. There’s already been plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20747528/electric-porsche-912-vintage-restoration-tesla-car-vehicle-ev"&gt;awesome creations despite the cost and effort currently required&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air and new iPad Mini have the same design and shape as the iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OqDG5sf2dQljUBF65yxBXRiy6oE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select iPad models go on sale quite regularly.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday approaching&lt;/a&gt;, the best iPad deals of the year are just around the corner, yet we’re already starting to see some solid discounts for those who can’t wait to grab one now. Whether you’re after the new 2021 entry-level iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or the latest iPad Mini, there’s a sale going on somewhere you may be interested in. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed each iPad model that is currently available, some of which are outgoing models with freshly introduced replacements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnYL1M"&gt;We, of course, will keep an eye out for more deals as we approach Black Friday and Cyber Monday, however, so be sure to keep checking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mEJgRj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Black Friday deals: what time sales start at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and more","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21569881/black-friday-deals-start-time-hours-cyber-monday-stores"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="jzeS15"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10754964"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="DMtl0v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best iPad (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;Announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;the September iPhone 13 event&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"&gt;2021 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s latest entry-level tablet and replaces the outgoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;eighth-gen model from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, this would leave the older model ripe for the picking as retailers may drum up some fire sale pricing to get rid of old stock, but at this time, there are no good deals to be found on the eighth-gen model. The ones you can currently find in stock, such as at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJrISyuZP4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, are full price. Without any significant discounts, you can feel comfortable steering clear of the 2020 version and get the latest and greatest of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZ13y"&gt;The new, ninth-generation iPad starts at $329, just as its predecessor, though the base model now has 64GB of storage instead of 32GB. You can also still opt for the model with 256GB of storage for $479. If you prefer your iPad to include cellular connectivity, the 64GB, LTE-equipped configuration runs $459 and the 256GB variant is $609. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMpIom"&gt;The updates for the 2021 model include a faster A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP ultrawide camera with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt;, a feature designed for keeping you framed up and centered while on video calls. Many other features carry over from its predecessor; the new entry-level model has the same 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qnjdLM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;We’ve previously seen Walmart discounting both Wi-Fi models of the new iPad by $30. Although at the moment they’re sold out, there’s a possibility we could see a similar discount again as we approach Black Friday. However, if you can’t wait until then, Best Buy is selling the Wi-Fi versions of the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWvH7LMj0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB&lt;/a&gt; full-priced while taking $30 off of the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWwO2PdJE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB&lt;/a&gt;. Both models come with free six-month subscriptions to Apple Music and Apple News Plus. Note these freebies are only available to new subscribers, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MKkmFl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the $329 iPad compares to its last-gen predecessor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2019) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; from 2019 has the same 7.9-inch display and design as its previous iterations but with refreshed internal specs for its time. Just like the base iPad, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new iPad Mini was announced&lt;/a&gt; during Apple’s recent “California Streaming” event that starts at a higher price point of $499. Meanwhile, the base 64GB outgoing iPad Mini with its older A12 Bionic processor now is on sale starting at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWn7uOMT5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$360 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; instead of its typical $400. We have previously seen the 64GB recently drop to $299, so it’s possible this price could only decrease on Black Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntoIEO"&gt;You can also buy the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWpBeCEve" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB variant for $495&lt;/a&gt; instead of $550, which is around $150 cheaper if you compare the old and new models on equal footing when it comes to storage. This could be a great opportunity for anyone who needs more storage or prefers the classic home button, Touch ID, or a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="njqbEo"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jTw4HZ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fifth-generation iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; has a larger screen, top-of-the-line processor, support for USB-C, and options for 5G. It has sadly forfeited its headphone jack in the process, but overall it’s a solid device that brings a fully refreshed design to Apple’s small tablet form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBkkEE"&gt;The changes and refinements to the new iPad Mini come at a heftier price, however, and the new 64GB Wi-Fi model now starts at $499. Electing 256GB of storage brings the price up to $649, while the 5G cellular models are $649 for 64GB and $799 for 256GB. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want the latest and greatest from Apple in a smaller format, this is where the action is. Right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUz2VOgrdA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; will also throw in six months free of Apple Music when you purchase the iPad Mini full-priced from them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NMDW5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zw4xQv"&gt;If the prior-generation iPad Mini has given any indication, however, deals on the 2021 iPad Mini might be light and infrequent moving forward for the most part, partly because it has such minimal competition in its product segment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KGao5s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;The best iPad Air (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. Apple has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, too, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-generation iPad Air comes in 64GB and 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than the prior gen. The units equipped with LTE start at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FkUXn4"&gt;Fortunately, if you’ve been waiting for a discount on the iPad Air, the 64GB model with Wi-Fi is available for $539 — $60 off the list price — in space grey and sky blue at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The 256GB, Wi-Fi-enabled version is also available for a $100 discount at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6LJMT4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; with your choice of many colors marked down to $650 at checkout.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-generation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; came out earlier this year, which means there are many deals to be had on the prior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-generation iPad Pro looks nearly the same as the 2018 model, when this design was first established, aside from a dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance in some configurations at Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H, and Target. As far as the Wi-Fi models go, the 128GB base storage is discounted to $750 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747067025091069041" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The 256GB model is available for $900 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-pro-11-inch-wi-fi-128gb-silver%2F-%2FA-77616876%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D1148110%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestIPadDeals110221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; in both color configurations. Best Buy is also selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065575324374726#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065628094129232#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; variants for $950 and $1,005, respectively. Best Buy will also throw in six-month Apple News Plus and Apple Music subscriptions for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQi2tt"&gt;Some similar discounts extend to the 12.9-inch model at Best Buy and B&amp;amp;H Photo. The 256GB model is $949 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553828-REG%2Fapple_mxat2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and $1,000 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748082168808445595" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly, the 512GB model is $1,100 instead of $1,300 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065793668725731" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; while the massive &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065843218873803" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; is $1,300 instead of $1,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zobp6q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important factor to your purchasing decision, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch 2021 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-gen model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to produce deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — as well as new features like Center Stage. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12.9-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kIHPXF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mini LED display reportedly coming to 11-inch iPad Pro next year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569690/mini-led-11-inch-ipad-pro-macbook-air-2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="I5hP3e"&gt;If the latest model is what you desire, the 11-inch, 128GB iPad Pro with Wi-Fi is selling at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-11-inch-Wi%E2%80%91Fi-128GB/dp/B09328WZPR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in silver for $700 – a record low – instead of $799, and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray%2F354993710" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; has it for $749.

&lt;div id="yhnrgA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10840379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The latest Oculus Quest update will help to prevent accidental dog punching</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Oculus Quest Space Sense" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y0XTHzrnbPSrMaAm1a_d3BAFwGw=/0x0:1997x1331/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70080621/spacesenseoculus.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;“Watch out, kid. You’re in my guardian.” | Meta&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qdGNmX"&gt;Fresh off of Meta’s Connect 2021 keynote, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751009/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-oculus-quest-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&lt;/em&gt; was announced for Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fa-smarter-guardian-android-phone-notifications-and-improved-voice-commands-in-latest-oculus-software-update%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company announced&lt;/a&gt; the latest set of software feature updates arriving on Quest and Quest 2 headsets starting today. The biggest addition is Space Sense, a feature that goes a step beyond the passthrough guardian by showing you in real-time when your safe VR space has been intruded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ro6HZe"&gt;It’s a practical update that aims to keep you safer, along with the other people and things in your home, too. Pets sometimes like to come over to you while a VR headset is on because it looks, to them, like you’re just standing or sitting there getting excited about something. The blog post over at Oculus’ site says that Space Sense can detect things like people, large pets (sorry to small pets), and other objects that might have found their way into your passthrough guardian zone. These things will be highlighted in your headset, “surrounded by a pink-ish glow,” says Oculus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KiimkF"&gt;This is a great addition. But, we’ve got to pour one out since this means that the days when you could get away with taking joke selfies next to people VR without them knowing are essentially over.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Oculus Quest" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6LzPFDkR15YNOnww5J3yVyBvcZ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980016/249331924_868670680684986_2274825082054725571_n.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Oculus Quest headsets can now display notifications from iPhones and Android phones&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9huSGS"&gt;Version 34 of Oculus’ software for the Quest platform adds a slew of new voice commands if you’re someone who prefers to navigate the interface with your voice instead of physical movement. Here’s &lt;a href="https://support.oculus.com/articles/in-vr-experiences/oculus-features/what-can-I-say-with-voice-commands?intern_source=blog&amp;amp;intern_content=a-smarter-guardian-android-phone-notifications-and-improved-voice-commands-in-latest-oculus-software-update"&gt;the current list of commands&lt;/a&gt; supported. Oculus also added the option to view Android app notifications while in VR. It first added the option for iOS users in May 2021, letting you pipe in your iPhone’s notifications while in-headset. You’ll need to activate the feature within the Oculus app for your Android phone, then enable it within the app or in your headset’s interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l94Osf"&gt;Lastly, Oculus shared that developers will soon be able to publish mixed-reality apps and games that utilize its Passthrough API on both the Oculus Store and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262794/oculus-update-app-lab-vr-early-access-sideloading"&gt;App Lab&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which is the non-curated fork of the Oculus Store that hosts experimental or in-progress titles. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22749567/facebook-presence-platform-oculus-quest-mixed-reality-api"&gt;Oculus provided more detail around it, along with its ambitious Presence Platform&lt;/a&gt;, during Connect 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fired #AppleToo organizer files labor charge against the company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/INY46vctDvgoNd95OBIXuJkYgwM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70080565/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O0HhUg"&gt;Janneke Parrish, a leader of the #AppleToo movement, has filed an unfair labor practice charge against the company, alleging the tech giant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727123/apple-fires-leader-apple-too-movement"&gt;fired her in retaliation for organizing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubzf2D"&gt;Parrish &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;created the #AppleToo platform&lt;/a&gt; to help colleagues air their concerns with Apple’s culture of “pervasive sexism” and pay equity, according to the complaint. Then, in October, she was fired, allegedly for failing to comply with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687747/tim-cook-employee-leak-memos-do-not-belong-at-apple"&gt;workplace investigation into leaks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9emqc"&gt;Parrish says the company terminated her based on “false and pretextual reasons” — namely because she “spoke up regarding her personal experiences regarding workplace concerns and helped give voice to her co-workers’ concerns in a workplace where such issues have been systematically siloed, suppressed, and unaddressed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhM1VW"&gt;“It seems like all the tech companies are using the same playbook,” says labor attorney Laurie Burgess. “They get rid of outspoken organizers by asserting they are responsible for a leak without any proof or documentation that that person was indeed responsible. My client denies having leaked this information.” Burgess is also representing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22751847/netflix-employees-dave-chappelle-file-charges-nlrb"&gt;fired and suspended Netflix organizers&lt;/a&gt;, as well as prominent Google organizers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoiwGm"&gt;This is the seventh unfair labor practice charge that has been filed against Apple since August. Last month, former senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-ceo-s-anti-leak-edict-broke-the-law-ex-employee-alleges?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;accused Tim Cook of violating the National Labor Relations Act&lt;/a&gt; when he warned employees that “people who leak confidential information do not belong here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4auhi"&gt;Cher Scarlett, an Apple software engineer, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-national-labor-relations-board-investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02/"&gt;filed a complaint in September&lt;/a&gt; alleging the company stopped employees from engaging in protected activity when they tried to discuss their pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfGsTl"&gt;An employee on the AppleCare team, Apple’s version of customer service, filed a charge on September 28th alleging they were unlawfully fired. This charge has not been previously reported. The employee’s identity is not known at this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xa0mbe"&gt;The NLRB is currently investigating claims against the tech giant. If it finds they have merit, it can try to secure a settlement. The labor board can also issue its own complaint if settlement talks fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLmubA"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The free laptop program built into the Biden reconciliation plan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BRITAIN-UN-CLIMATE-COP26" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kIULLwyeEWiSVhK_6FGcKx4406g=/0x0:4130x2753/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70080502/1236277724.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZCk80b"&gt;After months of negotiations, President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better agenda advanced into its last phase of debate this week. The bipartisan infrastructure bill contains billions to expand high-speed broadband across the country, aiming to close the digital divide over the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byG7Ei"&gt;But the administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598636/white-house-infrastructure-broadband-package-bipartisan"&gt;$65 billion down payment&lt;/a&gt; on broadband can only help connect families who can afford a computer. So Biden’s latest version of the Build Back Better program goes further, allocating new funds to bring federally funded desktops, laptops, and tablets to poor Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPTq3L"&gt;Last week, the White House released its latest version of the Build Back Better plan, outlining &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751099/white-house-budget-climate-electric-vehicles-ev-tax-credit-deal-manchin-sinema"&gt;a $1.75 trillion budget proposal&lt;/a&gt; to tackle climate change and invest in other social services like Medicare. Deep within the over 1,600 pages of the bill is a new initiative — the Connected Device Grant Program — that would help provide free or discounted desktops, laptops, or tablets to low-income households. To accomplish that goal, the Commerce Department would receive $475 million to award community groups that want to distribute these devices locally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w5qvmk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re not going to close the digital divide if we don’t make sure people have the computers and tablets they need”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E3YrAJ"&gt;“We can invest all of this money in the infrastructure package in broadband deployment,” said Jenna Leventoff, Public Knowledge senior policy counsel, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last week, “but we’re not going to close the digital divide if we don’t make sure people have the computers and tablets they need.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adzqfr"&gt;As of June of this year, only four in 10 lower-income adults have access to a desktop or laptop computer, and a majority are not tablet owners, &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/22/digital-divide-persists-even-as-americans-with-lower-incomes-make-gains-in-tech-adoption/"&gt;according to the Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;. Only 43 percent of low-income adults have access to in-home broadband connections as well. These devices and technology are prevalent in households making $100,000 or more every year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLHewz"&gt;The device program has been championed by Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA) and Rep. A. Donald McEachin (D-VA), who introduced the Device Access for Every American Act in September. The original bill would have established &lt;a href="https://mceachin.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-mceachin-sen-warnock-introduce-bicameral-legislation-establish-voucher"&gt;a $5 billion Federal Communications Commission program&lt;/a&gt; to distribute up to $400 vouchers to low-income Americans for computers and tablets. The language was later roped into the Build Back Better budget reconciliation package and amended into the nearly half a billion grant program currently authorized under the measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmsjew"&gt;“It is nearly impossible to get by without access to a laptop or tablet — especially after a year of adjusting to virtual learning, working, and more,” Warnock said in a Monday statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “My bill will help ensure every American, regardless of their income or zip code, has the ability to participate and thrive in our increasingly digital economy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVNS7j"&gt;While a majority of lower-income adults own smartphones, experts argue that mobile devices are not enough for people to compete and advance in the digital economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKVi9r"&gt;“A mobile phone isn’t sufficient. It’s not where I work. It’s not where I write my resume. It’s not where I work on spreadsheets,” Angela Siefer, National Digital Inclusion Alliance executive director, said. “Folks have been getting by with a mobile phone, but you certainly can’t thrive with only a mobile phone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="FEuZDd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A mobile phone isn’t sufficient”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HJEi7S"&gt;Funding the program through the grant model leaves the specifics of implementation up to local groups, which could include anything from housing authorities to local libraries. Experts like Siefer and Leventoff also expect the private sector to play a significant role in distributing devices once the grant funding is approved by Congress. Hoping to stretch the grant dollars further, community groups could partner with device manufacturers to buy devices in bulk or offer them at a discounted rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnMpbP"&gt;Microsoft launched its own free or low-cost refurbished device program called Airband earlier this year. The program partners with civil society organizations to provide devices to poor Americans. Starting in Los Angeles and New York City, the program expects to roll out to six more cities &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com_-3Furl-3Dhttps-253A-252F-252Fblogs.microsoft.com-252Fon-2Dthe-2Dissues-252F2021-252F06-252F02-252Fracial-2Ddigital-2Dinequity-2Dairband-2Dbroadband-2Daccess-252F-26data-3D04-257C01-257Cadorsett-2540we-2Dworldwide.com-257Cc0f3563eb1fe44f4f39008d99b2f1db4-257C3ed60ab455674971a5341a5f0f7cc7f5-257C0-257C0-257C637711448947035986-257CUnknown-257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0-253D-257C1000-26sdata-3DfbFGckAFJ-252BDUgiqJXX1Wl3gAN5YpkZATiI-252Bxrqf2BfE-253D-26reserved-3D0&amp;amp;d=DwMF-g&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=HNNpVffGdDpwb__vVTedbxA45oxwn1GdeQ8euhDLKmk&amp;amp;m=qxCWW59whJYpU9rcl4OiRvLJPtv-1Fe1q2PNLdkz9jE&amp;amp;s=C7DWTuMzfLnLcOph7V1Au18ssc4LVfBdutLkiIjyk9g&amp;amp;e="&gt;in the coming months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8utSxl"&gt;Many universities offer loaner devices to adult students, but these laptops or tablets usually must be returned after the school year ends. This means adult learners might not have access to free or low-cost devices until the following school year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQhdvU"&gt;“There’s a big difference between using a loaner computer and having your own,” Siefer said. “It’s the understanding of what you can do with it. You’ll play with the settings. We all learn by doing that. There’s huge value in ownership over loan programs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTj1dC"&gt;In a Tuesday call with House Democrats, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said she expects to finish negotiations over lingering issues, like climate and drug pricing, before the end of the day. This could set up a final vote on both the bipartisan infrastructure and budget reconciliation packages on the House floor either Thursday or Friday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sarahnferris/status/1455528621485985799?s=20"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DyvLfx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m not going to stop working until we get it passed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q0oNKZ"&gt;While the infrastructure package &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618448/senate-bipartisan-infrastructure-package-schumer-broadband-cryptocurrency"&gt;was approved by the Senate earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, the budget proposal could face an uphill battle in the higher body. On Monday, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-manchin-biden-spending-bill-clarity/"&gt;called the social spending framework&lt;/a&gt; a “shell game, budget gimmicks that make the real cost of the so-called $1.75 trillion bill estimated to be almost twice that amount.” Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (AZ), both moderate Democrats, have been at the center of negotiations over the budget proposal that has shrunk dramatically in size compared to its initial $3.5 trillion goal. Democrats need Manchin and Sinema’s support in order to pass the resolution and overcome a razor-thin majority in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8Dr7e"&gt;Even if the reconciliation is approved within the next few days and weeks, it would be months before local groups could receive grant funding through the device program. The Commerce Department agency in charge of allocating the money would still need to approve new rules for the program, which could take months after the measure is approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VjEpHo"&gt;Still, Warnock is optimistic that the program will remain in the bill. “I’m glad we’ve been able to include it in the major economic package we’re debating in Washington, and I’m not going to stop working until we get it passed,” Warnock said on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is reportedly making 20 percent fewer Switches due to the chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ps7fBok3APbSiKqVDQmCSvrA2PE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70080433/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="phiqLT"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22363232/global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-pandemic-consoles-cpus-graphics-cards-cars"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; is rippling through all areas of technology, and its chokehold on electronics doesn’t seem to be easing up anytime soon. Nintendo is just one brand that continues to suffer due to the shortage, as a report from &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Media-Entertainment/Nintendo-to-make-20-fewer-Switch-consoles-due-to-chip-crunch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reveals that Nintendo is slashing the number of Switches it’s producing even further and falling short of original projections by 20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JXIvcd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nikkei Asia reports Nintendo will only push out 24 million units by the end of March&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AnzFG8"&gt;While Nintendo insists the chip shortage didn’t cause the Switch OLED to miss out on 4K video support, the squeeze could keep the company from meeting its updated projection. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt; reports that instead of producing the 30 million Switches it initially planned on,  Nintendo will only push out 24 million units by the end of March, which is short of the 25.5 million number it gave to investors in May. In a brief statement, a Nintendo spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt; that they’re aware of the semiconductor shortage, and they’re evaluating the “impact” on its production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBrpFw"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt; notes, the Switch has seen a 37-percent decline in sales this September when compared to the same period last year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562530/nintendo-switch-lite-sales-october-2020"&gt;Demand for the Switch rapidly increased&lt;/a&gt; during the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, as people looked for ways to keep busy while staying at home. The Switch took the spot as the top-selling console in the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562530/nintendo-switch-lite-sales-october-2020"&gt;from 2019&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279859/nintendo-switch-lite-ps5-sales-january-2021"&gt;the beginning of 2021&lt;/a&gt;, only to be surmounted by the PS5, which sold fewer units than the Switch but made more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="86SW1s"&gt;It also doesn’t help that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22660574/nintendo-switch-oled-model-availability-restock-best-buy-target-walmart-amazon-gamestop"&gt;Nintendo just released the Switch OLED model in October&lt;/a&gt; — a slightly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt;upgraded version of the Switch&lt;/a&gt; that comes with a better screen and more storage. A newer model typically means more demand, something that Nintendo probably should’ve considered before launching the Switch OLED during a chip shortage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ce3juG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/that-was-quick-scalpers-resell-nintendo-switch-oled-model-pre-orders-for"&gt;Scalpers already bought out and attempted to resell Switch OLED preorders&lt;/a&gt; for outrageously high prices, so it wouldn’t be a surprise if they targeted what remains of the Switch stock in the coming months. After all, scalpers have already benefitted from the chip shortage, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564282/ps5-sony-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-orders-launch-week"&gt;digging their greedy claws into the Xbox One X and PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; — the Switch OLED could be their next feast.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Harry Potter: Wizards Unite is shutting down next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gw74sD"&gt;Niantic, the developers of the smash hit &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, will be shutting down its Harry Potter-themed AR game &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Wizard’s Unite &lt;/em&gt;on January 31st, 2022. The game will be pulled from the App Store, Google Play, and Galaxy Store on December 6th, and that same day, you will no longer be able to make in-game purchases, according to the game’s website. The game’s community forum and social media channels will be closed on January 31st as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNJAzb"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.harrypotterwizardsunite.com/"&gt;blog post and FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, Niantic didn’t specify why it decided to shut down &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Wizard’s Unite&lt;/em&gt;. But we weren’t impressed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18716146/harry-potter-wizards-unite-pokemon-go-review-ar-augmented-reality-game-foundable"&gt;when we first tried it in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and the game never reached the same level of popularity as &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, which is still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565654/pokemon-go-5-billion-fifth-anniversary-revenue-analytics"&gt;incredibly relevant&lt;/a&gt; despite being more than five years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCUqob"&gt;There hasn’t been another AR hit quite on the level of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;; Niantic’s AR adaptation of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680166/niantic-catan-world-explorers-shutdown-early-access"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catan &lt;/em&gt;will fully shut down this month&lt;/a&gt;, while Microsoft closed down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215253/minecraft-earth-closing-down-june-2021-microsoft"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt; in June&lt;/a&gt;. That hasn’t stopped Niantic from trying, though, as it just released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746427/pikmin-bloom-niantic-nintendo-pokemon-go-release-trailer"&gt;Pikmin-focused AR game &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and has an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22529378/transformers-heavy-metal-niantic-pokemon-go-location-game-ar"&gt;AR &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;/em&gt; game in the works&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is shutting down its Face Recognition tagging program</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Facial Recognition" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9V--JyicblACS2GU9uyjW_-bJZQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70080326/jbareham_170417_1617_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SdIU4b"&gt;Meta (formerly known as Facebook) is discontinuing Facebook’s Face Recognition feature following a lengthy privacy battle. Meta says the change will roll out in the coming weeks. As part of it, the company will stop using facial recognition algorithms to tag people in photographs and videos, and it will delete the facial recognition templates that it uses for identification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfbhwp"&gt;Meta artificial intelligence VP &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/update-on-use-of-face-recognition/"&gt;Jerome Pesenti calls&lt;/a&gt; the change part of a “company-wide move to limit the use of facial recognition in our products.” The move follows a lawsuit that accused Facebook’s tagging tech of violating Illinois’ biometric privacy law, leading to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/27/22304618/judge-approves-facebook-privacy-settlement-illinois-facial-recognition"&gt;a $650 million settlement&lt;/a&gt; in February. Facebook previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20847650/facebook-facial-recognition-setting-default-opt-in"&gt;restricted facial recognition&lt;/a&gt; to an opt-in feature in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swKMyT"&gt;“Looking ahead, we still see facial recognition technology as a powerful tool,” writes Pesenti in a blog post, citing possibilities like face-based identity verification. “But the many specific instances where facial recognition can be helpful need to be weighed against growing concerns about the use of this technology as a whole.” Pesenti notes that regulators haven’t settled on comprehensive privacy regulation for facial recognition. “Amid this ongoing uncertainty, we believe that limiting the use of facial recognition to a narrow set of use cases is appropriate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="m3VQJ2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More than one-third of active daily users had opted in&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NKGx1W"&gt;Pesenti says more than one-third of Facebook’s daily active users had opted into Face Recognition scanning, and over a billion face recognition profiles will be deleted as part of the upcoming change. As part of the change, Facebook’s automated alt-text system for blind users will no longer name people when it’s analyzing and summarizing media, and it will no longer suggest people to tag in photographs or automatically notify users when they appear in photos and videos posted by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LhPGdA"&gt;Facebook’s decision won’t stop independent companies like Clearview AI — which built huge image databases by scraping photos from social networks, including Facebook — from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22522486/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-avoid-escape-privacy"&gt;using facial recognition algorithms trained with that data&lt;/a&gt;. US law enforcement agencies (alongside other government divisions) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641216/facial-recognition-gao-report-agency-dhs-cbp-fbi"&gt;work with Clearview AI and other companies&lt;/a&gt; for facial recognition-powered surveillance. State or national privacy laws would be needed to restrict the technology’s use more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVhJVX"&gt;By shutting down a feature it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/19/16794660/facebook-facial-recognition-tagging-photos"&gt;used for years&lt;/a&gt;, Meta is hoping to bolster user confidence in its privacy protections as it prepares a rollout of potentially privacy-compromising virtual and augmented reality technology. The company launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;a pair of camera-equipped smart glasses&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with Ray-Ban earlier this year, and it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22752986/meta-facebook-andrew-bosworth-interview-metaverse-vr-ar"&gt;gradually launching 3D virtual worlds&lt;/a&gt; on its Meta VR headset platform. All these efforts will require a level of trust from users and regulators, and giving up Facebook auto-tagging — especially after a legal challenge to the program — is a straightforward way to bolster it.&lt;/p&gt;
