    <title>Chip shortages cost GM the US vehicle sales crown it’s held since 1931</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KUJ9GN"&gt;General Motors is no longer the top seller of vehicles in the US as &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/04/toyota-dethrones-gm-to-become-americas-top-selling-automaker-in-2021.html"&gt;reported Tuesday by &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Detroit powerhouse lost the crown to Toyota, which reportedly sold about 114,000 more vehicles than GM in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKHETU"&gt;GM reported Tuesday that total sales were down &lt;a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2022/jan/0104-gmsales.html"&gt;almost 13 percent&lt;/a&gt; last year due to semiconductor shortages. Vehicle and technology companies worldwide have been faced with production difficulties due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;chip shortages&lt;/a&gt;, and GM has had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575836/gm-wireless-charging-cadillac-chevy-tahoe-chip-shortage"&gt;cut features&lt;/a&gt; from some vehicles, such as wireless chargers and HD radios, due to supply issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DbSael"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Toyota dethrones GM to become America's top-selling automaker in 2021 &lt;a href="https://t.co/oO4AmytFyu"&gt;https://t.co/oO4AmytFyu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— CNBC (@CNBC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1478395980026454016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 4, 2022&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FEebbZ"&gt;But things are looking up for GM — the parent company of Chevrolet and GMC says the chip situation is improving. “In 2022, we plan to take advantage of the strong economy and anticipated improved semiconductor supplies to grow our sales and share. We will also further strengthen our industry leadership in trucks and begin our drive to EV leadership in North America,” Steve Carlisle, GM’s president of North America, &lt;a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2022/jan/0104-gmsales.html"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. A major focus for the company now is bolstering its electric vehicle lineup with the new Hummer EV (which it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/18/22843805/gm-ev-hummer-pickup-truck-delivery"&gt;begun delivering&lt;/a&gt;) plus the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826236/chevy-silverado-ev-truck-production-sale-date"&gt;Silverado&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837827/gmc-sierra-denali-ev-electric-pickup-truck-tease"&gt;Denali&lt;/a&gt; EVs.&lt;/p&gt;

The (now) top automaker in the US leads in sales of sedans with the Camry, SUVs with the RAV4, and minivans with the Sienna, &lt;a href="https://pressroom.toyota.com/toyota-motor-north-america-reports-u-s-december-year-end-2021-sales/"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;. The company also reported that it was the “number one seller of electrified vehicles for the 22nd consecutive year” — although it has yet to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22187113/toyota-electric-vehicles-us-suv-debut-hybrids"&gt;actually ship&lt;/a&gt; a fully electric one.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW’s iX M60 is a dual-motor performance EV with 280 miles of range</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zIdzAv2brxEtAY9fjZNk7S2_kDU=/0x2:4961x3309/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348472/BMW_202111__1251.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The second EV to feature the German automaker’s coveted performance branding&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rx0X4u"&gt;BMW announced the iX M60, the German automaker’s latest performance electric vehicle, and the second EV to be released under its racing-inspired M branding. When it comes out in the summer of 2022, the iX M60 will feature two electric motors, 610 braking horsepower, and will get up to 280 miles of range on a single charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z54YFW"&gt;There are other impressive specs to note, including 811 lb-ft of near-instantaneous torque when in Launch Control, and a 0 to 60mph acceleration time of 3.6 seconds. BMW says that the power delivery of its M-specific electric drivetrain continues into high load ranges, “so acceleration remains almost constant up to the electronically-limited maximum speed of 155 mph when properly equipped.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="IFMD1Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“acceleration remains almost constant up to the electronically-limited maximum speed of 155 mph”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UTbsSm"&gt;BMW M, which stands for “Motorsport,” was born in May 1972, conceived to support the company’s racing endeavors. Now, as we near the brand’s 50th anniversary, it's being integrated into BMW’s—arguably belated—effort to shift from dirty internal combustion engines to electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lI4CRi"&gt;BMW’s iX M60 sports a massive 111.5kWh battery, with a usable 106.3kWh. By way of comparison, the most powerful Tesla, the long-range Model S, has a 100kWh battery, while Mercedes-Benz’s flagship EQS sedan, with 350 miles of range, has one with 107.8kWh of capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w6gkLO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10961822"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zgcSrY"&gt;In terms of charging, BMW says it will take 97 minutes to go from 10 percent to 80 percent while plugged into a 25-amp system delivering 50kW of charge. When plugged into a 250-amp charger delivering 100kW of power, that time drops to 49 minutes. And when plugged into a DC fast charger delivering 250kW of power, the iX M60 will only take 35 minutes to get from 10 to 80 percent charged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tOZzr3"&gt;The company expects to introduce a whole new package of software and advanced driver assist features with the iX M60. Among the features powered by the vehicle’s new computing platform are partially autonomous driving and self-parking features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LkOcmm"&gt;Notably, BMW says it won’t use rare earth materials to power the iX M60’s two motors. Instead, the motors operate on the principle of a “current-energized synchronous machine,” which BMW describes as “the excitation of the rotor is triggered by the precisely metered supply of electrical energy.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HJb5ZW0qqAhVxdJ7y_WJLc-Nd4Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145987/BMW_202111__1638.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="esTPfX"&gt;Most electric motors are powered by permanent magnets, sometimes no larger than a pack of playing cards, that are made of rare earth metals. The magnets enable the motors to transform electricity into motion, thus powering the vehicle. These rare earth magnets, mostly made of neodymium (NdFeB), are almost entirely mined and processed in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXPDFa"&gt;By using current-energized synchronous machine principles, BMW says it can achieve a higher energy density, especially in the rear motor, which in turn allows the automaker to achieve levels of performance it expects out of its M-series vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QZ90jBkgYCaiFXnPjvGSOjSqb1g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145990/BMW_202111__1935.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ANRQW9"&gt;BMW has a raft of new EVs coming out in the next few years, with the goal of achieving 50 percent of sales by 2030. Later this year, the company is releasing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462504/bmw-i4-ev-price-specs-photos-release-date"&gt;i4 electric sedan&lt;/a&gt;, with up to 300 miles of range and starting at $55,400 for the low-spec model. It’s also developing an electric version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345464/bmw-5-7-series-x1-electric-car-ev-plug-in"&gt;5 Series and 7 Series sedans&lt;/a&gt; as well as its entry-level X1 SUV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwEJYo"&gt;That means almost all of the German luxury automaker’s most popular cars will soon have all-electric variants. A fully electric version of the 3 Series, BMW’s most popular car in the US, has &lt;a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-electric-bmw-3-series-spied-testing"&gt;already been spotted in testing camouflage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFz7VV"&gt;There have been some twists, though. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324114/bmw-ix3-electric-suv-range-specs-price-china-europe"&gt;iX3&lt;/a&gt;, the all-electric version of its top-selling X3 SUV,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324114/bmw-ix3-electric-suv-range-specs-price-china-europe"&gt; won’t be available in the US&lt;/a&gt;, only in Europe and China. And the tiny i3 electric hatchback was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554419/bmw-i3-discontinued-us-electric-hatchback-sales"&gt;discontinued last year&lt;/a&gt; after low sales. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK_0rJq3OvCws9YqPVzhFSZzZQk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/cgartenberg_211020_4803_0006.8.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is one of many e-readers currently available as part of a discounted bundle at Amazon.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AZCNr8"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UeWxe"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each model currently available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one, or any, of the products, which is why we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price in those instances. While newer models like the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite are currently only available for full price, keep in mind that the retailer also offers 20 percent off all of its Kindles when you trade in select devices, so there are still other ways to save money when none of the models are available at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="U51BKy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21546591/best-amazon-echo-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="r36wrm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741941"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;Kindle (10th-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mXAcFi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10363966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfprjz"&gt;The 10th-gen Kindle is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, and as such, it usually retails for $89.99. Released in 2019, the base Kindle includes a front light, 8GB of storage, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, the latest model features a slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy a 10th-gen Kindle with lock screen ads at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VT322X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1221005/2092?subId1=VergeBestKindleDeals121021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-8gb-now-with-a-built-in-front-light-8211-black%2F-%2FA-79804909%2F"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxG6j9qO2d" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $89.99, its typical retail price. If you want one without ads, you can grab it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$109.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy either Kindle model at Amazon, you’ll also receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $119.97 ($15 off its usual price) at Amazon; it includes an ad-supported Kindle in either black or white, one of three printed covers, and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkX3DN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ze80m8"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids (2019)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019. Amazon also announced and released the Kindle Kids, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $109.99 ($20 more than the base Kindle at standard MSRP). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon Kids Plus service. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their kids access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHO6IB"&gt;Right now, it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746224890339507137" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $109.99, the full retail price, though, we did see it drop to $60 during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3DEvBp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="deHMlR"&gt;Amazon’s latest Kindle Paperwhite is its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22684801/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-features-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11th-gen model&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with USB-C support, longer battery life, and a larger, 6.8-inch display. Given just how recently the new e-reader launched, however, we haven’t seen a ton of discounts yet. Thankfully, you can still pick up the last-gen model, which is frequently available for far less than the standard retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkwzBt"&gt;The 2021 Kindle Paperwhite comes in three main configurations: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KTZ8249/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB model with ads for $139.99&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N38WQSH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB without ads for $159.99&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B495319/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB Signature Edition for $189.99&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is identical to the standard Paperwhite, except it also features Qi wireless charging and a sensor that will automatically adjust the backlight when needed. Amazon has also rolled out a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WPB8PW9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite Kids Edition for $159.99&lt;/a&gt;, which comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a year of Amazon Kids Plus, much like the aforementioned Kindle Kids. All 2021 models are also similar to the 2018 model in that they feature a waterproof design and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrLCU1"&gt;Currently, the ad-supported Kindle Paperwhite is available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Kindle-Paperwhite-adjustable-Ad-Supported/dp/B08KTZ8249/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjh6fhT1VK" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1230703/2092?subId1=VergeBestKindleDeals122921&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fall-new-amazon-kindle-paperwhite-6-8-34-8gb-tablet-black%2F-%2FA-84609459" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; starting at $139.99, its full retail price. Amazon also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Essentials-Bundle-including/dp/B09FC51SFK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offers it as part of a bundle&lt;/a&gt; that includes a power adapter and one of three fabric covers for $189.97, however, which is a $20 discount. The 32GB, ad-free Signature Edition is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FNY4RRP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $249.97 as part of a discounted bundle, too, which also includes a “cork” cover and a wireless charging dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XEYFbp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10765216"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="S8bhtR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10913659"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iorwh0"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (2018)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;While there currently are no price breaks on the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite — save for the $20 discount available on the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition Bundle — retailers like Amazon and Best Buy often lower the price of the last-gen model to $89.99 during major shopping holidays and bigger sales events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYvMzL"&gt;Although the e-reader is not on sale as a standalone device at the moment, Amazon is discounting the Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle in select color configurations, which includes either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TSLFS9W/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader with ads for $169.97&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TTF2SPJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB reader with ads for $199.97&lt;/a&gt;, along with a leather case and power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5RQ0ML"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10953222"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Oasis (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof, 7-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. However, unlike previous models, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we’ve seen the 8GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $174.99, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are currently no deals on just the Oasis itself, configurations start at $249.99 at Amazon and include three free months of Kindle Unlimited. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $249.99 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VDMJJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads is $269.99&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB version is $279.99 with ads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$299.99 without&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGlPY"&gt;If you’re looking for a discount, the Essentials bundle is on sale at Amazon for $30 off its normal list price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RSVGLKV/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported configuration for as low as $279.97&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RW2K1MD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $309.97&lt;/a&gt;, both of which come with a leather cover, a power adapter, and three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood debuts First Trade Recommendations for beginner investors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rvbWV5qK8D-AWrcztxlXURqkGF0=/222x0:2214x1328/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348390/robinhood_first_trade_recommendation.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Robinhood&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bnd7Vn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2022/1/3/kick-off-the-new-year-with-first-trade-recommendations"&gt;Robinhood has introduced&lt;/a&gt; a new experience geared towards trading noobs, and the company says its personalized stock recommendations could help beginners get a sense of the technical side of trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="240Qgs"&gt;If you’re a new user and haven’t added anything to your Investment Profile, you’ll get the option to choose “Get help with your first investment” from the Investing tab. Robinhood will then present you with a questionnaire that asks what your investment goals are, how long you plan on investing your money, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yLBYf"&gt;Based on those answers, Robinhood will recommend a personalized portfolio containing four diverse exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with additional information about each fund and why Robinhood picked it for you. Once you’ve reviewed all of the funds, you can choose whether or not you want to invest in the recommended ETFs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NWHSqgnR2rbNKG4lVfNuYDxmQtU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145519/robinhood_stock_market_tour.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Robinhood&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zP3mTU"&gt;And if you feel especially lost when it comes to investing, Robinhood is now offering something it calls “Tours” to show you the ropes of trading. The app will provide a quick overview of investment-related terminology, along with some of the important elements you might come across when using the app and trading in general. It’s definitely something I could’ve used when dabbling in the stock market for the first time — and is probably something I could still use if I’m honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xUNGo"&gt;It’s obviously best to use your own judgment and research and not to over-rely on a simple questionnaire for making major investment choices. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557419/robinhood-finra-fine-70-million"&gt;Robinhood was fined $70 million by financial regulators&lt;/a&gt; last year for not properly protecting investors and supervising trades, and it’s possible that carefully vetted advice will stop it from repeating that experience. It can’t be much riskier than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22618238/online-stock-education-communities-discords-robinhood-trading"&gt;relying on Reddit or Discord for tips&lt;/a&gt; (for many investors, at least).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are a go-to pick that’s often on sale.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EMp8N7"&gt;Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the holidays may have come and gone, but there are still some great discounts available on Apple’s AirPods. In fact, we’ve actually been seeing some deals that are even better than they were during the recent shopping holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SziSp1"&gt;Since Apple launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt; in October and unveiled its new AirPods lineup, we’ve seen the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level model drop from $159 to $129. Even better, we’ve seen many retailers starting to heavily discount the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model. We’ve even recently seen some significant discounts on the third-gen AirPods, despite how recently they launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on each model, including the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Si36Ca"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"},{"title":"Which AirPods should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFDHZw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10742787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ej2msf"&gt;The best entry-level &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; (second-gen) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eg29V6"&gt;Once $159, Apple recently lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — to $129. It only sells the model with a wired charging case, however, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. Despite their age, we found these easy-to-use earbuds offer great wireless performance and reliable battery life, making them a great pick if you can live without a wireless charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtXs0h"&gt;Although we’ve recently seen Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods drop to $90 — their lowest price to date — the second-gen earbuds are currently only on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1155135/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-2nd-generation%2F-%2FA-84852693"&gt;Target for $114.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is just $15 less than their typical asking price. They’re also &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/619717/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F604342441&amp;amp;_be_shelf_id=66025&amp;amp;search_sort=100&amp;amp;facet=shelf_id%3A66025&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; right now, where you can pick them up for $119.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;AirPods (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d2yjBK"&gt;The newest pair of wireless earbuds support Apple’s MagSafe technology. The short stems yield a more subtle design, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiPrKN"&gt;Deals were once hard to come by on the third-gen model, but we finally started seeing some significant deals starting around Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Sadly, like the second-gen AirPods, they’re currently only available for slightly less than MSRP. At the moment, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling them for $169.98&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1230713/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals010422&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-true-wireless-bluetooth-headphones-3rd-generation%2F-%2FA-77603772"&gt;Target for $169.99&lt;/a&gt;, roughly $10 shy of their full retail price and a far cry from their all-time low of $139.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q2OXRZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iewbkw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S8o5q4"&gt;We think Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; an iPhone owner can buy, regardless of the price. They have better sound quality than the models above, offer active noise cancellation, and come with a wireless charging case. The earbuds also support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;Apple’s spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; feature, which adds an immersive surround sound effect to select content, and come with swappable silicone tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM8uVd"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733183/apple-magsafe-charging-case-airpods-pro-qi"&gt;recently launched a new version&lt;/a&gt; of the AirPods Pro with a wireless charging case that supports Apple’s MagSafe technology, just like the third-gen AirPods. These retail for $249, but you can buy them right now for $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/612734/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro-with-MagSafe-Charging-Case%2F975690481&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $199.99 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro-with-magsafe%2F-%2FA-77603773&amp;amp;subid1=Verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not nearly as low as the $159 price we saw this model drop to during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it’s still more than $50 off what you’d pay if you were to purchase the earbuds directly from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ri3jYY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AirPods Pro 2 may come with lossless audio support and a charging case that makes sound","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863442/airpods-pro-2-lossless-audio-charging-case-sound"},{"title":"Apple selling new AirPods Pro coinciding with the Year of the Tiger in certain markets","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22864887/apple-new-airpods-pro-year-of-the-tiger"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="THtgJp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and a wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max were discounted to $429 at Amazon during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, prices have since increased. Still, the Max are currently selling for $479 in most colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1610234-REG%2Fapple_mgyj3am_a_airpods_max_silver.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $70. You can also &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?Ntt=airpods+max"&gt;reserve them in green at Micro Center for $429.99&lt;/a&gt;, one of their best prices to date, though they’re only available for in-store pickup in select states.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s videoconferencing monitor has a 4K webcam, USB-C hub, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UHhroWBBZDKjDoLhfyV2iUH1OK8=/136x0:1765x1086/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348012/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_12.26.01.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ft98ee"&gt;Dell’s new 32-inch UltraSharp videoconferencing monitor supports 4K in more ways than one — the first, obvious for a display, is its 3840 x 2160 panel. But it also has a built-in 4K webcam, perfect for the age of Zoom meetings and working from home. Better still, you can connect to the monitor with a single USB-C cable, which will provide a video signal to the screen and send 90W of power back to your laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYe2pb"&gt;The monitor’s official name is the U3223QZ (Dell’s naming is catchy as ever), and its webcam uses a Sony 4K HDR STARVIS CMOS sensor. That’s similar to the imaging tech that Dell uses for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22553857/dell-ultrasharp-4k-webcam-features-price-release-date"&gt;its $200 external UltraSharp webcam&lt;/a&gt;, but unlike that device, the monitor has two built-in microphones. Dell also says that you’ll be able to adjust the camera’s tilt by 20 degrees and switch between 65, 78, and 90-degree fields of view. All of that should add up to you showing up crystal clear in meetings (if that’s something you want to do — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22858876/built-in-laptop-webcam-zoom-video-conferencing"&gt;not everyone does!&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XbPAGymiOGH844UIU-Eikrd_BFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145533/U3223QZ_webcam_expanded_using_MSFT_Teams.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The webcam will let you show up crystal clear in meetings, and also lets you unlock your computer with Windows Hello.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cQvCL7"&gt;That webcam is attached to a decently specced display: it’s 31.5 inches, IPS, and runs at 60Hz. While the low refresh rate means it probably won’t be a game streamer’s first pick — a shame, because a built-in face cam would actually be handy — it should be totally fine for a home (or regular) office. Plus, it has two 14W speakers built in, which should let you hear anyone you’re talking to well enough, though they might appreciate it if you just used headphones instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4byydQ"&gt;The monitor also has a lot going for it beyond the screen and videoconferencing features. If you connect to it with USB-C, it basically acts as a hub, giving you access to five 10Gbps USB-A ports, ethernet, and another USB-C port. If your computer supports Display Stream Compression, you can even use the monitor’s DisplayPort out port to daisy-chain another 4K monitor. Oh, and like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22214786/dell-monitor-microsoft-teams-button-features-specs-price-release-date"&gt;some other Dell monitors&lt;/a&gt;, the U3223QZ has a dedicated Microsoft Teams button on the front.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H2FC-hGiysaG5D3Kn4tnpsrg6GI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145479/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_12.26.22.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dell’s absolutely packed this monitor with ports, but you only need a single USB-C cable to connect to it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X0oJq3"&gt;It’s also got HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.4 input ports, and if you plug in multiple devices, you can view them in picture-by-picture or picture-in-picture modes. Handily, it’s also got a built-in KVM, which lets you use one pair of peripherals with multiple computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mS9ZO"&gt;The ergonomic situation also seems pretty solid: the U3223QZ’s stand supports tilt, swivel, and height adjustments, including the ability to turn the monitor vertically according to &lt;a href="https://content.hmxmedia.com/dell-u3223qz-monitor/index.html"&gt;Dell’s 3D demo&lt;/a&gt; (though that may make things awkward if you’re trying to use the webcam). If that’s not enough, it also has 100mm x 100mm VESA mounting holes for attaching the display to a monitor arm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O74eCs"&gt;The monitor will be available starting March 29th, and Dell says it’ll share pricing information closer to the release date. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will pay top execs $1 million each after declining to boost workers’ pay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit 2016" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G4C4plmDrDIFTz7byk2DKL-MqdU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347985/615656976.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Scarnici/Getty Images for Fortune&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JrBlFq"&gt;Google is giving four of its top execs a significant pay bump, raising their salaries from $650,000 to $1 million, just weeks after the company told staffers it wouldn’t automatically adjust salaries to account for inflation. The new executive salaries were disclosed in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204422000009/goog-20211228.htm"&gt;an SEC filing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwv9Gi"&gt;The executives receiving the $1 million base salaries are chief financial officer Ruth Porat, senior vice president Prabhakar Raghavan (who is in charge of Google search); senior vice president and chief business officer Philipp Schindler; and president of global affairs and chief legal officer Kent Walker. All four executives are eligible to “participate in a maximum $2,000,000 annual bonus program, based on contributions to Google’s performance against social and environmental goals for 2022,” according to the filing. Each person has also been granted stock awards with target values in the millions of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09ieAI"&gt;Google has been very financially successful as of late — it posted its fifth quarter in a row of record profits &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747193/google-q3-2021-earnings-record-revenue-profit"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. But in contrast to giving the four execs huge pay raises, Google’s vice president of compensation told workers at an all-hands in December that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828132/google-employee-wages-inflation-2021-record-profits"&gt;doesn’t plan to make broad salary adjustments&lt;/a&gt; to account for the &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coming-up-u-s-consumer-price-index-for-november-11639142278"&gt;rising inflation rate in the US&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RNwtr"&gt;The raises were also given as Google is embroiled in a legal battle with employees over charges that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421969/google-illegally-firing-three-workers-nlrb-president-biden"&gt;they were illegally fired in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The employees are planning to call one of the recipients of a new $1 million salary, Kent Walker, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tri_Becca90/status/1429825092779876352"&gt;to testify as an adverse witness&lt;/a&gt;. Employees are also reportedly dissatisfied with the company’s seemingly different remote work policies for higher-ups. In July, senior vice president for technical infrastructure Urs Hölzle announced he was moving to New Zealand, which two employees &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-employees-angered-by-search-giants-hypocritical-remote-work-policies/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was emblematic of a double standard for executives.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon joins T-Mobile and AT&amp;T by offering a truly unlimited mobile plan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RioKII8rw-_HAUG5yHKi7ZJVcYs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347981/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon is the latest carrier to offer a mobile data plan without monthly caps on its fastest network speeds.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VkTGlc"&gt;Verizon has &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/power-verizon-5g-ultra-wideband-coming" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;updated its unlimited plans&lt;/a&gt; in anticipation of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;new 5G spectrum coming online &lt;s&gt;tomorrow&lt;/s&gt; soonish&lt;/a&gt;. The new plans cost the same and include the same level of access to the carrier’s Nationwide and Ultra Wideband 5G networks, but the priciest Get More plan receives a notable upgrade: unlimited monthly “premium data.” That puts it on even terms with the other major carriers’ top-tier unlimited plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llbC6h"&gt;The plans previously known as Start, Play More, Do More, and Get More Unlimited are now called 5G Start Unlimited, 5G Play More Unlimited... you get the idea. The Get More plan ($90 / month for one line with autopay) previously included 50GB of premium data each month — once customers reached that limit, they’d be subject to slowdowns during times of network congestion. The new 5G Get More plan does away with that monthly cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XnOv32"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Cellphone plan fine print, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"},{"title":"The best phone plans in 2021 (and how to pick one)","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22606623/best-cell-phone-plans-verizon-att-t-mobile"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8IZGUr"&gt;Verizon is playing a little bit of catch-up here; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573847/att-unlimited-elite-data-cap-4k-streaming-phone-plan"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s Unlimited Elite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;T-Mobile’s Magenta Max&lt;/a&gt; already offer all-you-can-eat premium mobile data. The new 5G Get More plan also includes a boost in premium mobile hotspot data: 50GB, up from 30GB. The Play More and Do More plans now offer 30GB compared to 15GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKZTDq"&gt;One thing remains the same, though: customers on the basic Start Unlimited plan won’t have access to the faster Ultra Wideband network at all — just slower Nationwide 5G. That’s no great loss at the moment, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;when C-band joins the call&lt;/a&gt;, it’ll be a real bummer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia still has no idea how to pronounce the name of its best gaming GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E6jwFu65pwQ_HbDdOct1PuNKcQI=/112x0:1312x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347965/85lXfjr.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GpIOHA"&gt;Ti or Ti?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRCi0k"&gt;It’s a question that’s plagued Nvidia fans for years, ever since the company started appending the “Ti” designation to its most powerful GPUs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866454/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-specifications-release-date-price-ces-2022"&gt;like the RTX 3090 Ti&lt;/a&gt; that Nvidia just announced at CES 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JvwW8e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nvidia announces RTX 3090 Ti with faster memory and performance","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866454/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-specifications-release-date-price-ces-2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fnCbFv"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; do you pronounce “Ti”? There are two camps: those who pronounce it “tie,” like the neck garment or the first syllable of “titanium,” while others fervently insist that it’s pronounced as initials: “tee-eye.” Not even Nvidia seems to know which is right, as the company’s CES presentation showed — different presenters switched back and forth between saying “tie” and “tee-eye” from one segment to the next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ylzn2o"&gt;Should “GeForce” be called “Gee-Eee Force”? Of course not. Do you say “Ertex” instead of RTX? Preposterous. But Nvidia has let the “tie” / “tee-eye” debate simmer unchecked, even though the branding dates as far back as the GeForce 2 Ti from 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZ0VzO"&gt;Here’s a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq_q6tp3vI0"&gt;YouTube supercut&lt;/a&gt; of Nvidia’s senior vice president Jeff Fisher pronouncing it “tie” many, many times during the RTX 3080 Ti launch last year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9uQfb5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qq_q6tp3vI0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t4VNYN"&gt;And yet whenever founder and CEO Jensen Huang (Nvidia’s motorcycle jacket-wearing public face of the company) cooks up a new graphics card in his kitchen, he tends to say “tee-eye” instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYBjny"&gt;When asked about the proper pronunciation, the company punted on the issue entirely, with Nvidia’s corporate communications director Hector Marinez telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “there is no wrong way to pronounce Ti.... as long as you spell it correctly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IoH5GM"&gt;Or, in other words, in Nvidia’s eyes... it’s a tie.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is testing a Twitter-like Repost button for sharing videos </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z1QJeszsZ6W4lctCI0z2_76Lu9E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347937/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ippRK5"&gt;The highly addictive clock app is testing a feature that should save you the trouble of having to DM the most share-worthy clips from your For You page with friends. TikTok has introduced a “Repost” button that works a little like Twitter’s retweet feature — but it doesn’t appear to be available to everyone yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CH5y5G"&gt;Several sites &lt;a href="https://www.imore.com/tiktok-testing-repost-button-will-share-content-your-followers"&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.distractify.com/p/tiktok-repost-button"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/20/tiktok-testing-new-way-to-let-users-repost-content-on-the-social-network/"&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt;, and social media consultant Matt Navarra &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1472579035641397252"&gt;tweeted an image&lt;/a&gt; of the button on December 19th. &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;today reported a more &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/tiktok-tests-its-own-version-of-the-retweet-with-a-new-repost-button/"&gt;detailed explanation&lt;/a&gt; of how the tool works in practice, including that it seems to be limited to the For You feed from the share menu rather than throughout the TikTok app. (Videos that are shared can similarly be un-shared from this menu as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UMU7oO"&gt;Additionally, videos shared with the Repost button won’t appear in the sharer’s profile — just on their friends’ for For You feeds. According to TechCrunch, the Repost button will only push the video into the feeds of users who follow each other. The feature is reportedly being tested with a limited number of users, and some of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff had access to it while others did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4gLovI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;TikTok is testing a ‘Repost’ button &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;h/t &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adrianokev1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@adrianokev1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Nwbj07GXsK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Nwbj07GXsK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1472579035641397252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H8yZBz"&gt;TikTok did not immediately return a request for comment about the feature or how widely it’s available at this time, but the company told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; in a statement that it’s “always thinking about new ways to bring value to our community and enrich the TikTok experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQdctu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports that some users are seeing a “Recommend” button in place of the Repost tool. Both prompt users to share why they’re reposting the video — a step, it’s worth noting, you can skip entirely by simply DMing it. Though again, depending on the pool of mutuals you want to share a video with, that could be a bit of an inconvenience. Keep in mind comments on shared videos can be seen, though they’ll disappear if you un-share a video with your mutuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="miGk3Y"&gt;As I have exactly five (5) mutual friends on TikTok who receive anywhere between two and 20 TikTok DMs a day from me alone, I imagine they’ll be grateful for the shuffle-in alternative to being pinged a dozen times daily if and when they get it.&lt;/p&gt;
