    <title>Google Pixel 6 leak teases Magic Eraser feature, plus five years of Android security updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 (top) and Pixel 6 Pro (bottom)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pJ3qw9qBEwqt_izogsA4VR5JuMQ=/0x1364:4500x4364/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69974319/Google_Pixel_6_Pro_Google_Pixel_6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Google Pixel 6 (top) and Pixel 6 Pro (bottom) | Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fA13dV"&gt;New leaks from a marketing site appear to confirm that the camera for the Pixel 6 will have a new Magic Eraser feature, and the devices will apparently get five years of Android security updates (h/t &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/09/pixel-6-magic-eraser-camera-features/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5 Google)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAMizQ"&gt;According to reliable leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1446843190892453889?s=21"&gt;Evan Blass, the Carphone Warehouse website&lt;/a&gt; was showing images of Google marketing materials for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro (the images have since been taken down, but you can view the earlier versions of the Carphone Warehouse pages on the Wayback Machine &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211009124417/https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/google/pixel6-river-content.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211009124928/https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/google/pixel6-pro-river-content.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Screenshots show the description for the previously leaked Magic Eraser, which will apparently be linked to Google Photos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="AW8juw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magic Eraser makes distractions disappear with a few taps. Remove strangers and unwanted objects in Google Photos, so the people and places that you capture remain the true stars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UQqO77"&gt;Much of what is in the latest photos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714141/google-pixel-6-pro-marketing-images-leak-evleaks-wireless-charger-face-unlock"&gt;has been leaked&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;confirmed already&lt;/a&gt;; the Pixel 6 camera will have a 50MP main sensor and a 12MP ultrawide lens, and the Pixel 6 Pro will have a 48MP telephoto lens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="H22CiN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"This is the Pixel 6","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cczVQ3"&gt;And as &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pro-five-years-android-updates-134435892.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget &lt;/em&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;, some of the copy on the leaked images (in the tiny, tiny fine print) references “Android security updates for at least five years from when the device first became available on the Google Store in the US.” That would mean Pixel 6 devices would have protection into 2026. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmPZaA"&gt;Google did get ahead of some of this year’s leaks with early announcements about the Pixel 6 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686534/google-pixel-6-pro-leak-display-screen-video"&gt;the Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, including hints about its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676099/google-pixel-6-tensor-processor-rumor-arm-cortex-x1-core-mystery-strange"&gt;Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt;. The company will hold its traditional &lt;a href="https://pixelevent.withgoogle.com/"&gt;autumn hardware event&lt;/a&gt; on October 19th, where it will “officially introduce” the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boeing Starliner test flight delayed until 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Boeing Orbital Flight Test-2 Prelaunch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P1ARKh_uUMVX0k1z08p2l3HfReY=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69974010/1234298178.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A test flight for Boeing’s Starliner has been pushed back to 2022 | NASA/Joel Kowsky&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ItzWo7"&gt;NASA has officially &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2021/10/08/nasa-boeing-update-starliner-orbital-flight-test-2-status/"&gt;pushed back the launch&lt;/a&gt; of its Orbital Flight-Test 2 until next year, as it continues to work on an oxidizer isolation valve issue on Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft, the agency announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jtAp5"&gt;The agency said in a &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2021/10/08/nasa-boeing-update-starliner-orbital-flight-test-2-status/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it’s continuing to assess potential launch windows for the mission: “The team currently is working toward opportunities in the first half of 2022 pending hardware readiness, the rocket manifest and space station availability,” according to the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVHnkI"&gt;Steve Stitch, manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, added that it was “a complex issue,” affecting parts of the spacecraft that aren’t easy to access, which has required “a methodical approach and sound engineering to effectively examine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SyPsZU"&gt;Boeing’s Starliner is one of two vehicles designed to take passengers to and from the International Space Station as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program; SpaceX’s Crew Dragon is the other. NASA required each company to launch an uncrewed test flight, followed by a crewed test flight as part of the process. So far, Starliner has only conducted one uncrewed flight, but it suffered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21127127/boeing-starliner-spacecraft-nasa-safety-software-glitch-catastrophic"&gt;software problems&lt;/a&gt; before it could reach the ISS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6EqYt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22595730/boeing-starliner-astronaut-capsule-launch-nasa-oft2"&gt;Boeing had hoped to fly the Starliner&lt;/a&gt; without passengers over the summer in a second attempt at an uncrewed flight, but hours before liftoff the company found the problems with some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607683/boeing-starliner-technical-issue-nasa-launch-postponed"&gt;spacecraft’s propulsion valves&lt;/a&gt; and NASA scrubbed the launch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPVFXA"&gt;Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712701/nasa-boeing-starliner-astronaut-assignment-nicole-mann-josh-cassada-spacex-dragon"&gt;NASA announced it was reassigning two astronauts&lt;/a&gt; who were supposed to fly on upcoming Starliner flights to an upcoming SpaceX flight instead. Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada will fly on the fifth crewed SpaceX mission to the International Space Station, currently scheduled for autumn 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk cites ‘last minute concerns’ in delay of Tesla software rollout</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IIKEcfb1JjTROcqo5jSI5UXGKyA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69973360/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tesla has delayed the latest rollout of its so-called “Full Self-Driving” software | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QhjOKD"&gt;Tesla has delayed the rollout of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta 10.2 software rollout because of last-minute concerns, CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1446752265012908032"&gt;Elon Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt; early Saturday. He apologized for the delay, saying the release would likely happen Sunday or Monday. He didn’t elaborate on what the “concerns” were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g5kbkY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A few last minute concerns about this build. Release likely on Sunday or Monday. Sorry for the delay.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1446752265012908032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jp6gGh"&gt;The software was supposed to roll out Friday to about 1,000 Tesla owners with perfect safety scores of 100 —as determined by the automaker— with a gradual rollout for those with scores at 99 and below after that, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1446104772092772352?s=20"&gt;according to Musk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZWVld"&gt;Tesla has been testing the beta version of its FSD software for about a year, and despite the head of the National Transportation Safety Board &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22682272/ntsb-official-tesla-safety-elon-musk-full-self-driving"&gt;expressing serious concerns about the software’s safety&lt;/a&gt;, the carmaker began expanding FSD access to more drivers last month. Before a Tesla driver gets access to FSD, however, the company &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/safety-score"&gt;determines their “safety score,”&lt;/a&gt; using criteria that evaluate “the likelihood that your driving could result in a future collision.” The score is tabulated using data collected by sensors in the driver’s Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dF5V6n"&gt;The company has required owners who opt in to the FSD beta to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22696463/tesla-fsd-beta-nda-video-clips-controversy-full-self-driving"&gt;sign non-disclosure agreements&lt;/a&gt;, and asked that they refrain from sharing video clips online of the system’s mistakes. To reiterate: the FSD software doesn’t make Teslas fully autonomous; Musk himself has said he thinks the “feature complete” version of the software will only be “&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/01/13/tesla-full-self-driving-feature-complete-soon-elon-musk/#:~:text=When%20Musk%20talks%20about%20a,features%20with%20city%20driving%20capability.&amp;amp;text=So%20feature-complete%20means%20it's,it%20would%20still%20be%20supervised."&gt;likely&lt;/a&gt;” to drive someone from their home to work without human intervention and will still require supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXoFAT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WaK7dl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to work with the Windows 11 Widget panel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/694f7SWBn0F7wuLDbff8nsj9vK8=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69973224/Screenshot__89_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O6KHvb"&gt;Windows 11 has introduced a brand new Widgets panel, where you can access a variety of updated information using configurable topic boxes (what Microsoft calls information cards). It’s made up of two sections: a top section that offers widgets for weather, sports, your latest photos, and other personalized topics, and a news section that offers clickable headlines from a variety of sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="STPP33"&gt;Here’s how to make the most of the current Windows 11 widgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2vfZgW"&gt;Access your widgets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OGVhCa"&gt;To access the widgets, select the Widgets icon in the taskbar (it’s the one that looks like a square divided into white and blue sections). You can also hit the Window + W keys or, if you’ve got a touchscreen, swipe from the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yZhWf"&gt;You’ll probably see a variety of starter widgets on top that will give you info about sports scores, the weather, stock prices, and any images you may have in your OneDrive account. There is also a search field and a button that lets you add new widgets. Under that, you can scroll down to find a number of news sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="HjryVg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Windows 11 review: a familiar home that’s still being renovated","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="4KQZpC"&gt;Adjust your widgets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PtemlK"&gt;There are a variety of ways you can tweak your widget panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HF6dUr"&gt;To move your widgets around, long-press on the top of a widget until you see an open hand. (This is as opposed to a “pointing” hand, which enables you to click on a link.) You can then change its position on the panel. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BfwkKR"&gt;To change the size of a widget, remove it from your panel, or customize it, click on the three dots in the upper right corner. The selections that you see will depend on the widget; for example, the Weather widget can be small, medium, or large, and you can customize it to set a default location and work either in Fahrenheit or Celsius. The Photos app, meanwhile, only sizes to medium or large and has no other customizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The three “More” dots let you adjust the size of the widget, customize it, or remove it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8_eGprXR_MNm7yjYogaPmFfDPmY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910889/Screenshot__90_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The three “More” dots let you adjust the size of the widget, customize it, or remove it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HTlFhG"&gt;Click on the name of the widget in the upper left corner, and you will be taken to a separate page where you can access more information — more details on the weather, for example, or more of the latest sports scores. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FppMZ8"&gt;If you want to see the current selection of widgets available, click on the “Add widgets” button that is between your widgets and the news feeds. It’s not a large list right now — I counted 11, all available are Microsoft-produced. Hopefully, however, there will be additional third-party entries coming. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Windows 11 doesn’t yet have a great many widgets, but that may change." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZHPqOBaOByV3qSk_2fR3hhDz59M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910910/Screenshot__9_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 doesn’t yet have a great many widgets, but that may change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kolIrB"&gt;News feed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UeemFV"&gt;The news section is below the “Add widgets” button. It is headed by a “Top stories” section that highlights several headlines, followed by individual stories. Both come with Facebook-like icons that you can attach to each story (including thumbs-up, heart, “surprised,” “thinking,” sad, or angry). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can “react” to each news item with an appropriate mood icon." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/74_KpSX9IOcV4UPgGXQBnIm4A6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910959/Screenshot__93_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can “react” to each news item with an appropriate mood icon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fYZnGF"&gt;Select the three dots next to each headline, and you can see more or fewer stories like that, hide stories from that source, save it for later (in other words, bookmark it), or report it. Any bookmarked stories will have a gray square around those three dots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aYpbBm"&gt;Personalize your interests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0WE0nQ"&gt;The “Add widgets” button also offers a link (in the lower-left corner) that lets you tell the Widget app what you are and are not interested in. (You can get to the same place by clicking on the three dots next to a news story and select “Manage interests.”)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can influence what shows up in your news feed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AJznWtaiHWWCRkbXGegL6CRbyOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910915/Screenshot__96_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can influence what shows up in your news feed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7MuwLr"&gt;Either way, you’ll end up on the Microsoft Start page — essentially, the settings page for the Edge browser. Using the “My Interests” tab, you can tell Windows what types of news stories you want or don’t want. On the left side of the page, you can choose from categories such as News, Sports, Travel, Health, etc.; as you click on each of those categories, you’ll get a list of specific topics in the main window. For example, if you select “Entertainment,” you can choose from topics such as “Celebrities,” “Music,” or “Books,” among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8v3s9"&gt;Other tabs you can choose from include “Profile” (which introduces you to what is called the “Microsoft News Community”), “My Saves” (any stories you saved), “History” (a list of stories you’ve read within the last 48 hours), and “Experience Settings.” You may want to visit this last: it lets you choose the language of your feed (the default is English) or toggle several features on and off, including those Facebook-like reaction icons. You can also toggle off some of the basic information cards, such as finance or weather.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you’re not in the mood for community reactions, you can remove them." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nD4ZpdeGpaLpiMbq3hBWMIeKZt0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910923/Screenshot__98_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re not in the mood for community reactions, you can remove them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oR0nT0"&gt;Currently, the Windows 11 widgets seem to be more of a curiosity or a way to take a quick break than a real tool. However, if and when third-party widgets become available, the widget pane could become truly useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkpwuP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This 55-inch QLED TV is available for a stellar price at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1RkkI3kNufOMf8f2Y0jwE6HuY84=/180x454:2951x2301/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69973161/6450248cv12d.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZANC3f"&gt;Perhaps not as impressive as some of the cutting-edge OLED TVs, it's tough to argue with a deal this good. The 55-inch Insignia F50 4K TV is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfKnu68UQLc#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available at Best Buy for $450&lt;/a&gt;, nearly its lowest price ever. This sizeable QLED panel features a 60Hz refresh rate and is powered by the Fire TV OS allowing for built-in Alexa voice controls. This gives the TV native access to most major streaming services, including Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus. The picture can be enhanced with Dolby Vision and HDR for increased depth of color, and a narrow bezel provides the TV with a sleek aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="enB6qD"&gt;The ever-increasing size of game updates has become something of a meme by now. If you’re tired of constantly freeing up space on your PC or console, we recommend investing in the slim Samsung 970 Evo Plus SSD. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fsamsung-970-evo-plus-2tb%2Fp%2FN82E16820147744%3FItem%3DN82E16820147744" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This 2TB is currently enjoying a deep discount on Newegg and is available for $250&lt;/a&gt;. The M.2 form-factor of this SSD makes it a cinch to install in whatever platform needs a little extra storage space. Besides providing more room for saves and local installations, the faster transfer speeds offered by M.2 SSDs can help improve the load times of anything installed on them. Just don’t expect them to improve your framerates, or your kill-death-ratio for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VEGf8e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797429"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A7L35m"&gt;If you’re looking for ways to beef up the sound of your home theatre, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fklipsch-k1069074%2Fp%2F0W3-000R-004D1%3FItem%3D0W3-000R-004D1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this six-piece surround sound system from Klipsch is available for $289&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price ever at Newegg. This massive system comes with a pair of front and rear speakers, as well as a center channel and wireless subwoofer. Each speaker is capable of standing on its own, but they also feature built-in mounts if you’d rather anchor them to the wall. The one potential drawback to this otherwise outstanding deal is that you’ll need a standalone 5.1 receiver to take advantage of everything this system has to offer. However, surround receivers typically fall in the $300-$400 range, making them relatively affordable, and will still result in a net discount on this usually pricey set of speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oS0B2Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797253"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qn654T"&gt;You know what they say, “pics or it didn’t happen”, now with the Elgato Game Capture HD60 S+, nobody will ever have reason to doubt your speed run of ever &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22710468/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid: Dread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ever again. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfKmTuqiCtM#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This slim capture card is available at Best Buy for $164&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price ever. While the utility of this device is somewhat lost on your typical gamer, this gadget is a must for any streamer or content creator that wants high-fidelity video from a console or external PC. Capable of capturing output from any 4K HDMI source at 60Hz the capture card plugs into your console and operates as a throughput to a nearby PC with streaming software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJsJl3"&gt;A device like this is going to be more useful for someone that does their gaming on consoles, as anyone with a PC can typically stream their gameplay directly to their preferred platform. However, for consoles with no built-in streaming capabilities, like the Nintendo Switch, this is the best way to piece together highlights of your gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aey1H6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797301"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wGZIXe"&gt;An excellent, flat-panel gaming monitor, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fblack-acer-nitro-gaming-series-vg270u-pbmiipx-27%2Fp%2FN82E16824011243%3FItem%3DN82E16824011243" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Acer Nitro VG270U is available for just $340 at Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, which is a reasonable discount. This 27-inch monitor offers some specs that are perfect for gaming, including a 144Hz refresh rate and AMD Freesync compatibility for super-smooth performance. The 1440p resolution offers a sharp picture and the panel has inputs for HDMI 1.4, 2.0, and DisplayPort for a variety of connectivity options. The stand has limited adjustment options, with only a small tilt range available, can be attached to a wall or monitor arm with the integrated 100x100mm VESA mount. While the monitor does come with built-in 2W speakers, they can be a bit underpowered, for the best gaming experience we’d recommend investing in some headphones or a standalone speaker system.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is appealing the Epic Games ruling it originally called a ‘resounding victory’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rw1L-2fRK2yD6eV4lSRtlNc_Ofs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69972129/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple is appealing the Epic Games ruling | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HXBaCg"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business"&gt;potentially billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; and some control over the App Store at stake, Apple has filed for an appeal of the ruling in its major trial against Epic. While Apple largely won that case (the company went so far as to call the ruling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667769/apple-epic-lost-lawsuit-verdict-ruling"&gt;a “resounding victory”&lt;/a&gt;) with Judge Gonzalez Rogers ruling in favor of Apple in nine of the ten claims Epic brought against the company, it did lose in one important way: the judge found that Apple violated California’s anti-steering rules, and demanded that Apple let developers link to outside payment systems. That policy would have taken over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;, but it may be pushed out beyond that — and it seems that’s the point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzMH0j"&gt;As part of the appeal, Apple is asking for a stay to prevent the company from having to implement the new anti-steering rules, arguing that it “will allow Apple to protect consumers and safeguard its platform while the company works through the complex and rapidly evolving legal, technological, and economic issues.” And the company’s arguments there are pretty revealing if we’re reading the document right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yxijeu"&gt;For instance, Apple claims that the new anti-steering rule is unnecessary because the company had already agreed to delete the offending section of its App Store Guidelines in the &lt;em&gt;Cameron v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;settlement, but that’s news to us: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;at the time&lt;/a&gt;, Apple only agreed to “clarify” that app developers were allowed to communicate with consenting customers, not link to outside payment systems. That clarification was widely seen by developers as a red herring. At the time, Apple didn’t say anything about deleting a section of its App Store Guidelines entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yPUaOe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple and Epic both lost today","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667769/apple-epic-lost-lawsuit-verdict-ruling"},{"title":"The future of the App Store depends on the difference between a ‘button’ and an ‘external link’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"},{"title":"What comes next for the App Store?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671574/epic-apple-app-store-new-rules-meaning-ruling-decision"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fPZLBZ"&gt;It also seems like Apple is genuinely afraid that the court order &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; force them to open up the App Store to alternate payment mechanisms, despite what some Apple pundits have claimed. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"&gt;A button might actually be a button&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="32fHay"&gt;Links and buttons to alternate payment mechanisms are fraught with risk. Users who click on a payment link embedded in an app—particularly one distributed through the curated App Store—will expect to be led to a webpage where they can securely provide their payment information, email address, or other personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2k0SHS"&gt;Apple goes on to argue that if it were forced to allow app developers to link to external payment systems, it wouldn’t be able to protect users from fraud: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="07eXrO"&gt;While Apple could examine the links in the version of the app submitted for review, there is nothing stopping a developer from changing the landing point for that link or altering the content of the destination webpage. Additionally, Apple currently has no ability to determine whether a user who clicks on an external link actually received the products or features she paid for. Apple already receives hundreds of thousands of reports each day from users, and allowing links to external payment options would only increase this burden. In essence, the introduction of external payment links, particularly without sufficient time to test and evaluate the security implications, will lead to the very same security concerns that Apple combats with the use of IAP more generally, which the Court agreed were legitimate, procompetitive reasons for the design of the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9GgANe"&gt;There are a number of open questions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;about how well Apple protects App Store users&lt;/a&gt; — it was only this past week that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22705405/apple-report-a-problem-button-app-store-scams"&gt;added a feature to easily report obvious App Store scams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67W2hL"&gt;The company even cites a blog post from (and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s story about) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714677/apple-in-app-payment-competitor-paddle-epic-ruling"&gt;Paddle, a would-be rival to Apple’s in-app payments that emerged after the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;ruling&lt;/a&gt;, using it to illustrate one possible threat to consumers. Not because of its lower fees, of course, but because “In contrast to Apple’s strict rules surrounding privacy, that developer intends to provide access to user email addresses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSOivG"&gt;Other arguments are raised as well, which you can read in full in the document embedded at the bottom of this post. Overall, the company says that the “precipitous implementation of this aspect of the injunction would upset the careful balance between developers and customers provided by the App Store, and would irreparably harm both Apple and consumers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCH4s7"&gt;Apple also cites a previous case, &lt;em&gt;Ohio v. AmEx&lt;/em&gt;, as evidence that transaction platforms like the App Store can promote competition despite steering restrictions. (AmEx doesn’t double as a software marketplace, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ay66qJ"&gt;It’s important to note that Apple has only filed for appeal; we don’t know if the court will grant the appeal — and the stay— just yet. When the ruling originally hit in in September, Apple said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671736/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-case-ruling-appeal-decision"&gt;at the time&lt;/a&gt; that it hadn’t decided whether to appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xc5yqh"&gt;For its part, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667208/epic-games-appeal-apple-judge-rogers-ruling-court"&gt;Epic announced its intent to appeal&lt;/a&gt; on the same day Judge Gonzalez Rogers issued her order and permanent injunction against Apple. It was clear from the beginning that Epic wasn’t happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nQVyH"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney issued his response to the appeal, and it’s pretty much what you’d expect: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wDiEtX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple filed a peel &lt;a href="https://t.co/hvnfgg8lZC"&gt;https://t.co/hvnfgg8lZC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/TouBIrKiSp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TouBIrKiSp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1446627338058350599?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>My new favorite Twitter account just posts classic clips of SNL hosts introducing the musical guest</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7mufD9k3LYKu7FHt-9pYz5MqWt4=/0x0:597x398/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69971858/Screen_Shot_2021_10_08_at_2.31.36_PM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Erdz0K"&gt;The highlight of my Friday so far has been the discovery of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snlhostsintro"&gt;@snlhostsintro Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, which posts old clips of Saturday Night Live hosts introducing the musical guest. While the account isn’t new to everyone — it was created in September and already has more than 37,000 followers — I felt it was my duty to write about it because it posts some absolutely magical time capsules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58DyL4"&gt;Here’s a tame one to start, to give you an idea of the format: former US vice president Al Gore &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snlhostsintro/status/1443312858054344706"&gt;introducing Phish&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k3nNkv"&gt;But how about Sean Penn, with a casually-yet-confidently undone bow tie, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snlhostsintro/status/1446297346136940550"&gt;introducing LL Cool J&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vCk50G"&gt;Here’s Bernadette Peters &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snlhostsintro/status/1446281173399793664?s=20"&gt;introducing The Go-Go’s&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WRtr1U"&gt;And Christine Baranski &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snlhostsintro/status/1443672902012833821?s=20"&gt;enthusiastically introducing&lt;/a&gt; the notoriously downbeat band The Cure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3Epkkc"&gt;I also love Nathan Lane doing perhaps the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snlhostsintro/status/1436582941174337539"&gt;most metal SNL musical guest introduction ever&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iRzq4Y"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r4idoK"&gt;Part of the magic of the account is that there’s no context posted with any of the tweets. Whenever I click a new video, I &lt;em&gt;cannot wait&lt;/em&gt; to see who the host is going to introduce and how they are going to introduce them. The cognitive dissonance between the host and the band can be delicious — I can’t imagine &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snlhostsintro/status/1446271668788236296"&gt;John McCain and The White Stripes&lt;/a&gt; were all that chummy backstage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fFmNzc"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T6szrJ"&gt;The account is almost surely inspired by the massive popularity of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/craigweekend"&gt;@CraigWeekend&lt;/a&gt;, which posts the same video of Daniel Craig introducing The Weeknd &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CraigWeekend/status/1444071879455776773"&gt;every Friday&lt;/a&gt;. While that account has nearly 500,000 followers and seems to fill up my timeline weekly, Craig only recently learned of the existence of the meme during &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/movies/daniel-craig-no-time-to-die.html"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wReaV8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As we are speaking, it’s a Friday afternoon, and I am about to see my social media feeds populated with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/03/style/craig-weekend-daniel-craig.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a video of you declaring it to be the weekend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Has the popularity of this gotten back to you in any way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzbVF4"&gt;No, what is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9oiPn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a clip of you from that “Saturday Night Live” you hosted, introducing the Weeknd with almost a sense of relief. People just like to post that clip as a way of ushering in the weekend.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUD1Yd"&gt;They do? It’s amazing. I don’t know what that is, but thank you. That’s lovely. I suppose I’d have to have social media to know what that was all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VjMUFh"&gt;We’re still waiting for this week’s @CraigWeekend post, so it just doesn’t feel like the weekend yet. But if you want to get excited for the weekend now, here’s last week’s:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is trying to stop the sale of Amazon rainforest land on its Marketplace</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Large estate land management in Amazon rain forest,..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fCefAUBz4cNqyGi0hM1pNBH8MdA=/0x0:3504x2336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69971768/1235080881.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kqXEDb"&gt;Did you know you can sell land on Facebook Marketplace? No? Neither did I. Did you know people were trying to sell land in the Amazon rainforest on Marketplace? Again, neither did I! Selling land in ecological conservation areas is typically illegal and can have negative impacts on the flora, fauna, and people living there, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/curbing-amazon-land-listings-on-marketplace/"&gt;so Facebook announced Friday&lt;/a&gt; that it’s changing its commerce policies to explicitly prohibit the sale of protected land on Facebook and its Instagram and WhatsApp platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABHzYn"&gt;Facebook’s announcement comes after &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56168844"&gt;a February BBC investigation into its Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; that found people illegally sold large plots of land in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest on Facebook’s Craigslist alternative. The plots were frequently sold without an official land title designating ownership, driven by the deforestation of the Amazon caused by the Brazilian cattle industry, the BBC found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UOzuwz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Amazon is no longer for sale (on Facebook)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P46KPc"&gt;The social network didn’t want to independently stop the illegal sale of land in the Amazon initially because Facebook’s “commerce policies require buyers and sellers to comply with laws and regulations,” the company told the BBC in February. Now several months (and scandals) later, Facebook is taking a harder stance. “Listings may not promote the buying or selling of animals or animal products, or land in ecological conservation areas,” &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/policies_center/commerce/animals"&gt;Facebook’s updated policy reads&lt;/a&gt;. The company also plans to cross-reference listings against a database of protected land to identify anyone that violates its policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rc18X"&gt;The move is ultimately a good one, even if it's delayed. It’s just the timing that makes it strange. In the last few weeks, Facebook’s dealt with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;leaked research&lt;/a&gt;, a whistleblower &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;actively calling out&lt;/a&gt; the company’s supposed hypocrisy, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;a major global outage&lt;/a&gt;. Stopping the sale of the Amazon rainforest is just a strange cherry on Facebook’s shitty, multi-week sundae.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says outage affecting Instagram, Messenger, and more has been fixed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uoblHBIDaBQyhHx9ouY4ncr03RY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69971030/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0RYsoW"&gt;Facebook says it has fixed an outage that lasted for about two hours across some of its services on Friday. The outage, which Facebook says was caused by a configuration change, impacted Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and Workplace and affected people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6RsiDZ"&gt;“We’re so sorry if you weren’t able to access our products during the last couple of hours,”  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Facebook/status/1446585486605160448"&gt;Facebook said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. “We know how much you depend on us to communicate with one another. We fixed the issue — thanks again for your patience this week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hxDk4"&gt;The outage follows a massive one on Monday, which took down Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Oculus for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;nearly six hours&lt;/a&gt;. In an explanation posted the day after, Facebook said the backbone connecting the company’s data centers around the world &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710963/facebook-dns-bgp-outage-backbone-maintenance"&gt;was inadvertently shut down&lt;/a&gt;. The outage was extensive enough that it even broke &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709575/facebook-outage-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;internal systems used by Facebook employees&lt;/a&gt;, forcing them to turn to company-provided Outlook accounts to communicate instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TaZmd1"&gt;Friday’s outage was not related to the one that took place Monday, Facebook says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCz60d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 8th, 5:24PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Updated to reflect that the outage has been fixed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If you want to use the Apple Watch Series 7’s new fast charging, make sure to use the cable in the box</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TFzmi6Ppf8-Ek9wq06qiHdRiaw8=/74x0:820x497/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69971643/Capto_Capture_2021_09_14_01_24_25_PM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KhEdj0"&gt;One of the best features on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt; is its newly added fast charging system, which Apple claims is 33 percent and capable of charging the watch to about 80 percent charge in about 45 minutes. But if you want to take advantage of the fast charging, you’ll need to make sure to use the charger that comes with the Series 7, which is a brand new “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMLWJ3AM%2FA%2Fapple-watch-magnetic-fast-charger-to-usb-c-cable-1-m&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22716294%2Fapple-watch-series-7-fast-charging-cable-magnetic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Magnetic Fast Charger&lt;/a&gt;” that’s different from the old model (which doesn’t offer similar charging speeds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQsaH0"&gt;The old USB-C charger and the new model look identical from the outside, but only the new cable can charge the Series 7 at full speed (assuming you’ve got a USB-C charger that can put out the proper wattage, that is — Apple recommends its own 20W USB-C charger, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6tihBM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Make sure to actually use the cable that comes with the Series 7&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wRBb8G"&gt;And while Apple has already stopped selling the old USB-C charger that doesn’t offer fast charging on its site, they’re still available from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Magnetic-Charger-USB-C/dp/B07XR9TYQ1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;other retailers like Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, so you’ll want to make sure you’re buying the right one if you’re looking to pick up a spare. It also means that if you own an existing Apple Watch charging dock or stand that has a built-in charger, you won’t be able to take advantage of the faster charging available on the Series 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lquMvi"&gt;Of course, none of this matters if you own an older Apple Watch: even if you’re using the proper fast charging cable, the fast charging technology still needs a Series 7 watch to work. As Apple’s website notes: “Fast charging is only compatible with Apple Watch Series 7. Other models will have regular charge times.”&lt;/p&gt;
