    <title>Amazon Music Unlimited now lets you stream music videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PXKy9mA4YL-d7W0yo2ENFrVDLN0=/0x0:900x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68098258/Screenshot_20201201_131735_Amazon_Music.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dvqPsZ"&gt;Amazon is adding a large vault of music videos to its Amazon Music Unlimited service. Unlike some competitors like YouTube Music, Amazon’s videos are only available to paying subscribers, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/01/amazon-music-unlimited-subscribers-can-now-stream-music-videos-in-the-app/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — not listeners on the ad-sponsored free tier. But the selection seems on par with other services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71ifE4"&gt;You’ll now see music videos show up as their own section in search results and on artist pages. There will also be music video playlists to watch through. As with YouTube Music, there’s a toggle on the now playing screen to switch between the music video and just the audio of whatever you’re currently listening to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b0LGXk"&gt;The debut of music videos comes after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21583123/amazon-music-x-ray-trivia-song-tracks"&gt;Amazon brought its X-Ray feature to the service&lt;/a&gt; for US and UK customers in November as a way to display behind-the-scenes trivia and “fun facts” about currently playing tracks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8C0ZP"&gt;Amazon Music Unlimited costs $8 monthly for Prime members and the standard $10 / month for non-Prime subscribers. That’s for standard streaming quality, and Amazon also offers an “HD” tier with lossless and hi-res streaming, which remains a unique offering compared to larger competitors Spotify and Apple Music. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pinterest shareholders sue over ‘toxic’ work culture</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pinterest Takes Stock Public On New York Stock Exchange" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s9BuWQmhQZiwFE0bSZ6jB9Hadb8=/0x0:5329x3553/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68085150/1143515118.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9GwGmY"&gt;Pinterest shareholders are suing the company’s top executives, including CEO Ben Silbermann, for allegedly enabling a culture of discrimination. The toxic work environment has hurt the company’s reputation, leading to a user boycott and financial harm, the complaint alleges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzODwN"&gt;The CEO “repeatedly placed himself before the Company, surrounding himself with yes-men and marginalizing women who dared to challenge Pinterest’s White, male leadership clique,” the complaint says. The company ignored or silenced employees who tried to speak out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZllJkD"&gt;The plaintiff in the suit is the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, which oversees $8.5 billion in public assets, including retirement funds for thousands of Rhode Island teachers, firefighters, and nurses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIXESU"&gt;The suit claims Pinterest executives and board members breached their fiduciary duty by failing to respond to allegations of workplace discrimination. “Even when presented with widespread claims of race and gender discrimination at Pinterest, the [executives and board members] did nothing to address this misconduct,” it says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNTsUD"&gt;Issues with Pinterest’s internal culture first surfaced in June, when &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/03/pinterest-race-bias-black-employees/"&gt;Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks went public&lt;/a&gt; with allegations of racial discrimination and retaliation. The women helped lead some of Pinterest’s most high-profile initiatives, including banning anti-vax content and limiting the spread of plantation wedding posts, but were underpaid compared to white male colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jS07W7"&gt;Two months after Ozoma and Banks came forward, Pinterest’s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/11/technology/pinterest-francoise-brougher-gender-discrimination-lawsuit.html"&gt;former COO Françoise Brougher sued&lt;/a&gt; for discrimination and retaliation. She said she was left out of key meetings, given gendered feedback, and underpaid compared to her male colleagues, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/11/technology/pinterest-francoise-brougher-gender-discrimination-lawsuit.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When she spoke out about her mistreatment, she says she was fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qt6q4A"&gt;Brougher’s suit shined a spotlight on chief financial officer Todd Morgenfeld, who’d asked her “What is your job anyway?” in front of teammates and undermined her accomplishments in a performance review. When Brougher brought these complaints to Silbermann, he compared the conflict to “an old couple fighting over who would make coffee.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWGDWp"&gt;The shareholder suit says Pinterest executives violated securities law when they failed to disclose Brougher’s pay compared to male colleagues. This caused the company to file a “false and misleading” proxy statement to the SEC, deceiving investors about its compensation practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMfDSA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21429619/pinterest-workplace-discrimination-finance-team-unequal-culture-bias"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; investigated the finance team&lt;/a&gt;, finding new stories of unequal treatment for women and people of color at the company. McKenna Rogers, who worked there in 2018, said her manager asked inappropriate questions about her personal life, made a sex joke at a team happy hour, and retaliated when she tried to speak up. “After Rogers declined his advances and went to the HR department for help, her supervisor cancelled meetings, cut her off from work, and berated her,” the shareholder lawsuit says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNImWR"&gt;This isn’t the first time shareholders have tried to hold companies accountable in the wake of significant press coverage. In September, Google’s parent company Alphabet &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-settlement.html"&gt;settled a series of shareholder lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; claiming the company had created a toxic work environment where women were repeatedly sexually harassed. The complaints came after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html?module=inline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; the company protected former executive Andy Rubin, paying him $90 million after he was investigated for sexual harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMMQBv"&gt;Victoria’s Secret parent company L Brands also faced legal action after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/business/victorias-secret-razek-harassment.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;published a report&lt;/a&gt; on the culture of misogyny at the company. Defendants hoped to get records and further investigate the firm, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/victorias-secret-parent-company-sued-over-alleged-toxic-culture-2020-6"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVF9Fe"&gt;Pinterest did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wyze announces $20 smartwatch with nine-day battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aXwGFHQqliyIUp1qNbuVQ9zo2m0=/351x0:4149x2532/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68067494/Two.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UfpKgF"&gt;Wyze, the smart home company best known for its range of budget internet-connected security cameras, has announced its debut smartwatch. The &lt;a href="http://wyze.com/wyze-watch.html"&gt;Wyze Watch&lt;/a&gt; will be available in two sizes — 44mm and 47mm — when it ships in the US in February 2021, and like the rest of the company’s lineup, it’s priced affordably at $20. Wyze’s announcement follows the release of the company’s first fitness tracker, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150549/fitness-tracker-wyze-band-alexa"&gt;$25 Wyze Band&lt;/a&gt;, earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VQcYM"&gt;The watch will ship with a fairly standard selection of smartwatch features, including blood oxygen monitoring, heart rate tracking, an IP68 water and dust resistance rating, nine-day battery life, activity and sleep tracking, and integration with Google Fit and Apple Health. However, the watch will also integrate with Wyze’s other devices; the company promises that it’ll support shortcuts to let you control products like its smart bulbs. It can also display your notifications, allowing you to read email previews and texts, though Wyze’s press release doesn’t explicitly say which mobile operating systems the watch works with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K0Y8dGFNTn1DFx_L7NmBQDbwVao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22129850/Six.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 47mm version of the watch (pictured) comes with a 1.75-inch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w-kyqWxAdqlw15Zhc_1nayvsDbo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22129849/Three.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wyze Watch will ship in February.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0XNdT9"&gt;In terms of specs, the 44mm Wyze Watch has a 1.4-inch LCD display with a resolution of 320 x 320 and a 260mAh battery. The 47mm version has a 1.75-inch LCD display with a resolution of 320 x 385 and a 300mAh battery. Both have 16MB of storage. Neither offer GPS tracking, or support for voice assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZuITm"&gt;It’s hard to see Wyze beating out competition from the likes of Apple or Samsung when it’s pricing its debut smartwatch at just $20. But if it can deliver on its modest promises to offer a simple, functional experience, then the Wyze Watch could become an attractive first smartwatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1pvRw"&gt;The Wyze Watch is available to preorder starting today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s Oversight Board takes its first six cases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1OE-tT5XlBXC5W8V2Xq-VgEiUpM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68061385/acastro_180806_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b9TKRb"&gt;Facebook’s Oversight Board, an independent body that reviews Facebook moderation decisions, has &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/719406882003532-announcing-the-oversight-board-s-first-cases-and-appointment-of-trustees/"&gt;accepted its first cases&lt;/a&gt;. The six appeals involve content removed under Facebook’s hate speech rules, nudity ban, and misinformation policies. They’re now open for seven days of public comment, after which the board will determine whether the posts should have been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxeF7l"&gt;Most of the cases involve users outside the US posting non-English content — a known &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-languages-insight/facebooks-flood-of-languages-leaves-it-struggling-to-monitor-content-idUSKCN1RZ0DW"&gt;weak point&lt;/a&gt; for Facebook moderation — and at least two hinge on the nuance of someone publishing hate content to implicitly criticize it. One user posted screenshots of &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/30/malaysias-mahathir-post-on-french-killings-taken-out-of-context"&gt;offensive tweets&lt;/a&gt; from former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, for instance, allegedly to raise awareness of “horrible words.” Another post involved a user who shared an alleged Joseph Goebbels quote, but who appealed by saying they were comparing Goebbels’s words to a “fascist model” in US politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vx2pVL"&gt;Each case will be referred to a five-member panel that includes one person from the same region as the original content. These panels will make their decisions — and Facebook will act on them — within 90 days. The oversight board, whose &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-oversight/facebook-names-first-members-of-oversight-board-that-can-overrule-zuckerberg-idUSKBN22I2LQ"&gt;first members&lt;/a&gt; were announced in May, includes digital rights activists and former European Court of Human Rights judge András Sajó. Their decisions will be informed by public comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHxV82"&gt;Five of the incidents were submitted by users, who have appealed over 20,000 decisions since the option opened in October. The last was referred by Facebook itself and deals with coronavirus-related misinformation — one of the platform’s touchiest subjects. Moderators removed a video that criticized French health officials for not authorizing unproven COVID-19 treatment hydroxychloroquine, which the video inaccurately referred to as a “cure.” The company later submitted it as “an example of the challenges faced when addressing the risk of offline harm that can be caused by misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdJOTc"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has compared the Oversight Board to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20870827/facebook-supreme-court-mark-zuckerberg-content-moderation-charter"&gt;a Supreme Court for Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. It’s supposed to offer a fair appeals process for users who get their content removed — something that often feels missing on social networks, especially as they take stricter steps to remove false information or offensive speech. At the same time, it eases the pressure on Facebook to make moderation calls. Cases like the pandemic video decision, for instance, will set an independently decided precedent for when Facebook removes similar content in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibUJJF"&gt;The Oversight Board — similar to the US Supreme Court — is largely supposed to interpret policies, not make new ones. Facebook has said it may also turn to the board for policy recommendations in the future, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBRkWA"&gt;Many of Facebook’s problems involve the speed and scale of content moderation, not the exact nuances of interpreting its policies. The Oversight Board obviously can’t hear all the appeals cases, and we don’t know exactly how rank-and-file moderators will apply its rulings to everyday decisions. But it’s the start of a long-awaited experiment in managing Facebook (a little) more like a government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0rXAoZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams gets an overhauled calling interface, CarPlay support, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K2TUFgb6SUp_h-igzbSg3RJHMb8=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68058693/microsoftteamscalling.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2qZoZZ"&gt;Microsoft is overhauling its calling features inside Microsoft Teams today. A new calling interface will now show contacts, voicemail, and calling history in a single location. It’s designed to allow Microsoft Teams to more easily replace your desk phone, with built-in spam call protection, reverse number lookup, and the ability to merge calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyMqEd"&gt;Microsoft Teams users will also be able to transfer calls between mobile and desktop soon, allowing people to quickly move locations in the middle of an audio or video call. The Teams app will let people join without audio on an additional device, or simply transfer the call and end it automatically on other devices. Microsoft says this particular feature will be available in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gLcavWyrxelkRO0J7NYX_Cky9k0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22133229/microsoftteamscalling.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Microsoft Teams calling features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D7oSCK"&gt;People who regularly record meetings in Microsoft Teams will also see some new options. You’ll be able to record meetings to SharePoint or OneDrive, providing greater flexibility than being limited to Microsoft’s Stream service. That will also make it easier to share calls or transcripts with people outside a Teams organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RVOsY"&gt;Finally, Microsoft is also bringing CarPlay support to Microsoft Teams. This will allow cars with built-in CarPlay to control Teams and for people to use Siri to initiate or answer calls. It’s not clear when Microsoft Team will support Android Auto in the future, though.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="s6IcmG"&gt;Heading into its second year, Google’s Stadia game streaming service is adding more games and making it easier to play without having to pay. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571699/google-stadia-destiny-2-free-to-play-game-chromebook-phone"&gt;The first free game released for the service was &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and now it has another multiplayer companion: &lt;em&gt;Super Bomberman R Online&lt;/em&gt; will become free today. All you need is a Stadia account, which is completely free. On Android or in the Chrome browser, you should be able to &lt;a href="https://stadia.com/link/aFu2pZmeQSnvPiZ16"&gt;click this link&lt;/a&gt; to launch the game now if you’re logged in to that account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8WUbk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bomberman &lt;/em&gt;is a particularly fitting title to make free, considering it’s got a 64-player battle royale mode that’s exclusive to Stadia, and its lobbies might have been difficult to fill if each player had to pay. Otherwise, it’s an updated 3D take on the bomb-laying and maze-navigating &lt;em&gt;Bomberman&lt;/em&gt; gameplay many players already know, which also released on the Nintendo Switch in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="zQr1Ct"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575100/google-stadia-one-year-anniversary-cloud-gaming-cyberpunk-2077-launch-test"&gt;Stadia’s first year was difficult&lt;/a&gt;, primarily because of the upfront cost to play on your TV or phone and a long wait for the games and features that Google promised before the service launched. Adding &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; for free last month was a big step in the right direction. And while maybe not as well-known, &lt;em&gt;Super Bomberman R Online&lt;/em&gt; adds another option for players to enjoy without having to invest in Stadia’s subscription service, Stadia Pro, or purchase any games upfront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vu2X1g"&gt;Google says it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612848/google-stadia-400-games-200-developers"&gt;big plans for Stadia in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, so expect more features and (hopefully) free games in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla whistleblower Martin Tripp ordered to pay $400,000 to settle hacking case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zhkAIKAW-njRZwPssYynnV3SvF8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68054219/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tGDtXv"&gt;Martin Tripp, the former Tesla worker who has been embroiled in a bitter legal battle with CEO Elon Musk for over two years, was ordered to pay his former employer $400,000 after admitting to leaking confidential information to a reporter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvjoR9"&gt;The settlement is intended to bring an end to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263757/tesla-elon-musk-employee-hack-spying-whistleblower-gigafactory-martin-tripp-drugs"&gt;one of the more sordid stories at Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, in which Tripp, a former process technician, locked horns with the billionaire CEO over allegations that Tesla was wasting a “jaw-dropping” amount of raw material as it ramped up production of the Model 3 sedan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XeTnH4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The settlement is intended to bring an end to one &lt;s&gt;﻿&lt;/s&gt;of the more sordid stories at Tesla&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="szRtQi"&gt;Musk later accused Tripp of “sabotage” and personally ordered investigators to hack Tripp’s phone and spy on his messages. Tesla even misled local police about a potential mass shooting by Tripp at the company’s Nevada factory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEeBr9"&gt;But in the end, Tripp came out on the losing side. The payment is part of a proposed settlement to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17484030/tesla-sues-employee-hacking-theft-leaking"&gt;a lawsuit filed by Tesla in 2018&lt;/a&gt; alleging that Tripp hacked the electric car company’s system and transferred “gigabytes” of data to third parties. As part of the agreement, Tripp admitted to violating laws related to trade secrets and computer crimes when he &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-model-3-scrap-waste-high-gigafactory-2018-5?r=UK"&gt;told a &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; reporter&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla was wasting a significant amount of raw materials during production of its Model 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8XleL"&gt;Tripp also agreed to pay $25,000 to Tesla for continuing to reveal information about the company, despite being ordered to stop by a judge. Tripp had been publishing a large number of documents and videos online, including many under a confidentiality order in the case. In August, Tripp fired his lawyers and set about representing himself in the case. It was also revealed that a Tesla short seller, &lt;a href="http://www.cablecarcapital.com/"&gt;The Funicular Fund&lt;/a&gt;, was financing Tripp’s legal defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bOk1Aq"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/19/21446587/judge-dismiss-defamation-employee-tesla-leak-elon-musk-model-3"&gt;a judge dismissed Tripp’s defamation case&lt;/a&gt; against Tesla, in which the former technician accused the company of spreading false rumors about him. After Tripp filed for whistleblower status with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Musk emailed a reporter at &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-03-13/when-elon-musk-tried-to-destroy-tesla-whistleblower-martin-tripp?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; telling them&lt;/a&gt; a tipster had contacted Tesla to say that Tripp might “come back and shoot people,” at the Nevada Gigafactory. The local sheriff determined the threat was not real, but Tesla issued a press release, which was picked up by several media outlets. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go watch this video about an AI system that can predict how proteins fold</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A diagram comparing an AlphaFold prediction with an identified protein shape, showing 99.09 percent Global Distance Test accuracy." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AVDQgynabdlgPnprYiR4bBFrd2U=/108x0:1262x769/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68052988/global_distance_result.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An AlphaFold prediction compared against an identified protein.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: DeepMind&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eUYngK"&gt;Within any living organism, there are thousands of different proteins, each with its own unique shape. For decades, the exact formation of those shapes has been a pain for scientists to figure out. How exactly does a protein, which starts as a string of amino acids, fold itself into the funky 3D shapes you might recognize from diagrams? AlphaFold, an &lt;a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphafold"&gt;AI from DeepMind&lt;/a&gt;, may have an answer. It can predict, with heretofore unseen accuracy, the shape a protein will take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBzmn7"&gt;AlphaFold was put to the test in a global competition called Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction, or CASP, which DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis calls the “Olympics of protein folding” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg7WjuFs8F4"&gt;in a video&lt;/a&gt;. During the competition, systems like AlphaFold are given the amino acid strings for proteins with shapes that have already been identified through previous experiments but haven’t been published yet. Judges compare the protein shapes produced by the systems with what they know the shapes should be. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A gif of two rotating protein fold models made up of curls and swirling lines. AlphaFold’s predictions are overlayed on the models, with 90.7 GDT accuracy on the left and 93.3 GDT accuracy on the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MLV4q-2KKwiqnXtDBpqLL6LTmY0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22132319/AlphaFold_prediction_comparisons.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DeepMind&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overlays of protein structures in green with AlphaFold’s predictions in blue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x6Pb2X"&gt;At the end of the competition, AlphaFold had the most accurate predictions of any CASP participant in its 25-year history by a wide margin. Even the predictions that weren’t accurate enough to be considered “competitive” with experimental results were only a few atom-widths off. The complete data still needs to be peer-reviewed and published, but the DeepMind team is excited about the results so far, saying in a blog post that they are “optimistic about the impact AlphaFold can have on biological research and the wider world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4DX4H"&gt;It can take years in the lab for scientists to identify the shapes of individual proteins. Neural networks like AlphaFold could help speed up biological research and drug development in the future. The AI method isn’t perfect yet, and it won’t be taking over for flesh-and-blood researchers anytime soon, but it could be a major step in the everlasting marathon of scientific advancement. To learn more about AlphaFold and to see a bunch of scientists and engineers getting giddy and fist-pumping over competition results, check out the video below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose adds swipe volume controls to QuietComfort Earbuds and Sport Earbuds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s-SrCqBMZVQwKFnEAD-c7xpLUno=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68050638/IMG_0723-1.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A5NCa7"&gt;One of the few complaints I had in my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507552/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-best-noise-cancellation"&gt;review of Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds&lt;/a&gt; was that they lacked onboard volume controls. Well, a few weeks after they went on sale, the company has now resolved that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojhIj6"&gt;In the latest update of the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bose-music/id1364986984"&gt;Bose Music app out today on iOS&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a new volume control option in settings. (Presumably this will be coming to the Android app imminently, as well.) Once you toggle it on, you’ll be able to swipe up and down on the right earbud to adjust how loud the audio is. This feature is available for both the QuietComfort Earbuds and less expensive Sport Earbuds. It’s something that was spotted in early user manuals for the earbuds but was removed before they shipped. I’m glad Bose has quickly moved to add this functionality, as it makes the premium earbuds more well-rounded when it comes to controls. And for Sport Earbuds owners, this means you won’t have to mess with your phone (or Siri or Google Assistant) in the middle of a workout or run if you need to change the volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdX1f1"&gt;Bose has also added an (optional) Spotify shortcut to its Noise Canceling Headphones 700. You can now set the headphones to launch Spotify on your mobile device with a tap and hold on the right ear cup. Other headphone makers, including Samsung, have previously added similar quick-access shortcuts to the popular streaming music service. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Windows Feature Experience Packs are smaller updates to Windows 10</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Windows 10 stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OmwbTtUAXoY-N4tK23JhTiNrFvE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68045021/mswindows1_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5LAMcR"&gt;Microsoft has started testing smaller feature updates for Windows 10 in the form of a Windows Feature Experience Pack. The branding appeared inside Windows 10 earlier this year, but Microsoft has only confirmed what the packs will be used for this week. The Windows Feature Experience Pack will be used to “improve certain features and experiences that are now developed independently of the OS,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/11/30/releasing-windows-feature-experience-pack-120-2212-1070-0-to-the-beta-channel/"&gt;according to Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NHHGJ"&gt;The first feature pack has been released to Windows 10 beta testers this week, and it includes the ability to use the built-in screen snipping app to paste screenshots directly into folders within the File Explorer. The pack also includes a split keyboard mode for 2-in-1 touch devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IQvz4h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Feature packs are for the smaller parts of Windows&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7hQuG1"&gt;Microsoft says feature packs will be delivered to Windows testers much like how existing builds and cumulative updates are delivered. It’s not clear how these feature packs will make their way to consumers and enterprises, though. Feature packs appear to be a new channel for Microsoft to update parts of Windows that aren’t directly controlled by the OS but also aren’t separate apps that are maintained through the Windows Store.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mq3UyTm8X11siUwYjzX45loIaWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22133704/5GjjfSu.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 10’s new built-in snipping tool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RRDZjn"&gt;It could mean we’ll see more regular minor updates to Windows 10 in the coming months and years ahead. Microsoft typically delivers two big Windows 10 updates per year, with one arriving around the April time frame and the other around October. The company has been using a Service Pack-style update model for some Windows 10 updates, including relatively minor changes in one of the updates and bigger changes in the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMEdWR"&gt;“By testing this process first with Windows Insiders, we hope to expand the scope and the frequency of releases in the future,” explains Microsoft’s Brandon LeBlanc. “Eventually, Windows Feature Experience Pack updates will get folded into the already existing servicing process for Windows 10 and delivered to customers that way through Windows Update.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fh7bJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
