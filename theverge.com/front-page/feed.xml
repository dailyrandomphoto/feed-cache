    <title>Nvidia teases GeForce RTX 3080 Ti announcement for May 31st</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IPFgKC"&gt;Nvidia is teasing a GeForce event for May 31st, the same day the company is rumored to be launching its new GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics card. A mysterious 11-second teaser video has appeared on Twitter today, simply revealing a GeForce event for 10PM PT on May 31st, or 1AM ET on June 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJLZoD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419668/nvidia-rtx-3080-ti-leak-may-launch-rumors"&gt;Recent rumors have suggested&lt;/a&gt; the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will be revealed alongside the RTX 3070 Ti on May 31st. The RTX 3080 Ti will reportedly include 12GB of GDDR6X memory, a 2GB increase over what’s found on the existing RTX 3080. A wider 384-bit bus is also rumored, matching the RTX 3090 — and an increase to the memory bandwidth over the RTX 3080. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="leiLQg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Get Ready.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/VuDCcKXrry"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VuDCcKXrry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NVIDIA GeForce (@NVIDIAGeForce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGeForce/status/1397568207448326144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MLEPWe"&gt;The new RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti will undoubtedly include a hash limit for Ethereum cryptocurrency mining. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441847/nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;Nvidia introduced this limit&lt;/a&gt; on newly manufactured RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 cards recently, branding new cards with a “Lite Hash Rate” or “LHR” identifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RPeB7"&gt;Leaked specs appear to suggest the RTX 3080 Ti will sit between the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090, offering performance somewhere between the two. Since the RTX 3090 retails (on paper at least) at $1,499, it’s possible we’ll see RTX 3080 Ti pricing at around the $1,000 mark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t22AAA"&gt;Not that retail pricing really matters, as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;street prices of new GPUs are utterly out of control&lt;/a&gt;. A global chip shortage has pushed GPU prices up, and demand is still incredibly high during ongoing supply constraints. Nvidia has already warned these supply issues will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385261/nvidia-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-warning-comments-2021"&gt;continue throughout 2021&lt;/a&gt;, so launching a new RTX 3080 Ti isn’t going to help here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch two whole seconds of the increasingly real Uncharted movie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yxRqgWBJKfCv3SwkJIQzT_PbGLk=/58x0:1849x1194/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345755/Screen_Shot_2021_05_26_at_8.37.42_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mark Wahlberg in the &lt;/em&gt;Uncharted&lt;em&gt; movie.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yox4PV"&gt;After more than a decade in development and several directors, release dates, and scripts, the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; movie increasingly seems like it may actually, really, for real become a movie we can watch, thanks in part to our first actual footage (via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/1397505699308048388"&gt;Twitter user @Nibellion&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lWQ1x"&gt;The sneak peek is in this &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/TF8MrJPTy7w"&gt;YouTube video from Sony&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/TF8MrJPTy7w?t=92"&gt;timestamped here&lt;/a&gt; if you want to skip right to it). Get excited:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mRSHbk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TF8MrJPTy7w?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=93&amp;amp;start=93" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xPeF5A"&gt;Did you blink? If so, you might have missed everything that happened. I made a GIF to make sure you can see it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nUnTaHVl-0nKSUtcGnyL17TNTNU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22540946/May_26_2021_08_08_23.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="487EfB"&gt;Okay, so maybe the two whole seconds here aren’t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; exciting. And disappointingly, none of the footage shows any of the &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt;-inspired action for which the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; game series is known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPX6eZ"&gt;But seeing Tom Holland’s Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg’s Sully actually appearing on camera is a promising sign that the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; movie will really come out after &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/uncharted-movie-development-hell-a-timeline-of-all/2900-3354/#32"&gt;years in development hell&lt;/a&gt;. And better yet, this is the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; shred of evidence we’ve seen this week that the movie is real: &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; published &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/24/business/media/video-game-movies-sony-playstation.html"&gt;a new photo&lt;/a&gt; of Holland and Walhberg in a scene together on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dfIOe9"&gt;The movie is currently set to release on February 18th, 2022. Here’s hoping.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Merlin Labs wants to fill the sky with pilotless planes carrying cargo and passengers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QS7HjwJpbi4hws3ch3uufeSCC7k=/42x0:1695x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345686/Screen_Shot_2021_04_13_at_7.34.34_PM.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RrxerP"&gt;Autonomous flight startup Merlin Labs is coming out of stealth mode to announce that it’s raised $25 million in funding from Google Ventures and First Round Capital. The company has also struck a deal with aviation services contractor &lt;a href="https://www.dynamicaviation.com/"&gt;Dynamic Aviation&lt;/a&gt; to begin putting its pilotless plane technology into commercial operation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oFZg2J"&gt;The two announcements are the first steps toward Merlin Labs’ larger goal of filling the sky with pilotless planes carrying cargo and passengers. As part of its deal with Dynamic, the startup will supply its autonomous flight technology to 55 of the contractor’s King Air aircraft. Merlin is already conducting test flights with the first King Air plane outside its dedicated flight facility at the Mojave Air and Space Port. Merlin Labs is co-located in Boston; Los Angeles; Denver; and Auckland, New Zealand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ObLjz8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What we’re working on is creating a truly autonomous digital pilot”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4D346B"&gt;“What we’re working on is creating a truly autonomous digital pilot,” Merlin Labs CEO Matt George told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “either to be able to go and take that airplane and fly it totally unmanned, but then also on larger aircraft to be able to reduce crew. So taking existing aircraft that are already out there, and enabling those aircraft to be able to go fly autonomously.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2Y8Q96"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZPf_V_vHog?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0zDwgr"&gt;These are not aircraft that are being joy-sticked by a remote operator in some terrestrial office park somewhere, like a Predator drone, George said. Merlin Labs “doesn’t believe in remote piloting...  we fundamentally believe that the vast majority of the autonomy needs to be on the aircraft.” If the aircraft loses signal with the remote operator, then you would have “a huge chunk of metal hurtling through the sky,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdRQwg"&gt;Merlin envisions the role of its remote pilots as supervisory, monitoring dozens of aircraft in the sky at once, but leaving the vast majority of the tasks, from communication with air traffic control to navigation, to the autonomous software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSI3dx"&gt;The technology that allows Merlin’s aircraft to fly without a pilot is pretty simple, George says. “The reason that that autonomy up in the air is so much easier is that you have complete vision, at least in the United States, of everything that’s up in the sky, with ground based radar,” he said. Its aircraft use the air traffic control network’s radar system to plot a safe course. And the digital transponders that are required as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/faqs/"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration’s NextGen&lt;/a&gt; system help the planes understand where there are other aircraft in the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="seljAd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Autonomous flight isn’t as outlandish as it may sound&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CXTpL5"&gt;Autonomous flight isn’t as outlandish as it may sound. It’s commonplace for planes to come equipped with autopilot technology. Pilots of large commercial aircraft, for example, will typically handle the take-off and then let the software handle the flying and landing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RwpsP"&gt;But automation is also becoming increasingly problematic in the world of aviation. In 2016, the Department of Transportation’s Inspector General &lt;a href="https://www.oig.dot.gov/sites/default/files/FAA%20Flight%20Decek%20Automation_Final%20Report%5E1-7-16.pdf"&gt;released a damning report&lt;/a&gt; calling out the FAA for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/12/10756640/faa-airline-pilot-automation-inspector-general-report"&gt;failing to ensure pilots receive enough training&lt;/a&gt; in manual flying. In fact, commercial pilots may be relying so much on automation that they lack the skills to take over when the system fails, the IG concluded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gq8kKu"&gt;This came up again with the fatal crashes of two Boeing 737 Max jets in 2018 and 2019. US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263751/boeing-737-max-8-pilot-complaint-autopilot-mcas"&gt;pilots complained&lt;/a&gt; that they weren’t being properly trained to handle all of the Max aircraft’s many automated features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kMuAe"&gt;This is where you run into problems, George said. “When you have a human sort of in control and the machine sort of in control is where you get really bad stuff,” he said. Echoing his counterparts in the world of autonomous vehicles, George said he believes that full autonomy is the only way to ensure these systems are as safe as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MV9AmV"&gt;Unlike other companies in the autonomous flight space, like Xwing or Reliable Robotics, Merlin isn’t seeking to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/10/18657150/autonomous-cargo-drones-delivery-boeing-aircraft-faa-regulation"&gt;become its own cargo carrier&lt;/a&gt;, which would require obtaining a Part 135 air carrier certificate from the FAA. Merlin is working to certify its technology with the agency, but it would rather license its technology to preexisting cargo carriers than seek to supplant them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4qdfKr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When you have a human sort of in control and the machine sort of in control is where you get really bad stuff”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wgxn7G"&gt;“We’re partnering with a bunch of Port 135 operators around the country,” George said. “But we’re gonna focus on what we do well, which is not figuring out how to run an airline, you know, which is pretty difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaDZsX"&gt;George has experience in the transportation startup world, having run the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/1/15501764/bridj-on-demand-bus-startup-fail-ford"&gt;on-demand bus service Bridj&lt;/a&gt; for several years. The company shut down in 2017 after having failed to land a major deal with an unnamed car company. Working with automakers like Ford provided him with a close look at the race to deploy autonomous vehicles. And that got him thinking about where autonomy would work best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7ACN9"&gt;“Where is autonomy going to take effect first?” he asked. “Is he going to be on the ground? Or is autonomy actually much easier in the air, where we know where everything is?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blHbh1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBrjw3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google to use patient data to develop healthcare algorithms for hospital chain</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KiU9vYl8QV8t92EJ_8B6jH5TwOo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345621/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X6gjOu"&gt;Google has made a deal for access to patient records from HCA, which which &lt;a href="https://investor.hcahealthcare.com/news/news-details/2021/HCA-Healthcare-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx"&gt;operates 181 hospitals&lt;/a&gt; and more than 2,000 healthcare sites in 21 states, so the tech company can develop healthcare algorithms, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-strikes-deal-with-hospital-chain-to-develop-healthcare-algorithms-11622030401"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGoAsz"&gt;Google will store anonymized data from patient health records and internet-connected medical devices. That data will be used to build programs that could inform medical decisions made by doctors. The deal is described as “multiyear” by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ, &lt;/em&gt;without specifying how many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAFLzj"&gt;As health records moved online over the past few years, hospitals and tech companies jumped at opportunities to take advantage of the glut of digitized medical information collected at each doctor’s visit. Microsoft and Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-give-tech-giants-access-to-detailed-medical-records-11579516200?mod=article_inline"&gt;also have deals&lt;/a&gt; with hospitals to analyze their patient information. Google previously partnered with healthcare system Ascension to gather patient records in a secretive project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959771/google-health-records-project-nightingale-privacy-ascension"&gt;called “Project Nightingale.”&lt;/a&gt; The company was criticized for starting in on the project without disclosing the work to patients and doctors. HCA is a major win for Google, since &lt;a href="https://hcahealthcare.com/util/forms/press-kit/HCA-presskit-fact-sheet-a.pdf"&gt;its facilities handle 5 percent of the hospital services provided in the US&lt;/a&gt; — around 30 million patient interactions each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="19J7ng"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We want to push the boundaries of what the clinician can do in real time with data”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AiSNXl"&gt;Along with using that data to develop algorithms, Google could also build healthcare tools independently and then pass them off to HCA to test on its own. “We want to push the boundaries of what the clinician can do in real time with data,” Chris Sakalosky, managing director of healthcare and life sciences at Google Cloud, told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnQUhk"&gt;Healthcare privacy laws in the US allow hospitals to share information with contractors and allow researchers to &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/research/index.html"&gt;analyze patient data&lt;/a&gt; without express permission from those patients. Healthcare companies can use that information in any way they see fit, including to boost profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTdba4"&gt;HCA made $3.75 billion in profits during 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. National Nurses United &lt;a href="https://www.nationalnursesunited.org/press/hca-safety-cuts-huge-profits-amid-pandemic"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in February that the company prioritized income over patient and staff safety. Nurses reported staff shortages and cutbacks on personal protective equipment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford is making an electric Explorer, boosts EV investment by $8 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c6qA6s5pBbH4rlQS0ZeGgxDMGLs=/905x0:6220x3543/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345598/All_New_Ford_E_Transit_09.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sPMEFK"&gt;Ford will spend $30 billion on electric vehicles by 2025, and says 40 percent of its global fleet will be all-electric by 2030. The company is working on an all-electric versions of its Explorer and Lincoln Aviator SUVs. And it’s developing two new electric vehicle platforms: one that will power full-size pickup trucks, and one that can easily flex between all- and rear-wheel drive to fit multiple vehicle types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlW9we"&gt;The company had previously committed $22 billion to EVs and had announced a goal to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287284/ford-electric-vehicles-ev-europe-2030"&gt;all-electric in Europe by 2030&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2dAvl"&gt;Ford is also creating a standalone business for its commercial vehicle division called Ford Pro. The company hopes that by offering more dedicated services to these customers, it can build on what is already a dominant position, as it makes up 43 percent of the commercial truck and van market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6h7iD"&gt;This barrage of announcements is part of a new business plan Ford has rolled out called Ford Plus, which the company says is all about creating “close, enduring customer relationships” that last beyond the purchase of a vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ES3u1e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A new focus on “close, enduring customer relationships”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zw14Ig"&gt;To do that, Ford spent a good chunk of time during an investor event on Wednesday talking about how it plans to make sure its future vehicles are fully networked, something it wants to do quickly. At one point, CEO Jim Farley said Ford plans to have more vehicles capable of being updated by over-the-air software updates than Tesla by mid-2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NU4b4J"&gt;Better-connected cars would let Ford offer things like more convenient mobile service, which could entice more customers to turn to the automaker when their cars need something fixed, for example. Connected services are also a big part of the plan for Ford’s commercial vehicle division. The company says it already has 160,000 customers that pay subscription fees for the advanced version of its fleet telematics offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7s5Qmj"&gt;“We are reinventing our customer experience,” Alex Purdy, who runs Ford’s connectivity team, said during the event. “The path to winning [market share] requires daily interaction” with customers, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9DOPp"&gt;“I cannot overstate the magnitude of the shift taking place at Ford,” Purdy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwElii"&gt;Ford Plus is yet another attempt to rethink Ford’s overall business, something the century-old automaker has spent a lot of time doing over the last few years. Its previous CEO, Jim Hackett, led &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353950/ford-ceo-jim-hackett-retiring-replaced-restructuring"&gt;a major restructuring at the company in 2017&lt;/a&gt; that led to decisions like Ford shutting down its manufacturing efforts in Brazil and partnering with Volkswagen on autonomous, electric, and commercial vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNXewu"&gt;The moves Hackett made are starting to pay off. Despite some early hiccups, the Mustang Mach-E is off to a strong start. Ford says 80 percent of customers are opting for the more expensive extended range battery versions, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408369/ford-mustang-mach-e-new-customers"&gt;70 percent overall are new to the brand&lt;/a&gt;. And on Wednesday, Ford shared that it has collected 70,000 deposits for the all-electric &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt; announced last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfUk4q"&gt;Ford Plus, then, is meant to build on that momentum. In addition to the aforementioned announcements, Ford also spent time Wednesday talking about how it plans to make its own battery packs in the US with South Korean manufacturer SK Innovation — a deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445688/ford-sk-innovation-ev-battery-production-joint-venture"&gt;it announced last week&lt;/a&gt;. The company will brand the lithium-ion packs for passenger vehicles as “IonBoost,” in a nod to its efficient EcoBoost engines. Lithium iron phosphate battery packs for commercial vehicles will be called IonBoost Pro. Ford is also developing solid state batteries and believes they will be ready by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEKXFm"&gt;Ford’s announcements come at a time of great change in the automotive industry. General Motors has said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;it hopes to only make zero-emission light duty vehicles by 2035&lt;/a&gt;, and the Ford rival also recently spun out its own commercial vehicle (and vehicle services) business &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225394/gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-ep1-ev600-ces-2021"&gt;called BrightDrop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnpWPY"&gt;“This is our biggest opportunity for growth and value creation since Henry Ford started to scale the Model T,” Farley said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="edUWcR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lockheed Martin and GM are working on an electric Moon buggy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gpPNqMddHRWIs31InlFeIzOEnCc=/466x0:5485x3346/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345528/LM_GM_Lunar_Vehicles_teaser_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A company illustration shows astronauts staring at a fleet of conceptual lunar rovers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Lockheed Martin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VpdfPC"&gt;Lockheed Martin and General Motors unveiled plans on Wednesday to build an autonomous buggy-like vehicle that future astronauts can use to zip around the surface of the Moon. The two companies collaborated to pitch a conceptual Lunar Terrain Vehicle to NASA’s Artemis program, a Moon exploration campaign that calls for various robots, vehicles, and scientific bases to be planted on the lunar surface within the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I09IIE"&gt;Ahead of a presentation Wednesday morning, Lockheed and GM said in a joint press release that the vehicle will use the automaker’s autonomous driving technology and is “being designed to traverse significantly farther distances” than Apollo-era buggies. Just like those Moon buggies from the ‘70s, the Lockheed-GM concept will be fully electric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vhwo1p"&gt;The rover is still in the early stages of development, so details on its size, weight and range aren’t set in stone yet, Jeff Ryder, GM’s Vice President of Growth and Strategy, told reporters in a press conference. It will be “made of very lightweight, strong and resilient materials,” but “exactly what those are is still in formulation,” says Lockheed’s lunar exploration vice president Kirk Shireman. “We want it to be as light and strong and have a long life as it possibly can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZVWCO"&gt;The rovers “will dramatically extend the range of astronauts as they perform high-priority science investigation on the Moon that will ultimately impact humanity’s understanding of our place in the solar system,” Rick Ambrose, executive vice president of Lockheed’s space unit, said in a statement. NASA’s Artemis program calls for an initial astronaut Moon landing as soon as 2024 (a goal some say is unrealistic) with follow-up missions to build a sustained presence on the lunar south pole. Those missions will serve as a prove and test technologies that can inform future missions to Mars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9IXked"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NASA’s Moon buggy requirements: fully electric, rugged, and autonomous&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TlBqeF"&gt;The heavyweight collaboration between Lockheed and GM came after NASA asked the private sector to come up with ideas for two types of human-rated Moon vehicles: the Lunar Terrain Vehicle (or LTV) and a bigger “Lunar Surface Science Mobility System,” essentially a science lab on wheels. NASA had only a few minimum specifications for LTV concepts, including the capability of driving autonomously on the Moon’s hazardous, crater-laden terrain — a challenging environment for the computer vision technology that powers autonomous driving systems on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8OMPX"&gt;GM, which is investing $27 billion through 2025 in its autonomous EV portfolio, plans to put its self-driving technology on the Moon for the first time. “At this point, what we have is a tremendous toolkit, a commercial autonomy baseline that we can work from,” Ryder said. “We’re heads-down right now investigating how we would take those capabilities and apply them to these specific missions and operations associated with the Artemis program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uD5OCF"&gt;A NASA LTV also needs to be fully electric and capable of recharging itself internally — either from onboard solar arrays or other systems — and externally from infrastructure that can be set up on the Moon, like NASA’s Human Landing System. It should be able to carry two fully suited astronauts, including the driver, as well as any cargo for a total haul capacity of 1,102 pounds on a single charge for at least 1.2 miles. And it needs to withstand the lunar south pole’s volatile surface temperatures, which can vary from 260 degrees Fahrenheit to negative 280 degrees during the Moon’s nighttime.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wlekmc"&gt;Lockheed and GM were among the cadre of industry giants that built NASA’s first lunar landing systems and buggies under the Apollo program. GM built the chassis and wheels for the Lunar Roving Vehicles, as they were formally called, on Apollo missions 15 through 17. The rover for Apollo 17, the program’s final Moon mission in 1972, did the most roving: Astronaut Gene Cernan whipped the lightweight electric LRV more than 22 miles total on the Moon, going as far as 4.7 miles away from their lunar module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1YLhH"&gt;Lockheed and GM said their new concept will travel much farther than the buggies of Apollo. “The result” of the companies’ engineering efforts, a press release said, “may allow astronauts to explore the lunar surface in unprecedented fashion and support discovery in places where humans have never gone before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuJxdw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>More Americans believe in climate change but still can’t quit fossil fuels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activists demand senate pass ‘Green New Deal’ Resolution" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xUlYUdM89l_JnBmaMcjzmsMioWc=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345257/1133036440.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0GLLqC"&gt;Nearly two-thirds of Americans now believe that climate change is an urgent problem to address, but they aren’t nearly as enthusiastic about giving up oil and gas, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/05/26/gen-z-millennials-stand-out-for-climate-change-activism-social-media-engagement-with-issue/"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; by the Pew Research Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNCsqO"&gt;Only one-third of people surveyed supported completely phasing out fossil fuels. Less than half of respondents are okay with phasing out new gas-powered vehicles. Taking those steps might seem drastic, considering fossil fuels currently&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;make up about 80 percent of the &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/"&gt;US energy mix&lt;/a&gt;. But phasing out most, if not all, fossil fuels is pretty much in line with what’s needed to meet the scale of the climate crisis, according to climate experts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5d6ue"&gt;Now that many Americans are taking the threats posed by climate change seriously, the next hurdle for climate activists and policymakers is getting more of them on board for the swift action it will take to limit the damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aY81J4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Attitudes towards climate change are hardly a predictor of policy support”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OqNwOs"&gt;“This is the divide between attitudes and action,” says Chenyang Xiao, a sociology professor at American University who studies environmental beliefs. “Attitudes towards climate change are hardly a predictor of policy support or pro-environmental actions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcIrie"&gt;A more gradual shift away from fossil fuels may be something most Americans can get on board with. About 70 percent of people surveyed agreed that future fossil fuel expansion should take a back seat to developing alternative energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hourcD"&gt;Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels need to drop dramatically&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;by the middle of the century, &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;according to leading climate scientists&lt;/a&gt;. They’re aiming for “net-zero” — the point where global emissions match up with the amount of greenhouse gases removed from the atmosphere, after making major reductions to fossil fuel use.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Otherwise, say goodbye to 99 percent of the world’s coral reefs and hello to more extreme heat, hunger, and flooded coastlines. In most scenarios, meeting the net-zero goal involves using less energy and swapping out most or all fossil fuels for renewables like wind and solar or carbon-free energy like nuclear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qHZKO"&gt;There’s a little more allowance for continued emissions from heavy industry like steel and for ships and planes that are hard to electrify. Those sources of pollution might be paired with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404056/climate-tech-joe-biden-summit-carbon-capture-green-hydrogen"&gt;emerging technologies&lt;/a&gt; that can capture and store the planet-heating CO2 they produce. But reaching net-zero greenhouse gas pollution requires no new fossil fuel development past 2021 and no more sales of gas-powered vehicles past 2035, a major &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/pathway-to-critical-and-formidable-goal-of-net-zero-emissions-by-2050-is-narrow-but-brings-huge-benefits-according-to-iea-special-report"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the International Energy Agency recently found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="yTKIOk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Political affiliations are the biggest driving factor behind the beliefs people have of climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YWC2zl"&gt;Unfortunately, attitudes toward climate change and environmental policy in the US don’t tend to be influenced by actual science and data. &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/21/how-americans-see-climate-change-and-the-environment-in-7-charts/"&gt;Historically&lt;/a&gt;, political affiliations are the biggest driving factor behind the beliefs people have of climate change. But in the last couple decades, Americans have swung further left politically — although they might consider themselves “moderates” rather than “liberals,” according to Xiao. That could be why a growing number of people are at least taking climate change seriously, even after years of &lt;a href="https://graphics.latimes.com/exxon-arctic/"&gt;disinformation from fossil fuel industries&lt;/a&gt; and the politicians they bankroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BNKi9w"&gt;A little over a year ago, &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/02/13/as-economic-concerns-recede-environmental-protection-rises-on-the-publics-policy-agenda/"&gt;52 percent&lt;/a&gt; of Americans saw climate change as a top priority. That’s now up to 64 percent of the 13,749 adults that the Pew Research Center surveyed in April. Xiao also says that most people now have a better understanding of climate change than they have in the past. Nearly a third of people surveyed who use social media said that they’ve engaged with content about climate change on the platforms they use — including following accounts focused on climate action and posting about climate change on their own accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="er6vgh"&gt;“It used to be a small majority [that saw climate change as a top priority and] now, it’s a strong majority. I’m hopeful this kind of change can amount to the point that we may be able to start a social movement,” Xiao says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roVaCs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbjQVE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sweet Tooth’s post-apocalyptic world is meant to be a ‘storybook dystopia’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sweet Tooth" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ymQ4ISwGyqF38yelfVW7-yxxCtM=/0x1:3600x2401/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345107/sto105_nf_pull_02a_20210412R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tq3UIB"&gt;Jeff Lemire’s &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; is a comic book about a young boy surviving in a world ravaged by a pandemic. He also happens to be a “hybrid,” a new breed of half-human, half-animal creature that began to appear alongside the deadly sickness. It’s a dark story, one that had the potential to be incredibly bleak and uncomfortable when translated to television. That’s particularly true now, as the real world continues to deal with its own pandemic. For the team adapting the story for an upcoming series on Netflix, all of these factors combined to create a slightly different approach. “It made us lean more into the hope,” executive producer Amanda Burrell says of the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95Mwbd"&gt;Netflix’s eight-episode &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; series will debut on June 4th. It’s a live-action take on the comics, one that maintains the same basic premise: Gus, a nine-year-old boy with deer antlers, lives in relative isolation with his father, before eventually setting out into the larger world alongside a wanderer named Jepperd. (There are other changes, but they venture into spoiler territory.) Aside from the move to live-action, one of the biggest shifts is pacing. &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; is a real page-turner in comic book form, but the show moves much more leisurely, lingering on key moments. That’s by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iMAOrF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We wanted to draw things out a bit more.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SiBv5B"&gt;“We wanted to draw things out a bit more,” explains Burrell. “We wanted to give more time to Gus and Jepperd together. We wanted to slow down and ensure we were really inside all of the characters.” This also gives the show time to steadily introduce some of the more fantastical concepts, like the hybrids themselves, as early on, the focus is almost entirely on Gus. “We really wanted to slowly get the audience on board with this very specific type of new human, and really get them emotionally invested in Gus before opening it up too wide,” Burrell adds. “It was an intentional thing. We want the audience to be with these characters and not removed from them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LyXTVQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zG9RuJb3QU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cWqS7n"&gt;This focus on Gus is also where that hope comes from. The boy, played by Christian Convery, has a wide-eyed optimism that’s easy to get caught up in, particularly when it’s played against Jepperd’s cynicism. In fact, there’s almost a schism in the show, where the younger characters seem able to deal with the state of the world in a much more positive way compared to the adults. So even if there are incredibly dark moments, there’s a sense of balance. “We wanted to make sure that humanity wasn’t depicted in just such a dark, foreboding way,” Burrell says, adding, “We talked a lot about not wanting audiences to be alienated by the world. That kind of hopeless feeling you get after you watch a show that has a bleakness to it. Then it was just about leaning into Gus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FHxNa5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We talked a lot about not wanting audiences to be alienated by the world.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q8jt2N"&gt;She describes the show’s vibe as a “storybook dystopia,” a feeling that was enhanced by filming in New Zealand. (The story is set in the US.) “We went to New Zealand, and it has this kind of heightened magic to it,” Burrell says. “The trees look slightly different, the mountains are bigger. It allowed us to really accentuate the beauty of nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IuhnP"&gt;The pilot for &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; was filmed in 2019, before the current pandemic, and it wasn’t until it came time to write the rest of the season that “the world went nuts,” as Burrell describes it. The real-world pandemic had some influence over the show’s comparatively lighter tone, though it didn’t alter the actual story in any way. That said, Burrell notes that a tension could be felt during filming, particularly during one scene (which I won’t spoil) that feels eerily familiar after a 2020 filled with lockdowns and quarantines. “On set, you could hear a pin drop,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sweet Tooth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DQtjvkK3plW9AfIF7mQ0skcE2gE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22540664/sto105_nf_pull_01_20210412R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eoVzSe"&gt;This all raises an interesting question: why are people drawn to these stories, particularly as they more closely resemble our own reality (deer children aside)? The last year has seen major releases like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286964/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4"&gt;the grim &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s take on the Stephen King classic &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2021/2/11/22277486/the-stand-new-ending-stephen-king"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the surprising heartwarming film &lt;em&gt;Love and Monsters&lt;/em&gt;, to name just a few. Burrell has a theory as to why this kind of post-apocalyptic setting continues to resonate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5xoAWJ"&gt;“There’s a tension to: what if it’s all over? I think the idea of the human spirit and the future, wrestling back constantly, is just so powerful,” she explains. “&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us &lt;/em&gt;is a great example. Seeing what humans are willing to do for one another; obviously it can get very dark, like in that instance. But it’s just really powerful to see what people do for one another. I think now more than ever we need to feel that.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="dJa8tz"&gt;Airbnb doesn’t want you to forget about Airbnb, especially when you’re planning post-pandemic vacations. So on Monday, the company &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2F2021&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;made multiple announcements&lt;/a&gt; all seemingly designed to get people renting, traveling, and, crucially, choosing Airbnb to do so. It announced flexible booking, which lets people search across days, weeks, or months to plan a trip, as well as more location flexibility when looking for a place to stay. It also launched a faster onboarding process for hosts, during a time when competitors &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/vrbo-isnt-airbnbs-problem-11621510202"&gt;like Vrbo&lt;/a&gt; are trying to poach them, as well as a new service for Super Hosts that’ll allow them to reach out to the Airbnb team directly for support issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGOYoA"&gt;“We just think there’s this huge inflection point in travel brought on by the pandemic,” Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky says in a chat with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And so we wanted to adapt our service to this changing world and kind of really ride this wave.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgARri"&gt;At the same time, Airbnb is expanding its idea of travel beyond short vacations. Chesky says that nearly a quarter of Airbnb bookings are “long term,” or 28 days and longer. “Millions and millions of people” are staying and living at Airbnb listings on a monthly basis, he says, and in cities like New York, that figure is more like 60 percent. He views this as a a shift from travel to “living,” which has been propelled by people “discovering they do not need to be tethered to one location to live and work,” per the company’s &lt;a href="https://s26.q4cdn.com/656283129/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Airbnb_Q1-2021-Shareholder-Letter_Final.pdf"&gt;latest earnings report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jnj2Sx"&gt;“I think eventually in the future people will start paying for rent the way they pay for cable television, or for Netflix, you pay on a month-to-month basis,” he says. He didn’t mention how this could impact tenants, like those who prefer long-term rentals because it locks in their rent at a set price and offers legal protections. The idea is that more people are going to want flexibility and the ability to parachute into a destination and live like a local. Chesky says that Airbnb has dealt with evictions and squatters in the past and hasn’t found any “intractable issue” that can’t be handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QZRhxk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nearly a quarter of Airbnb bookings are for 28 days or longer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F6h8ii"&gt;That shift to long-term rentals doesn’t mean the business is changing how it vets guests, though. It won’t make renters prove income, submit a credit score, or leave a deposit of first and last month’s rent for longer stays, like traditional landlords require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19ABsv"&gt;“I think that’s all anachronistic and going to eventually go away,” Chesky says, pointing to Airbnb’s prepay model as secure enough backing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dw8aJQ"&gt;“So almost all this old system of renting, you don’t need to do anymore,” he says. “That is stuff that was invented before the technology allowed almost all this to be automated. It’s like using a rotary dial phone, suddenly we have smartphones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SRbEH"&gt;He says Airbnb’s Trust and Safety team is “more sophisticated” than what landlords use and that eventually, people will prefer not to sign one-year leases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yijmxR"&gt;For price-conscious renters, he notes that the company is reexamining how fees on its platform work, particularly after &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-trending-twitter-customers-complain-host-cleaning-fees-rules-price-2021-5"&gt;a flurry of complaints&lt;/a&gt; about exorbitant cleaning fees. The team is refining their algorithm to determine the “best deal” for renters that takes fees into account, along with asking hosts and guests for their input on how to make fees work for everyone. Their solve will be coming out “later this year” he says, without offering details.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waze names former Hotwire president Neha Parikh as CEO</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vkqXaJ"&gt;Waze has a new CEO: Neha Parikh, the former president of Hotwire and a board member of Carvana. Parikh replaces Noam Bardin, who &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/waze-ceo-noam-bardin-to-leave-company-in-early-2021/"&gt;stepped down&lt;/a&gt; as CEO of the Google-owned navigation service last November after leading the company for 12 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6epDlZ"&gt;Parikh will join Waze as CEO starting in June, the company says. She is a veteran of online hospitality brand Expedia, having served in a variety of positions at two of the corporation’s subsidiaries: Hotels.com, where she ended as senior vice president for global brands and retails, and flight and hotel booking service Hotwire, where she is currently president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqTWlU"&gt;As Hotwire’s youngest and first female president, Parikh “led a return to growth by revamping the business model, reshaping the product, and rebuilding the team and culture,” Waze says. The aim is for her to do the same at Waze. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neha Parikh is the youngest and first female president of Hotwire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7KERje"&gt;“As Neha leads Waze into the future, she will remain hyper-focused on our passionate community, beloved brand, and best-in-class products,” a spokesperson for the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1HF0Q"&gt;She was appointed to the board of Carvana in April 2019. The online car marketplace praised Parikh for her focus on customer service. “On my first visit to the Carvana offices, I took a picture of their prominently displayed values, one of which is ‘Your next customer may be your mom,’ which I love,” &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190422005543/en/Carvana-Adds-Neha-Parikh-President-of-Hotwire-to-Board-of-Directors"&gt;she said in the press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Relentless customer focus has been central to my career, so I’m thrilled to align with a company that puts their customers first.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OmqQwY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Relentless customer focus has been central to my career”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="baXB1A"&gt;Waze was founded in Israel in 2008 by Ehud Shabtai, Amir Shinar, and Uri Levine. The crowdsourced navigation app quickly grew in popularity, praised for its ability to take into account traffic and construction in real time. The app quickly emerged as a top choice among Uber and Lyft drivers. And today, it has 140 million monthly active users who drive more than 24 billion miles (40 billion kilometers) every month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KYgAa"&gt;The company was acquired by Google in 2013 for a reported $1.1 billion. And the app continued to flourish, as Google refrained from absorbing it into its Maps division and allowed it to stay independent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ma18X"&gt;Like most companies, Waze hit a rough patch during the pandemic. Its number of monthly active users, or the number of customers using the app each month, and driven kilometers, the metric by which the company measures how far its customers drive while using Waze, both decreased significantly. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21428907/waze-layoff-pandemic-google-navigation-driving"&gt;laid off 5 percent&lt;/a&gt; of its global workforce, or 30 people, in September. Its nascent Carpool service was hit especially hard, as people stopped commuting to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMR7lE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
