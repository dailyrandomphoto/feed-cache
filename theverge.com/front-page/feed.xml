    <title>Amazon facing formal complaint from labor board over worker firing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wTsouvl5csw_m2wrgDZPUpJRcp4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70418829/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The NLRB will issue a formal complaint against Amazon unless it settles a case with a fired worker | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3sFsEV"&gt;The National Labor Relations Board is preparing to issue a complaint against Amazon alleging the company illegally fired a worker at one of its New York warehouses, unless the company settles the case first. At issue is whether Daequan Smith, an organizer with the newly-formed Amazon Labor Union (ALU), was fired for trying to organize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NRStdr"&gt;As first reported by&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-21/amazon-activist-s-firing-deemed-illegal-by-labor-board-officials?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, NLRB spokesperson Kayla Blado confirmed Friday that the agency’s regional director Kathy Drew King determined allegations by the ALU that Smith was fired illegally had merit and would issue a complaint if the case doesn’t settle. “The complaint would allege a discharge because of union and other protected concerted activities, among other allegations,” Blado said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j23qu2"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bq97n0"&gt;The ALU Is awaiting a hearing on its petition to hold a union election at four of Amazon’s warehouses in Staten Island. Smith was a worker at one of the Staten Island warehouses, and the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonlabor/status/1484638708867514371?s=20"&gt;ALU tweeted Friday &lt;/a&gt;that since his firing, Smith has been left homeless. The NLRB has the authority to reinstate workers fired for organizing, but it’s not yet clear whether it would do so in this case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qN9VNi"&gt;The NLRB ordered Amazon to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"&gt;redo a union election&lt;/a&gt; at its warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, after finding the company interfered in the first election in April 2021. That redo, which will be carried out by mail and supervised by the NLRB, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878457/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-election-redo-february-fourth"&gt;begins February 4th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>American Airlines suing The Points Guy over app that syncs frequent flyer data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="American Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner In Greece" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V3wLJqz4cfJysZGTPqocDaC5VbI=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70418633/1235127494.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;American Airlines is suing The Points Guy | Photo by Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bhiueg"&gt;American Airlines has filed a lawsuit against travel tips site The Points Guy, claiming the site has violated the terms of use of its frequent flyer program by offering an app that lets users track airline miles from multiple airlines in one place. It’s seeking an order blocking The Points Guy from accessing or using American Airlines customer data and from allowing its users to access their own accounts through the TPG app or site. American is also seeking to block The Points Guy from displaying the American Airlines logo and other trademarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="piDCfi"&gt;The TPG app, released in September 2021, purports to “&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-newswire/lifestyle-technology-travel-media-d1458a6ca22c62f0946c1767f1a884ed"&gt;help users learn about points, miles, and loyalty programs&lt;/a&gt;, while maximizing their earning potential, and discovering how to efficiently burn those earned points and miles to see the world.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypStN8"&gt;The app allows users to link together different frequent flyer accounts. In the case of American Airlines, the TPG app prompts you in-app to enter your AAdvantage number, your password, and your last name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0TVr4"&gt;The lawsuit filed by American Airlines alleges that the TPG app encourages members of its AAdvantage program to breach its terms of use en masse by handing over their user logins to an unauthorized third party. The airline says the logins allow The Points Guy to “invade American’s servers, access users’ accounts, and collect and expropriate the proprietary data” in violation of American’s terms and conditions. The complaint accuses The Points Guy of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, an anti-hacking statute, by doing so. In addition, the suit trots out a litany of other offenses, such as breach of contract, trespass, trademark infringement, and copyright infringement (for displaying the American Airlines logo). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sqaz7D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The airline says the logins allow The Points Guy to “invade American’s servers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MZfxSr"&gt;American Airlines representative Amanda Koos said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that The Points Guy parent company Red Ventures “is accessing AA.com and AAdvantage customer account data in a way that does not comply with our standards for use of confidential information.” She added that American Airlines takes “customer data and proprietary information incredibly seriously, and want to make sure it is protected and secure.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6QFvO"&gt;The Points Guy preemptively sued American Airlines in Delaware after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from the airline, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-points-guy-fights-back-against-american-airlines-to-bring-cost-and-time-saving-tool-to-consumers-301464841.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, claiming the airline was “attempting to block the media platform from providing the cost and time-saving benefits of The Points Guy App to consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRx097"&gt;“Consumers are always in control of their own data on The Points Guy App — they decide which loyalty programs and credit cards are accessible for the purpose of making their points-and-miles journey easier,” The Points Guy founder Brian Kelly said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The site is “choosing to fight back against American Airlines on behalf of travelers to protect their rights to access their points and miles so they can travel smarter,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgGPzZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked The Points Guy in an email whether the TPG app stores AAdvantage passwords and have not yet received a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdaa855a892c74b6e00091c92b957a14"&gt;American Airlines is asking the courts to enjoin The Points Guy from allowing users to log in to AAdvantage through the TPG app or website and also from storing AAdvantage passwords and other member information. It is also seeking to legally block The Points Guy from displaying American’s “copyrighted material” — that is to say, the American Airlines logo. The lawsuit requests statutory damages for the trademark and copyright violations and additional unspecified damages to include any “‘ill-gotten revenues and benefits” that The Points Guy may have gained from American’s customers and their data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWMSjj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ii2bJG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We’re happy to inform you that Apple isn’t requiring verification for education discounts anymore</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/50TLf-UapZYpyPMwke4yaxsqkbw=/0x0:1768x1179/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70415567/billboard_202101_intro.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GIASYa"&gt;At &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220108032348/https://www.apple.com/us-edu/store"&gt;some point in the last month&lt;/a&gt;, Apple introduced a new verification process in the US that tried to ensure customers who want to benefit from its discounted education pricing are actually involved in education. Now Apple has removed the verification process, as confirmed in tests by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and backed up by reports from &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/21/apple-no-education-verification-requirement/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/21/apple-education-store-verification-removed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When it was in place, customers had to verify that they actually qualified for an education discount using Unidays’ third-party verification service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y55hu8"&gt;It’s possible that the verification requirement, which was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/s7g5t6/apple_education_store_now_requires_unidays_and/"&gt;spotted by Reddit users&lt;/a&gt;, will return. Apple already has verification processes in place in other countries, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/education-pricing?afid=p238%7Cs5Jg5FlGg-dc_mtid_187079nc38483_pcrid_349151339418_pgrid_15144757333_&amp;amp;cid=aos-uk-kwgo-edu%E2%80%94slid%E2%80%94bran-product-"&gt;like the UK&lt;/a&gt;. The company didn’t immediately respond to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment on whether the verification requirement’s removal was temporary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VQhQZD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Matching a similar policy in the UK&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MOJnNg"&gt;Customers have also noticed Apple placing new limits on how many items you can buy with an educational discount. &lt;a href="https://appletrack.com/apple-tightens-education-discounts-with-account-verification-and-purchase-limits/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Track&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that users are limited to one desktop computer, one Mac mini, one laptop, two iPads, and two accessories per year. (These limits are &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/browse/open/salespolicies/edu"&gt;still listed on Apple’s site&lt;/a&gt;, despite verification being gone.) Given that it’s more than any student, teacher, or educational staff member is likely to purchase for themselves in a given year, the limit seems to be in place to stop them from acting as a discount broker for all their non-education friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZrydR"&gt;Although the change (potentially temporarily) removed a loophole that was previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/27/17169108/apple-education-discount-how-to-new-ipad"&gt;ridiculously easy&lt;/a&gt; to exploit — apparently Apple didn’t even require customers to have a .edu email address — there was surprisingly little outcry over on Reddit, with some pointing out that Apple’s first-party discounts are often beaten by third-party retailers during back to school season. Meanwhile, if you’re looking for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"&gt;good deal on a MacBook&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve got a page dedicated to that exact purpose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvMGC0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 21st, 4:58PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect that the Unidays’ verification seems to have been removed from Apple’s US education store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ozzy Osbourne’s NFT project shared a scam link, and followers lost thousands of dollars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IxRQSsGElGfFuha6INqOMfs2eos=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70417902/acastro_210329_1777_nft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3r0BJf"&gt;When a pop-cultural icon like Ozzy Osbourne announces an NFT collection, you can count on the project getting publicity. The launch of the “CryptoBatz” collection, a series of 9,666 digital bats, received coverage in outlets like &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/ozzy-osbourne-nfts-cryptobatz-collection-1235014292/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/exclusive-ozzy-osbourne-announces-nfts-cryptobatz-collection-1276535/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-nft-cryptobatz-collection-preview-video-watch-3135108"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NME&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://hypebeast.com/2021/12/ozzy-ozbourne-cryptobatz-nft-project-info"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypebeast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/ozzy-osbourne-nft-collection-cryptobatz-market-concert-1982-tokens-crypto-2021-12"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6l8Q7"&gt;But just two days after the tokens were minted, supporters are being targeted by a phishing scam that drains cryptocurrency from their wallets, playing off a bad link shared by the project’s official Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORQRMp"&gt;Like the majority of NFT projects, CryptoBatz uses Discord as a place to organize its community. The official CryptoBatz Discord is now accessed through the short link &lt;a href="https://t.co/c8bUinn1LN"&gt;discord.gg/cryptobatz&lt;/a&gt;. But previously, the project used a slightly different vanity URL at discord.gg/cryptobatznft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYLOl9"&gt;When the project switched to the new URL, scammers set up a fake Discord server at the old one. But neither CryptoBatz nor Ozzy Osbourne took the precaution of deleting tweets referencing the previous URL, meaning that old tweets from Osbourne himself were left directing followers to a server now controlled by scammers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ozzy Osbourne tweet containing link to a scam Discord" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9DS7fG2QgZjZ94QWRwxRv2EbybY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23185024/Osbourne_tweet.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HgCmeA"&gt;One tweet from CryptoBatz, posted on December 31st, 2021, received more than 4,000 retweets and hundreds of replies. The tweet was only removed on January 21st after CryptoBatz was contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Cryptobatz tweet containing link to a scam Discord" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5rKGTUmjVGiOa0t8kQqpJ8xia0k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23185029/cryptobatz_tweet.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tOnZFC"&gt;On clicking the scam link, the invite panel for the fake Discord showed the total number of members as 1,330, an indication of the number of people who could potentially have been fooled by the scam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LF6C35"&gt;Inside the server, a bot spoofing community management service Collab Land asked users to verify their crypto assets to participate in the server — but directed users to a phishing site where they were prompted to connect their cryptocurrency wallets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tY91Ky"&gt;A representative of Collab Land declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Fake Collab Land bot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LB5IFndoKg55MIA9Rmt9dMY24Ms=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23185140/scam_bot.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D2rK2G"&gt;Tim Silman, a nonprofit employee, is one person who lost money through the scam. Silman estimates that around $300–400 in ETH was drained from his wallet after he visited the fake Discord server through a link posted on the CryptoBatz website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGv7by"&gt;“I’ve seen at least a dozen people on Twitter voicing this same issue,” Silman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If you look at the transactions on Etherscan, others lost a lot more than me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hj6mgB"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xdfbd08a29967f13cc2c143f0e8b71aea6dec3ecb"&gt;Ethereum wallet address&lt;/a&gt; Silman indicated was linked to the scammers had received a series of incoming transactions totaling 14.6 ETH ($40,895) on January 20th and sent it onwards to a wallet containing more than $150,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T34cji"&gt;The project had been slow to remove the bad links, even when informed, Silman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lQCBk"&gt;“I tagged them a few times in various tweets, as have a few other people, but no response,” he said. “This is an expensive lesson, I suppose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pilF2B"&gt;Even as the fake link remained present in a prominent tweet, the CryptoBatz project continued to hype the public token mint. As of January 21st, CryptoBatz NFTs were being &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/collection/cryptobatz-by-ozzy-osbourne"&gt;resold on OpenSea&lt;/a&gt; for around 1.8 ETH ($5,046).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K0XNWu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is an expensive lesson I suppose”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ivFQfY"&gt;Asked whether the project should accept responsibility for leaving the old link online, Sutter Systems, developers of the CryptoBatz NFT, laid blame for the scam squarely with Discord. In an email statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Sutter Systems co-founder “Jepeggi” emphasized that the compromise was only possible because of the easy setup and maintenance of the scam Discord instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuiRPa"&gt;“Although we feel very sorry for the people that have fallen prey to these scams, we cannot take responsibility for the actions of scammers exploiting Discord — a platform that we have absolutely no control over,” Jepeggi said. “In our opinion this situation and hundreds of others that have taken place across other projects in the NFT space could have easily been prevented if Discord just had a better response/support/fraud team in place to help big projects like ours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1ocR8"&gt;Discord said that it was aware of the incident and in contact with the affected team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GatYgw"&gt;“Our Trust &amp;amp; Safety team is in touch with the server owners and are investigating the incident,” said Peter Day, senior manager for corporate communications at Discord. “Our team takes action when we become aware of attacks like this one, including banning users and shutting down servers.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="dNRwAo"&gt;Just when it seemed like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/4/17651884/patrick-stewart-jean-luc-picard-star-trek-cbs-all-access-new-series"&gt;Patrick Stewart’s Jean-Luc Picard&lt;/a&gt; might have been ready to bid the galaxy farewell, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21079004/star-trek-picard-review-cbs-all-access-patrick-stewart"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Picard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;gave the legendary space explorer a second shot at life that raised some questions about just who and what he is now. While first trailer for &lt;a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/482924/175360/3065?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2Fshows%2Fstar-trek-picard%2F&amp;amp;subid1=VergePicard012122"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Picard&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;/a&gt;second season doesn’t directly answer any of them, it brings back one of the few characters perfectly suited to help guide Picard and his allies through this next chapter of their journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GznznJ"&gt;Beyond getting the recently resurrected Jean-Luc and his fellow explorers back aboard &lt;em&gt;La Sirena &lt;/em&gt;and in the depths of space they long for&lt;em&gt;, Star Trek: Picard&lt;/em&gt;’s second season is also about to send its heroes into the existential deep in as they embark upon a journey spanning across time and space, and seemingly multiple realities that have all been fractured somehow. As disorienting as Picard is when he wakes up in what appears to be the past, it’s the sort of turn of events that Whoopi Goldberg’s Guinan likely sees coming long before her old friend even thinks to come looking for her El-Aurian wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uP0HXF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OyuddrlFajs"&gt;https://youtu.be/OyuddrlFajs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTdUtO"&gt;Along with Guinan, &lt;em&gt;Picard&lt;/em&gt;’s second season will also see John Delancie’s Q and Annie Wersching as the Borg Queen in the mix, and the show’s decision to lean heavily on familiar characters from &lt;em&gt;Next Generation &lt;/em&gt;makes sense given how this arc’s poised to focus on key moments from the franchise’s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5EfXa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Picard’s &lt;/em&gt;second season hits Paramount+ on March 3th, and premieres internationally on Prime Video from March 4th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to protect your PC from ransomware using Windows’ built-in protection</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of a laptop with three locks, a key, an at sign, a key and colorful pixels all randomly placed around the image." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RRgsb9jYPOE44pbnwQhmerfLH3M=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70417398/VRG_4614_0_Overview.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8nHoix"&gt;Ransomware — malware that prevents you from accessing your files unless you pay the hacker that infected your computer — has been an issue plaguing computer users and businesses for years. Given its prevalence and the fact that a ransomware infection can lead to the loss of valuable files like documents or family pictures, it’s a good idea to make sure you’re protected. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/29/15892658/microsoft-windows-10-controlled-folders-feature"&gt;Starting with Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft has added features to its built-in Windows Security software that can help keep your computer safe from ransomware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQQe5e"&gt;As far as ransomware is concerned, there are two levels to Windows Security. The first consists of malware scans, which are on by default, and which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22705042/how-to-scan-microsoft-windows-pc-malware-security-antivirus-defender"&gt;you can learn more about here&lt;/a&gt;. While this will work to keep ransomware from being installed on your computer, if a piece of malware &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; manage to slip by, the scans won’t be able to protect your files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wazhbC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Winning the war on ransomware","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22822884/us-government-department-of-justice-ransomware-digital-extortion-task-force-report-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wCROiA"&gt;The second level is Windows’ ransomware protection, which you have to turn on manually. However, before you do, it is worth noting that this feature is not on by default for a reason. It works by only letting approved apps make changes to your files — which, in theory, prevents ransomware from encrypting them and locking them away. This, however, can cause some problems with apps that aren’t expecting it, so you may have to do some occasional trouble-shooting if you’ve got ransomware protection turned on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUMYBk"&gt;As a result, as we go over how to enable ransomware protection, it’s worth keeping in mind that there will probably be some tinkering involved with this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uRvozJ"&gt;How to turn on ransomware protection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="seP7Wy"&gt;Windows’ built-in ransomware protection is included in its security app. To get to it, either search “Windows Security” from the start menu or go to “Settings”&amp;gt; “Privacy &amp;amp; Security”&amp;gt; “Windows Security.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uM00HoGU4fWrH_-TH8GyEfuRRS0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183213/2022_01_20_14_46_12_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once you’re in Windows Security, go to “Virus &amp;amp; threat protection,” either by clicking the tile or the button in the sidebar on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SU4BmU"&gt;To turn on ransomware protection, go to “Virus and threat protection” and click “Manage ransomware protection.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kWN32CnI5bDMNJzsz_NPOTOb8-0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183233/2022_01_20_14_46_43_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on the “Manage ransomware protection” link to get to the Ransomware protection page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hgyq7f"&gt;From there, you can turn on a feature called “Controlled folder access,” which will make it so that unapproved apps won’t be able to make changes to your documents, pictures, videos, or music folders. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6aMHrlKuOUyaEKG4eQLVOXfN6Ok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183270/2022_01_20_14_47_08_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Switching on the “Controlled folder access” feature ensures that unauthorized apps can’t make changes to files in certain protected folders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cOgUmu"&gt;How to adjust Controlled folder access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mYSkkj"&gt;Once you switch Controlled folder access on, you’ll see three more control panes: “Block history,” “Protected folders,” and “Allow an app through Controlled folder access.” By default, Controlled folder access will only allow a list of approved apps to make any changes to files in the Documents, Pictures, Videos, and Music folders on your computer. These apps let you tweak how the system works.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIcTcT"&gt;You can, for example, add other folders that you want to protect using the “Protected folders” screen and manage which apps are allowed to make changes to protected folders using the “Allow an app through Controlled folder access” screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMKZ3M"&gt;Here’s what you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tPcZ-qfAise9-fFDNVrLywsFb4o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183278/2022_01_20_15_31_53_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Ransomware protection” panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="21K0lk"&gt;Block history&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Kzaqlv"&gt;According to a statement in one Windows security page, apps “determined by Microsoft as friendly” will always be allowed to make changes to your protected folders, but that doesn’t mean that every app you’ll want to use will be allowed by default. If you see a weird error popping up after turning on Controlled folder access (one common error I found during testing was getting a “This file cannot be found” message when trying to save a file), you may want to check “Block history” to see if Windows Security has been keeping that app from making changes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nfoVqfNGHmV3gKhoJUya9qlBqKM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183194/2022_01_20_15_16_01_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The block history screen shows you which apps have tried to write to protected folders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uTuaMr"&gt;“Block history” lets you see what app was blocked and what folder it was trying to write to. If it’s the app you’ve been having issues with, you’ll want to add it to the list of programs that can make changes. (We’ll go over how to do that in a moment.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ek20dpfNBcGQuFNUauZiDGLyxls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183170/2022_01_20_15_02_19_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the types of errors you may encounter: FireFox’s download screen said the file I was trying to save could not be found.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8UoKgI"&gt;Protected folders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zBTAaq"&gt;If you want to protect additional folders from ransomware, like your Desktop folder (which isn’t protected by default), you can select “Protected folders” and click the “Add a protected folder” button.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BQemG2EBYG3oDRjm5HvML6AAV-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183203/2022_01_20_14_50_14_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adding a folder to the protected folder list will keep apps from writing to it without permission.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sJg4HO"&gt;From there, you can navigate to the folder you want to protect and click the “Select Folder” button.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pSQR6cMoAPb8vFDtD2ClB6185JU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183202/2022_01_20_14_51_33_Greenshot.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chose the folder you want to protect, then click the “Select Folder” button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tIciSK"&gt;You can remove protection from custom-added folders (but not the default ones) by going back to the “Protected folders” screen, clicking on the folder you added, and clicking the Remove button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="D47dzS"&gt;Allow an app through controlled folder access&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9GxWct"&gt;If you’re having problems using an app and want to add it to the allowed list of apps, go back to the “Ransomware protection” page and select “Allow an app through Controlled folder access.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FiljGU"&gt;After clicking on the “Add an allowed app” button, you can click “Recently blocked apps” to see a list of the apps that have recently tried to write to your protected folders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AXqikyVWbjyt9C5UHjfDC8WUxvQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183172/2022_01_20_15_03_28_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clicking “Recently blocked apps” gets you a list of the apps that have tried and failed to make changes to your files.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pQ7ihV"&gt;You then click on the plus button next to its name to unblock it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kG7UweNSg8kyhgQXj4soRDMWSB0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183173/2022_01_20_15_03_37_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clicking the plus button next to an app’s name will let it make changes to files in your protected folders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="82QKwA"&gt;While you should only have to do this process once per app, it can be frustrating. You can turn off Ransomware Protection at any time, but if you believe that you’re at high risk for infection and don’t have backups, you should think carefully before doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TMLbUS"&gt;Additional ways to protect yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar09rE"&gt;While Windows’ ransomware protection is a powerful built-in tool, it’s probably not a good idea to rely on it as your only defense — as with all anti-malware systems, it should be treated as a safety net rather than your first line of defense. Here are some of the things you can do to avoid getting a ransomware infection in the first place and to make sure that your data is safe even if the worst were to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="l7FgvZ"&gt;Be careful online&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="F9pzxb"&gt;As with any malware, ransomware can spread through a variety of ways, such as being attached to phishing emails, exploiting security holes in out-of-date software, or masquerading as an actually useful program. When you’re online, it’s important to stay vigilant — if someone is trying to get you to download a program from an untrusted source that seems too good to be true, proceed with extreme caution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyeTkr"&gt;It’s also important to check the extensions of files you’re sent. If someone claims an attachment is a document, but it has a .exe or .msi extension, that file is likely dangerous. If you can’t already see the file’s extension, you can right-click on it, then click “Properties.” Windows will tell you what kind of file it is next to the “Type of file” heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srMlkU"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/protect-your-pc-from-ransomware-08ed68a7-939f-726c-7e84-a72ba92c01c3"&gt;guide to protecting yourself from ransomware&lt;/a&gt; lists some of the things that can lead to your computer being infected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="11tTnG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• &lt;/strong&gt;Visiting unsafe, suspicious, or fake websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9Nc9q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• &lt;/strong&gt;Opening file attachments that you weren’t expecting or from people you don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4oBIQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• &lt;/strong&gt;Opening malicious or bad links in emails, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media posts, or in instant messenger or SMS chats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="z8b33C"&gt;Keep your software updated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Br8z5b"&gt;It’s also important to make sure that your operating system and any software you use regularly have the latest security patches. Most browsers will update themselves automatically, and Windows usually also installs updates as they become available. To manually check for updates, go to “Settings”&amp;gt; “Windows Update” and click the “Check for updates” button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAjqsC"&gt;You can update any apps installed through Windows’ built-in store by going to the Microsoft Store app, clicking the “Library” button in the lower left-hand corner, and then clicking the “Get Updates” button to find any available updates. You can also click the “Update” button on individual apps or the “Update all” button at the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1Fnfyx"&gt;Make sure to have backups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="82qIPA"&gt;While using ransomware protection and having safe browsing habits can help keep you safe, no system is perfect. It’s important to have a backup of your computer’s files so that if you do end up infected by ransomware, you don’t lose your most valuable photos, videos, or documents. Backups can also keep you from losing data if your computer is physically damaged, lost, or stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npwd50"&gt;You can read our guide on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/1/16240630/how-to-back-up-your-computer-time-machine-file-history-windows-mac-external-drive"&gt;how to back up your computer here&lt;/a&gt;. If possible, it’s best to have two different forms of backup: one local and one in the cloud. However, having any kind of backup is much better than not having anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fm3B6W"&gt;What to do if your computer is infected with ransomware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="W48q9L"&gt;If all your protections have failed, and you discover that your computer is infected with ransomware, there are three important steps to take:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="8XvaKN"&gt;Disconnect your computer from Wi-Fi or ethernet — some ransomware can spread to other computers connected to your network, and it’s important to limit the damage. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="deJhOH"&gt;Don’t pay the ransom — doing so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685930/treasury-sanctions-cryptocurrency-exchange-ransomware-colonial-pipeline"&gt;could be illegal&lt;/a&gt;, depending on where the hackers trying to extort you are located, and paying does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; guarantee that you’ll actually get access to your files back. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DuGULa"&gt;Don’t plug in your backups if you have them — the ransomware will very likely attempt to destroy those files as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="jVCZsC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/protect-your-pc-from-ransomware-08ed68a7-939f-726c-7e84-a72ba92c01c3"&gt;Microsoft recommends&lt;/a&gt; attempting to do &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/virus-threat-protection-in-windows-security-1362f4cd-d71a-b52a-0b66-c2820032b65e"&gt;a full scan of your computer using Windows Security&lt;/a&gt;. (Another good app to try is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.malwarebytes.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22889631%2Fwindows-10-11-ransomware-defense-security-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Malwarebytes&lt;/a&gt;, which is well-known for its ability to scrub a computer of malware and is free for personal use.) If neither of those work, you may need to &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/recovery-options-in-windows-31ce2444-7de3-818c-d626-e3b5a3024da5#bkmk_win11_reset_pc"&gt;fully reset your PC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMoB6p"&gt;Finally, if you don’t feel confident that you can remove the ransomware yourself, take your computer to a professional — it’s best to make sure that it’s fully clean before trying to recover your backups. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nike’s accessible ACG Gaiadome FlyEase Boot will be for athletes only</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/okdBbH6q9FJgtLZnkqUsbXK9kWU=/0x1934:4480x4921/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70417294/Gaiadome_Boot_Side_original.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nike’s ACG Gaiadome FlyEase Boot feature toggle laces and a zippered back entry.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nike&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jFh8CJ"&gt;For the upcoming Beijing Winter Olympics, Nike announced Friday that it’s designed inclusive and accessible gear for Team USA Olympians and Paralympians to wear on the medal stand. That includes the new ACG Gaiadome FlyEase Boot, which can be slipped on and secured one-handed. The only issue is it seems to have inherited the FlyEase’s limited availability as well. While the rest of the ‘fit will be available for purchase, the Gaiadome boot will be an athlete exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzKk36"&gt;“For the official Team USA Medal Stand look in Beijing, we worked closely with the disability community, including current and former winter and summer Paralympians, in our design and testing process, and used inclusive design principles and methods to create gear that ensures every athlete who competes feels support in style from start to finish,” Nike said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvWSMK"&gt;Overall, this translates to an outfit that can be easily worn by those with limited dexterity. For example, the jackets include magnetic closures, oversized zipper pulls, and fish-trap pockets. Meanwhile, the ACG Dri-Fit ADV Trail Pants have a quick-release magnetic buckle. For the ACG Gaiadome Boot, the design features a zippered back entry and toggle laces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVqJIn"&gt;The Gaiadome FlyEase Boot has a similar design philosophy to the $120 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/2/1/22260179/nike-go-flyease-shoes-hands-free-pricing-release-day"&gt;Go FlyEase&lt;/a&gt;, which Nike introduced last year. Those sneakers featured a “bistable hinge” that allowed a person to put on and take off the shoe hands-free. While the FlyEase’s accessible design was widely praised, Nike was heavily criticized over how it handled the launch. Limited stock and hype created a resale market around the shoes resulting in prices shooting upwards of $400. The problem &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LeoInLaurent/status/1388739788522627072?s=20"&gt;went viral&lt;/a&gt; on social media, and some accused Nike of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/28/981197687/nike-accused-of-using-disability-to-hype-new-hands-free-sneaker"&gt;using disability as a marketing scheme&lt;/a&gt; without assuring access to those who would most benefit from the sneakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="CYH9dV"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Nike ACG Gaiadome FlyEase Boot|105647" data-volume-uuid="06ae71a8b" data-volume-id="105647" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-213" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EDFAOa"&gt;It’s curious, then, that Nike has decided to make the Gaiadome FlyEase Boot an athlete exclusive. This isn’t the first time Nike has made accessible footwear for Olympic athletes that then became available for consumers. For the Tokyo Summer Games last year, Nike introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/design/2021/7/1/22560002/nike-glide-flyease-olympics-sneakers"&gt;Glide FlyEase&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of the innovative hinge, they featured a flexible heel that would snap into place once a person stepped into the shoe. Both the Go FlyEase and Glide FlyEase are available for retail. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked Nike why the Gaiadome FlyEase Boot will be an athlete exclusive but didn’t immediately receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9B1rUt"&gt;In an ideal world, accessible design would be the default, &lt;a href="https://accessibility.umn.edu/importance-accessibility/benefits-accessible-design"&gt;as it benefits everyone&lt;/a&gt;. Boots are oftentimes difficult for even able-bodied people with full use of their hands. It’s understandable that Nike may be keen to avoid further controversy, but hopefully, we’ll see the Gaiadome FlyEase Boot’s design incorporated on future shoes that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; available to the public — and not in limited quantities. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Light sensors on wearables struggle with dark skin and obesity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Watch Series 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iQB5TbbRGFw6Y-5YpbwbAHIvIOM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70417202/akrales_171113_2119_0074.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rPTfh3"&gt;Light sensors used to track heart rate in wearable devices like the Apple Watch Series 5 and the Fitbit Versa 2 don’t work as well on darker skin or people with obesity, according to modeling done in a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8713672/"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdXiIo"&gt;That’s a problem for features currently built into devices — but it’s also a bad sign for efforts to use light sensors for new applications in wearables, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677381/smartwatch-blood-pressure-samsung-fitbit-apple"&gt;monitoring blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, says study author Jessica Ramella-Roman, an associate professor studying bioimaging sensors at Florida International University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2QBbg"&gt;“The architecture of the device has to change,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LmWqd"&gt;The study looked at the photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, a technique that uses changes in how light is reflected to measure blood flow, on three wearable devices: the Apple Watch Series 5, Fitbit Versa 2, and Polar M600. The research team used a model that simulates how light moves through tissue to show how the sensors on those devices would behave with different skin properties. Darker skin has higher melanin and absorbs more light, while skin from people with obesity tends to be thicker, have less water, and have less blood flow than skin from people who are not obese. While previous research on accuracy and bias in wearables has focused on skin tone, Ramella-Roman says that many studies haven’t included a lot of people with obesity despite these physiological differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qbx7kq"&gt;“That’s why we think it’s necessary to focus there,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LsrOn"&gt;The PPG signal didn’t change much as skin tone changed, the researchers’ model found: it varied less than 10 percent across the devices. But modeling obesity, both alone and together with skin tone, caused up to a 60 percent variation in the signal. Signal loss appeared to be because of the changes in skin thickness in people with obesity, the authors said in the study. There were changes in the peak of the PPG signal, which is used to calculate heart rate but whose signal strength should not change based on the heart rate value. There were also changes in the shape of the signal — which different groups are using as a way to track blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9aYqpZ"&gt;“As we increased the BMI level and increased the skin tone, the signal diminished, and then other features started disappearing as well,” she says. The Fitbit, which had fewer sensors, had a more dramatic loss of signal than the Apple Watch, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ItVTsZ"&gt;This study only modeled how these wearable devices would detect signals in the lab, Ramella-Roman stressed. The team still has to check the devices on actual people in order to confirm the findings. They’re in the process of doing that study now and have enrolled around 100 people so far, she says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZB5fg"&gt;But the problems revealed by analyses like this complicate projects looking to use wearables to track cardiovascular health for underserved groups, Ramella-Roman says. The new study indicates researchers have to be careful using PPG, particularly for projects aiming to use the devices to help monitor people at higher risk of cardiovascular issues — which includes people with obesity. “The holy grail in this context is looking at blood pressure,” she says. “But many, many studies looking at blood pressure use some combination of PPG and other modalities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxSlul"&gt;The findings also suggest that other devices that use light sensors and PPG, like the blood oxygen measures in hospitals or doctors’ offices, might not work as well for people with obesity. There are very few studies that evaluate the devices in those groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yRH6uT"&gt;The good news is it should be possible to adjust devices (like by moving around the spacing of the sensors) so that they are more accurate on people with darker skin or with obesity without compromising accuracy for other groups, Ramella-Roman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qtXEVg"&gt;“The way the systems were designed initially maybe didn’t account for these individuals, but they could definitely make changes,” she says. “I don’t see anything that would limit that.”  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kyocera DuraSport 5G UW review: tough choices</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The DuraSport 5G is one of the few rugged options available&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="XH6g5P"&gt;After releasing the tank-like $899.99 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446490/kyocera-duraforce-ultra-5g-uw-review-price-specs-screen-camera"&gt;DuraForce Ultra 5G UW in April 2021&lt;/a&gt;, Kyocera is back with a more subtly rugged (and more affordable) phone — the $579.99 DuraSport 5G UW. If you want a sub-$600 rugged phone that works on Verizon’s millimeter wave (mmWave) 5G network, the DuraSport 5G UW is really your only choice. Roughly the size of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A with 5G&lt;/a&gt;, the DuraSport is small but strong: it’s dust, sand, and waterproof in up to 6.5 ft of water for 30 minutes (IP68), as well as MIL 810H-certified to survive five-foot drops onto concrete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fyRyM"&gt;Underneath that toughness, the DuraSport is a sub-$300 phone at heart. It shares similar specs as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;$239.99 OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt;: they both use the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of internal storage. But the DuraSport has a smaller 4,500mAh battery and comes with some unique outdoor apps and camera features. This leads to the obvious question: is a budget rugged phone worth the premium, or are you better off getting a cheap 5G phone and adding a very protective case around it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mQRyhj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10954621"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Irpu2G5AQ1fM2aqWOGvUvsuIYeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100512/gsin_190401_4934_0001_cropped.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FceIkL"&gt;DuraSport 5G UW Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="87ab7q"&gt;At a time when every new budget phone seems to be over 6.5 inches tall, the DuraSport is surprisingly compact. It’s similar to the Google Pixel 5A with 5G but thicker and slightly more narrow (6.09 x 2.78 x 0.39-inch or 154.7 x 70.7 x 9.9mm). They even look alike, with the same rounded corners and fingerprint sensor on the back — handy for unlocking the phone when you’re wearing a mask. This phone fits nicely in my small hands, and I can stuff it into most pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6x0Q5"&gt;For a phone built to survive the rigorous military-grade tests for dust, sand, water, and drop protection, the DuraSport’s design doesn’t scream rugged. Unlike its more expensive sibling, the DuraSport has normal dimensions and proportions. But it still obviates the need for a separate case: not only is its screen protected by Gorilla Glass 6, but it has reinforced corners, water-tight seams around its buttons, and a Dragontrail Glass over its rear cameras. Despite its extra bits of engineering, the Kyocera weighs about the same as the Pixel 5A. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/szgt5xhgFStySime-UT16E5-eCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100514/gsin_190401_4934_0004_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The DuraSport has some texture on its sides to help with grip, but it’s not very comfortable to hold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9A00JY"&gt;While the DuraSport’s hard plastic shell can withstand a lot of abuse, it’s not the most comfortable to hold. Kyocera added some light texture to its back cover and along the sides, but they don’t provide much substantial grip to the device. Not that this phone needs the extra protection, but a case would make the phone easier to hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwU83e"&gt;Among the many ways you can customize this phone, the most obvious is the programmable button on the left side. You can set it to open the exact camera mode you need in a hurry (underwater shutter button) or open a particular app if you double-press the button. I kept hitting the programmable button by accident because that’s where my thumb lands when I hold the phone; the actual power button is a bit too low for my liking. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/goH2npYLIBiyfmDpLl-sLeG10_g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100518/gsin_190401_4934_0012_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The included suite of outdoor apps can provide useful information, but they require constant access to your location, even when you’re not using them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7FSjlj"&gt;DuraSport 5G UW Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8pyQG8"&gt;Despite its mid-range price tag, the DuraSport has low-end internal components. Its processor is the budget-tier Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 with 4GB of RAM, which makes the DuraSport just a beat slower to open a webpage or switch between portrait and landscape mode when watching a YouTube video. This was particularly evident when playing a round of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;, where the middle of a battle slowed to such a crawl that I couldn’t move my Pokémon out of the way to dodge an attack. While a sub-$300 phone can get away with just 64GB of storage, it’s mismatched to the DuraSport’s nearly $600 price tag, even if it has a microSD card slot for expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGZaCB"&gt;The DuraSport somewhat redeems itself with a 6.1-inch 1080p IPS LCD display that is quite bright (500 nits), making it possible to use the screen at just 60 percent brightness in direct sunlight. When you look at high-res photos like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22829680/2021-art-illustrations-photography-verge-roundup"&gt;The Verge’s 2021: A Year in Art&lt;/a&gt;, the images look smooth and detailed even when you pixel-peep, thanks to this screen’s over 400PPI pixel density. Best of all, the touchscreen is functional when I’m wearing gloves or there is water on the screen, which is a huge help during winter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnFy7I"&gt;This phone is preloaded with apps for outdoor enthusiasts: an Outdoor Portal, Compass, Barometer, Sun&amp;amp;Moon, Weather, Tide (if you fish or have a boat), and Solunar (if you want to meet or avoid certain animals). In my case, I skate on an outdoor rink in the winter but am extremely picky about when I do so: the temperature needs to be at least 32 degrees or below the night before and throughout the day, with minimal wind, and after sunset so the ice has a chance to harden. I used the Outdoor Portal to monitor my local weather and sunset / sunrise data rather than cycle between multiple apps. While I appreciate the convenience of having these apps on my phone, I was not impressed that I had to give the apps non-stop access to my location, even though they said I could just limit the data collection to when I use the apps. If you don’t care to use these apps at all, you don’t have to worry about the location tracking, but they are a big part of the DuraSport’s selling points.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Za_0PTHZr5E8GrE4FGg5EUTFO3k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100513/gsin_190401_4934_0003_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The included outdoor apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WugW9L"&gt;Beyond these outdoor apps, the DuraSport essentially runs an unmodified version of Android 11. As one of the phones selected for the &lt;a href="https://androidenterprisepartners.withgoogle.com/device/#!/Atw0zjuq92nTHyfuwwaC"&gt;Android Enterprise Recommended&lt;/a&gt; program, Kyocera is already committed to providing quarterly security updates to the DuraSport until November 2023. This, along with the fact Kyocera provides two years of warranty, compared to the industry standard of just one year, means this phone should last you a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLv26q"&gt;The DuraSport’s 4,500mAh battery is actually quite energy-efficient and able to go without a charge after two days of use — and that’s from using mostly 4G LTE. After listening to a couple of hour-long podcasts, taking some photos and videos, posting and scrolling through social media, and reading various articles, I got about 15.5 hours of screen time out of the DuraSport over two days. Using the included charger, I was able to recharge the phone within 2.5 hours, which isn’t particularly fast. Kyocera says the DuraSport supports faster charging, but a fast charger is not included in the box. Like the DuraSport Ultra 5G, the lower tier model also supports wireless charging for more convenient topping up.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ge9x8YJkswhw_6oWgX2d-TQLTtc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100516/gsin_190401_4934_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The DuraSport’s camera is budget-level, despite its mid-range price tag.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GcaNqZ"&gt;DuraSport 5G UW Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NdYqvf"&gt;Let’s get this out of the way: if you’re serious about photography, then you won’t like the cameras on the DuraSport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwh9GB"&gt;The phone has two cameras on the back, a 48-megapixel main and a 16-megapixel ultrawide, as well as an 8-megapixel front camera. The cameras take perfectly fine photos in good lighting conditions, but they’re not designed for anything challenging like low-light or action photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="14riyf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10988512"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NP3CMo"&gt;Its cameras share the same problems that plague other sub-$300 phones. Not only do the colors differ between the main and ultrawide camera, but the main camera also sometimes has trouble focusing and separating the subject from the background in portrait mode. I’ve also noticed that photos from low-light environments look as if there is vignetting around the edges — whether they were captured with the main, ultrawide, or selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyd2wN"&gt;The DuraSport tries to make up for its technical deficiencies with some unique video interfaces like the Action Overlay and beauty filters. (I did not have access to ANT Plus compatible fitness sensors, so I could not test the Action Overlay being linked to my fitness data in real-time.) Ultimately, it’s let down by a camera app that is slow at switching between cameras and will randomly close for no reason, which makes it frustrating to take photos with it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/txzVUzQNArBSUldpMHGKeU1EaBk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121642/gsin_190410_4934_0023.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kyocera DuraSport 5G UW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k0eOIY"&gt;There is no doubt you’re paying a premium for the rugged design of the $579.99 DuraSport 5G UW — despite the fact it has cheap components that are more common in sub-$300 budget phones. It’s a shame it doesn’t use a faster processor or feature better cameras for a phone that is almost $600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvqoKv"&gt;There are plenty of other, better phones in this price range, including Google’s own Pixel 6. But if you’re looking for a rugged phone and want to use Verizon’s faster mmWave 5G network, the DuraSport is really the only budget rugged 5G phone available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsci4J"&gt;If having excellent cameras on your phone is more important to you, and you are willing to accept a water-resistant (IP67) rather than a waterproof one (IP68), then the $449 Pixel 5A with 5G would be a better choice. After all, they look and feel almost identical to each other, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okGCOQ"&gt;The peace of mind of having a phone that can handle serious spills and drops without needing to be replaced within a few years, thanks to Kyocera’s two-year warranty, is worthwhile, but most of us are better off just investing in a durable case for another phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="XCHVNL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10988492"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S0pRvT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, 1:30PM ET, January 21st, 2022:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this review stated the DuraForce 5G UW does not support wireless charging. That is incorrect, the phone includes support for Qi charging. Also added information about optional wired fast charging. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="n8QNZ4"&gt;Digital password manager company 1Password announced this week intentions to expand the login features of its services — starting with something the company calls Universal Sign On that it says can make logging into different websites or services even easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcBpqa"&gt;1Password already sells subscription services to small and large businesses looking to control and secure access to various passwords amongst staff — and now it looks to make Universal Sign On work alongside multi-factor authentication products like Duo and single sign-on (SSO) products like Okta (depending on what the enterprise needs are).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="SEQqjC"&gt;“How will 1Password try to solve the challenges of universal log on and, in particular, whether you’re trying to compete with Okta, Active Directory and others in this space?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3uMwdB"&gt;1Password’s CFO Jeannie De Guzman responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QRhhNt"&gt;“We actually partner with Okta and we are an Okta shop at 1Password. When I think about competing with Okta... we don’t view them as a direct competitor. When you use Okta inside a company, it’s often times a lot of enterprise level software that you have enterprise-wide deployments... there's a huge proliferation of SaaS apps going out that are being used by all of us at work right now. Those onesies and twosies that go to one person or to a small group of people... those don’t necessarily get caught in Okta”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HJpavW"&gt;Guzman explains the issue of “shadow IT,” where people can still have access to things not governed by Okta SSO or have accounts for work that IT does not know about — and that is where Guzman says 1Password can cooperate with Okta (or other SSOs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPFjWA"&gt;“We capture all those logins that don’t get captured enterprise-wide.” Guzman gave an example of this as someone who has worked finance in various companies: finance departments could give access to bank accounts with a single sign-on solution using 1Password, even if they’re not configured for Okta-style SSO access. Guzman further expanded that many companies could have a finance department employee who just left and, yet, still knows the bank account password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="319Lhc"&gt;Today, the company &lt;a href="https://blog.1password.com/how-sso-fits-enterprise-security-framework/"&gt;posted on its blog&lt;/a&gt; to further explain how 1Password will work alongside SSO solutions and why companies really should use its product:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JzcUA4"&gt;It’s important to note that SSO doesn’t solve all your security problems, just a subset of them. For instance, if a service isn’t integrated into your SSO platform, employees can create an account on their own, bypassing SSO altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
