    <title>Workers at Medium are unionizing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rqOMB-8K2h8PDVrsHFwiiRUZsI0=/109x0:1513x936/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68805784/MWU_Group_Photo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mSG9Pv"&gt;Medium workers have announced they’re forming a union with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) Local 9410. The Medium Workers Union says more than &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mediumworkers/status/1359942472479232001"&gt;70 percent of eligible employees have already signed cards in support&lt;/a&gt;, currently representing 140 workers across editorial, engineering, design, and product, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/11/media/medium-union/index.html"&gt;according to CNN&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BJMYI"&gt;The organization plans to negotiate a contract for its members. Right now, it’s asking Medium to voluntarily recognize the union. If the company refuses, the union can force recognition through the National Labor Relations Board as long as a majority of employees vote in favor of unionization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SqDG1"&gt;The Medium Workers Union is not putting out a list of demands and says it didn’t organize around a single issue. “We’re creating infrastructure for workers at Medium to have their voices strengthened and amplified by each other, much like the way writers use Medium to amplify their words and ideas,” &lt;a href="https://mediumworkersunion.org/"&gt;its website reads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMlJe4"&gt;Historically, unions have organized around fair pay and benefits. More recently, however, they’ve gone after larger goals, like giving workers a say in business decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDDU97"&gt;The news comes a month after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html"&gt;Google employees and contractors announced the Alphabet Workers Union&lt;/a&gt; (AWU), a group also affiliated with CWA. AWU is a solidarity union, meaning it’s not recognized by the NLRB and can’t force Google management to negotiate a contract for its members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ef2RnX"&gt;Medium, which hosts both a blogging platform and digital media outlets, sits at the corner of tech and journalism. In recent years, workers at &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed, and Vox &lt;/em&gt;(which includes &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;) have also announced plans to unionize. Now, the movement is growing in the tech industry, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aKNP02"&gt;In a section titled “our vision,” the Medium Workers Union says part of its goal is to bake social justice into the product. “Our platform’s mission aligns with the greater purpose of social good, and we invest in mitigating harm in a landscape of tech and media that has historically deprioritized user safety and combating misinformation,” the website reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TzlnSa"&gt;The union also said it wants workers to have protections against harassment and discrimination based on race, ethnicity, class, gender identity, religion, sexual orientation, body size, and disability. “We hold the company and its leaders accountable to their diversity and inclusion promises, and to maintaining an open door culture for marginalized workers to voice their concerns without fear of retaliation,” the website says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLO5gk"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Medium spokesperson wrote: “We’re aware that some employees have started to explore unionizing with the Communications Workers of America. This is an important matter that merits thoughtful consideration, and we are assessing the appropriate next steps.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DFjEA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter plans to label the personal accounts of heads of state</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h6BA7kEbgKroYAXGR-WRIYvlH7w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68805612/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sfCb4q"&gt;Beginning next week, Twitter will add labels to the personal accounts of heads of state as it expands its policy on government-affiliated accounts, &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/account-labels-phase2.html"&gt;the company said Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The labels are meant to provide context for users to “have a more informed experience on Twitter,” according to a blog post from Twitter Support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqZcQ3"&gt;This appears to be a change from an earlier position when the company said it &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/new-labels-for-government-and-state-affiliated-media-accounts.html"&gt;would not label the personal accounts&lt;/a&gt; of heads of state since such accounts already have “widespread name recognition, media attention, and public awareness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="K9k332"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To continue to help you identify governmental officials and institutions on Twitter, we’re expanding our policy to label these accounts in more countries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next week, you’ll start to see new profile labels on government accounts in 16 other countries.&lt;a href="https://t.co/RNyrznKQuL"&gt;https://t.co/RNyrznKQuL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/poK4vIa5xZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/poK4vIa5xZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1359941657215475712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WXHXvB"&gt;Twitter said it will also update the text in its labels to add more specificity and will apply additional labels to state-affiliated media accounts in the coming months. The company has stopped amplifying tweets from accounts where a government “exercises control over editorial content through financial resources, direct or indirect political pressures, and/or control over production and distribution.” That doesn’t include news outlets that receive government funding but which have editorial independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3C48d3"&gt;In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357287/twitter-government-officials-state-affiliated-media-labels-algorithm"&gt;Twitter began applying labels&lt;/a&gt; to government officials’ accounts to more clearly identify them for users. It started with government officials in China, France, Russia, the UK, and the US, and is adding Canada, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, Germany, Honduras, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates beginning on February 17th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jG6L3z"&gt;Twitter declined to comment Thursday about whether it would apply additional protections to personal accounts of heads of state, but such protections apparently do exist. In July, the accounts of dozens of companies and high-profile individuals were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21326200/elon-musk-bill-gates-twitter-hack-bitcoin-scam-compromised"&gt;compromised during a massive breach&lt;/a&gt; that was part of a bitcoin-promoting scam, but the (now-banned) account of then-President Trump was unaffected. It turned out that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327782/trump-twitter-hacked-massive-attack-bitcoin-scam"&gt;Trump’s account enjoyed additional protections&lt;/a&gt; after “past incidents.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdDlGz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Trump was permanently banned from Twitter&lt;/a&gt; in January for inciting the deadly attack on the Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Game of Thrones showrunners are producing a Netflix adaptation of The Overstory with Hugh Jackman</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q7hTQUxRpg-hJxpri1y0PkJ0rzM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68805581/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nvA65S"&gt;David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, the creators and showrunners of HBO’s &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, have a new project in the works with Netflix that will see the duo team up with actor Hugh Jackman to executive produce an adaptation of the 2018 novel &lt;em&gt;The Overstory&lt;/em&gt;. The novel, from author Richard Powers, is a work of environmental fiction centered on the lives of a group of individuals and how their experiences relate to a distinct set of trees and the movement to preserve and protect nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vtgCdE"&gt;Benioff and Weiss &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20761099/game-of-thrones-david-benioff-db-weiss-netflix-deal-200-million-disney-stars"&gt;inked a deal with Netflix in 2019&lt;/a&gt; worth a reported $250 million to bring new shows to the platform. &lt;em&gt;The Overstory &lt;/em&gt;adaptation will be the duo’s third after an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21410210/netflix-the-three-body-problem-benioff-weiss-adapation"&gt;adaptation of Liu Cixin’s sci-fi trilogy The Remembrance of Earth’s Past&lt;/a&gt; (perhaps better known by its first entry, &lt;em&gt;The Three-Body Problem&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/holland-taylor-sandra-oh-jay-duplass-netflix-dramedy-series-the-chair-1234673561/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new six-part series from showrunner Amanda Peet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b5ZCke"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Overstory is being developed as a series by David Benioff &amp;amp; D.B. Weiss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richard Powers’ novel is a sweeping work of activism and resistance about a magnificently inventive world that a handful of people learn how to see and are drawn into &lt;a href="https://t.co/Wn0VTlFWcU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Wn0VTlFWcU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Queue (@netflixqueue) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflixqueue/status/1359902772443836417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WB81JI"&gt;Jackman is reportedly a fan of the novel, as is Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-of-thrones-creators-set-third-netflix-show-the-overstory?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The book won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, and Netflix describes the novel as “a sweeping, impassioned work of activism and resistance that is also a stunning evocation of the natural world” in its announcement post. “It tells the story of a world alongside ours that is vast, interconnected, resourceful, magnificently inventive and almost invisible to us,” the announcement goes on to say. “A handful of disparate people learn how to see that world and are drawn into its unfolding catastrophe.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-68" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $110 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. You can also get them for $120 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or $130 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731722633239801630" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4781ccd9dac6fb8bf9e60c657cd3fbba&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/979838/2092?sharedid=verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OGXtAu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Uv43TD"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="AirPods Pro review: the perfect earbuds for the iPhone|73652" data-volume-uuid="c840e1e11" data-volume-id="73652" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-362" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. Right now, if you don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730154636955201273" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$190 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Apple’s AirPods Pro are down to $180 at Amazon and Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ADVaKJ741skd2nYKH2QlBnCa0F0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68805342/akrales_191030_3763_0446.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XWNZQd"&gt;When it comes to true wireless earbuds, Apple’s AirPods Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;are possibly the best option out there&lt;/a&gt;. If you have been holding off on buying the AirPods Pro, hoping for a significant price drop, your time has come: Apple’s flagship wireless earbuds are just $180 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; right now. That’s $69 off the usual $249 price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLpNMN"&gt;While this is not the lowest price we have seen these earbuds go for, the AirPods Pro rarely get marked down to anything lower than $190, making this an exceptional deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hm8acq"&gt;Among other advantages, the AirPods Pro offer a customizable fit that includes three different silicone ear tip sizes, making it easier for them to fit in your ears. The standard AirPods come with a “one size fits most” design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="04LGOU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vDBZb6"&gt;If you’re looking for a pair of AirPods but aren’t interested in the Pro model, Amazon currently has one of the better deals on the regular AirPods. For $110, you can grab &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a second-generation pair with a wired charging case&lt;/a&gt; (coupon applied at checkout). For $50 more, you can pick up a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pair that includes a wireless charging case&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned you can turn off Reddit’s obnoxious app install pop-up with a simple checkbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C-Qm-_GlVAZiMEUv7vVoamTXkyU=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68805262/reddit_notice.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1cyQLq"&gt;My preferred way to surf Reddit is via the mobile website. It lets me quickly check a few of my favorite subreddits to see which posts are bubbling up. Since I’m not usually logged in, it helps me manage my screen time, too; you can only scroll down so far in comment threads until Reddit prompts you to enter your username and password. I take that as a sign that I’ve scrolled far enough and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoZAs2"&gt;I have one big complaint with the mobile site, though: it constantly shoves a large banner into my face suggesting that I abandon all of that and install the app instead. Here’s a picture of that banner from my phone, which you may have seen before:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6zJIAB6u1S5Qun3O23-lPK_NBfI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22293538/IMG_0199.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, I don’t want to view the page in the app, thanks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w4QXTm"&gt;Typically, I just close the prompt to make it go away, but sooner or later, it reappears, requiring me to close it again and again and again. The cycle never ends — or so I thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wge8Vx"&gt;Today, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/09/you-can-disable-reddits-maddening-open-in-app-popup-once-and-for-all/"&gt;thanks to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I learned I can disable that pop-up forever. It’s actually very easy to turn off:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="14kbPU"&gt;On Reddit’s mobile website, tap the three-line / hamburger menu at the top right of the screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="neV51s"&gt;You’ll be shown a number of options. Tap “Settings” near the bottom. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7qe5El"&gt;Uncheck the box for “Ask To Open In App.” That’s it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KywCTphqO2_guXkM4bmIc2Vd99U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22293552/IMG_0202.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncheck the “Ask To Open In App” option to banish the banner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SdvnFP"&gt;This isn’t a new solution — &lt;em&gt;TNW&lt;/em&gt; wrote about it back &lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/basics/2018/11/21/how-to-stop-reddits-annoying-app-download-prompt/"&gt;in November 2018&lt;/a&gt; — and if you delete your browsing history or go to Reddit in incognito mode, you’ll have to turn the prompt off again. But thanks to this simple tweak, my mobile Reddit browsing experience has already changed for the better. I hope it can for you, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clapper permanently bans QAnon-related content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zFkydbGqJVso58iMfGeZX2a3ztw=/69x0:444x250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68805236/unnamed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Clapper&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wos5kw"&gt;Clapper has moved to ban accounts spreading QAnon conspiracy theories and vaccine misinformation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254411/clapper-parler-gab-qanon-tiktok-free-speech"&gt;in the wake of a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; report last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1FOEl"&gt;Clapper CEO Edison Chen told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Thursday that the company will permanently ban QAnon-related content going forward. As of publication, Chen said Clapper has removed over 400 videos and 20 accounts for spreading QAnon or anti-vax misinformation and has increased its number of content auditors from around a dozen to 20. It will take Clapper up to 10 days to complete a full audit of its over 1 million videos, Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3eo0QV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“From today, if additional users were to post QAnon-related content, it will be removed.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nWUW5X"&gt;“We take this matter very seriously,” Chen said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Thursday. “After investigating, we decided to take action to remove and ban accounts regarding QAnon and mis-info about vaccines… which are against our mission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKOwRL"&gt;Chen continued, “From today, if additional users were to post QAnon-related content, it will be removed. We have zero tolerance about QAnon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyx3oh"&gt;Clapper launched last July as a “Free Speech Short video” app, mimicking platforms like TikTok but with less content moderation. After January’s deadly attack at the Capitol, QAnon content was largely banished from social media. The “free speech” platform Parler, which had a largely conservative-leaning user base, was forced offline by its web hosts after failing to respond to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;reports of violent threats on its platform&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wD6AOL"&gt;Like Parler, Clapper became a popular app for conservatives who disagreed with the content moderation decisions of large tech companies like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; report found that some QAnon Clapper users were able to build large followings using hashtags like #thestorm and #thegreatawakening. One Q-related account identified by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, belonging to Clapper user Josh Sardam, appears to have been removed as of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtTfKY"&gt;Clapper’s QAnon ban puts the smaller platform’s policies in line with those at larger tech platforms like Facebook and TikTok. Last October, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504887/facebook-qanon-ban-all-apps-pages-groups-instagram-accounts"&gt;Facebook moved&lt;/a&gt; to completely ban QAnon, calling it a “militarized social movement.” Other platforms, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226503/twitter-qanon-account-suspension-70000-capitol-riots"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522896/tiktok-removing-accounts-qanon-conspiracy-social-media"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, have also decided to ban the content outright in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83IlNb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Kingdom Hearts series comes to PC as an Epic Store exclusive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FhdmosGJ0mL84q_tJLV_C8J8e-0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68805129/90.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CnRcD2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt;, Square Enix’s action roleplaying mashup of Square Enix, Disney, and Pixar characters, is coming to PC for the first time. The series will be available as an &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/discover/kingdom-hearts"&gt;Epic Store&lt;/a&gt; exclusive on March 30th, the company announced today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7mxZf"&gt;Titles include &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts 1.5 + 2.5 Remix&lt;/em&gt; — enhanced versions of &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts 1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory&lt;/em&gt;. Although the series has spanned a variety of platforms, from its beginnings as a PlayStation title to its arrival on Xbox consoles and handhelds for many of the series’ spinoffs, it has never made the leap to PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rt7aX8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; Just announced &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The iconic &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KINGDOMHEARTS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@KINGDOMHEARTS&lt;/a&gt; Series is coming to PC for the first time ever on March 30th!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are you ready to join Sora and friends in their battle against the darkness? Pre-order all the titles in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KINGDOMHEARTS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@KINGDOMHEARTS&lt;/a&gt; series starting today  &lt;a href="https://t.co/nUKDdLoEcZ"&gt;https://t.co/nUKDdLoEcZ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/RgcfVk3CFA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/RgcfVk3CFA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Epic Games Store (@EpicGames) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1359941547345739777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v76kqI"&gt;The series follows Sora as he travels with companions Donald Duck and Goofy through worlds based on Disney classics.&lt;em&gt; Kingdom Hearts III&lt;/em&gt;, which acts as the conclusion to Sora’s adventure, launched for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThY0Jy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts 1.5 + 2.5 Remix&lt;/em&gt; is available for $49.99, while the other three games are $59.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>See how libraries are meeting ebook demand for the NYT Best Sellers list with this visualization</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oyKZSvtsAdaHih9ptz2PEMkbybU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68805091/akrales_190723_3560_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5F4laT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/17/2945779/5-minutes-on-the-verge-robin-sloan"&gt;Fiction author&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/6/16257364/robin-sloan-sourdough-mr-penumbras-24-hour-bookstore-interview-silicon-valley"&gt;sourdough bread lover&lt;/a&gt;, and former Twitter executive Robin Sloan is answering a question you may have never thought to ask: which &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;Best Sellers list&lt;/a&gt; ebooks are in the highest demand in the US public library system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nn1E0r"&gt;Sloan created &lt;a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/library-demand-list/"&gt;an interactive visualization&lt;/a&gt; that lets you see how many people are on the waitlist to “borrow” a digital copy of a book (known as “holds”) and compare that against how many “copies” a library actually owns. Some are perhaps more popular than the libraries were prepared for! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6L8bTa"&gt;I’m using air quotes because while digital goods are infinite, there’s a whole system in place that lets libraries continue to lend books (and their creators continue to get paid) as if they had a limited number of physical copies. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t__I1_SyhMW_Tqld88nQcoh0Sxw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297742/library_book_holds_nyt_bestseller_list_sloan.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="46z7mQ"&gt;If you page through Sloan’s visualization, you can also see that library patrons aren’t necessarily most interested in the books at the very top of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;’s list&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The Vanishing Half&lt;/em&gt; has the most holds and the most copies available, despite being No. 6 at the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; in sales. You have to hover over titles to see those rankings, though; there’s no button to reorder Sloan’s list, only scale the size of each box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f84Mc4"&gt;“I think these views of the NYT list are interesting because library e-book lending has exploded in the past few years, and now constitutes a very important channel for reading in the United States; it feels worthwhile to try to understand how its patterns both mirror and diverge from book buying,” writes Sloan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzhfmK"&gt;Sloan is being cagey about how he got the data, but he says he’ll continue to update this with new data through February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="vaxfXA"&gt;Jack Black is set to play snarky robot Claptrap in the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; movie, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/jack-black-joins-cate-blanchett-in-borderlands-movie"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/jack-black-eli-roth-cate-blanchett-borderlands-lionsgate-1234692217/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/jack-black-borderlands-movie-claptrap-1234906098/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and other publications. He joins what’s turning out to be an all-star cast, which also includes Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Hart, and Cate Blanchett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6kN8J"&gt;The movie will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145855/borderlands-film-eli-roth-gearbox-live-action-adaptation-direct"&gt;directed by Eli Roth&lt;/a&gt;, who most recently directed &lt;em&gt;The House with a Clock in Its Walls&lt;/em&gt;, which Blanchett and Black also starred in. “I am so excited to reunite with Jack, this time in the recording booth,” he said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;. “&lt;em&gt;Claptrap&lt;/em&gt; is the funniest character in the game, and Jack is perfect to bring him to the big screen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JI59a8"&gt;If you ask me, Black’s wild exuberance is a perfect match for the robot’s quippy in-game persona. If you haven’t played the &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; series before, just watch &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/K3R3iBwGTKA"&gt;this compilation&lt;/a&gt; of some of Claptrap’s best quotes from the second game to get an idea of the role Black is gearing up for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="orip7B"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; movie adaptation has been in the works &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/28/9220215/borderlands-movie-being-made"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt;.

Craig Mazin, who co-created &lt;em&gt;Chernobyl &lt;/em&gt;and is a writer and executive producer on HBO’s take on &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us, &lt;/em&gt;is writing the &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVdVMt"&gt;Speaking of &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;, the casting for Joel and Ellie was just announced on Wednesday: Pedro Pascal (who plays the titular character in &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277687/mandalorian-star-pedro-pascal-joel-hbo-the-last-of-us-tv-show"&gt;will play Joel&lt;/a&gt;, and Bella Ramsey (who starred as the beloved Lyanna Mormont in &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277372/the-last-of-us-ellie-game-of-thrones-bella-ramsey-hbo-lyanna-mormont"&gt;will play Ellie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
