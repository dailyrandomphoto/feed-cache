    <title>Online-only Outriders can be paused in single-player — if you have an Nvidia GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OYbXzUyWi1LBRVlgVGECf_6oUDE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69079250/pv_02_s001_s001_t011_mov_02_55_57_22_still003_sCAdb67GRO.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: People Can Fly&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bVTDmn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outriders&lt;/em&gt;, the online shooting, looting, and superpower-slinging game from People Can Fly, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/outriders/comments/mj3upt/pc_users_with_nvidia_gpus_can_pause_the_game/"&gt;finally has a way to pause&lt;/a&gt;, but to do it you’ll need to be using an Nvidia graphics card (via &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/solo-players-with-nivida-gpus-can-pause-always-online-o-1846616313"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;). &lt;/em&gt;Despite working as a single-player game, &lt;em&gt;Outriders&lt;/em&gt; requires an internet connection to play, which means pausing in the middle of a battle was impossible until this workaround. Even with your menu open, enemies could still attack you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iudg82"&gt;Using &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fansel-revolutionizing-game-screenshots%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F5%2F22368287%2Foutriders-destiny-square-enix-online-only-pause-singleplayer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ansel&lt;/a&gt;, which is a feature of Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics cards that enables a kind of photo mode even in games without one built in, you can “pause” &lt;em&gt;Outriders &lt;/em&gt;by pressing “Alt F2” on the fly, and get up and take care of business. Because Ansel is specific to the Nvidia’s Geforce Experience software, pausing is limited to PC players, which means anyone playing on console or with a different brand of graphics card is out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dPP5Zs"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLkKwLx8Dw4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="96BHb3"&gt;The handling of pausing and single-player content in &lt;em&gt;Outriders&lt;/em&gt; is similar to &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, to&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which it shares some aesthetic and mechanical similarities. &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21154809/destiny-2-paid-cosmetic-loot-boxes-fortnite-style-season-battle-pass-ending"&gt;sells a battle pass and yearly expansions&lt;/a&gt; with new story content, and it justifies — at least in part — it’s online-only requirements with the promise of new weekly and monthly changes in the form of live events and other features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZJYN1"&gt;The difference is that &lt;em&gt;Outriders&lt;/em&gt; is very explicitly sold as a more traditional single-player game, with the game’s publisher Square Enix &lt;a href="https://outriders.square-enix-games.com/en-us/faq/"&gt;addressing the issue on its site&lt;/a&gt;, “&lt;em&gt;Outriders&lt;/em&gt; is a complete experience out of the box,” it writes. For some reason, an internet connection is still required, which, beyond hindering a basic feature like pausing the game, also seemed to contribute to &lt;em&gt;Outriders&lt;/em&gt;’ launch on April 2nd being &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/outriders-launches-to-a-day-of-server-problems-like-ev-1846608910"&gt;kind of a mess&lt;/a&gt;. Players had issues connecting with the game’s servers to play in single-player and multiplayer, for which developer People Can Fly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PCFPeopleCanFly/status/1378075633553715216"&gt;acknowledged and apologized publicly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ma7VWa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To All Players: &lt;a href="https://t.co/xBpcc6g9T1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/xBpcc6g9T1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— People Can Fly (@PCFPeopleCanFly) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PCFPeopleCanFly/status/1378075633553715216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6UApmH"&gt;The game &lt;a href="https://status.outriders.net/"&gt;seems to be working fine now&lt;/a&gt;, and this weird Nvidia loophole means the experience of playing single-player could be a little bit more comfortable, but &lt;em&gt;Outriders&lt;/em&gt; definitely illustrates the ongoing problems of making a game online-only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2jLXx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yahoo Answers will be shut down forever on May 4th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Yahoo (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/suf1NGVTbFtyM2yYdXDr9h01svQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69079195/yahoo-stock-1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L46G59"&gt;Yahoo Answers, one of the longest-running and most storied web Q&amp;amp;A platforms in the history of the internet, is shutting down on May 4th. That’s the day the Yahoo Answers website will start redirecting to the Yahoo homepage, and all of the platform’s archives will apparently cease to exist. The platform has been operating since 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCC9fp"&gt;Yahoo, which is now part of Verizon Media Group following the company’s sale to the telecom for nearly $5 billion in 2017, &lt;a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/"&gt;announced the change&lt;/a&gt; at the top of the Yahoo Answers homepage. The message links to an &lt;a href="https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN35642.html"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, which details the timeline of the shutdown. Starting April 20th, the platform will no longer accept new submissions, the FAQ explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKfTs5"&gt;Users will also have until June 30th to request their data or it’ll be inaccessible after that. That includes “all user-generated content including your Questions list, Questions, Answers list, Answers, and any images,” Yahoo says, but  “you won’t be able to download other users’ content, questions, or answers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NpFfM"&gt;A note sent to active Yahoo Answers members provides a little more detail as to why Yahoo is shutting down the platform, including that “it has become less popular over the years” and that the company “decided to shift our resources away” from the product to “focus on products that better serve our members.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yARHGy"&gt;Dear Yahoo Answers Community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Qab4e"&gt;We launched Yahoo Answers sixteen years ago to help people around the world connect and share information. With you and millions of other users, we built the best place on the web to ask and answer questions on a variety of topics, creating a community of global knowledge sharing. While we could not have been prouder of what we accomplished together, we are reaching out today to let you know that we have decided to shut down Yahoo Answers on May 4th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJya6d"&gt;While Yahoo Answers war once a key part of Yahoo’s products and services, it has become less popular over the years as the needs of our members have changed. To that end, we have decided to shift our resources away from Yahoo Answers to focus on products that better serve our members and deliver on Yahoo’s promise of providing premium trusted content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qe50Q8"&gt;Starting on April 20th you will no longer be able to post any new questions or answers. However, you can still view any posted questions and answers until May 4th. On May 4th the site will be shutting down. If you would like to download a copy of your questions and answers you have posted, you can do this by signing into &lt;em&gt;Your Privacy Dashboard&lt;/em&gt; and requesting a download. You will be able to do this until June 30th, 2021 after which your Yahoo Answers data will be securely deleted and no longer available. The closure of Yahoo Answers will not affect your Yahoo account or other Yahoo services. For further information and instructions on how to download your data, please visit our Frequently Asked Questions or copy and paste this URL into your browser: &lt;a href="https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN35642.html"&gt;https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN35642.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1pZ1U"&gt;Thank you for contributing to Yahoo Answers — we’re proud and honored to have helped you connect with and learn from the Yahoo community these past sixteen years. If you’d like to provide feedback, please feel free to reach out to our team at &lt;a href="mailto:yahoo_answers_sunset@verizonmedia.com"&gt;yahoo_answers_sunset@verizonmedia.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar8YYi"&gt;Sincerely, The Yahoo Answers team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dkRUEK"&gt;Perhaps the shutdown is for the best, considering the site appears to be overrun with far-right conspiratorial garbage. The current Yahoo Answers homepage is highlighting such introspective gems in its discover section as, “Will America survive 4 years of Joe Biden?” and “Will this summer be record riots by BLM and antifa?,” as well as this instant classic, “Was Stalin right about everything?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEQrJO"&gt;May all the wayward souls of Yahoo Answers now find the information they’re looking for somewhere more credible. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This Nintendo Switch is so big you can actually read the text in Skyrim</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CELyoHr4zWJ0uhayoyE3bELERMA=/259x0:2185x1284/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69078886/Screen_Shot_2021_04_05_at_2.23.14_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cOZ1TM"&gt;Nintendo has been rumored to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22312559/new-nintendo-switch-oled-screen-holiday-release-report"&gt;working on a bigger Switch&lt;/a&gt; for a while now, which reportedly could show up later in 2021. But YouTuber &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCao3Nt6sXkRZc851f6wHmkg"&gt;Michael Pick&lt;/a&gt; isn’t waiting around for a new model from Nintendo — he’s gone and built his own bigger Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fljYuR"&gt;Much bigger, as it turns out: almost six feet wide, compared to the regular Switch’s 9.4-inch size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhWh5z"&gt;“I really like the Nintendo Switch. It’s small, it’s portable — but it’s really easy to lose. And for me, that was a problem. So, I decided to fix that by making something that was just a little bit larger,” Pick said. That reads as a bit of an understatement when comparing Pick’s supersized model (which he says is the world’s largest) to the original. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aWRbRgqBoxL-RaWFBKSOWZB8Z0w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422135/Screen_Shot_2021_04_05_at_2.23.25_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X5n8ZK"&gt;The gigantic version of the Switch is less a portable console and more of a fancy wooden frame for a 4K TV screen, with 3D-printed buttons and an actual (regular-sized) Switch hidden inside. To make the buttons work, a smaller Joy-Con controller is stowed inside with several servo motors that translate the presses on the big buttons to the actual hardware on the inside. The joysticks are even simpler: just massive, 3D-printed joysticks centered with rubber bands on top of the smaller Joy-Con joysticks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ro4nOn"&gt;Of course, the massive custom Switch does lose out on some of the regular Switch’s portability: at 65 pounds, it’s not something that you’ll be able to carry around easily. And if one wanted to quibble, Pick’s Switch isn’t technically &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; functional, lacking both a touchscreen and removable Joy-Con controllers (making it more of a giant Switch Lite in practice than a giant standard Switch.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdwlHz"&gt;Still, the lack of portability shouldn’t be too much of a problem, given that Pick is donating the custom console to the St. Jude Children’s Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic just made streaming Fortnite easier than ever with a new Houseparty integration</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vIIB_FEzmd3sF8Hxg3-MuBo1FN8=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69078880/stream_fortnite_gameplay_to_houseparty_1280x720_224cb65f8d7c.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ev6jux"&gt;Epic is further stitching together its various platforms with a new &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; integration for its social video app Houseparty that &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/stream-your-fortnite-gameplay-to-friends-inside-houseparty?sessionInvalidated=true"&gt;lets you stream your gameplay to friends&lt;/a&gt;. The integration builds on an existing one that uses Houseparty’s video chatting capabilities to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572069/fortnite-houseparty-video-chat-pc-ps4-ps5"&gt;bring live video chat into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and now this essentially does the reverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZg3qL"&gt;That way, your friends can see you live both through your mobile phone camera and also the feed of your active &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;game. Think of it a bit like Twitch streaming without all the fuss and just for your friends instead of the broader public. Epic says the feature supports streaming from a PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, or PC right now. “We will let everyone know if we’re able to support more platforms in the future,” Epic says in its blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kyjnh5"&gt;Epic owns Houseparty, which streamlines fast and easy group video chat, following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18662708/epic-games-houseparty-acquisition-fortnite-video-chat"&gt;2019 acquisition&lt;/a&gt;, and the game maker has used the app to boost the social feature sets of its various gaming platforms. A few months following the acquisition, Epic began using Houseparty for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871464/fortnite-voice-chat-party-hub-houseparty"&gt;improved &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;cross-platform audio chat&lt;/a&gt;, and now a full bridge between the game and the app exists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOJafX"&gt;For a breakdown of how to enable Houseparty gameplay streaming and video chat, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/stream-your-fortnite-gameplay-to-friends-inside-houseparty?sessionInvalidated=true"&gt;check out Epic’s FAQ here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG says some phones will get Android 12 updates, but we’re skeptical</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9JLpHDS59marPNaKaSNPBQA6CU8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69078689/cwelch_200218_3910_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG V60 — launched in early 2020 — could be on the list for an Android 12 update.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eYfu7t"&gt;LG says it will continue to offer Android OS updates — including an upgrade to Android 12 — for some of its devices after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;exits the smartphone business&lt;/a&gt;, but the company’s poor track record has us feeling skeptical it’ll follow through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0SUJg"&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fpress-release%2Flg-to-close-mobile-phone-business-worldwide&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F5%2F22368129%2Flg-phones-android-12-update-security" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; and on a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fnotice&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F5%2F22368129%2Flg-phones-android-12-update-security" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US FAQ page&lt;/a&gt;, LG says only that it will continue to provide some security and OS updates, but a page on LG’s Korean website &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lg-android-12-update/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; specifically mentions that an “Android 12 OS upgrade will also be provided for selected models.” This page also notes that this is subject to change based on product performance, and that update availability may vary by region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8c6v05"&gt;&lt;q&gt;LG wasn’t very reliable with updates even prior to its decision to get out of the phone business&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N0YSS5"&gt;LG US didn’t share anything more specific when contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying only that “LG may offer certain OS upgrades for select models,” and that “additional details will be provided in the near future on software updates.” An Android 11 update schedule hasn’t yet been confirmed for the US either, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327144/lg-android-11-software-update-wing-phones-mobile-q4-2021"&gt;details posted on LG’s German website&lt;/a&gt; could give a rough idea of what that might look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDoIPb"&gt;Unfortunately, LG wasn’t very reliable with updates even prior to its decision to get out of the phone business; OS upgrades came slowly, even for flagship devices. In 2018, the company attempted to remedy this by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/12/17228306/lg-android-software-upgrade-center-research-development"&gt;setting up a Software Upgrade division&lt;/a&gt;, but when it came time to offer Android 9 Pie updates in early 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/1/18164265/lg-android-pie-update-g7-v40-q1-2019"&gt;not much had actually changed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOA9Cw"&gt;If the company does make good on its Android 12 promise, we expect that it would only come to a few high-profile devices, like the Wing and V60. And with Android 11 only scheduled to come to many of the company’s phones much later this year, even if that 12 update does come it’ll likely be a long ways off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WsG0st"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"LG had few smartphone hits, but it’ll still be missed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22367903/lg-smartphone-retrospective-hits-misses"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Echo Show 10 now has Zoom</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QkdlIN"&gt;Amazon’s bringing Zoom compatibility to more devices. The company announced today that it’s making the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 10 devices&lt;/a&gt; in the US compatible with the popular video calling software. Users who have their calendars linked up to the Alexa will have their meetings started automatically while people who haven’t done that can say, “Alexa, join my meeting” or “Alexa, join my Zoom meeting” to join one. This is the second Echo Show to gain Zoom access; the Echo Show 8 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;started supporting&lt;/a&gt; the videoconferencing platform in the US in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBbGia"&gt;The Echo Show 10’s camera tracks users as they move throughout a room, meaning callers can see the screen no matter where they sit or stand. Presumably, this functionality will work with Zoom, putting it on par with other competitor devices like the Facebook Portal and Google Nest. Google pulls Zoom meetings from users’ calendars while Facebook allows its Portal camera to track users around the room so that they’re always in frame, just like it does with Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVMnIe"&gt;Although people might start commuting into the office more frequently, Zoom and other videoconferencing software will likely remain a standard for many workplace meetings, especially as workers shift to working from home more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJbhJa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clarence Thomas really wants Congress to regulate Twitter moderation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amy Coney Barrett Is Sworn-In As New Supreme Court Justice At The White House" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bED3BCpCf0CP5MZuPcgOEo0_i3Q=/0x0:4858x3239/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69078436/1282403966.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BgtpmI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22421840/thomas_biden_knight.pdf"&gt;Responding to a petition on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas laid out a comprehensive constitutional framework for regulating Twitter moderation, signaling that Thomas and other conservatives are eager to take action against social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3w3HlM"&gt;Thomas was writing in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/11/15953266/knight-institute-files-trump-twitter-block-lawsuit-first-amendment"&gt;a case brought in 2017 by Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that President Trump was violating the First Amendment by blocking critics on Twitter. A federal appeals court &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20688860/trump-loss-knight-institute-second-circuit-court-twitter-block-lawsuit-analysis"&gt;ruled in favor of the institute&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 and Biden’s White House has declined to contest that ruling, making it pointless to continue the case. But since an appeal was filed while Trump was still president, the court is formally required to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PWvS1M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“legislatures might ... be able to treat digital platforms like places of public accommodation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nZXApu"&gt;While the dismissal has little legal significance, Justice Thomas used the case as an opportunity to weigh in on more profound issues facing social media platforms. Thomas’ response focuses primarily on Twitter’s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;ban Trump from the platform&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of the Capitol riot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKMsc1"&gt;Nearly every major platform banned then-President Trump in the wake of the Capitol riot — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251338/twitter-facebook-youtube-election-misinformation-ban-trump"&gt;including Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter&lt;/a&gt; — with most citing terms-of-service provisions against using the platform to incite violence. There has been no meaningful legal effort to contest the bans but they remain politically controversial, particularly among American conservatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlvzFg"&gt;While the ban took place more than six months after the appellate ruling in the Knight case, Thomas uses it as a pretext to examine the separate issue of how Congress or the courts could legally restrain Twitter’s moderation powers to prevent such bans in the future. Over 12 pages, Thomas draws out a detailed case for how lawmakers might restrain platform moderation without violating the First Amendment, drawing on both common carrier designations and English common law rules around the right to exclude customers from public accommodations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h2Z5OD"&gt;Specifically, Thomas argues that lawmakers could use the scale and public nature of platforms like Twitter to justify new moderation rules, similar to the way the Telecommunications Act prevents phone companies from blocking specific people from phone service. Failing that, lawmakers could craft a statute similar to &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-ii-civil-rights-act-public-accommodations"&gt;the public accommodations clause of the Civil Rights Act&lt;/a&gt;, which prevents hotels and restaurants from barring service on the basis of race or creed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SJeSE"&gt;“Even if digital platforms are not close enough to common carriers, legislatures might still be able to treat digital platforms like places of public accommodation,” Thomas continues. “The similarities between some digital platforms and common carriers or places of public accommodation may give legislators strong arguments for similarly regulating digital platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeT7aT"&gt;It’s not the first time Thomas has used a tech-related petition as an opportunity to call for social media regulation. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/clarence-thomas-wants-to-reel-in-section-230-fad81180-1f50-48a6-b638-f9386221f4f2.html"&gt;In October&lt;/a&gt;, Thomas laid out a similar call to pare back the protections offered by Section 230, in a similar motion denying a petition to hear a malware case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1H3UGT"&gt;Notably Thomas’ most recent argument cites &lt;a href="https://yjolt.org/bargaining-free-speech-common-carriage-network-neutrality-and-section-230"&gt;a law review article&lt;/a&gt; by Michigan State professor Adam Candeub, who &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/05/trumps-commerce-department-just-hired-a-lawyer-with-ties-to-white-nationalists/"&gt;served in the Commerce Department&lt;/a&gt; under Trump. Candeub played a role in &lt;a href="https://www.ntia.gov/fcc-filing/2020/ntia-petition-rulemaking-clarify-provisions-section-230-communications-act"&gt;drafting an NTIA petition&lt;/a&gt; to reshape Section 230 through the regulatory process, which would have positioned the FCC as the de facto regulator of social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Chromebook for 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Chromebooks 2020: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HDV4yWEUjQt1tPQn1vixjNoG1V4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976144/mchin_181029_4126_0011.0.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best Chromebooks for every user&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GGbxNY"&gt;The best Chromebooks aren’t just laptops that run a few Google apps anymore. Chromebooks can cover a wide variety of computing needs now, and a good Chrome OS laptop or two-in-one can be more useful than a mediocre &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21231636/windows-10-pc-user-guide-how-to-microsoft"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281530/macos-mac-imac-user-guide-how-to-os-tips"&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt; laptop. That’s why our pick for the best Chromebook of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;, which does just about everything right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnwyna"&gt;The best Chromebooks are known to deliver good value. The message that many people actually want &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;Chromebooks — rather than just cheap ones — has gotten through to manufacturers. Many are around $500 or $600, though there are good options in the higher and lower ranges as well. The extra money goes a long way toward getting something you’ll be happy with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUTNYw"&gt;For the first time, the quality of the best Chromebooks in this range has been consistent. There are so many similarities between the offerings from Asus, Lenovo, Google, HP, Dell, and Samsung that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they’re all sourcing their components from the same factory. That’s great news if you’re comparison shopping; the majority of this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount. They can even rival some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21528540/budget-windows-10-chromebook-systems-acer-lenovo-cheap"&gt;best budget laptops&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptops&lt;/a&gt; on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMCGia"&gt;Our pick for the best Chromebook is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and we’ve selected the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; for shoppers on a budget. Other picks for the best Chromebooks of 2021 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, the HP Chromebook x360, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch4TuU"&gt;What most buyers want in the best Chromebook are likely the same things they want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want. More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but these are the ones that rise above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="YECpuA"&gt;Best Chromebook 2021&lt;/h1&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the best Chromebook of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KQRVus"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BfZy92"&gt;Best Chromebook of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LpXHDz"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is, hands-down, the best Chromebook you can buy. With a gorgeous 3:2 screen that rivals some more expensive competitors, you’ll have a ton of extra vertical space for your work and multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarhIJ"&gt;The keyboard is excellent with a comfortable, quiet feel, and nice backlighting. There’s even an HDMI port, which you don’t see on a thin Chromebook every day. And (most importantly) the 10th-Gen Intel processors can handle a heavy load of tabs with no problem. The Spin’s speakers aren’t great, and there’s no biometric login, but those are reasonable sacrifices to make for a laptop of this quality at this low of a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX2USx"&gt;In a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Acer sets itself apart by making an affordable laptop that’s excellent in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For students or anyone looking for a small secondary device, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great affordable pick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RGZEpN"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P8MGAD"&gt;Best Chromebook on a budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xJq778"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable device for on-the-go work, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet delivers excellent value for its low price. It’s an ultra-portable 10.1-inch 2-in-1 device with a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfnBmb"&gt;The Duet contains a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage, and it performs well if you’re just browsing and don’t plan on using a super heavy load. It also uses a version of Chrome OS that’s made for its convertible form factor, including the first version of Chrome that’s optimized for tablet use. When detached from its keyboard, the Duet supports an Android-esque gesture navigation system that makes switching between apps a breeze. But the most impressive feature is battery life; I got close to 11.5 hours of fairly heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93jX9I"&gt;Of course, there are drawbacks. The touchpad and keyboard are quite small, there’s no headphone jack (and only one USB-C port), and the 16:10 screen is a bit dim. But those are reasonable trade-offs to make for such an affordable price. It makes a great secondary device for schoolwork or on-the-go browsing.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a larger device with more power, one of the best Chromebooks you can buy is the HP Chromebook x360 14.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C2SoIE"&gt;3. HP Chromebook x360 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rtrWbQ"&gt;Powerful Chromebook with a sleek design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rGvI"&gt;If you’re looking to get more power and you don’t mind getting a slightly larger laptop, the HP Chromebook x360 14 is a great choice. HP has several configurations that fall under this name, but we suggest the model we tested with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage to go along with the i3 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUDxQ"&gt;While we picked the Asus because of its elegant design, there isn’t much to complain about on the slightly larger HP. It has the same ports, RAM, and storage. The keyboard is great, and it also sounds slightly better because the speakers are up on the keyboard deck instead of on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 one of the best Chromebooks of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FxguZ6"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CrrPVI"&gt;Best midrange Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="IqMUru"&gt;Samsung’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; shot for the moon, with a $1,000 price tag, an OLED display, a packaged stylus, and a premium build. The Galaxy Chromebook 2 isn’t so much a sequel to that device as it is a pared-down, more affordable alternative. There’s no fingerprint sensor, no stylus, and no OLED — but it’s quite functional, and with a sub-$600 starting price it’s a much more reasonable purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMshkm"&gt;The Chromebook 2’s highlight feature is its finish: It comes in a bright “fiesta red” that will certainly stand out wherever you’re using it. (There’s a gray option as well, if you’d prefer something subtle.) It’s also the first Chromebook ever to feature one of Samsung’s QLED panels. QLED isn’t OLED — it’s just a fancier LED — but it still makes for one of the most gorgeous displays I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91mDFz"&gt;Nice screens sometimes wreck battery life, but that’s not the case here. I averaged about seven hours and 21 minutes of continuous work on the Chromebook 2, which means you shouldn’t need to plug it in &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;too often. And while the Core i3 processor isn’t the most powerful chip you can get in a Chromebook, it’s just fine for everyday work use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s4tmgA"&gt;Best Google Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WMItcT"&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop that weighs just 2.3 pounds. It has a sturdy magnesium chassis, and a ridged grip on the bottom to keep itself from slipping on slanted surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M72CDq"&gt;Not only is the Pixelbook Go portable and stylish, but it delivers solid performance, and supports fast charging through either of its USB-C ports. Battery life is also impressive. The Go lasted over eight hours in our testing, and it should get you through a full workday with no problem. But its standout feature is the keyboard, which is quiet with good travel and a springy feel. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Dieter Bohn found it to be his “favorite thing to type on by a long shot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCvQ3C"&gt;The Go is an expensive product, as Chromebooks go, and it doesn’t top our list because the Chromebook Flip C434 offers similar specs and features for a slightly lower price. But we think plenty of shoppers who value long battery life and lightweight build might prefer to spend a bit more on this device instead.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a premium design, the Google Pixelbook is a good Chromebook for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oKAVKP"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UgIG1H"&gt;Thin Chromebook with beautiful hardware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ptwU2G"&gt;Google hasn’t updated the Pixelbook since its 2017 release, but if you’re looking for a convertible premium Chromebook, it’s still competitive. It has a beautiful design, combining aluminum and Gorilla Glass with silicone palm rests, and sports a bright touchscreen with 2400 x 1600 resolution. The 3:2 aspect ratio offers extra space compared to 16:9 panels and makes it more comfortable to work in multiple apps and windows without having to zoom out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rv26rE"&gt;The Pixelbook doesn’t have the latest Intel processors since it’s an older product. Still, its Core i5 and 8GB of RAM should be able to handle everyday browsing and multitasking just fine. We also got around eight hours of battery life under a fairly heavy load. The keyboard and touchpad are both fun and comfortable to use — and as a neat bonus, the speakers fire up through the hinge, so audio sounds clearer than it does on many convertible laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvzNEI"&gt;Note: Google appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449640/google-pixelbook-discontinue-chromebook-laptop"&gt;discontinuing the Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, but some models are still available through Google’s store and other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="sajnTX"&gt;Premium 2-in-1 with a built-in stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6nUXhF"&gt;It’s a bit heavy as Chromebooks go, but the 3.99-pound Inspiron 14 is still a sturdy convertible device with brushed aluminum chassis that gives it a premium look. It has a spacious backlit keyboard and a nice 1920 x 1080 display with accurate colors. With an 8th Gen Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, it delivers snappy performance for streaming, browsing, multitasking, and even more demanding artistic tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kX7aDx"&gt;Speaking of artists, the Inspiron 14 comes with a stylus, which lives in a dedicated socket inside the chassis so you don’t have to worry about losing it. Thanks to electromagnetic resonance technology (EMR), it doesn’t need batteries or any kind of charge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="E0uFW7"&gt;The convertible Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 is far from a budget purchase. But it does offer a lot for its price, including a built-in battery-free stylus and an extra front-facing camera for quick photos of blackboards or job sites. (The camera above the keyboard is also surprisingly high-resolution — it’s a 13-megapixel sensor with autofocus.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKmhZX"&gt;The V2 also has a nice design on par with that of other premium Chromebooks, including an aluminum lid and a sturdy hinge. It’s fairly portable at 2.9 pounds, and it has a microSD slot in addition to its two USB-C ports and headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re able to spend a bit extra for some serious power, the Asus Chromebook Flip C436 is a good Chromebook for you, offering great battery life and a super light build.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="URploe"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21206912/asus-chromebook-flip-c436-review-chromeos-android"&gt;Asus Chromebook Flip C436&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WREbTq"&gt;A pricey, premium Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DSD92E"&gt;Disappointing battery life (just over five hours of multitasking and seven hours of looping video) and a hefty price tag keep the Chromebook Flip C436 from topping this list, especially considering the lower price but similar offerings of its predecessor, the Chromebook Flip C434. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4Kg8L"&gt;Still, if money isn’t an object for you, there’s a lot to like about the 2-in-1 C436. It has a nice, compact, convertible chassis — unlike many convertible devices, it’s actually light enough (2.4 pounds) to feasibly be used as a tablet for an extended period of time. Inside, it has a comfortable and snappy keyboard and a fingerprint reader in the top corner of the deck. The audio is good: there are two Harman Kardon-certified speakers in the hinge, as well as one on each side of the cover. And it’s powered by a 10th Gen Intel Core i3 that performs quite well under a heavy browsing load. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqzqH2"&gt;The C436 is a pricey Chromebook, but it certainly looks and feels premium. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One Medical charged some patients a fee for the COVID-19 vaccine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="One Medical" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cqs2Ai6rSxk--PnsgNVFir8ZzZY=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69078140/1175073468.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rFEm0j"&gt;Health care company One Medical charged administration fees to some people receiving COVID-19 vaccines in Washington, DC, according to bills reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The company runs the COVID-19 vaccination site at DC’s Entertainment and Sports Arena. People vaccinated at this site were also prompted to sign up for a trial account with One Medical to receive the shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9dqUMY"&gt;One Medical told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in a statement that an error in the billing system led to the charges, that impacted patients “are being notified,” and that they should disregard the bill. “We are monitoring daily to ensure that no new invoices are going out,” One Medical said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7hXGV"&gt;There is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html#:~:text=Vaccine%20doses%20purchased%20with%20US,the%20shot%20to%20someone."&gt;not supposed to be a charge&lt;/a&gt; associated with the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Vaccine providers can get reimbursed by insurance companies or federal programs for the cost of administering the vaccine, but the CDC’s “Frequently Asked Questions” page says that they cannot charge patients that administration fee directly. The DC Department of Health did not respond to a request for comment by publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WzTjUb"&gt;Chris Driver, who lives in Northeast DC, says he was charged by One Medical for both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. He provided his insurance information when he signed in for the first shot but was still billed a total of $56.94 — $16.94 for the first dose, and $40 for the second dose. After receiving the bill for the first dose, Driver tweeted at One Medical on March 18th asking why he was charged. The company responded that it would remove the charge. Over two weeks later, the first charge was still listed on his account, and the second dose fee was added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-75Ffx3Nly0T8_kfEdIwCF3RDw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22421520/image__2_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris Driver’s One Medical bill.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jtexuB"&gt;The charges appear to be inconsistent. Driver’s wife was also vaccinated at the One Medical site, but he says that she did not receive a bill. But another person who got a first dose of the vaccine at the One Medical site was charged $40 by One Medical, according to a bill reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That person — who wished to remain anonymous to discuss personal health information — did not give their insurance information when they got the shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6O8aS"&gt;Health officials around the country are working to improve vaccine equity by removing barriers to sign-ups like complex websites or the perception that there’s a charge associated with the shot. It’s a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-vaccine-disparities/2021/03/25/f9661460-8126-11eb-81db-b02f0398f49a_story.html"&gt;big problem&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, DC, where more affluent areas have far higher vaccination rates than poorer areas and communities of color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxEYUT"&gt;“While I can afford a random $55 medical bill if it came to it, I know that’s not always the case for a whole lot of people in the city,” Driver said in a Twitter direct message. Millions of people say they aren’t going to get vaccinated because they’re worried about costs, according to a &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2021/03/10/covid-vaccine-free-people-not-getting-coronavirus-vaccines-cost-price/"&gt;US Census survey&lt;/a&gt; — even though the vaccines are free. “The federal government is providing the vaccine free of charge to all people living in the United States, regardless of their immigration or health insurance status,” &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html#:~:text=Vaccine%20doses%20purchased%20with%20US,the%20shot%20to%20someone."&gt;the CDC’s website says&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E82knd"&gt;People getting shots in other states have also been stuck with bills. One Houston, Texas-area clinic &lt;a href="https://abc13.com/covid-19-vaccine-administrative-fee-cost-insurance-covid/10420177/"&gt;charged people $30&lt;/a&gt; for each dose of the vaccine, &lt;a href="https://abc13.com/covid-19-vaccine-administrative-fee-cost-insurance-covid/10420177/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;13 Investigates&lt;/em&gt; found&lt;/a&gt;. The Texas Department of State Health Services told &lt;em&gt;13 Investigates&lt;/em&gt; that providers should not be charging people a fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8HJ8Q"&gt;One Medical, which was backed by Alphabet’s venture capital group, GV, provides concierge primary care in over a dozen cities (including Washington, DC) for a $199 annual fee. A handful of states gave the company vaccine doses to administer. An &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299279/one-medical-covid-vaccine-ineligable-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; in February found that it was giving shots to people who were not eligible in California and Washington state. Those states stopped giving vaccines to One Medical after receiving complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3jC7T"&gt;Tech executive Lucy Caldwell tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;she canceled her One Medical membership after a family member was charged for the COVID-19 vaccine at its site in Washington, DC. In an emailed response to her complaint, a representative told her that bills went to patients “by default” if they did not give insurance information. The representative said that charges are removed if the company is notified and that “dozens” of people had that problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e7We3AM76s4UdS71XlXDWVjcXp0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22421492/EyLGmVsWUAE6ULt.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w3cjws"&gt;People vaccinated at the One Medical site were also asked to sign up for a trial membership of its health service. “That pinged as a red flag for me, because I couldn’t believe the city was asking people to sign up for some health care subscription service in order to get the vaccine,” Driver said. “But, I did it because I wanted to get the dang shot.” The free trial sign-up did not ask for billing information, and it said the service would not auto-renew. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3SUA9"&gt;One Medical told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it needed the information in order to create a patient chart for people vaccinated at its site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMqdRG"&gt;Privacy watchdog groups have been worried about private companies using the COVID-19 vaccine administration process to collect personal data on potential customers. Pharmacies like Walgreens require that people create an online account in order to sign up for a vaccine appointment. Consumer rights organizations asked Democratic state attorneys general to investigate how the companies are &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/03/pharmacy-covid-vaccine-customer-data-478977"&gt;using that data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KADrQy"&gt;“We don’t want to see folks in their desire to get vaccinated — and frankly, protect themselves and their loved ones — be in any way taken advantage of,” Andrew Crawford, a lawyer at the Center for Democracy and Technology, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/03/pharmacy-covid-vaccine-customer-data-478977"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOWFLn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fnj8q0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVqC78"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhQ2tg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disco Elysium: The Final Cut on PlayStation has some bugs that need investigating</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sLKnA8nQAwd6SL94C6fKjurHEk0=/125x0:1075x633/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69078080/image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Studio ZA/UM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6NNOqX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium: The Final Cut&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;an upgraded version of one of 2019’s most-acclaimed titles, hit consoles last week with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336035/disco-elysium-the-final-cut-ps5-indie-games"&gt;game’s release on PlayStation 4 and 5&lt;/a&gt;. But fans who have been looking forward to finally trying &lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;/em&gt; on console (including myself) have run into many bugs, and developer ZA/UM still hasn’t released a promised update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQxAXs"&gt;Most of the bugs are small but annoying, like finicky controls or voice lines not triggering when they should. (That last one is particularly frustrating given that every line of dialogue is supposed to be voiced, which is &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/interviews/2021/2/8/22260324/disco-elysium-winter-games-preview-march-2021"&gt;a new change for &lt;em&gt;The Final Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) But players are also reporting a bigger issue: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/mkbyur/fairweather_t500_gauntlets_glitch_ps5/"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAiem4HGDWA"&gt;important&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/miqgak/can_anyone_read_this_and_confirm_i_cannot/"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; can’t be completed at all. (Last night, I ran into one of these bugged quests myself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POspkj"&gt;On March 31st, a day after the game came out, ZA/UM shared &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/studioZAUM/status/1377311097271812103"&gt;what’s coming in the 1.2 update&lt;/a&gt;, including smoother controls and fixes for “various” voiceover problems. But the developers still haven’t said exactly when the patch will release, and we don’t know if it will address everything that’s been reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KRjyf8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Patch 1.2 incoming for all platforms! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;✔️Fixed locations/interactables not working&lt;br&gt;✔️Fixed items not loading&lt;br&gt;✔️Smoother controller &amp;amp; interaction experience&lt;br&gt;✔️Fixed various VO issues&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks everyone for playing and reporting, we couldn’t have done it without you ❤️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/6VLlnlojnu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6VLlnlojnu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Disco Elysium (@studioZAUM) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/studioZAUM/status/1377311097271812103?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IMRjJp"&gt;I’m liking &lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium: The Final Cut&lt;/em&gt; a lot so far, despite the bugs. But if you’ve been thinking about getting it on PlayStation, I’d recommend waiting until ZA/UM irons out the issues before you pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sALnu6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
