    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MOmTPI"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 3, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21459565/samsung-galaxy-tab-active-3-rugged-android-tablet-gloves-lte-wifi-6"&gt;announced globally in September&lt;/a&gt; of last year, is now available in the US starting at $489.99. It’s a rugged 8-inch Android tablet designed primarily for manufacturing, retail, and job sites, with an IP68 water- and dust-resistance rating. Samsung even says it passed tests against 23 environmental conditions, including vibrations and high altitude, to meet the MIL-STD-810 military-grade standard. An IP68 S Pen stylus is included in the box, as is a case that protects against drops up to 1.5 meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgmZgs"&gt;The Tab Active 3’s touchscreen is designed to be used even when wearing work gloves, though not “extremely heavy duty gloves or mittens.” It also offers three physical navigation buttons as well as two programmable buttons that can act as shortcuts to certain apps. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NFEBFe"&gt;Its rear 13-megapixel and front-facing 5-megapixel cameras are optimized for scanning barcodes, and a removable 5,050mAh battery is included. While it will ship with Android 10, Samsung says an upgrade to Android 11 will follow. It will sell with either 64GB or 128GB of internal storage, expandable by microSD card slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W0sL6l"&gt;The Galaxy Tab Active 3 is available now from Samsung’s partner distributors and at &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/business/products/mobile/tablets/galaxy-tab-active/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung.com&lt;/a&gt;. It starts at $489.99 for a Wi-Fi-only version and $589.99 for the LTE model. Samsung says it will remain available for purchase for three years.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix surpasses 200 million subscribers, but has more competition than ever in 2021 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XoTAJRWivu-r9UIG-DlDRWBnggI=/0x2:3600x2402/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68690852/BRIDGERTON_102_Unit_02026R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YCE6Jp"&gt;Netflix has surpassed another major milestone: 203.6 million subscribers around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PaiGke"&gt;The achievement comes after Netflix saw spectacular growth in the first half of 2020. But as it celebrates passing the 200 million subscriber mark, Netflix is also acknowledging that 2021 likely won’t see as many net subscriber gains every quarter, starting in the first quarter of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zfFOB"&gt;Netflix added a total of 8.5 million paid net subscribers in Q4, bringing in a record breaking 37 million paid memberships in 2020. Netflix “achieved $25 billion in annual revenue,” according to the earnings report. Still, Netflix is warning that “we expect paid net adds of 6 million” in Q1 2021 compared to last year’s “15.8 million, which included the impact from the initial COVID-19 lockdowns.” Most importantly, however, Netflix executives are telling shareholders that “we no longer have a need to raise external financing for our day-to-day operations.” Or, more simply put, Netflix no longer needs to borrow substantial amounts of cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTwWZk"&gt;Coming off a less than stellar third quarter in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525428/netflix-earnings-q3-content-subscribers-pandemic-competition"&gt;terms of subscriber gains&lt;/a&gt; (2.2 million added compared to the 6 million expected), the current uptick in growth is a sign of what Netflix can achieve with a string of must-watch content. In the fourth quarter, new shows like &lt;em&gt;The Queen’s Gambit &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Emily in Paris &lt;/em&gt;found a sizable fan base right away. Plus, strong returns for popular shows like &lt;em&gt;The Crown &lt;/em&gt;helped make Netflix a destination streamer, even amid competition from Disney Plus (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188706/the-mandalorian-season-2-episode-8-rescue-star-wars-grogu-skywalker-saga"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s second season&lt;/a&gt; premiered at the end of October) and HBO Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kA4wmC"&gt;More than 62 million households &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1330903941706485761"&gt;watched &lt;em&gt;The Queen’s Gambit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;within the first four weeks of its release, making it the second most watched limited series on Netflix. The only show that beat it was &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt;. Toward the end of the quarter, Netflix also saw another big hit with Shonda Rhimes’ &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;, which Netflix projected would amass &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1346214836544315393"&gt;more than 63 million household views&lt;/a&gt; within its first four weeks. If true, that would make &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton &lt;/em&gt;Netflix’s fifth most-watched series to date. &lt;em&gt;The Crown&lt;/em&gt;’s fourth season also remained one of the most-watched shows for weeks. George Clooney’s &lt;em&gt;The Midnight Sky &lt;/em&gt;is also estimated to reach we 72 million households. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="naYDvP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The current uptick in growth is a sign of what Netflix can achieve with a string of must-watch content&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jYXC9M"&gt;Now, as Netflix moves into 2021, the company is trying to let subscribers know that it has plenty more to come. Just a month after Netflix announced price increases in the United States to its most popular plan, the company also declared it would release at least one movie a week — or about one every five days. That doesn’t account for new shows, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9Y2Bc"&gt;Despite the up-and-up seen in this most recent quarter, there is some hesitancy about the upcoming year. One reason is the pulldown effect. Those who didn’t have Netflix, particularly in the United States, signed up. Co-CEO Reed Hastings &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53435858"&gt;warned at the time&lt;/a&gt; that subscriber gains wouldn’t be as strong because so many people signed up at once — something the company saw happen in its third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2BMtB"&gt;HBO Max and Peacock still hadn’t launched, Disney Plus didn’t have too much original content, and sports were shut down — Netflix became one of the &lt;em&gt;only &lt;/em&gt;things to do. That’s changed. &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22229076/wandavision-marvel-studios-disney-plus-streaming-loki-falcon-winter-solider-black-widow-theatrical"&gt;launched on Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and it will roll right into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Loki&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. WarnerMedia is releasing its big theatrical titles simultaneously on HBO Max the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;same day movies hit theaters&lt;/a&gt;, possibly drawing attention away. Then there’s TikTok and YouTube and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and, hopefully sometime soon, the real world to rejoin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nN9Hng"&gt;&lt;q&gt;By October 2020, 25 percent of general streaming subscribers canceled a service to sign up for another one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vpy4Wl"&gt;“Our strategy is simple: if we can continue to improve Netflix every day to better delight our members, we can be their first choice for streaming entertainment,” Netflix’s letter to shareholders reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRWwGL"&gt;Netflix has a pipeline of big movies and TV shows coming up — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/2/21046412/netflix-witcher-henry-cavill-games-books-fandom-binge-ip-competitors"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;’s return&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Umbrella Academy&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Shadow and Bone &lt;/em&gt;— but it’s getting harder for those titles to stick out simply because they’re on Netflix. People who want Netflix most likely already have Netflix, and the very nature of streaming allows people to cancel one service and jump to another one whenever they want because of easy monthly plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAf0yt"&gt;By October 2020, 25 percent of general streaming subscribers canceled a service to sign up for another one, according to a recent study conducted by Deloitte. It was 17 percent in May, just before HBO Max and Peacock launched. Deloitte also found that 62 percent of people who signed up to watch a specific show canceled once they finished. On Netflix, when that show is dropped at once and people can marathon it, it’s easier to cancel than on Disney Plus, where episodes are released weekly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTJzUV"&gt;Netflix is entering a new year with more high-power competition than ever before and even more uncertainties about what the pandemic will bring. Netflix will likely continue to sit atop the streaming throne, but it’s not going to ever be as easy as it was before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOL3CV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eEbLbH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="osjkbc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmEQkt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLmDQe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6YNlR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="17jNYP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In Search Party, the journey from poster to influencer to monster is a slippery slope</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YvoMMuX3tHK8kZl5cg6V0VM6RSI=/0x1:1920x1281/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68690708/search_party_20.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Warner Media&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7NBjcq"&gt;Much has been made of &lt;em&gt;Search Party &lt;/em&gt;as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21310000/search-party-hbo-max-season-3-review"&gt;a uniquely millennial show&lt;/a&gt;, like it’s a brunch line you can watch other people stand in. It’s true that the &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;aff_sub=verge"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; comedy — initially about finding a missing acquaintance — is absolutely drenched in the iconography of privileged millennials; their world is Instagram-friendly and the characters are all in a self-serving relationship with New York City. But it’s also a show with a uniquely online worldview: where everything, no matter how remote, is happening to you, personally, all the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2bBAIA"&gt;The new season of &lt;em&gt;Search Party&lt;/em&gt;, which premiered last week, starts in a wildly different place than the series began. Unbeknownst to her friends, protagonist Dory Sief (Alia Shawkat) is being held hostage by an obsessed fan, imprisoned in his basement. Her friends, on the other hand, are frankly too busy to notice she’s gone missing. They’re dealing with a rush of newfound notoriety after literally getting away with murder, which happened in the show’s first season. (Later seasons have chronicled that fallout.) The very public trial in season 3 has granted Dory and her friends — her ex Drew (John Reynolds), and her best friends Elliott (John Early) and Portia (Meredith Hagner) — a degree of fame they’ve never had before, and this latest crop of episodes shows them getting used to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzTa1U"&gt;For Portia and Elliott, this notoriety is all they’ve ever wanted, and they happily use it to sell themselves: the former for a role in the film adaptation of their ordeal, the latter as a conservative pundit. Drew, wracked with self-pity, leaves the city in an attempt to live in obscurity. Dory, on the other hand, languishes alone. It’s a pretty good joke to pin a protagonist’s survival on her hopelessly narcissistic friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mdm4bS"&gt;Despite this season leaning more into the show’s thriller aspects, &lt;em&gt;Search Party &lt;/em&gt;is still resolutely a comedy that keeps its knives out for its subjects — the coddled, internet-ruined millennials who love to post. While most of the show’s plot is concerned with IRL actions like going places and talking to people, its allure is closely related to the thrill of posting and the intoxicating effect of being able to mythologize yourself in the eyes of a growing number of followers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsXWOR"&gt;But the posting life is a dangerous one. &lt;em&gt;Search Party&lt;/em&gt;, among other things, is a slow-motion horror story about how the millennial snake eats its own tail. Fundamentally, it’s a show about what happens when we believe the lies we tell about ourselves and then what happens when those same lies expand outward and make contact with an impressionable public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dLZFYb"&gt;In its scenes that take place in the basement of a deranged fan, &lt;em&gt;Search Party&lt;/em&gt; becomes a series about what happens when other people take the lies you told about yourself as gospel truths — about the suffocating vacuum that’s left when you realize people stopped caring about what’s real a long time ago. At the heart of it all is Sief: poster-turned-influencer-turned-monster, acquitted by the public but damned by her own conscience. She’s also imprisoned by the sort of parasocial relationship she first formed with her missing classmate and then encouraged others to build with &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GcMGuV"&gt;It’s worth noting that Dory doesn’t actually post much throughout &lt;em&gt;Search Party&lt;/em&gt;. Even so, the reductive optics of social media are still how she and her friends interact with the world: everything is a place to be seen or not be seen; there are names to tag along with the constant negotiation between their occupations and their ambitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6FAmX"&gt;None of this is terribly different from the way upwardly mobile young people have navigated New York City in popular culture — you could say similar things about &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City &lt;/em&gt;— but &lt;em&gt;Search Party&lt;/em&gt; focuses its satire on how &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt; millennial life has proven that a lifestyle of consumption can quickly become consumed itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQQxdS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Raise your hand if a gaming PC is currently heating your home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KQbNcT761etLoKuexSqkmWdU4HY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68690601/shollister_201114_4303_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NP4cWx"&gt;A few weeks ago, our furnace (technically a ductless heat pump) stopped working at the worst possible time of the year. But at least one room stays nice and toasty all winter long — thanks to my gaming PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJ6bio"&gt;Now, &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; is reporting this might actually be a trend: some bitcoin miners and gamers &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/computer-videogame-bitcoin-mining-heat-11611072131?st=5ysnpdv16mek0x6&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;are warming their rooms, growing tomatoes, and even heating a chicken coop&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sY6RuP"&gt;It made me wonder: how many &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers are doing the same? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pgQMQy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="poll:10292262"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FaNSM7"&gt;Me, I keep my PC running all night long, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161131/folding-home-volunteers-researchers-coronavirus"&gt;folding proteins to help study COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, which I highly recommend. (I just crossed &lt;a href="https://stats.foldingathome.org/donor/StarFire2258"&gt;175 million points&lt;/a&gt; this week.) But I have to admit the room hasn’t been as warm since I swapped my own GeForce GTX 1080 back in. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;impossible-to-find&lt;/a&gt; AMD Radeon RX 6800 definitely put out more heat, and we actually had to crack a window when I had an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;Nvidia RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt; folding those proteins. I can’t speak for every model, but the Founder’s Edition runs &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bcvaj9"&gt;Here’s hoping Mitsubishi delivers a new control board for my heat pump soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECpgjk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Faraday Future’s best shot at redemption may be a SPAC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NBPt5SDwg8ofBgQg2h9qg6pXZI4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68690385/faraday_future_ff91_5214.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fYH40X"&gt;Despite a whirlwind of electric vehicle SPAC mergers in the last few months, there’s still one startup flying solo that’s arguably the best-positioned. Yes, Faraday Future is still on the market — though maybe not for long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMnv2N"&gt;Sure, Faraday Future is distressed and its electric SUV is outrageous, but it developed valid technology over the last few years that is further along than what some competitors have. It will take a lot of money to get that vehicle over the proverbial finish line. Lucky for Faraday Future, though, money is now incredibly easy to come by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQBMR7"&gt;In the last seven months alone, a half-dozen startups have gone public or announced plans to go public by merging with SPACs, or special-purpose acquisition companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;publicly traded investment funds that only exist to acquire other companies&lt;/a&gt;. Faraday Future has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-faraday-m-a-spac-idUSKBN26Q36M"&gt;said since October&lt;/a&gt; that it’s looking to go public by merging with a SPAC, and &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-10/faraday-future-is-said-in-talks-to-go-public-via-spac-merger?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_content=deals&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-deals&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported on January 10th&lt;/a&gt; that the startup is in talks with one run by a New York City real estate investor. Faraday Future also hired its first chief financial officer in three years, in a potential nod to there finally being some serious work to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="68JpaE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SPACs have made money incredibly easy to come by&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pIzl4I"&gt;If Faraday Future doesn’t pull off a SPAC merger, it won’t be for lack of trying. The startup has entertained investors looking to take companies public since the beginning of the SPAC boom last June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkQ4Hm"&gt;One group toured Faraday Future’s idle factory in Hanford, California, on June 26th, according to emails obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That group then immediately departed from the local airport for Jackson, Wyoming, according to the emails and flight records. The Jackson area is home to investor Daniel Hennessy’s SPAC, which eventually merged with rival startup Canoo. Faraday Future brought another unidentified investor group through the factory in September, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned. (Emails to Nicholas Petruska, the chief financial officer of Hennessy’s SPAC, were not returned. Faraday Future did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4xP7wW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tesla’s success helped aim a fire hose of cash at EV startups in 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22194330/ev-startups-tesla-success-2020-electric-vehicles-spac-public"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hwrUea"&gt;But now there’s a CFO in place, and negotiations are reportedly happening. Yes, Faraday Future has lost most of the people who worked on its electric SUV, the FF91. And yes, it has burned through $2 billion to date. But this is the best chance the startup has had to bring in outside help since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/31/18162827/faraday-future-evergrande-settlement-restructuring-china-ev-investor"&gt;a deal with a Chinese conglomerate Evergrande fell apart in spectacular fashion&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6Nhxc"&gt;It may be hard to believe Faraday Future could go public considering the troubles it’s had over the last four years — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18088438/faraday-future-electric-cars-ev-news-layoffs-bankruptcy"&gt;which &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has documented extensively&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s also kind of easy to believe the company will make that leap given the momentum these mergers have created. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="SuXiFs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Faraday Future has been hosting SPAC groups since last June&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gejrgf"&gt;That movement — sparked by Tesla’s success in 2020 but supercharged by the rise of retail traders who trade stocks on Robinhood and speculate on Reddit — has already turned startups on the brink into companies with valuations of a billion dollars or more, despite &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/688d8472-c404-42d6-88b7-fbd475e50f7c"&gt;many of them not making any money yet&lt;/a&gt;. And some of those that &lt;em&gt;weren’t&lt;/em&gt; headed for collapse are still going public with unproven technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqFLhp"&gt;You’d be hard-pressed to find a company more on the brink than Faraday Future. As for the tech, Faraday Future’s battery pack, motors, and inverter were all designed by the widely respected team that created the General Motors EV-1, the first attempted mass-market electric car. The company has said its SUV is essentially 85 percent complete, meaning it’s ahead of peers like Fisker and Lordstown Motors, which have only recently started testing their first prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWH2Rg"&gt;If there is a knock on the technology Faraday Future has created since its inception in 2014, it’s that employees were given too much freedom to work since founder Jia Yueting — who is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/8/18130543/faraday-future-jia-yueting-leeco-leshi-debt-china"&gt;prone to lighting money on fire&lt;/a&gt; — set them all toward the goal of creating a vehicle that costs close to $200,000. But the pack and the motor layout are scalable, meaning smaller versions that cost less are possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Btanyi"&gt;In fact, Faraday Future was one of the first EV companies to design one of these modular so-called “skateboard” platforms, where all the tech that’s crucial to powering an EV is integrated into the base of the car and can fit differently sized vehicles. It’s just never had the chance to execute on the idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lB6krQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Faraday’s tech is further along than that of many rival EV startups&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8oXCf2"&gt;None of this guarantees Faraday Future will succeed. Selling an extremely expensive SUV that also costs a lot to manufacture will make it hard to turn a profit — even in China, where the startup also wants to operate. By the company’s own admission, it still needs some $850 million &lt;em&gt;just to put the vehicle into production&lt;/em&gt;. It has a long way to go to generate revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tPqi8"&gt;That may not matter so much to investors who would rather tap the SPAC boom while there’s still money to be made, though. There’s value in Faraday Future’s tech (and the patent portfolio behind it), and business plans can always be adjusted. To wit, the new chairman of Canoo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;has refocused the company on selling its technology to — and partnering with — other businesses&lt;/a&gt; instead of jumping too deep into passenger vehicles. For Faraday Future, like these other companies, merging with a SPAC is the quickest path to fresh funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkmIca"&gt;What could still hold Faraday Future back is its most persistent obstacle: Jia himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnB4HF"&gt;The startup’s new CEO has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/10/30/20879811/faraday-future-ceo-founder-jia-yueting-carsten-breitfeld-bankruptcy"&gt;worked to box in the tycoon founder since taking the helm in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, including setting up a management committee that is now in charge of making decisions. This effort was aided by Jia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21268043/court-jia-yueting-faraday-future-bankruptcy-plan"&gt;declaring personal bankruptcy to settle some $3 billion in debt he still owes in China&lt;/a&gt;. The agreement he ultimately came to was to give each of those creditors a slice of a new trust that holds his controlling shares of Faraday Future, simultaneously offering restitution while also giving up “control” over the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sJdFgN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Faraday Future’s still haunted by the past of its billionaire founder","url":"https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/10/30/20879811/faraday-future-ceo-founder-jia-yueting-carsten-breitfeld-bankruptcy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gBhEVr"&gt;But over the years, Jia has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;filled Faraday Future’s ranks with people loyal to him&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom are either former employees of his previous company, tech conglomerate LeEco, or family members. And according to his bankruptcy filings, his nephew still holds veto power over the management committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="42PGyc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If Faraday Future goes public, what happens to its founder?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UHJcW2"&gt;Jia has maintained that he wants to return to China, and a successful public listing that helps make his creditors somewhat whole could help make that happen. After all, he only turned up in the US a few years ago after being named to a debtor blacklist there. Whether the autocratic government would welcome him back, or what would happen when he got there, is hard to say. The &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-12-22/jack-ma-s-empire-in-crisis-after-china-halts-ant-group-ipo"&gt;recent crackdown on Alibaba’s Jack Ma&lt;/a&gt;, a far more visible and successful businessman, doesn’t particularly bode well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5LoKOr"&gt;If Faraday Future fails to merge with the real estate SPAC, there are plenty of others eager to dole out cash. A SPAC started by investment fund Churchill Capital is currently in talks with Saudi-backed EV startup Lucid Motors, but &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/lucid-motors-said-to-be-in-talks-to-list-via-michael-klein-spac?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;previously targeted DirecTV&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s playing the field. If Lucid Motors decides to stay private or follow the traditional IPO route, maybe that SPAC will turn its attention to Faraday Future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCU6ey"&gt;Perhaps the most poetic, though, would be one that &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/k8n902/ccac_rumors_with_ev_company/"&gt;Reddit and Twitter users&lt;/a&gt; have baselessly speculated on: the SPAC created by CITIC Capital, the asset management arm of the massive state-owned investment company CITIC Group. What better way for Jia to make good with the Chinese government than to give it a direct interest in Faraday Future’s success?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DC is relaunching its mobile app to focus on comics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="batman and superman" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/07m68H9mf7IBY4suQJ_Gfsjpegc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68690316/batman_superman-dc-comics.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: DC Comics&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="diWI9c"&gt;DC is shaking up its comics app on January 21st and relaunching it as DC Universe Infinite. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/19/17589522/dc-universe-titans-streaming-service-san-diego-comic-con-2018"&gt;original DC Universe&lt;/a&gt; featured television shows and comics, but now that DC shows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21369285/dc-universe-original-shows-hbo-max-changes-streaming-lineup"&gt;have moved to HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, the company has decided to refocus the app on comics and the “fan community,” while keeping the same $7.99-a-month price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjiKI8"&gt;DC Universe Infinite will have DC’s catalog and early access to comics six months after they’re released physically in stores. Additionally, DC says the comic reader in its app has been improved, and users will have more options to curate custom lists of titles. The app will also have a customizable icon and a widget for iOS 14 so you can get back into whatever you were reading faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7O979L"&gt;In terms of features, DC Universe Infinite is most similar to &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/unlimited"&gt;Marvel Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;, which is Marvel’s $9.99-a-month take on an exclusive comics service. Infinite undercuts Marvel by keeping its cost at $7.99 a month (or $74.99 a year), and it might help to make it popular as WarnerMedia rolls out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202992/dc-films-multiverse-batman-wonder-woman-aquaman-hbo-max-dceu-marvel-disney-plus"&gt;its plans for the DC universe(s) in film and TV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jh4e56"&gt;As extended universes expand, comic apps are as much for comic book fans as they are for anyone trying to appreciate all of the lore that’s layered into each new superhero outing. Now that HBO Max is the home for DC superheroes in film and TV, and DC Universe Infinite for comics, WarnerMedia’s plans are starting to make more sense. Whether fans will be willing to pay a combined $22 a month for both services will be the real test.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We don’t object to this Reddit bot that turns arguments into Ace Attorney videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image from the bot’s video, displaying an argument about CDPR" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PSMIcLXRfa9pH6hqSdWNiqHumc4=/0x0:2798x1865/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68690290/Screen_Shot_2021_01_19_at_9.40.19_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OmjnmI"&gt;Someone had to do it: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/objection-bot/"&gt;there’s now a bot&lt;/a&gt; that turns Reddit arguments into scenes from &lt;em&gt;Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt;, complete with music and the iconic “OBJECTION!” intercuts. It’s from those moments that it draws its name: objection-bot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1lRhm"&gt;Users can summon the bot by typing “!objection-bot” under a thread that would work as an Ace Attorney courtroom scene, and the bot will generate a video based on the posts. It feels a little like shouting “worldstar!” but on Reddit. You can see &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/kz9kh6/i_made_a_bot_that_turns_reddit_arguments_into_ace/gjmp6ds?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;an excellent &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;-related example&lt;/a&gt; below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="68QFn6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://streamable.com/o/fdxzag" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V6e5BY"&gt;The genius behind the bot &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/kz9kh6/i_made_a_bot_that_turns_reddit_arguments_into_ace/"&gt;is Reddit user oppai_suika&lt;/a&gt;, who was kind enough to also post the source code. They also note &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/kz9kh6/i_made_a_bot_that_turns_reddit_arguments_into_ace/gjmp6ds?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;in a comment&lt;/a&gt; that the number one and two fighters get assigned as Phoenix and Edgeworth, respectively, and everyone else is assigned a character randomly. Other characters from the series show up, too, egging on the other posters or coming in with takes too hot to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbRk4V"&gt;The first post from the bot was four days ago, but it’s been busy since then. There’s already a dedicated subreddit, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Objectionbotbattles/"&gt;r/Objectionbotbattles&lt;/a&gt;, for users to post the best of the bot’s results. One that had me laughing out loud &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Objectionbotbattles/comments/kzyk9u/its_all_going_off_in_the_courtroom_when_people/"&gt;re-creates the experience of being stuck in a reply-all email chain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fzHL0d"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created='"2021-01-19T19:18:54.667944+00:00"'&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Objectionbotbattles/comments/kzyk9u/its_all_going_off_in_the_courtroom_when_people/?ref_source=embed&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;It's all going off in the courtroom when people keep using reply all!&lt;/a&gt; from
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Objectionbotbattles/"&gt;Objectionbotbattles&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;script async="" src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="85H3Zp"&gt;The bot only supports certain subreddits, but it includes &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the important ones: r/politicalcompassmemes, r/vegan, r/MechanicalKeyboards, and r/JoeRogan. (In all seriousness, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/objection-bot/comments/kz97be/these_are_the_subreddits_i_support_at_the_moment/"&gt;a reasonably long list&lt;/a&gt;.) Obviously, it also supports r/aceattorney, and it’s been called upon to dramatize &lt;a href="https://streamable.com/7u7enj"&gt;arguments about its source material&lt;/a&gt; as well (&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AceAttorney/comments/kxaber/is_it_worth_to_finish_the_game/gjui9rf/?context=3"&gt;based on this thread&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlW01z"&gt;Sometimes Reddit arguments can feel like courtroom dramas, with people squabbling over technicalities, intent, and the definitions of words. Now, that experience has been digitized with some of our favorite video game attorneys, and it is truly glorious.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic pledges $20 million for Fortnite esports in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fortnite World Cup Finals - Final Round" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/64K2F2CVZd5wFQaacAHvdMqil6I=/1x0:3961x2640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68690179/1164792889.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="akcYsY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic says that, for 2021, the game’s competitive scene will have a prize pool of $20 million. That’s a step up from last year’s total of $17 million — though it’s not as massive as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/29/8934329/fortnite-world-cup-finals-epic-games-esports-ninja-tfue-bugha-marshmello"&gt;the 2019 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, where $30 million was on the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1j3tE3"&gt;The news comes as Epic provided details on the latest season of the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Champion Series, the game’s highest level of competition. The developer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22152744/epic-fortnite-world-cup-2021-canceled-fncs"&gt;previously said that all competitions would take place online&lt;/a&gt;, and today, it revealed more details about the schedule: qualifiers will kick off on February 4th, with the finals starting on March 12th. In a nod to the global nature of the game, there will also be three new, separate broadcasts with commentary in French, German, and Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rN7fjO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our overall goal is to create better consistency.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UdDuDn"&gt;There are a number of other format and scoring changes; you can check &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/en-US/news/2021-and-chapter-2-season-5-fncs-details"&gt;Epic’s blog post&lt;/a&gt; for the full rundown. “Our overall goal is to create better consistency throughout the year and tie the 2021 seasons together for a more cohesive experience,” Epic says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Y3sAkk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Fortnite World Cup Finals were a victory lap for Epic Games","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/29/8934329/fortnite-world-cup-finals-epic-games-esports-ninja-tfue-bugha-marshmello"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="d8Kwxc"&gt;As for the prize pool, there will be four seasons of the FNCS in 2021, with a total of $3 million in prize money for each. But Epic says there are additional tournaments on the way. “We also have plans for mid and end of year competitions where we will bring together the top performing FNCS players in each region in multiple competitive formats,” the developer explains. The remaining $8 million will serve as the prize money for these yet-to-be-determined tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wF0rQx"&gt;Meanwhile, earlier today, Epic revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;a new partnership&lt;/a&gt; that will see 23 different professional soccer teams featured in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dCmX19"&gt;Bats are elusive little creatures, which makes them the perfect subjects for scientists to try out new animal tracking systems. This is great news for me specifically, because I love both bats &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; seeing images of animals with goofy little trackers on them. How can you look at &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/seals-high-tech-hats-are-collecting-climate-data-antarctic-180973709/"&gt;these seals with ridiculous antenna hats&lt;/a&gt; and not laugh at least a little?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9Alnc"&gt;One of the latest innovations in tracking wearables is the &lt;a href="https://dulog.net/"&gt;dulog&lt;/a&gt; system, a wireless sensor network built by biologist Simon Ripperger and engineer Niklas Duda, which was put to the test in several bat-tracking studies over the past few years. Now that the dulog has proven its mettle with bats, which are tiny, nocturnal, and generally tough to observe, the pair believe it could be useful in monitoring all kinds of animals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXZ5Bg"&gt;“If your project can succeed with bats, it can probably work with most species,” says Ripperger in &lt;a href="https://www.silabs.com/community/blog.entry.html/2021/01/19/iot_heroes_createwirelessnetworktostudybats-yK5y"&gt;a recent Silicon Labs blog post&lt;/a&gt;. When he first got started in the bat-tracking business, he saw that his adviser was “essentially running behind bats, chasing them with an antenna.” I will be holding that image in my mind for a while, but Ripperger and Duda think the dulog’s tiny sensors will make animal studies easier — less chasing required. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A bat with reddish fur sits on a tree branch with a small sensor on its back." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OtZa2ot7_G7_6NiRJNo4wjNVEPM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22244912/Nyctalus_noctula__adult_Berlin___Kopie.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tiny common noctule bat wearing the latest in sensor fashion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T0Y5QU"&gt;The data collected with dulog tags can be downloaded remotely, meaning after the initial attachment, scientists don’t have to wrangle animals to retrieve data from their tags. They’re also smaller and lighter than current GPS tracking systems that enable remote downloads — the bat pictured above would fit in the palm of your hand, and the sensor weighs less than a gram. What’s most exciting to Ripperger is that the tags “talk to each other,” meaning they can be used to track the social behavior of tagged animals based on their proximity to each other over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmvMIl"&gt;So far, the dulog system has been used in studies that have produced some delightful findings: &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2018.0884"&gt;mother bats guide their pups&lt;/a&gt; from roost to roost, formerly captive bats maintain their social relationships &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982219313648"&gt;when released in the wild&lt;/a&gt;, and bats exhibit &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/31/6/1296/5937165"&gt;“social distancing” behavior&lt;/a&gt; when they’re sick. After these bat-based successes, Ripperger and Duda hope to soon start selling the system to researchers for use with other animals, both large and small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qeZQ8t"&gt;In terms of possible applications for the system, “the sky is the limit,” says Ripperger. I am not involved in any important animal research, but personally I would love to hook a tag to my dog to keep tabs on her general mischief. I imagine they would also be helpful for keeping track of which squirrels are the biggest offenders in eating my bird seed. For now, they’re not available for direct order, so I will leave the science to the scientists and continue to enjoy pictures of animals with backpacks and hats. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some M1 Mac users reporting screensaver takeover bug</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T7vtFS1TG21JsZ2cPzfJfdtmqSI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68689511/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zx4UVA"&gt;I picked up a new MacBook Air with Apple’s M1 chip, and I’ve absolutely loved it so far. It’s really speedy and the battery is fantastic. But I’ve been dealing with one nagging issue. Every once in a while, for reasons that I haven’t been able to figure out, a screensaver will suddenly take over the entire computer — despite the fact that I never use a screensaver. And frustratingly, the screensaver renders my laptop inoperable until I completely close the screen and reopen it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cf8SGP"&gt;It seems I’m not the only one seeing this bug, according to this &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/18/m1-macs-fast-user-switching-screensaver-bug/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt;. Others have shared similar issues with M1-equipped MacBook Airs, Pros, and Minis on &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/screensaver-activates-randomly-m1-air.2270873/?post=29296369#post-29296369"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’ &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-is-going-on-here-screensaver-like-animation-spontaneously-appears-video.2273013/?post=29338930#post-29338930"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt;, Reddit (in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/kj4ova/big_sur_screensaver_bug/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/k3mmwt/macbook_air_m1_2020_display_issue_screen_show_sup/"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/k18gih/has_anyone_ever_seen_this_it_just_recently/"&gt;threads&lt;/a&gt;), and Apple’s &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252083925?page=1"&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252087996"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt;. And one user on &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; said they’ve &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-m1-macs-affected-by-fast-user-switching-screensaver-bug.2280806/?post=29517694#post-29517694"&gt;seen the bug&lt;/a&gt; on their 16-inch MacBook Pro, which has an Intel chip, so perhaps this is a problem with macOS Big Sur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dd35WL"&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/N3CoMocJ7Rw"&gt;a video of the bug&lt;/a&gt;, shared by &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/screensaver-activates-randomly-m1-air.2270873/?post=29307255#post-29307255"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; forum member dawideksl&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nxY9gQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N3CoMocJ7Rw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B36v0c"&gt;Many people reporting the issue in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/kj4ova/big_sur_screensaver_bug/"&gt;this Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt; say they have multiple accounts on the same computer. And for what it’s worth, I’ve set up two accounts on my MacBook Air. One user on Apple’s &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252087996?answerId=254255624022#254255624022"&gt;support forums&lt;/a&gt; disabled Fast User Switching and said they weren’t seeing the screensaver, so perhaps that’s a workaround until Apple addresses the bug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9p3vO"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJ350W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
