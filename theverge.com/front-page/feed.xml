    <title>Xbox Game Pass aims for sports fans with NBA 2K21, Madden NFL 21, NHL 21, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KTFzsjO6SPQRvh8auNXiOpiTggM=/0x0:1296x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68903351/TW_Available_Today_Coming_Soon_templates_3.3.2021_6_JPG.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mq96ST"&gt;Microsoft is adding four sports games to Xbox Game Pass in March and April. &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 21&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/03/coming-soon-xbox-game-pass-march-wave-1-2021/"&gt;arrives today&lt;/a&gt; as part of EA Play for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, and &lt;em&gt;Football Manager 2021&lt;/em&gt; will arrive tomorrow for both Xbox consoles and PC. &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K1&lt;/em&gt; will also launch on Xbox Game Pass tomorrow and will be available on xCloud game streaming, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAED9y"&gt;The fourth and final sports addition will be &lt;em&gt;NHL 21&lt;/em&gt; in April, arriving for Xbox console owners with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. Sports games aren’t the only new additions this month, though. &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons&lt;/em&gt; is coming in March for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1h0E44"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Game Pass briefly explained: console, PC, xCloud streaming and more ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437529/xbox-game-pass-versions-tier-ultimate-pc-console-explainer"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6IgXi2"&gt;Microsoft offers three different versions of Xbox Game Pass, and each will provide different levels of access to games. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is the highest tier at $14.99 per month, offering access to EA Play games and xCloud game streaming. Xbox Game Pass itself is $9.99 per month, and the PC version is also $9.99 per month. We’ve got a full and detailed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437529/xbox-game-pass-versions-tier-ultimate-pc-console-explainer"&gt;breakdown of all the differences right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LTHmFD"&gt;As always, there are some games leaving Xbox Game Pass this month. The following will disappear on March 15th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LTlLwS"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Alvastia Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; (console and PC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yEMc6G"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Astrologaster &lt;/em&gt;(PC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aVfuwt"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night&lt;/em&gt; (console and PC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="g63ZD4"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Kona &lt;/em&gt;(console)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YlNw7z"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&lt;/em&gt; (console)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T promised a TV revolution — instead, we got a giant mess</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nQpu1rRUe2zP1hR9GfGXyQsv1ns=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68903343/acastro_180613_1777_at_t_timewarner_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Th5FFb"&gt;Last week, AT&amp;amp;T announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301840/att-tpg-directv-tv-uverse-new-company-announced"&gt;it would be spinning off its TV business&lt;/a&gt; — including DirecTV, AT&amp;amp;T TV, and U-verse — in a deal it claimed would greatly benefit the company’s customers, employees, and shareholders. The deal provides AT&amp;amp;T with a $7.8 billion cash infusion to pay down debt and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;recent wireless spectrum purchases&lt;/a&gt;, and a 70 percent stake in the “new” DirecTV. But it also values the entire operation at around $16.25 billion, a massive loss from the $67 billion AT&amp;amp;T paid just a few years earlier for just DirecTV alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boc8Qv"&gt;“It’s fair to say that some aspects of the transaction have not played out as we had planned,” AT&amp;amp;T said of the deal, trying to put a good face on a more than $50 billion loss, “such as pay TV households in the US declining at a faster pace across the industry than anticipated when we announced the deal back in 2014.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PX1EfR"&gt;It’s the latest chapter in AT&amp;amp;T’s long journey to transform from a boring old telecom into a dominant player in new media. Six years, 54,858 layoffs, two mergers, and nearly $175 billion later, AT&amp;amp;T is only marginally closer to streaming TV dominance. Instead, customers and employees are footing the bill for their bad decisions in the form of TV rate hikes and layoffs that show no sign of slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EwnpyX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“One of the worst acquisitions of all time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DQitpu"&gt;Wall Street telecom analyst Craig Moffett surveyed the wreckage in a research note to investors, in which he noted the deal does little to tackle $157 billion in remaining AT&amp;amp;T debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLHBiF"&gt;“AT&amp;amp;T’s DirecTV is inarguably one of the worst acquisitions of all time,” Moffett said. “They bought it for $67 billion in 2013. Even at the overly-generous valuation reported last night, they are exiting at a price 76% below what they paid for it just seven years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Shvx09"&gt;It wasn’t supposed to be this way. AT&amp;amp;T executives once dreamed of creating an online video juggernaut that could rival the power of Google and Facebook in the online advertising space, using must-watch HBO content — and AT&amp;amp;T’s wireless network — as the glue holding the effort together. That dream fueled the &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/att_to_acquire_directv.html"&gt;DirecTV acquisition in 2014&lt;/a&gt; (which executives promised would deliver “enhanced innovation” and “significant benefits for consumers”) as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/15/17468612/att-time-warner-acquisition-court-decision"&gt;the Time Warner acquisition in 2018&lt;/a&gt; (which &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/att_to_acquire_time_warner.html"&gt;we were told&lt;/a&gt; would usher forth the “next wave of innovation in converging media and communications”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="UNuQK2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;54,858 employees laid off since 2017&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AyRs8k"&gt;But for AT&amp;amp;T, a company built on the back of the far &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;less competitive and innovative US broadband sector&lt;/a&gt;, that dream proved hard to realize. First, AT&amp;amp;T unveiled so many discordant TV brands across both its traditional cable and streaming platforms, even &lt;a href="https://www.cordcuttersnews.com/att-is-confusing-att-tv-with-att-tv-now-creating-mass-confusion/"&gt;the company’s own employees got confused&lt;/a&gt;. The company then attempted to dig out from under its massive merger debt load by imposing &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/11/att-raises-directv-prices-again-amid-customer-losses-and-possible-sale/#:~:text=AT%26T%20has%20announced%20another%20round,a%20notice%20on%20its%20website."&gt;repeated price increases&lt;/a&gt; on subscribers already tired from years of relentless rate hikes. A discounted $15-per-month streaming TV offering, used to &lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/19/media/att-watch-streaming-service/index.html"&gt;lure regulators into approving the Time Warner merger&lt;/a&gt;, quickly &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90521422/att-is-killing-its-cheap-tv-bundle-for-cord-cutters"&gt;disappeared&lt;/a&gt; as soon as the merger ink had dried. AT&amp;amp;T’s customers, paying an average of &lt;a href="https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2020/q3-2020/3Q20_Trending_Schedule.pdf"&gt;$130.55&lt;/a&gt; per month for television, quickly revolted. As a result, AT&amp;amp;T has lost 8 million pay TV subscribers in just the last four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Bgdrb"&gt;But the casualties from AT&amp;amp;T’s merger go well beyond the financial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUp0WI"&gt;As streaming shifted from pesky upstart to the mainstream, younger consumers began viewing traditional satellite television as an antiquated relic of a bygone era. As a result, companies like Dish Network and DirecTV were &lt;a href="https://www.leichtmanresearch.com/major-pay-tv-providers-lost-about-1570000-subscribers-in-2q-2020/"&gt;particularly hard hit&lt;/a&gt; by the cord-cutting revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jejPir"&gt;Yet, in 2017, company executives made repeated television appearances promising that if the Trump administration passed its tax relief plan, the company would respond with billions in investment and thousands of “&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/04/att-ceo-says-a-corporate-tax-cut-would-mean-thousands-more-jobs-for-hard-hat-workers.html"&gt;high-paying, really good jobs with great benefits&lt;/a&gt;.” Similar promises were made by both AT&amp;amp;T and &lt;a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/cwa-fighting-maintain-good-jobs-in-att-time-warner-merger"&gt;unions&lt;/a&gt; ahead of each merger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOmVkY"&gt;After receiving an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/at-t-got-a-giant-tax-cut-but-has-laid-off-thousands-union-says/"&gt;$42 billion&lt;/a&gt; in tax cuts from the Trump administration, the company has instead laid off an estimated &lt;a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/instead-of-cutting-jobs-att-must-lead-recovery"&gt;54,858 employees since 2017&lt;/a&gt;. AT&amp;amp;T imposed additional layoffs at Time Warner properties, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/08/dc-comics-dc-universe-hit-layoffs-warnermedia-1203009714/"&gt;including HBO and DC&lt;/a&gt;, and shuttered businesses like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18701446/dc-comics-vertigo-shutting-down-reorganization-dc-kids-black-label"&gt;DC’s popular Vertigo label&lt;/a&gt; in a desperate bid to cut costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dg36aa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A sprawling collection of businesses battling well-funded competitors”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gcfCnf"&gt;Elsewhere, AT&amp;amp;T remained under steady fire for failing to upgrade its aging DSL lines to fiber, a problem particularly pronounced in &lt;a href="https://www.digitalinclusion.org/blog/2019/08/06/atts-digital-redlining-of-dallas-new-research-by-dr-brian-whitacre/"&gt;marginalized neighborhoods&lt;/a&gt;. Attention and resources that may have helped address the country’s stubborn digital divide were instead funneled into an aggressive proposal designed largely to appease shareholders, consumer groups say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldgkSo"&gt;“[Former AT&amp;amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson] was getting a ton of pressure to generate cash flow to support the dividend, but also pressure to increase the stock price,” S. Derek Turner, Research Director at consumer group Free Press, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Buying DirecTV on credit did that. The deal benefited whomever held AT&amp;amp;T’s stock as a dividend source. The customers and potential customers in AT&amp;amp;T service areas didn’t benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDDqR7"&gt;But even some investors grew angry with AT&amp;amp;T’s “growth for growth’s sake” strategy. Activist investors at Elliott Management &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190909005482/en/Elliott-Management-Sends-Letter-to-Board-of-Directors-of-ATT"&gt;penned a letter to AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; in late 2019 complaining the company had spent nearly $200 billion to become “a sprawling collection of businesses battling well-funded competitors,” instead of focusing on core competencies like wireless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYppfi"&gt;The end result of AT&amp;amp;T’s ambition wasn’t entirely fruitless: HBO Max, the latest in a long line of attempted streaming TV brand refreshes, could still challenge other rising streaming services like Disney Plus or Comcast’s Peacock. But however successful HBO Max winds up being, it’s a product that shouldn’t have cost $200 billion and 55,000 jobs to create. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUsMhi"&gt;Ironically, AT&amp;amp;T’s failure comes despite the fact that it spent the better part of a decade lobbying to tilt the regulatory playing field in its favor, culminating in the company’s successful 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687903/net-neutrality-was-repealed-a-year-ago-whats-happened-since"&gt;assault on net neutrality and the Federal Communications Commission’s consumer protection authority&lt;/a&gt;. But even abusing broadband usage caps to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/2/21277402/hbo-max-att-data-caps-netflix-disney-plus-streaming-services-net-neutrality#:~:text=AT%26T%20later%20confirmed%20to%20The,data%20caps%20on%20unlimited%20plans."&gt;give itself a tactical advantage&lt;/a&gt; over streaming competitors didn’t help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8y0QYB"&gt;Ultimately, no amount of money or political power could buy the TV dominance the company’s executives envisioned. And as AT&amp;amp;T struggles to offload the mammoth debt load created by its ambition, employees and customers continue to foot the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

You can find more information on the retailer's restock &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22303809/sony-ps5-playstation-5-console-restock-amazon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPqddq"&gt;Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; is available now. Due to the pandemic and high demand for the PS5, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550842/sony-playstation-5-ps5-launch-day-in-store-purchases"&gt;retailers such as Best Buy and Target will only sell the console online&lt;/a&gt; for the foreseeable future. So, if you were planning to camp outside your local Target hoping to buy the console today, there will be no walk-in purchases available this year. But, you can order one online and request an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="7M35PW"&gt;If you are torn between which PS5 console to buy, no need to worry. The biggest difference to note is that the PS5 Digital Edition is smaller than the PS5 standard, costs $399, and it does not include a Blu-ray disc drive. The PS5 standard is $100 more, is a bit bulkier than the digital edition, and includes a disc drive, allowing you to play game discs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon has both PS5 consoles in stock again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUblCW1pGy_nP4Vr1Bj7os57L70=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68903221/vpavic_4278_20201030_0281.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TjxoNx"&gt;Sony’s latest gaming console, the PS5, is one of many gaming gadgets that are hard to find in stock right now due to mostly online-only sales. If you are trying to get your hands on one, Amazon has restocked both the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FC6MR62?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FC5L3RG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; consoles right now, while supplies last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YgwrHO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Rd70W"&gt;Once you obtain your PS5, there are a few items you’re going to want to pick up for your console. Some of the most popular PS5 exclusives right now include &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Demons-Souls-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC5TTBF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Bluepoint Games. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZS80PC2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was a popular game in 2020; it is backwards compatible and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;PS5 port is coming on June 10th&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the game now, you’ll get a free next-gen upgrade when that version is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Uls0S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="bfKdpX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546364"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QXm507"&gt;I strongly suggest buying &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a one-year membership to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt;, as the perks of having a subscription are great for PS5 users. Most notably, it nets you access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, which is a digital library of some of the most popular first- and third-party titles released on the PS4 such as &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Remastered. &lt;/em&gt;I also advise picking up &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723570939328512577" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an extra DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ll53Kj"&gt;If you want to expand your SSD storage, sadly, there is no way to do that just yet. But Sony is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;reportedly expanding the options for more SSD storage&lt;/a&gt; sometime this summer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Western Digital’s fast 1TB portable SSD costs less than usual today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SicwSRVVJZaumAFak9zFWIBNMmc=/0x0:4128x2752/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68903201/en_us_WD_MyPassportSSD_ProdIMG_Computer_Plugin_HR.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Western Digital&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fM9jeJ"&gt;If you need compact external storage that can connect to game consoles, PCs, phones, and other devices, there are some options you can get a deal on today. One of them is Western Digital’s latest 1TB My Passport model, available at Best Buy and Amazon. This capacity usually costs $190, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733858161940312048" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get it for as low as $140&lt;/a&gt;. You can also save on Crucial’s X8 1TB USB-C SSD, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5TK4F/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which is $125 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (usually $140). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5vvPY"&gt;For context, Western Digital and Crucial each claim up to 1,050MB/s read speeds, but only Western Digital is public with its write speeds of 1,000MB/s. Both of these models also offer a drop-proof build, so your decision might come down to design preference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="MYCNRr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2&lt;/em&gt; for the PS4 &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733858933514752474" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs just $25&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy. That’s a good deal for the game now, especially considering it’ll get you the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297221/tony-hawk-pro-skater-1-2-ps5-xbox-series-x-nintendo-switch"&gt;free update coming in late March&lt;/a&gt; that will optimize it on PS5. PS5 owners will get to play the game at up to 4K resolution at 60 frames per second, or up to 120 frames per second at 1080p.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WfOb63"&gt;In case you missed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308943/ratchet-and-clank-free-ps4-ps5-playstation-sony-ps-plus"&gt;our post yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt; is now free for all PS4 and PS5 owners to download and keep forever. It’s part of Sony’s “Play at Home” initiative, and you have until March 31st to snag the game without the need for a PS Plus subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch AMD’s event introducing the next Radeon RX 6000 GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pErQ4b6HgNcjlfvT7eRLE3V-HF4=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68902911/twarren_201116_4300_0015.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;AMD’s Radeon RX 6800 XT graphics card | Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yCxOsL"&gt;AMD is holding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299529/amd-radeon-rx-6000-gpu-event-announced"&gt;a hardware event&lt;/a&gt; today, March 3rd, where the company plans to announce the next graphics card in its Radeon RX 6000 series. This will serve as the fourth GPU in the RX 6000 line, following the GPU’s debut in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbyWCQ"&gt;Like the other three cards, the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538010/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-specs-release-date-price-big-navi-gpu-graphics"&gt;Radeon RX 6000 GPU&lt;/a&gt; will feature AMD’s RDNA 2 architecture that includes real-time, hardware-accelerated ray tracing and variable rate shading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kau44N"&gt;This latest RX 6000 card will likely serve as a competitor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21409953/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;Nvidia’s RTX 3000 series&lt;/a&gt;, which recently released a new budget GPU, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt;. Whether this new AMD GPU will serve as a flagship or a lower-end budget card is yet unknown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lu9iPJ"&gt;WHEN DOES AMD’S EVENT START?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0nzJpE"&gt;It starts today, March 3rd, at 8AM PT / 11AM ET / 4PM GMT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aFoXcC"&gt;WHERE CAN I WATCH AMD’S EVENT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v3Ptbq"&gt;We have embedded the live stream at the top of this post, so you can stay here to watch it when it begins. AMD will also make streams available on its &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/events/gaming?utm_campaign=wheregamingbegins&amp;amp;utm_medium=redirect&amp;amp;utm_source=301"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to its official &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/amd"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjBqaGLRycc"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channels. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Congress can’t stop talking about Section 230</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i6USwhxVA24sJ3hPwaTwTLVkaPQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68902877/VRG_TEC_180_Section230_YT_05.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cpjvww"&gt;There’s finally momentum in Congress to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268421/cda-section-230-25th-anniversary-reform-stakes-big-tech-internet"&gt;make serious changes to Section 230&lt;/a&gt; — and not everyone’s happy about it. Last year’s antitrust hearings have given way to a full-court press on regulating big companies like Facebook and Google, and many in Congress see peeling back Section 230 as an easier way forward than GDPR-style privacy regulation or a full-scale antitrust breakup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ikbXxP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:8777491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HEg4PQ"&gt;So on Monday, we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307800/klobuchar-verge-live-section-230-speech-privacy-antitrust"&gt;hosted an event&lt;/a&gt; exploring what those regulations might look like, starting with a keynote on tech regulation from Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). After that, we had a panel of three experts — Vimeo’s Michael Cheah, Wikimedia’s Amanda Keton, and writer and strategist Sydette Harry — dig into the details of Section 230 and how the things they care about on the internet would be affected if the law was repealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leFC3e"&gt;It made for a strange combination. On one side, Sen. Klobuchar urged the tech world not to dismiss changes to Section 230 out of hand and to leave room for the idea that some kind of regulation or antitrust action might actually make the industry better. On the other side, the panel pleaded that any changes to Section 230 be tailored to specific problems. But since no one can quite agree which problems need to be addressed, it’s a tricky bet to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKexNu"&gt;If that sounds complicated, it is. The rise of online platforms like Facebook and YouTube has created several problems at once, and this kind of tangle is the inevitable result. There’s the antitrust problem, the misinformation problem, the hate speech problem, and half a dozen other issues. They’re all related, but fixing one will sometimes make others worse. Lawmakers are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301453/antitrust-facebook-google-amazon-apple-reform-cicilline-buck"&gt;increasingly aware&lt;/a&gt; of the problems with online platforms, but balancing them in an actual piece of legislation will be a spectacularly difficult task.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google promises it won’t just keep tracking you after replacing cookies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ItGlXXNdecUVi8wqsYXkhkGi9Iw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68902665/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Wf171"&gt;Google is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox"&gt;slowly phasing out third-party tracking cookies&lt;/a&gt;, and today, it’s making it clear that it won’t just replace them with something equally invasive despite the impact the change will have on Google’s lucrative advertising business. In a blog post, Google explicitly states that it “will not build alternate identifiers to track individuals as they browse across the web” after the third-party cookies are gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PAO5jm"&gt;“Instead, our web products will be powered by privacy-preserving APIs which prevent individual tracking while still delivering results for advertisers and publishers,” writes Google. “Advances in aggregation, anonymization, on-device processing and other privacy-preserving technologies offer a clear path to replacing individual identifiers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iq6feQ"&gt;Third-party cookies have been blocked for a while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192830/apple-safari-intelligent-tracking-privacy-full-third-party-cookie-blocking"&gt;in Safari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20848629/firefox-69-block-third-party-tracker-default-enhanced-tracking-protection-android-windows-mac-os"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; (though the browsers differed in how far they go), and Google plans on doing the same in Chrome. The cookies allow advertisers to track you as you move between different websites, which gives advertisers a better idea of what your interests are. These hyper-targeted ads are very valuable, resulting in the creation of an ad industry whereby individual user data is proliferated across “thousands of companies,” according to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DFPaQR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google says this practice has led to users not trusting the internet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5s5Xl4"&gt;Google says this practice has led to users not trusting the internet or advertisers, which puts the future of the web at risk. For all of the privacy concerns, advertising is still the primary way many companies on the internet make their money (&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and Google included). That’s why Google says it wants to move away from third-party cookies and toward “a more privacy-first web.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPG6sk"&gt;For all the talk of privacy, Google makes it clear it’s not trying to get rid of targeted advertising in general; it just wants to replace the more invasive methods of old with a new one of its own design, which it calls &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/2021-01-privacy-sandbox/"&gt;Privacy Sandbox&lt;/a&gt;. Part of Privacy Sandbox’s job is to hide the individual inside a large crowd of “cohorts” with similar interests it will then target ads toward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApoXD9"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/02/chrome-beta-89/"&gt;teardown of the Chrome 89 beta APK&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;gives us a first look at Privacy Sandbox controls and the use of “Web Crowd” cohorts for more relevant advertising:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="4IGQCK"&gt;Google’s embrace of a privacy-first web comes amid increasing regulatory pressure from across the globe. The company acknowledges that, while noting some of its competitors will still pursue solutions built around individual identities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1MBjs"&gt;“We realize this means other providers may offer a level of user identity for ad tracking across the web that we will not — like PII graphs based on people’s email addresses,” writes Google. “We don’t believe these solutions will meet rising consumer expectations for privacy, nor will they stand up to rapidly evolving regulatory restrictions, and therefore aren’t a sustainable long term investment.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Artificial intelligence research continues to grow as China overtakes US in AI journal citations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UAgztavodrYu6yfBfLw7TJuhAG8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68902671/acastro_180329_1777__brains_science_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Zx5xE"&gt;The artificial intelligence boom isn’t slowing yet, with new figures showing a 34.5 percent increase in the publication of AI research from 2019 to 2020. That’s a higher percentage growth than 2018 to 2019 when the volume of publications increased by 19.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zN2Qiv"&gt;China continues to be a growing force in AI R&amp;amp;D, overtaking the US for overall journal citations in artificial intelligence research last year. The country already publishes more AI papers than any other country, but the United States still has more cited papers at AI conferences — one indicator of the novelty and significance of the underlying research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LWh4X"&gt;These figures come from the fourth annual AI Index, a collection of statistics, benchmarks, and milestones meant to gauge global progress in artificial intelligence. The report is collated with the help of Stanford University, and you can read all 222 pages &lt;a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/research/ai-index-2021"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JilbIp"&gt;In many ways, the report confirms trends identified in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/12/18136929/artificial-intelligence-ai-index-report-2018-machine-learning-global-progress-research"&gt;past&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21010671/ai-index-report-2019-machine-learning-artificial-intelligence-data-progress"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;: the sheer volume of AI research is growing across a number of metrics, China continues to be increasingly influential, and investors are pumping yet more money into AI firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZJaShm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More money is being invested in fewer AI companies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lSvk51"&gt;However, details reveal subtleties about the AI scene. For example, while private investment in AI increased 9.3 percent in 2020 (a higher increase than 2018 to 2019 of 5.7 percent), the number of newly funded companies receiving funds decreased for the third year in a row. There are several ways to interpret this, but it suggests that investors expect that the winner-takes-all dynamic that has defined the tech industry — in which digital economies of scale tend to reward a few dominant players — will be replicated in the AI world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJlt24"&gt;The report’s section on technical advances also confirms the major trends in AI capabilities, the biggest of which is the industrialization of computer vision. This field has seen incredible progress during the AI boom, with services like object and facial recognition now commonplace. Similarly, generative technologies, which can create video, images, and audio, continue to increase in quality and availability. As the report notes, this trend “promises to generate a tremendous range of downstream applications of AI for both socially useful and less useful purposes.” Useful applications include cheaper computer-generated media, while malicious outcomes include misinformation and AI revenge porn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bx0gWF"&gt;One area of AI research that seems like it’s just beginning to come into its own is biotech. The drug discovery and design sector received the most private investment of any sector in 2020 ($13.8 billion, 4.5 times more than in 2019), and experts canvassed for AI Index’s report cited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754310/deepmind-alphafold-ai-protein-folding-casp-competition"&gt;DeepMind’s AlphaFold program&lt;/a&gt;, which uses machine learning to fold proteins, as one of the most significant breakthroughs in AI in 2020. (The other frequently cited breakthrough last year was OpenAI’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential"&gt;text-generation program GPT-3&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gv8YfJ"&gt;One area where the Index AI report struggles to gauge progress, though, is in ethics. This is a wide-ranging area, spanning everything from the politics of facial recognition to algorithmic bias, and discussion of these topics is increasingly prominent. In 2020, stories like Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/23/google-timnit-gebru-ai-ethics/"&gt;firing of researcher Timnit Gebru&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21284683/ibm-no-longer-general-purpose-facial-recognition-analysis-software#:~:text=IBM%20will%20no%20longer%20offer%20general%20purpose%20facial%20recognition%20or,addressed%20the%20letter%20to%20Sens."&gt;IBM’s exit from the facial recognition business&lt;/a&gt; drove discussions of how AI technology should be applied. But while companies are happy paying lip service to ethical principles, the report notes that most of these “commitments” are non-binding and lack institutional frameworks. As has been noted in the past: AI ethics for many companies is simply a way to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/3/18293410/ai-artificial-intelligence-ethics-boards-charters-problem-big-tech"&gt;slow roll criticism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lifx’s bacteria-killing smart bulb works, but here’s the small print</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/45MwfRJq7zpzf0bF1gXFwuLZX7A=/1x0:916x610/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68902440/lifx_clean_bottom_fixed_1600x1600.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LIFX Clean is a smart bulb that can kill bacteria.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LIFX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;These things take time&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="47DTMF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.lifx.com/products/lifx-clean-antibacterial-smart-light"&gt;Lifx Clean&lt;/a&gt; is a new smart lightbulb with an intriguing twist. Not only is it a fully functional color-changing lightbulb, the company also claims it is capable of disinfecting surfaces and the air around it. First announced last August, the $69.99 Lifx Clean is now shipping to preorder customers in the US, with wide availability planned this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ib7TVn"&gt;Lifx has an array of scientific studies as well as its own lab tests to support its claim that the Clean is the “world’s first antibacterial, germicidal smart light.” But can the lightbulb work as well in the average home as it did in the lab?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="thxLCK"&gt;It’s no coincidence that Lifx announced the bulb in a year in which we all had to pay more attention than ever before to keeping ourselves and our homes clean. Lifx’s CEO David McLauchlan says the company started having early discussions about developing a product like the Lifx Clean last March, the same month COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HqFrrR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We saw the alcohol companies were making hand sanitizer and clothing companies were making facial masks”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UArAnY"&gt;“We saw the alcohol companies were making hand sanitizer and clothing companies were making facial masks, and I said to the team that we can’t go do these things, but we do make lights,” McLauchlan said in a call. “There’s this technology out there, why don’t we look into it and figure out if we can do this?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HtFDhL"&gt;The “technology” McLauchlan is referring to here is a very specific kind of blue light with a wavelength of around 405nm. This high-energy visible (HEV) light has been shown across a number of studies to “inactivate” (read: kill) a range of bacteria including &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3330698/"&gt;salmonella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5068139/"&gt;E. coli&lt;/a&gt;, and methicillin-resistant &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2663198/#:~:text=Detailed%20investigation%20of%20the%20bactericidal,to%20a%209%2Dlog10"&gt;staphylococcus aureus&lt;/a&gt; (aka MRSA) in lab-based studies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKljZD"&gt;Other experiments have used it in real-world situations like hospitals. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195670110003312"&gt;Across&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305417911000908?via%3Dihub"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1757177413483646"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; conducted between 2010 and 2013, researchers found that the lights reduced the number of bacteria on frequently touched surfaces in a hospital’s burns unit. The reduction varied a lot — between 27 and 90 percent — even within these individual studies, depending on factors like how many days the light was used for, and how much activity there was in the room where it was used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FjGci9hffY52Z9tYwRVZW0Jnmlg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22339362/Computer_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lifx&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HEV lights’ lower energy means they’re safe for humans, but also that they take longer to kill bacteria.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5KiizC"&gt;The Lifx Clean incorporates this technology into a household lightbulb via an array of eight 405nm LED lights, which sit alongside the standard red, green, and blue diodes that you find in Lifx’s other bulbs. The array then has a typical diffuser placed over it, meaning that it looks almost identical to a standard Lifx bulb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xTxXs"&gt;It’s benign in appearance — vastly different from another light-cleaning tech that’s become popular during the pandemic era: UV light. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265221/nyc-mta-ultraviolet-light-uvc-coronavirus-disinfect-puro-pictures"&gt;Pilot programs have used UV light to clean subways, buses&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jetblue-deploys-honeywells-ultraviolet-cleaning-system-for-aircraft-interiors-301101993.html"&gt;aircraft cabins&lt;/a&gt;, and Transport for London has rolled it out to &lt;a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2020/october/installation-of-uv-light-devices-on-tube-escalators-is-latest-step-in-tfl-s-extensive-anti-viral-cleaning-regime"&gt;disinfect escalator handrails&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozZXWl"&gt;UV is fast acting, but it’s also incredibly dangerous when used incorrectly. That’s according to Jim Malley, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of New Hampshire who’s been studying the use of UV and other light as a disinfectant for over 30 years. It can cause erythema, the reddening of the skin that’s most commonly associated with sunburn, and repeated exposure has even been tied to skin cancer, he says. The light is particularly damaging to your eye’s cornea, and exposure to it can give you “the worst headache you’d ever imagined.” Although your cornea can generally recover from being exposed to UV, Malley tells me, repeated damage “does seem to tie to early blindness.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypUzk4"&gt;In comparison, HEV light doesn’t have those same problems. “Blue light, 405 nm, doesn’t have that kind of energy,” Malley explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9gskb"&gt;HEV light comes with its own disadvantages. Most notably, the light’s effect on bacteria just hasn’t been studied as much as UV. Much of the research that has been done has focused primarily on its ability to kill bacteria, and there’s less evidence to suggest it’s effective against viruses. That’s a very important caveat since COVID-19 is caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — a virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="POBcRY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I really want to be emphatic that we’re not trying to sell it as a ‘coronavirus killer’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2a3Dui"&gt;Lifx isn’t shy about pointing this out. In its announcement for the Lifx Clean last August, the company explicitly said that “no claim is currently being made that the product is effective in an antiviral capacity of any kind, including on SARS-CoV-2.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UMDQei"&gt;“I really want to be emphatic that we’re not trying to sell it as a ‘coronavirus killer,’” McLauchlan cautions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="305kP9"&gt;But Lifx still thinks that a disinfecting lightbulb, even if it’s antibacterial rather than antiviral, can help in an era of a global viral pandemic. Bacterial infections, after all, can create serious complications for anyone sick with a virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YS9eK6"&gt;HEV lights aren’t particularly fast when they’re being used to kill bacteria. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2663198/#__p16:~:text=.%20For%20the%20Staphylococcus%2C%20Streptococcus%2C%20and,with%20an%20irradiance%20of%2010%20mW%2Fcm2."&gt;A study from 2009&lt;/a&gt; found that it took as much as 60 and 90 minutes for 405 nm light to inactivate almost all the bacteria on test, despite the fact that the light was positioned a grand total of 2cm away from it. Hospital studies have focussed on using the light &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1757177413483646"&gt;continuously during daylight hours&lt;/a&gt; from anywhere between eight to 14 hours or more to achieve their desired bacteria reductions. In comparison, UV light can kill many bacteria and viruses in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZGx2X"&gt;These drawbacks mean that HEV lights haven’t really caught on as a disinfection technology, despite the research backing it up, Malley tells me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18Zt5U"&gt;“It’s not competitive, it’s not practical. You just can’t have hours and hours of contact time” Malley says. In a world where a UV light can sanitize a phone in 60 seconds, 405nm light “can’t compete.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yFkWc"&gt;Lifx provided &lt;a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0219/0638/files/QL20343-2A_An_Evaluation_of_the_Antimicrobial_Efficacy_of_HEV_Light_Report_FINAL.pdf?v=1614653165"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;of its tests of the light against E. coli and MRSA, which showed how its light performed over periods ranging from two to 12 hours, at a variety of distances. While the Lifx Clean can kill over 80 percent of E. coli bacteria on a glass surface in two hours under the right conditions, you’d have to run Lifx’s Clean bulb for up to eight hours to achieve a similar kill rate for MRSA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="13JdKM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s not competitive, it’s not practical. You just can’t have hours and hours of contact time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dkvTFv"&gt;The length of time involved in killing bacteria is a downside, but McLauchlan argues that the smart bulb’s scheduling features mean you can have it automatically come on when you’re not around. “You can literally have your lights come on at midnight when everyone’s in bed and stay on in the disinfectant mode till 6AM and provide a disinfectant effect in that room or that surface,” McLauchlan says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zsOkBw"&gt;The light’s efficacy also declines the farther away it is from a given surface. The results above were achieved by having the bulb just 40 cm away from the bacteria, which puts it at roughly desk lamp height. Move the bulb farther away, and it generally takes longer to kill the same amount of bacteria. Even after eight hours, Lifx’s tests show the bulb only killed around half the MRSA bacteria on a surface four feet away, or just over 65 percent of the E. coli. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3Zaz3"&gt;These results mean you’re unlikely to see much of an impact if you expect to use the Lifx Clean as an overhead light. Instead, the company sees people using the bulb in fixtures above desks and other surfaces. To its credit, Lifx is being upfront about these limitations, and these test results are &lt;a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0219/0638/files/QL20343-2A_An_Evaluation_of_the_Antimicrobial_Efficacy_of_HEV_Light_Report_FINAL.pdf?v=1614653165"&gt;available publicly on its website&lt;/a&gt; for everyone to view. If you’re planning on picking up one of the bulbs, it’s worth giving it a read to understand where, and for how long, you’ll need to leave the bulb running to get an effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxQ5x0"&gt;But there are other drawbacks with using HEV light that no amount of smart scheduling or clever placement are likely to be able to overcome. Lifx, for example, &lt;a href="https://mailchi.mp/buddy/lifxclean"&gt;initially said&lt;/a&gt; the Lifx Clean would be able to disinfect the air surrounding the bulb. However, the slow disinfection time makes that a pretty difficult feat to pull off, Malley explains, because of how air particles tend to move around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3BXJx"&gt;“They’re not going to be able to keep blue light on that particle of air long enough” Malley says. If bacteria gets really close to the blue light then you could see a reduction, he speculates, “but in general, I don’t think it can compete because you just can’t keep the air near that kill zone long enough.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CJv-3ynIzkLgvBeQfIpKTmdk3Ao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22339370/ezgif.com_gif_maker.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lifx&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outwardly, the Lifx Clean looks like the company’s other smart bulbs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A4PFu7"&gt;There are all sorts of variations in people’s homes that could affect how reliably the bulb kills bacteria. Disinfecting light is, by its very nature, a line-of-sight technology, so any areas of shade won’t be disinfected, and any lampshade in the way will also curtail its effectiveness. One of the &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1757177413483646"&gt;hospital studies from 2013&lt;/a&gt; found that the light killed an average of 15 percent less bacteria on the side of a room that was indirectly lit compared to the areas directly under the ceiling lights. It also can’t penetrate deep into porous surfaces, McLauchlan admits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixgPkS"&gt;The amount of variation in the average home could mean the results Lifx quotes from its lab tests won’t exactly match the real world. For reference, all the test results quoted above had the bacteria sitting on a glass slide. That might work for nonporous surfaces like kitchen or bathroom countertops, but Malley cautions that trying to generalize too much from lab results like this to the average home could end up looking “pretty unrealistic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="U1tA9M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I wouldn’t see [HEV light] as a substitute for cleaning, but as an adjunct”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="adnfrE"&gt;Variations like this between lab results and how people actually use products in the home are nothing new, says John Coia, a clinical microbiologist and professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Southern Denmark. Coia co-authored several of the real-world studies that found HEV light could reduce the amount of bacteria when used in hospital settings. He points out that even when it comes to traditional chemical disinfectant, many people might already not be using the correct concentrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djJWFa"&gt;“You can make the argument about whether people are using the correct concentration [of HEV light], but do people use disinfectants at the right concentration? The answer is they probably don’t,” Coia says. “In many cases, they probably use concentrations which are actually sub-lethal.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JncSVX"&gt;Everyone we spoke to, as well as Lifx, agreed that the Lifx Clean isn’t going to replace any normal cleaning. But used correctly, it could be an extra tool in your cleaning arsenal. “I wouldn’t see [HEV light] as a substitute for cleaning, but as an adjunct,” Coia says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="g8ypqC"&gt;Multiple studies have shown that under the right circumstances, HEV lights like the Lifx Clean certainly can kill bacteria. But even Lifx’s own laboratory tests have shown the limitations of the technology. It needs enough time, it needs to be the right distance away, and it needs a direct line of sight to bacteria in order to kill it. Lifx’s “germicidal smart light” isn’t snake oil, but nor is it a silver bullet that’ll save you from your weekly cleaning chores.&lt;/p&gt;
