    <title>Google and Jio’s smartphone collaboration has been delayed</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bklin2"&gt;The JioPhone Next, a smartphone being jointly developed by Google and Indian tech giant Jio Platforms, has missed its planned September 10th launch date, the &lt;a href="https://www.ril.com/getattachment/9071467e-5a43-415e-bfed-b831d0360df8/JioPhone-Next-in-Advanced-Trials,-with-Festive-Sea.aspx"&gt;companies have announced&lt;/a&gt;. The delay is needed to give both companies more time to refine the device, and to navigate problems created by the global semiconductor shortage. The JioPhone Next is now scheduled for wide release around Diwali, which will take place in early November. The phone is currently in testing with a small number of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fidBXi"&gt;The phone is designed to be an affordable 4G smartphone to help the roughly 300 million Indian users currently on 2G networks upgrade to 4G. When it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548453/jiophone-next-google-android-smartphone-affordable"&gt;announced the phone in June&lt;/a&gt;, Jio’s parent company Reliance said it would include voice assistant, augmented reality, and translation features. All this is build into an “optimized operating system based on Android,” which appears to bear some relation to Android Go, if &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/jiophone-next/#:~:text=the%20google%20camera%20go%20app%20icon%20spotted%20in%20one%20of%20the%20promotional%20images%20leads%20us%20to%20believe%20that%20it%20might%20feature%20android%20go"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; is to be believed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFYo2f"&gt;Work on the phone was first announced in 2020, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325343/google-reliance-jio-investment-india-4-5-billion-dollars-7-percent-facebook"&gt;Google announced a $4.5 million investment&lt;/a&gt; in Jio. As part of the collaboration, Reliance announced earlier this year that it’s shifting its retail business onto Google’s cloud infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi promises its 120W fast charger won’t kill its new phone’s battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shoppers are seen leaving the Chinese multinational..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qU_JsUcuMu9inFyT4qdB0knyVvo=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838893/1235139501.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pf8peD"&gt;If you’ve been following the Chinese phone scene for the past few years, you’ll have noticed the inescapable fast-charging arms race. It feels like every few months there’s a new champion, with high-wattage chargers constantly pushing down the time it takes to fill a phone battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1130hI"&gt;This month, Xiaomi is making its biggest effort yet to bring its “HyperCharge” technology to a mainstream, global audience. The upcoming Xiaomi 11T Pro has a 120W charger, a huge power increase on the current global flagship Mi 11, which uses a 55W charger that can get you to 100 percent in 45 minutes. Xiaomi hasn’t revealed estimating charging times for the 11T Pro yet, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363317/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-announcement-twitter-fast-charging"&gt;last year’s China-only Mi 10 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; also had a 120W charger that took just 23 minutes to fill up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnqpRS"&gt;A common reaction I see to this kind of fast charger is that they’ll surely have a negative impact on battery longevity, or that there must be safety issues, or both. So I talked to Daniel Desjarlais, international head of communications and global spokesperson at Xiaomi, about the company’s fast-charging technology efforts and what people outside China should expect from the 11T Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mc9AEM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is something that we’ve really, really heavily tested.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C1o9h5"&gt;First off, how does it work? “It’s like having two different inlets to fill the gas in your car and two separate tanks,” Desjarlais says of Xiaomi’s dual-cell battery design, which is similar to how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/11/8/20954678/oppo-reno-ace-super-vooc-fast-charging-review"&gt;other high-powered fast-charging solutions&lt;/a&gt; work. “Now, rather than filling at a certain slow rate on one side, you can fill up two at the same time. This is all done on the side of the phone, the charger outputs 120 watts and rather than trying to push the maximum of five volts, a single channel splits it into two, three, four channels. This allows us to increase everything — everything is done at 20 amperes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ybnUo"&gt;Desjarlais went on in detail to explain what happens with the technology in the battery itself, and how Xiaomi’s thermal monitoring systems work to maintain the optimum charging speed at each point in the cycle, but as a non-engineer I’m frankly not qualified to comment on the electrical design here. What I am qualified to comment on is phone design and consumer expectations, and I know a lot of people do worry about the tradeoffs with these fast-charging systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAuClI"&gt;On the question of longevity, Desjarlais says you can expect endurance in line with other more conventional phones. “This is something that we’ve really, really heavily tested,” he says. “Generally, for this level of charging with the batteries that we’ve tested it with, after 800 charging cycles you’ll still have 80 percent battery health. Now, that 20 percent might sound like ‘oh wow, I’m losing 20 percent,’ but that’s quite standard across basically all charging tech. 800 cycles, for most people, it’s going to be two years roughly. So that’s quite solid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lb8nZD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We don't just want to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChargeBetter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ChargeBetter&lt;/a&gt;, but we also want to make sure it's safe for our users. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XiaomiHyperCharge?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#XiaomiHyperCharge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/9AyMy3Jjzg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9AyMy3Jjzg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xiaomi (@Xiaomi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xiaomi/status/1433716399738925061?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UIOxPN"&gt;For comparison, Apple — a company that has faced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573710/apple-battery-gate-throttle-iphones-settlement-amount"&gt;heavy scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; over its long-term battery performance while offering slower charging tech than most of its competitors — &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387"&gt;tells customers&lt;/a&gt; to expect a lithium-ion battery to retain “up to 80 percent of its original capacity at 500 complete charge cycles.” If Xiaomi’s testing figures are accurate, a phone like the 11T Pro shouldn’t suffer from an unusually short lifespan, even if its owner only ever uses the fast charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xADjjO"&gt;When I ask whether using slower chargers would improve battery health further, Desjarlais says “There’s relatively minute differences between the two. Of course, the optimal situation would be yes, to use the slower charger if you’re going to charge overnight and use the fast charger for more rushed situations.” But Xiaomi’s testing has been carried out with the presumption that you could get good battery health if you use fast charging all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SExidK"&gt;As for safety, Desjarlais says the testing has been extremely thorough and includes third parties, with 34 different battery protection features included in the device itself. “Generally this is part of the reason why this technology is coming out now for global markets,” he says. “We wanted to make sure that we met all the regulations, but also that it was incredibly safe for all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ql77da"&gt;Still, I wondered about those potential tradeoffs. Are there really no downsides to a charging system like this? Could a phone with more conventional charging be thinner, or house a bigger battery, for example? According to Desjarlais, there’s no negative impact. That said, the actual charger is quite a bit larger than the average phone pack-in, and will of course draw more power (albeit for shorter periods of time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8jatb2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Join us for the global launch of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Xiaomi11TPro?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Xiaomi11TPro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Xiaomi11TSeries?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Xiaomi11TSeries&lt;/a&gt; and more products on Sep 15, 2021 at 20:00 (GMT+8)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let the magic begin! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cinemagic?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Cinemagic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ade9PECzWP"&gt;https://t.co/ade9PECzWP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xiaomi (@Xiaomi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xiaomi/status/1436252424390406149?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jk4AVJ"&gt;Xiaomi thinks its fast-charging technology is here to stay, and there still could be room for improvement. Earlier this year, for example, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/30/22461435/xiaomi-fast-charging-world-record-200w-wired-120w-wireless"&gt;demonstrated a prototype 200W system&lt;/a&gt; that filled a 4,000mAh battery in 8 minutes, though Desjarlais would only say that “Whether or not this comes [in a commercial product] is something that you’re going to have to wait and see on,” citing the need for further safety and performance testing. He had much the same answer about Xiaomi’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255625/xiaomi-mi-air-charge-technology-wireless-charging"&gt;truly wireless Air Charge&lt;/a&gt; teaser, saying “It’s a wonderful concept and it’s something that we’re continuing to examine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0o07nD"&gt;Obviously, safety and effective performance should be the least you expect out of any given phone feature. With fast charging, the question is whether customers in Xiaomi’s global markets will consider it a selling point. “For us, I think the big goal here is there’s a lot of people out there who consider fast charging to be an extraneous feature,” Desjarlais says. “But there’s also a lot of people out there for whom this is a big value add. It’s something you don’t really realize how good it is for your day-to-day life until you have to rush out the door to catch a cab in five minutes and your phone isn’t really charged.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGkfe0"&gt;Xiaomi’s international launch event for the 11T Pro and the rest of the 11T series is taking place next week on Wednesday, September 15th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam’s downloads page just got a lot more informative</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RJETzbnAXPMPO6V2nhtyxku5Vz0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838769/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xmtZWj"&gt;Valve has just released a &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/2941402621044012222"&gt;big update for Steam&lt;/a&gt; that offers a number of small but significant tweaks to the digital games store. Many of these changes have been &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/steam-client-beta-overhauls-downloads-page-and-storage-management-looks-great/"&gt;available in beta for months&lt;/a&gt;, but now they’re hitting the software’s stable release channel. The update overhauls the downloads page and introduces a much improved section for managing your storage, amongst a host of other tweaks and fixes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWFF0a"&gt;The downloads page has seen the bulk of the improvements. For starters, as well as showing download progress, the page also now shows installation progress. It should cut down on those frustrating moments when a game appears to be fully downloaded but isn’t playable because it’s not yet fully installed. The priority of downloads in the queue can now be easily reordered by dragging and dropping them, and the interface generally looks a lot cleaner overall. The “View News” button has been renamed “Patch Notes,” to make it easier to find what’s changed in a currently-downloading update, so long as developers have provided that information. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ER2qYjSVn2ZJVQ9MOSh3eV7oTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839401/steamwebhelper_E1Od5BYdSe.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Steam&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new storage management interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="71EGcx"&gt;Steam’s storage management section has also been improved to make it easier to see your available storage and move games between drives. You can get to it by going to Settings, Downloads, and then clicking “Steam Library Folders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cybp08"&gt;Those are the main improvements, but there are a host of other tweaks and fixes included in the update, which should be available to all users now. Steam should update itself automatically, but you can also click on “Steam” in the software’s menu bar, and then selecting “Check for Steam Client Updates…” to manually check. You can check out a full list of changes on &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/2941402621044012222"&gt;Steam’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Material You design is coming to Gmail, Calendar, and Docs on Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qe9tgoEPg8imvzWOdIKxwU63pT8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838608/acastro_201210_1777_gmail_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RitgUJ"&gt;Google is starting to roll out its new Material You design system to Gmail, Calendar, Docs, and more on Android. The new look will include changes to navigation bars, improved action buttons, and Google’s Sans text for better readability. It’s part of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;bigger Android 12 redesign&lt;/a&gt; that includes big, bubbly buttons, shifting colors, smoother animations, and some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663710/android-12-beta-5-ui-updates-features-clock-widgets-search-bar-calculator"&gt;overhauls to built-in apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYtqg5"&gt;The design changes mean Pixel devices with Android 12 or newer will be able to match the colors inside apps like Gmail, Google Meet, and Google Drive with their wallpapers for &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/09/material-you-for-android.html"&gt;what Google calls&lt;/a&gt; a “more dynamic, personalized look.” Existing color schemes and color-coded file types and folders will remain unchanged within the apps, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/spPCFRnccNqFxU05SjdF9yFLG4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839365/Screen_Shot_2021_09_09_at_3.26.48_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The subtle changes to the Gmail app design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jtArJjbuBHa1uA5Mxg3GT1liXsk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839366/Screen_Shot_2021_09_09_at_3.32.07_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google is leaning in to more rounded corners.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IPh7JW"&gt;The end result is subtle but colorful changes to apps like Gmail, Calendar, and Docs. Google has really leaned further into rounded corners here, and the changes are mostly aesthetic, meaning button placements and core navigation won’t be changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrUJbJ"&gt;The design changes are already available in Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. They will also appear in Google Calendar on September 20th, and Google Meet on September 19th. All of the design changes are available to both personal Google accounts and Google Workspace customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly overcomes Watch Series 7 manufacturing issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sw59Vp6iuCSMLr2W7hB1I19xOFg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838523/apple_watch_series_6_dbohn_821.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year’s Apple Watch Series 6.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hnmit8"&gt;Apple has reportedly overcome the production issues it’s been having with its unreleased smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 7, and will now begin mass manufacturing the device in mid-September, according to a report from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/kuo-apple-watch-series-7-ship-late-sept/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;seen by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The news comes as Apple gears up for a major launch event on September 14th. The fall event will presumably be focused on its latest iPhone models with the new Apple Watch also expected to make an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tAzCXE"&gt;Late last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Apple had temporarily halted production of its latest smartwatch while it fixed the problems. The issues were thought to be related to the Series 7’s revamped design, which is said to consist of “&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-29/who-will-replace-tim-cook-as-the-next-ceo-of-apple-aapl-ksxiq29z"&gt;a flatter display and edges&lt;/a&gt;” than seen on previous models. The new design has reportedly forced Apple to use new production processes that created “reliability issues” in early test runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;On Watch 7 from last weekend: “We’ll see an announcement during the usual September event alongside the iPhone, but there will be a mix of the models shipping late or in small quantities.” &lt;a href="https://t.co/xkvN14Mv3O"&gt;https://t.co/xkvN14Mv3O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1436226530598817815?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LGjrET"&gt;Now, however, these issues are thought to have been resolved, with shipments expected to begin in late September. According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1436226530598817815"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, however, although Apple will announce the new Watch next week, some of the models could ship “late or in small quantities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0nXvk"&gt;As well as the flatter display, the new smartwatch is expected to come with slightly larger 41mm and 45mm cases (up from 40mm and 44mm currently), bumping the largest display from 1.78 inches to 1.9 inches diagonally. The watches are also rumored to have a faster processor and updated wireless tech.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music is adding more DJ mixes with new features powered by Shazam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T2ZQnxXtXtKmSK-HQGqIANMbcsE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838305/acastro_210831_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="quFQc3"&gt;Last year Apple showed how it could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444506/apple-ios-14-2-beta-shazam-identify-music-phone-apps-headphones"&gt;embed Shazam’s music identification features even more deeply within iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;, and now it’s taking things another step forward within Apple Music. Apple Music initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/15/11235428/apple-music-stream-remixes-dj-mixes-dubset"&gt;introduced DJ mixes and mash-ups in 2016 through a partnership with Dubset Media Holdings&lt;/a&gt; to identify and pay for licensed music within mixes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uj1TvW"&gt;Now Apple says that by building upon the Shazam tech &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17896350/apple-shazam-app-acquisition-complete-free"&gt;acquired in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and partnering with various labels, Apple Music has the tools to identify and compensate individual creators, event promoters, labels, etc. It also allows subscribers to see the names of individual tracks, skip songs within the mix, listen with lossless audio on “most mixes,” and save them to their library for viewing offline. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cNlCJzWhvaL4iJTap0cLoW47L58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839129/applemusic_6001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Music DJ Mix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mQg5zT"&gt;So yes, the same fingerprint ID tech that tells you the name of a song playing in the mall can apparently figure out which festival it’s from, which DJ’s mix it is, and pick out different sounds as they blend together. This is apparently detailed enough, relying on matching across Apple Music’s database of 75 million songs or so, to enable recurring revenue streams for the clubs that host sets and the DJs that make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BTumey"&gt;There’s a dedicated genre page for DJ mixes within the Apple Music app, and the company says engagement has tripled in the last twelve months, with over 300 million streams of DJ mixes so far.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Un-C3A-NrrZPin1pIWYhKSifwl0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839132/applemusic_600t.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Music DJ Mix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bHBPrU"&gt;Apple has already been on a tear adding mixes over the last year or so, including some from Charlotte de Witte, Tiësto, Carl Cox, and others. Studio K7! founder Horst Weidenmueller said in a statement that “Through the partnership with Apple we finally have a place to celebrate DJ-Kicks with additional 14 editions which haven‘t been in the market for over 15 years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PERn2v"&gt;Apple Music says it’s commissioning more mixes (following series released earlier this year to mark Black Music Month and Pride) and working closely with DJs to get additional content on the service. This is a new path for getting DJ mixes onto Apple Music alongside older ones like Dubset’s platform. If you already enjoy existing mixes on Apple Music, we’re told they aren’t going anywhere, even if they don’t have all the new features included. Still, it isn’t yet accessible for bedroom DJs or lesser-known names posting their mixtapes to SoundCloud, so there’s some room between this and the wild days of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muxtape"&gt;Muxtape&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple won’t let Epic bring Fortnite back to South Korea’s App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EXYdbBwcc_0-tFM38okb09faDjw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838257/vpavic_180607_2652_0089.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eLYuio"&gt;Apple says it won’t let Epic Games back in the App Store until they agree to “play by the same rules as everyone else.” Earlier today &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665826/epic-games-apple-reinstate-fortnite-ios-korea-app-store-payment"&gt;Epic asked Apple&lt;/a&gt; to reinstate its developer account so that it could re-release the iOS version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in South Korea, which recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;passed a bill&lt;/a&gt; forcing Apple and Google to allow alternate in-app payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BVTLT"&gt;Apple, however, maintains it’s under no obligation to let Epic in the App Store at all. “As we’ve said all along, we would welcome Epic’s return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else,” an Apple spokesperson says in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Epic has admitted to breach of contract and as of now, there’s no legitimate basis for the reinstatement of their developer account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="N0dBfY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"All the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Yl5sa3"&gt;The South Korean legislation has not yet gone into effect, but if and when it does, according to Apple, that wouldn’t have any bearing on the company’s process for approving developer accounts. Until Epic agrees to comply with the App Store’s app review guidelines, Apple isn’t going to consider its request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LlEPyh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, one of the most popular video games in the world, has been unavailable on the App Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;since August of last year&lt;/a&gt;. Apple ultimately terminated Epic’s developer account in response to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; update&lt;/a&gt; that dodged the App Store’s in-app payment requirement in order to get around paying Apple the 30-percent cut. Epic then sued Apple and went to trial in May, with a verdict yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vivo finally adopts wireless charging with new X70 Pro Plus flagship</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VvNw_B1RXfeUxBh1ueLvdoreV1E=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838079/vivo_X70_Series_Photo_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1f8OIT"&gt;Vivo has announced the X70 series, its latest line of flagship phones. It sees the company further extend its camera partnership with renowned lens company Zeiss while refining the blueprint laid down by the X50 and X60 phones from the past year-plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VfwdW3"&gt;The X70 Pro Plus is the top-of-the-line device, featuring a Snapdragon 888 Plus processor, a 6.783-inch (yes that’s the stated spec) 1440p OLED screen, and a 4,500mAh battery that uses Vivo’s 55W FlashCharge technology. More importantly, it has 50W wireless fast charging that also works with Qi. This is Vivo’s first ever phone to support wireless charging, which should make it a more viable switching option for anyone who’s already put Qi chargers all over their house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9QWaP"&gt;The X70 Pro Plus’ Zeiss-branded camera array includes a 50-megapixel main sensor, a 48-megapixel gimbal-stabilized ultrawide, a 12-megapixel telephoto, and an 8-megapixel periscope telephoto. Vivo has added three new simulated bokeh modes based on the optical characteristics of classic Zeiss glass, including Distagon, Planar, and Sonnar. The Pro Plus also has a new Vivo-designed image processor called the Imaging Chip V1 that’s designed to improve performance in noise reduction and motion compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NHxEAVX3jccigTqloEf670PS-eM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836445/vivo_X70_Pro_Photo_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XVn4nW"&gt;The X70 Pro and X70 have smaller 6.56-inch 120Hz displays, Mediatek Dimensity 1200 processors, and 44W FlashCharge — but still no wireless charging. The X70 Pro’s camera system bumps the ultrawide down to 12 megapixels, while the X70’s triple array includes a 40-megapixel primary and two 12-megapixel sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WL6CLI"&gt;Vivo hasn’t given full pricing or release information for the X70 series except to say that it’s “gradually rolling out in markets such as India, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates, and more” from today. We’ll bring you more as we have it — the X70 Pro Plus in particular is looking like a compelling device.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple fires senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik for allegedly leaking information</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MpOe7Q2Tn1pUSlE7lq2TwQwZi2A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69838038/acstro_190902_apple_event_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xfqpAL"&gt;Apple has fired senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik for allegedly violating the company’s rules against leaking confidential information. For months, Gjøvik has been tweeting openly about allegations of harassment, surveillance, and workplace safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fO2x3"&gt;“When I began raising workplace safety concerns in March, and nearly immediately faced retaliation and intimidation, I started preparing myself for something exactly like this to happen,” she says. “I’m disappointed that a company I have loved since I was a little girl would treat their employees this way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0K58X"&gt;Gjøvik has raised concerns that her office is in an Apple building located on a superfund site, meaning it requires special oversight due to historical waste contamination. She also says that she faced harassment and bullying from her manager and members of her team. More recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22648265/apple-employee-privacy-icloud-id"&gt;she’s begun raising privacy concerns&lt;/a&gt; related to Apple’s policies on how it can search and surveil employees’ work phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0nYUnz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sooo, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; has pics of my boobs. During a discovery thing 3yr ago, legal forced me to hand-over all my texts. They refused to let me delete anything, even "fully personal," even when I said "by fully personal I mean nudes." They said they're in their "permanent evidence locker"&lt;/p&gt;— Ashley M. Gjøvik (@ashleygjovik) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleygjovik/status/1428495420917837826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4dviGK"&gt;She was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22610112/apple-female-engineering-manager-leave-sexism-work-environment"&gt;placed on administrative leave in early August&lt;/a&gt; while Apple investigated some of these concerns — a placement she says she requested as a last resort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ayee9"&gt;A member of Apple’s employee relations team reached out to Gjøvik earlier today saying the company was looking into a sensitive intellectual property matter and wanted to speak to her within the hour. Gjøvik said she wanted to keep all communications in writing, and noted she was forwarding the correspondence along to the NLRB, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-national-labor-relations-board-investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02/"&gt;where she recently filed a charge&lt;/a&gt;. The employee relations representative responded to say that because she had chosen not to participate in the discussion, they would move forward with the information they had and — “given the seriousness of these allegations” — suspend her access to Apple systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TWdgdI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Any bets if I get a literal knock on my physical door from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; today? &lt;a href="https://t.co/oFqw4VFaGi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/oFqw4VFaGi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ashley M. Gjøvik (@ashleygjovik) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleygjovik/status/1436078307859066890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PXSOMR"&gt;Hours later, Gjøvik received an email that her employment at Apple was being terminated, effective tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDhGAH"&gt;In response to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Apple spokesperson Josh Rosenstock said: “We are and have always been deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace. We take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised and, out of respect for the privacy of any individuals involved, we do not discuss specific employee matters.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vape receipts help DOJ nab man who allegedly botnetted thousands of passwords</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q-qMR2bo13723-o2ojmc44Q_GMQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69837773/acastro_170621_1777_0001_fin.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YEfHY3"&gt;28-year-old Ukrainian national Glib Oleksandr Ivanov-Tolpintsev has been &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdfl/pr/ukrainian-cyber-criminal-extradited-decrypting-credentials-thousands-computers-across"&gt;indicted by the Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly using a botnet to brute force people’s passwords, and then selling the credentials on a dark web store ominously called The Marketplace. According to the DOJ, Ivanov-Tolpintsev bragged that he was able to get at least 2,000 logins a week, and he allegedly told one of The Marketplace’s admins that he had cracked over 20,000 passwords. The DOJ’s description of the alleged methods and victims serve as a reminder of how much stolen information is out there, and the importance of implementing basic security principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Uk6zG"&gt;The indictment, which can be read in full below, alleges that Ivanov-Tolpintsev talked about controlling a botnet, which is essentially a group of computers whose users don’t know they are infected with malware. He’s accused of using those computers’ power to guess people’s passwords over and over, far faster than he could with his own hardware. Then, according to the DOJ, he would sell those passwords to cybercriminals who used them to carry out fraudulent activity, such as ransomware attacks, or even accessing someone’s home security cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="koEZMo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Botnets can let you guess passwords faster than you could with a single machine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0FmXpe"&gt;Some of the alleged victims are perhaps a bit surprising. The &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21059498-tolpinstev-complaint"&gt;criminal complaint&lt;/a&gt; lists two victims who were interviewed; one ran an IT business, the other was a security systems consultant who did work for the Department of Corrections. While the two victim’s systems are only a small portion of the over 6,000 compromised logins Ivanov-Tolpintsev is accused of putting up for sale, his alleged contributions are in turn just a drop in the bucket for The Marketplace. According to the complaint, vendors on the site are selling access to over 700,000 machines, and past buyers have used info purchased on The Marketplace to carry out over $100 million of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vjB4u6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Investigators were able to track Ivanov-Tolpintsev using an email address&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ecplj0"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/irs-ukraine-scammer-vape-store-receipts/"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;CyberScoop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, simple mistakes made it easier for investigators to accuse Ivanov-Tolpintsev. The IRS was granted access to email addresses with a warrant, and was able to link the alleged hacker to them using receipts from local vape and smoke shops, scans of his passport, and pictures on Google Photos. The emails also allegedly linked him to other accounts and identities that were related to The Marketplace, where the passwords were sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vy2Qx0"&gt;The DOJ says that if Ivanov-Tolpintsev is found guilty he could face up to 17 years in prison, and would have to hand over more than $80,000 that he allegedly made from selling information. He was originally caught by Polish authorities in late 2020, and was extradited to the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbxXeG"&gt;The story serves as a reminder of why good security practices are important. Things like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;using strong passwords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22215571/factor-authentication-2fa-apple-microsoft-google-how-to"&gt;two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt; can help better protect you against brute-force attacks, and occasionally scanning your computer for malware can keep your computer from inadvertently working to crack other people’s passwords. While authorities may be able to catch some cybercriminals, the vastness of The Marketplace (itself just a single site), shows that there’s plenty of people out there trying to get their hands on unprotected data.&lt;/p&gt;
