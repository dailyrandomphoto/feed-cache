    <title>Apple Music is missing one major thing: a classic iPod to go with it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pGh4pkF2WCmY3l5Jly55D9HUqUM=/0x0:5861x3907/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69540186/DSCF2292.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h6Hwop"&gt;Earlier this year, I did something weird: I bought an iPod 5th generation, originally manufactured back in 2006. I got it mostly as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/22/17039896/ipod-diy-upgrade-battery-memory-hack"&gt;fun thing to mod&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve actually been using it on a near-daily basis. The experience has brought me to the conclusion that Apple should bring back the iPod, but updated for the modern age. It should keep the click-wheel of course, but I can’t stop thinking about how good an iPod, designed for the age of music streaming, AirPods, and high-res displays would be. I know that might sound silly, but let me explain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jic8nB"&gt;There are a few reasons why Apple should make a new iPod. For one, it would allow the company to capitalize on some nostalgia for the iPod age that seems to be coming around, based on recent iPod-themed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548356/ipod-web-player-spotify-apple-music"&gt;web players&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/11/28/20986886/iphone-app-ipod-classic-click-wheel-elvin-hu-developer"&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/1/22260540/ipod-mod-portable-spotify-player-click-wheel-project"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YgCPcV"&gt;The other, perhaps more obvious reason, is that the iPod is a music-centric device, and Apple literally has a service called Apple Music. The company is currently in love with services revenue, but many of its devices just aren’t that great at playing music. The iPhone makes it difficult to plug in many types of headphones, and Siri interrupts what you’re listening to when you’re asking it to do something simple that doesn’t really warrant an audible response (like turning on HomeKit-powered lights, for example). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0FeZe"&gt;Most of, if not all, of Apple’s devices also can’t play the highest-end lossless files &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;that Apple Music can now deliver&lt;/a&gt; without additional hardware. This means that Apple doesn’t sell something it can point to and say “this is the best Apple Music experience you can get, period.” An iPod could be just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCZSDU"&gt;While Apple Music should be tightly integrated into a modern iPod, it would also be great if it could play music from other services, and if it had a totally Classic mode that just played files synced from a computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqksbh"&gt;Not only would opening the iPod up avoid some terrible optics for a company that’s being scrutinized by the government and competitors (like Spotify) for abusing its role as a platform and service designer, but it would also help avoid some of the weirdness that comes with streaming music. A lot of the times I use my iPod these days are because Apple Music is acting up, forcing me to restart the app because it claims that content is unauthorized, or completely fritzing out when trying to play the lossless music Apple recently introduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgVvWG"&gt;(Seriously, is anyone else having this problem? Randomly, but very often, the song I’m trying to listen to will devolve into a flurry of high-pitched, digital-sounding squeals, like I’m listening to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6tFRzt-QvA"&gt;a 100 Gecs song&lt;/a&gt; playing on a Discman that’s being vigorously shaken.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjgX2T"&gt;Of course, Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipod-touch%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F4%2F22561092%2Fapple-bring-back-ipods-2021-music-services" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;does still sell an iPod&lt;/a&gt;, after all these years: the iPod Touch. Now, don’t get me wrong, the iPod Touch is a very good device, especially for children, and people who just want a non-expensive iOS device. But that’s just the thing — the iPod Touch isn’t a purpose-driven music player, it’s an iPhone without the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGVBSl"&gt;But so what? That just means it can use its headphone jack to listen to tunes from Apple Music, as well as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Prime Music, and anything else, as well as play games, surf the web, read books, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGdvcs"&gt;And that’s the rub for me: the iPod Touch is a good computing device, one that Apple should arguably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/28/18642381/apple-ipod-touch-update-iphone-7-processor"&gt;update more often&lt;/a&gt;, but sometimes the best tool for a job isn’t the one that can do everything. It’s the one that’s designed to do one thing really well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MjcC3m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPod Touch is a good device, but sometimes the best tool isn’t the one that can do everything&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2XS8dx"&gt;For example, when I’m listening to music on an iOS device I often find that I’m not actually &lt;em&gt;listening&lt;/em&gt; to the music, but scrolling through Twitter with it on in the background. That doesn’t happen with my 2006 iPod. The focus that comes with something that’s not offering you &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1BneeJTDcU"&gt;everything, all of the time&lt;/a&gt;, is the same reason some people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444637/kobo-elipsa-e-reader-giant-screen-price-release-date-stylus"&gt;prefer e-readers&lt;/a&gt; over just reading on a tablet or phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3L4ka"&gt;And, practically speaking, making a dedicated portable music player without a smartphone OS and touchscreen would mean that Apple wasn’t competing as much with Android-powered players from the likes of &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/audio-components/hi-res-audio/p/nwa105-b"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Resolution-Lossless-Bluetooth-Spotify/dp/B07L8P8QDY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fiio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8iK0s"&gt;There’s also the matter of hardware — if Apple made a new iPod designed for just listening to music, it wouldn’t have to make it powerful enough to run 3D games or Safari, and could instead put resources to a better DAC and amp (perhaps one that could play Apple Music’s aforementioned 24 bit, 192 kHz lossless files). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgxBsf"&gt;I don’t think that a new iPod would ever reach the dizzying heights of popularity that the older models did. Most people are perfectly content to listen to music on their phones — if they weren’t, Apple probably wouldn’t have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/7/27/16050420/apple-ipod-nano-shuffle-discontinued"&gt;stopped selling iPods&lt;/a&gt; in the first place. However, Apple’s a big company — it could stand to make a niche, music-focused device, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434783/apple-homepod-stock-problems-discontinued-sale"&gt;even if its last one didn’t do so well&lt;/a&gt;. And as an old iPod enthusiast, it coming out with a new one would be literal music to my ears (I had to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USYUkK"&gt;P.S. — I’ve also found the Apple Music experience on the Apple Watch to be pretty mediocre, and I don’t want to take my phone on a run. I’m not saying there’s room for an iPod Shuffle with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522993/apple-siri-on-device-speech-recognition-no-internet-wwdc"&gt;the new offline Siri&lt;/a&gt; instead of VoiceOver, but...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok parent ByteDance has begun selling the video app’s AI to other clients</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LNcFGbfxZG2XCG12cPz4Drj6Ajg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69540140/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;TikTok’s parent company has started selling its AI to other companies | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rVVusm"&gt;ByteDance, the Beijing-based parent company of video sharing app TikTok has started selling TikTok’s AI to other companies, the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bed7cba1-db7a-49c7-9d57-06fd19e14e10"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports (may require subscription). The company has a new division called &lt;a href="https://www.byteplus.com/"&gt;BytePlus&lt;/a&gt;, and according to its website, its client list already includes US fashion app Goat, Singapore travel site WeGo, Indonesian shopping app Chilibeli, and India-based social gaming platform GamesApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hfsir"&gt;TikTok’s recommendation algorithm is a huge part of what has made it so popular. Essentially, the way you interact with the app affects what videos it will recommend to you. The company &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you"&gt;explained in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; last year how its ForYou feed determines what videos to serve a given user. Its recommendations are based on user interactions including which videos you like, share comment on, or create; video information, such as captions and hashtags; and device and account settings including what device you’re using, your language preferences, and your location settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvKmZ3"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;, BytePlus offers customers the chance to access the recommendation algorithm, and personalize it for their apps and customers. BytePlus also offers automated speech and text translation and real-time video effects as well as data analysis tools, according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJgyyl"&gt;Over the past year and a half ByteDance and TikTok were among the China-based companies targeted by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215961/trump-executive-order-prohibiting-transactions-eight-chinese-apps-alipay-tencent-qq-wechat-pay"&gt;a series&lt;/a&gt; of executive orders from former President Trump, that sought to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21358505/trump-tiktok-wechat-tencent-bytedance-china-ban-executive-order-legal-sanctions-rules"&gt;block China-based apps&lt;/a&gt; from US app stores. President Biden signed an executive order in June revoking the bans. Despite the pressure from the Trump administration, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/24/tiktok-reveals-us-global-user-growth-numbers-for-first-time.html"&gt;TikTok surpassed 100 million monthly users&lt;/a&gt; in the US last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7GMtI"&gt;ByteDance didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWgq4o"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL 20 Pro 5G review: good looks aren’t everything</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The 20 Pro 5G includes premium features you’d be hard-pressed to find in another $500 phone&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="jSGHyq"&gt;The TCL 20 Pro 5G is a good-looking budget phone that works out some of the first-gen kinks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21257398/tcl-10-pro-review-release-date-specs-features-camera-screen"&gt;we encountered in the 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but it isn’t quite ready to take on the category heavyweights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMAQQq"&gt;Much like its predecessor, the 20 Pro 5G combines a high-end look with a budget price tag — $499 for 6GB of RAM and 256GB of storage in this case. That’s $50 higher than the 10 Pro’s starting price, but this time you get more storage and 5G, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6klsf"&gt;It’s worth stating again: this is a very good-looking phone for just $500. Its huge curved-edge display boasts very slim bezels, and build quality is top-notch with an aluminum frame and glass on the front and back. The rear-facing cameras are neatly arranged under a vertical strip that sits flush with the rear panel. It’s tidy, and kind of retro cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eWAn76"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10634905"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nudokf"&gt;Good looks aside, I wouldn’t recommend the 20 Pro 5G to most people. There are a few usability quirks that make it feel like the second-gen device that it is. But more importantly, the 20 Pro 5G’s network compatibility and security support policy just aren’t as strong as the Pixels and Galaxy A-series phones in the category. It’s slated for two OS upgrades (decent for a midrange phone) but only two years of security patches (less good). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jINwzQ"&gt;It also lacks compatibility with AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network and isn’t certified to use C-band frequencies that will likely make Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G networks much better over the next couple of years. It’s yet another device that may be best suited for T-Mobile customers who will get full 4G and 5G connectivity and don’t need to worry about C-band as much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxxRtx"&gt;There’s a lot to like about the 20 Pro 5G, and TCL has made some steps in the right direction with this device, but it still comes up short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ma3dxXAld7tygbzrq0GE5sXHAZo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693979/ajohnson_210630_4655_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rather than offering a faster refresh rate, TCL has opted to include its second-gen Nxtvision display technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FEU2ls"&gt;TCL 20 Pro 5G screen, performance, and battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CDOuhY"&gt;A lot of the credit for the 20 Pro 5G’s premium look goes to its curved 6.67-inch 1080p OLED screen with slim bezels — you just won’t find another screen like it in this class. It offers a standard 60Hz refresh rate, bucking the trend toward faster 90Hz and 120Hz displays, so you won’t get that smooth-scrolling goodness here. I noticed a little bugginess in the screen’s color temperature jumping between warm and cool, particularly after leaving the camera app, but overall it’s a pleasure to look at. And thankfully, it seems much less prone to registering touches accidentally on the curved sides than in the previous generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leyDBH"&gt;TCL has included its second-generation Nxtvision 2 technology here, which aims to make standard images and video look more like high dynamic range content, with deeper blacks and brighter whites. You can choose from a few different profiles, with “vivid” as the default, or turn it off entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjQ7ch"&gt;We thought the first generation of this tech was a little heavy-handed, and I can’t say I’m impressed this time around either. The effect is often so subtle that I’m sure I wouldn’t notice it if I didn’t know it was there. When I could see a noticeable difference with it turned on versus off, it made images look too unnaturally processed for my taste. That said, I don’t think it will negatively impact anyone’s experience using this phone, it’s just not the impressive feature that TCL makes it out to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="xa93z0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TCL seems to be doubling down on this SDR-to-HDR conversion tech rather than joining the rest of the industry in embracing faster refresh rates&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2mQ5WZ"&gt;The company seems to be doubling down on this SDR-to-HDR conversion tech rather than joining the rest of the industry in embracing faster refresh rates, and it’s starting to feel like a weird choice. A faster refresh rate screen is an obvious benefit that many more users will see and appreciate. The advantages of viewing HDR content on an HDR screen are real, but the effect is hard to mimic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlygzZ"&gt;TCL has equipped the 20 Pro 5G with a Snapdragon 750G 5G processor and 6GB of RAM. It’s certainly up to day-to-day tasks, and stutters only occasionally with heavier tasks. The customizable smart key from last year’s model makes an appearance again here, and there are a ton of functions you can map it to, from opening a particular app to launching the camera in a specific mode, like night or portrait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zoKYr"&gt;It’s really useful, but unfortunately, it’s still easy to bump unintentionally. It’s positioned out of the way so that I don’t hit it while I’m using the phone; it’s just when I pick up the device or my hand brushes against it that I press it by accident. This is how you end up with multiple photos of your couch cushions in your camera roll, which nobody needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DMLv2y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s another premium feature on board here, too: wireless charging at up to 15W&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4HAibz"&gt;Moving along to the top edge of the device, there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is great! The phone’s mono speaker isn’t very good, but I wouldn’t expect it to be at this price, and anyway: headphone jack! The optical in-display fingerprint sensor is also good — one of the faster and more accurate I’ve encountered in the midrange class. I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate this after struggling with some finicky fingerprint sensors in lower-end devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOVzUo"&gt;The TCL 20 Pro 5G is equipped with a 4,500mAh battery. It will get you through a day of moderate use, but overall battery life doesn’t seem quite as robust as it could be. If you’re a heavy user, you may be pushing your luck by the end of a long day of use. There’s another premium feature on board here, too: wireless charging at up to 15W. That’s something that’s still hard to come by in the $500-and-under class, and it’s only a little slower than the phone’s 18W wired charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1910Q"&gt;On the software side, the 20 Pro 5G ships with Android 11 and TCL has promised it two OS upgrades. One (or god forbid, none) is common in this class, so that’s great to see. However, it will get just two years of security updates, which lags behind Samsung and Google’s four- and three-year policies, respectively. You should get more than a couple of years of support out of a $500 phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JH6614"&gt;Otherwise, TCL’s take on Android is a good one. It’s highly customizable but doesn’t feel overly busy, with handy features like a tray for frequently used apps tucked away on the right-hand side of the screen, and the option to rearrange the order of system navigation buttons during setup. It’s a lot, but it feels like useful stuff rather than customization overkill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pc-uvEmcDX2EsQ0JR-ebB7ndNm4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693982/ajohnson_210630_4655_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are four camera sensors on the rear of the device, including a stabilized 48-megapixel main camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CF7tGL"&gt;TCL 20 Pro 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="oDC2iD"&gt;The 20 Pro 5G includes a 48-megapixel f/1.8 main camera with optical image stabilization, which isn’t guaranteed at this price and is a real benefit in dim lighting conditions. There’s also a 16-megapixel ultrawide, 2-megapixel macro, and 2-megapixel depth sensor as well as a 32-megapixel selfie camera around front. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40vSfH"&gt;The camera hardware is clearly capable of good things. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of detail in photos I took outside in good light — there’s some aggressive sharpening going on, but it’s not too distracting. However, there’s still room for improvement. Colors like greens and blues look a little unnatural and bright. Photos can look flat and washed out, and I spotted more lens flare in my images than I’d expect to see. It’s possible that this is an effect from the cameras’ recessed position rather than on a protruding bump, which would be a real shame — I’ll gladly take an uglier camera bump than flare in my photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D94MRE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10634994"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="66E3QV"&gt;Portrait mode does a convincing enough job of separating subjects from a blurred background, though a disappointing number of my photos showed a little subject blur even with OIS assisting. “Super Night” mode is a bit of a miss. It seems to retain more detail in very low-light images compared to standard auto mode, but it also employs some heavy noise-reduction. Images show some unnatural smoothing and can skew a little too warm — personally I’d stick to auto mode for low-light shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDA8fP"&gt;All in all, the 20 Pro 5G’s camera capabilities are underwhelming. There are some real positives — OIS helps you get more steady shots and detail retention is good — but as a total package it’s not quite on par with the likes of the Pixel 4A 5G and Galaxy A52 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hwa5VdasTJagR-lQ2UjV1gCvLJE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693981/ajohnson_210630_4655_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;While it offers some premium features for its price, the 20 Pro 5G is hard to recommend to just anyone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="YaZVgv"&gt;There’s a whole lot to like about the TCL 20 Pro 5G, but it still feels like a device that’s still shaking off some early-generation quirks. While it does offer some features and hardware you’d be hard-pressed to find on any other $500 phone, it’s not quite the total package that it should be for that price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBQNV5"&gt;There have been some important improvements over the first generation. The curved sides of the screen are less prone to accidental touches, and there have been some nice additions like the inclusion of wireless charging. Yet some issues remain where TCL is still finding its footing with this second-generation device: the Smart Key is still easy to press accidentally, the camera is basic, and Nxtvision is underwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jdEFyR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;some issues remain where TCL is still finding its footing with this second-generation device&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3c8nC"&gt;And then there’s network compatibility — in the US, it’s kind of a jigsaw puzzle to which only the established players have all of the pieces. Thanks to some of these missing pieces, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T customers won’t get the most out of this device and its 5G capabilities. And with only two years of security updates promised, it lags behind the competition in terms of longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="CwH3IS"&gt;If you’re on T-Mobile and you’d really like a budget device with a flagship look and feel, then the 20 Pro 5G is a good option, with a strong caveat that you’ll be putting up with some issues that competitors have already figured out. Most others would do best to consider one of those $500 midrange heavyweights. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt; offers a fast refresh rate screen, better network compatibility, and a solid four-year security support policy. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;The Google Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt; is a good option, too, with a better camera — if you can find it still in stock. You won’t get a fancy curved display or the high-end build quality with either of those alternatives, but depending on your priorities, they may serve you better in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China regulator orders Didi ride-hailing app removed from stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Didi logo shown on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TWKqRKv65FHUdGSMSTcAHEyDRKw=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69539986/533645962.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Didi has some 377 million users in China | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qA76cp"&gt;The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has ordered app stores to remove Didi Chuxing’s app, claiming the ride-hailing company had been illegally collecting users’ personal data (via &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-cyberspace-agency-says-didi-illegally-collects-user-data-2021-07-04/?t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The regulator said it had ordered the company to make updates to put it in compliance with China’s data protection rules, but didn’t elaborate on what the violations may have involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="706ZXx"&gt;Didi was founded in China in 2012, and a recent regulatory filing shows it has &lt;a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001047469-21-001221/#dk10201_dilution"&gt;377 million active users&lt;/a&gt; in China alone. The company just &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/30/investing/didi-china-us-ipo-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;went public on June 30th&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest IPO of a Chinese company on a US stock exchanges since Alibaba in 2014. On Friday, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/02/business/didi-china-inquiry.html"&gt;CAC announced&lt;/a&gt; new user registrations for Didi’s service were being suspended pending a “cybersecurity review.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bE06cM"&gt;In response to a request for comment, a Didi spokesperson pointed to a Sunday post on its &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/4655333928344291?wm=3333_2001&amp;amp;from=10B5393010&amp;amp;sourcetype=weixin"&gt;Weibo page&lt;/a&gt; (translated from Chinese via Google Translate) that said its app would be removed in accordance with the order, and that users who have downloaded the Didi app could continued to use it normally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZa6lA"&gt;Over the past several weeks, China’s regulators have been cracking down on tech companies for a range of violations, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-tech-clampdown-is-spreading-like-wildfire-11622971802?mod=article_inline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported, with a focus on anti-competitive practices, inconsistent pricing, and the ways apps handle users’ data. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Games Done Quick’s speedrunning summer marathon kicks off Sunday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qdIkD1aC__J8ifpD3FDNEFSVBiQ=/0x0:2560x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69539912/i_s6hBWf5_X5.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SGDQ is You.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Games Done Quick&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qkV5Kp"&gt;Games Done Quick’s weeklong summer speedrunning event for charity begins on Sunday, and looks to have a whole bunch of good runs to look forward to. Things kick off for Summer Games Done Quick (SGDQ) Online 2021 at 12PM ET on the &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick"&gt;Games Done Quick Twitch channel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVPJUu"&gt;You can see the &lt;a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule"&gt;full schedule here&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s packed with a treasure trove of interesting-looking runs. There’s a lot I want to check out, but I think I’m most interested in the &lt;em&gt;blindfolded &lt;/em&gt;70-star run of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZXjrT"&gt;SGDQ and its wintertime counterpart, Awesome Games Done Quick, are two of my favorite weeks of the year. I love watching players absolutely dismantle some of my favorite games, such as in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRFVZHBj5Pc"&gt;this run of &lt;em&gt;Shovel Knight: Specter of Torment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or pulling off superhuman stunts, like beating the hardest levels of the already-hard platformer &lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_3f3q1bybQ"&gt;using a dance pad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p5nf9x"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_3f3q1bybQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6MqxSI"&gt;But since the marathon runs every hour of every day until it’s over, I also love checking the stream at random times of the day and just watching what’s on. Often, I’ll be introduced to a game that I’ve never heard of before, and it’s fun to learn all about it from people who are masters of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAi3yy"&gt;As the name of the event implies, SGDQ Online 2021 will take place entirely online (which was also the case &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21366548/summer-games-done-quick-2020-gdq-online-virtual-speedrun-marathon-charity"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;). Donations will benefit Doctors Without Borders, and in 2020, SGDQ raised more than $2.3 million for the charity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the first trailer for the Star Wars: Visions anime anthology</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IB-0YZ-iPn-eyURR1_mV3JcGF-k=/91x0:1066x650/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69538928/0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wrH7nL"&gt;At an Anime Expo Lite panel, LucasFilm revealed the very first look at &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Visions&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming anthology of short anime films set in a galaxy far, far away. The sneak peek featured a huge range of visual styles and ideas, with shorts that featured, among many other things, a rock opera, a chibi Boba Fett, droids in straw hats, a twin Star Destroyer, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VW25iF"&gt;“We really wanted to give these creators a wide creative birth to explore the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; galaxy,” LucasFilm executive producer James Waugh said during the panel. “We wanted this to be as authentic as possible to the studios and the creators. The idea was, this is their vision, riffing off all of the elements of the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; galaxy that inspired them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2SwLm"&gt;The shorts announced at the event, and the studios working on them, include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="V13nUI"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Duel&lt;/em&gt;  by Kamikaze Douga (&lt;em&gt;Batman Ninja&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JO228T"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Lop &amp;amp; Ocho&lt;/em&gt; by Geno Studio (&lt;em&gt;Golden Kamuy&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UoEZiR"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tatooine Rhapsody&lt;/em&gt; by Studio Colorido (&lt;em&gt;A Whisker Away&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wFZyzG"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Twins&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Elder&lt;/em&gt; by Trigger (&lt;em&gt;Kill La Kill&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ohIRgO"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Village Bride&lt;/em&gt; by Kinema Citrus (&lt;em&gt;Tokyo Magnitude 8.0&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RLUiBR"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Akakiri&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;T0-B1&lt;/em&gt; by Science Saru (&lt;em&gt;Japan Sinks&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TI4ZYc"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Ninth Jedi&lt;/em&gt; by Production IG (&lt;em&gt;Ghost in the Shell&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="zBTJ9r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; was first announced last December, and is described as “an original series of animated short films” that “celebrates the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; galaxy through the lens of the world’s best Japanese anime creators.” The anthology will be available on Disney Plus when it premieres on September 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QN8WwV"&gt;Anime has become a big focus for streaming services, with both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527983/netflix-geeked-week-anime-trailers-mobile-suit-gundam-godzilla"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559498/amazon-prime-video-evangelion-rebuild-us-streaming-release"&gt;Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt; snapping up big-name titles. &lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; will mark the first major anime series to debut on Disney Plus. That said, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/25/8287017/tie-fighter-anime-star-wars-movie-accurate"&gt;fan projects have clearly demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; in the past that &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; and anime are a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some accused in Capitol riot reportedly tried to scrub info from their phones and social media</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gOJS2X"&gt;Some 49 people accused of taking part in the January 6th riot at the US Capitol building have tried to erase images, videos, and texts from their phones and social media accounts, the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-capitol-siege-business-electoral-college-media-efe0ea1092bc11c6d3f42ea4ef752d98"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported, citing a review of court records. Authorities told the &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; that the people may have realized that the many photos and videos posted to social media by people participating in the riot could be used as evidence against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRpeDM"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;AP &lt;/em&gt;cited several cases where accused rioters’ social media posts apparently contradicted what they told authorities about their involvement in the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNazWQ"&gt;Hundreds of supporters of former President Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;stormed the Capitol building&lt;/a&gt; on January 6th as members of Congress prepared to certify the results of the presidential election. More than 500 people have been arrested in connection with the riot, Attorney General &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-investigation-january-6th-attack-capitol"&gt;Merrick Garland said last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNKkeR"&gt;In the days following the attack, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222200/social-media-telco-urged-preserve-evidence-capitol-attack-twitter-facebook-google-verizon-apple"&gt;asked mobile carriers and social media platforms&lt;/a&gt; to preserve “content and associated metadata” that may have been connected to the attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elWrOk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/capitol-riot-media-attacks/2021/07/02/8af871d2-daa7-11eb-bb9e-70fda8c37057_story.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported Saturday that the Department of Justice has started arresting people who attacked reporters documenting the riot, damaging their equipment. The &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; reports that the people would be charged with committing violence or destroying property on the grounds of the Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>REvil ransomware attacks systems using Kaseya’s remote IT management software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ncWJdH"&gt;Just in time to ruin the holiday weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545675/ransomware-cryptocurrency-regulation-hacks"&gt;ransomware attackers&lt;/a&gt; have apparently used Kaseya — a software platform designed to help manage IT services remotely — to deliver their payload. Sophos director and ethical hacker Mark Loman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markloman/status/1411035534554808331"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; about the attack on Friday, and reported that affected systems will demand $44,999 to be unlocked. A note on Kaseya’s website implores customers to shut off their VSA servers for now “because one of the first things the attacker does is shutoff administrative access to the VSA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="APKSa0"&gt;On Saturday, Kaseya issued another update, saying that it had been advised by its outside experts that “customers who experienced ransomware and receive a communication from the attackers should not click on any links – they may be weaponized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iiPDUk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;News Flash: cybercriminals are a$$holes.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep all the Incident Response teams in mind this holiday weekend as they're in the thick of it...again.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you use Kaseya VSA, shut it down *now* until told to reactivate and initiate IR. Here's the binary: &lt;a href="https://t.co/NIuGJZW84p"&gt;https://t.co/NIuGJZW84p&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/GSXPlOPjFt"&gt;https://t.co/GSXPlOPjFt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Krebs (@C_C_Krebs) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/C_C_Krebs/status/1411046946349924359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p2vfPv"&gt;According to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-hits-200-companies-in-msp-supply-chain-attack/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the attack targeted six large MSPs and has encrypted data for as many as 200 companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xaRdz"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://doublepulsar.com/kaseya-supply-chain-attack-delivers-mass-ransomware-event-to-us-companies-76e4ec6ec64b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DoublePulsar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Kevin Beaumont has posted more details about how the attack seems to work, with REvil ransomware arriving via a Kaseya update and using the platform’s administrative privileges to infect systems. Once the Managed Service Providers are infected, their systems can attack the clients that they provide remote IT services for (network management, system updates, and backups, among other things).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHOwjZ"&gt;In a statement, Kaseya told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “We are investigating a potential attack against the VSA that indicates to have been limited to a small number of our on-premises customers only.” A notice claims that all of its cloud servers are now in “maintenance mode,” a move that the spokesperson said is being taken due to an “abundance of caution.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUXOwx"&gt;Later on Friday evening, Kaseya CEO Fred Voccola issued a statement saying they estimated the number of MSPs affected is fewer than 40, and are preparing a patch to mitigate the vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADfnRG"&gt;“While our early indicators suggested that only a very small number of on-premises customers were affected, we took a conservative approach in shutting down the SaaS servers to ensure we protected our more than 36,000 customers to the best of our ability,” Voccola said in the statement, adding that the company’s SaaS customers were never at risk, and reiterating that “only a very small percentage of our customers were affected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Roq7cX"&gt;On Saturday, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-03/number-of-victims-continues-to-grow-in-massive-ransomware-attack"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-03/number-of-victims-continues-to-grow-in-massive-ransomware-attack?srnd=premium&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=business&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the attack was affecting more than 1,000 businesses in a ripple effect; the attack focused on managed service providers, but these providers offer IT services to other companies that may now be affected as well. A grocery chain in Sweden reported it couldn’t open 800 of its stores on Saturday when the attack resulted in its cash registers malfunctioning, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4kS3K"&gt;The attack has been linked to the notorious, REvil ransomware gang (already linked to attacks on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341642/acer-ransomware-microsoft-exchange-revil-security"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466003/jbs-cyberattack-fbi-revil-sodinokibi-criminal-group"&gt;meat supplier JBS&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year), and &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/revil-ransomware-executes-supply-chain-attack-via-malicious-kaseya-update/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes that, collecting incidents under more than one name, this may be the third time Kaseya software has been a vector for their exploits. REvil has previously been linked with Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1GTT00"&gt;But President Biden said late Saturday afternoon that the US government wasn’t sure whether Russia was involved in the attack, &lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/biden-says-not-sure-if-russia-is-behind-latest-cyberattack/2021/07/03/c8b8c686-dc3a-11eb-8c87-ad6f27918c78_story.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. “I directed the intelligence community to give me a deep dive on what’s happened, and I’ll know better tomorrow, and if it is either knowledge of and/or consequences of Russia, I told Putin we will respond,” he told reporters during a trip to Michigan. Biden added that he hadn’t yet called Russian President Vladimir Putin about the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1kfOv"&gt;Kaseya said Saturday it would &lt;a href="https://www.kaseya.com/potential-attack-on-kaseya-vsa/"&gt;provide updates&lt;/a&gt; on the situation every three to four hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtbSuB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 2nd, 10:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from Kaseya CEO.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OzdLB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 3rd 12:04PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added new information from Kaseya and updates about the spread of the attack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dzdtym"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 3rd 4:50PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added comment from President Biden &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dutch court rejects Facebook’s bid to have privacy lawsuit in the Netherlands dismissed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-61LwGSniCEFRZ5Kp_ir3HJ63gQ=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69538140/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D8fBQ7"&gt;A court in &lt;a href="https://linkeddata.overheid.nl/front/portal/document-viewer?ext-id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2021:3307"&gt;Amsterdam ruled that privacy litigation&lt;/a&gt; against Facebook in the Netherlands can proceed, rejecting the social network’s bid to have the lawsuit from two non-profit groups thrown out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2rvIF"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/dutch-court-will-hear-another-facebook-privacy-lawsuit/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, the Amsterdam-based Data Privacy Foundation and Dutch consumer advocacy organization Consumentenbond are suing Facebook on behalf of users over what they claim are violations of European Union privacy law. The lawsuit says Facebook has not provided enough details about the information it gathers from users, including what it does with the data, and therefore doesn’t have a legal basis to process the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNt9I7"&gt;Facebook tried to block the lawsuit claiming that the Amsterdam court doesn’t have jurisdiction over its European business, which it argues is subject to Irish law. The Court of Amsterdam disagreed, writing in its decision that “The Data Privacy Foundation may litigate before the Dutch court on behalf of Dutch users of the Facebook service against Facebook about whether Facebook has violated the privacy of its users.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNdCWo"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was reviewing the court’s decision, noting that the ruling was procedural, and that the company would continue to defend its position in court. “We care about our users in the Netherlands and protecting their privacy is important to us,” the spokesperson said. “ Users have meaningful control over the data that they share on Facebook and we provide transparency around how their data is used.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWFsip"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 3rd, 12:22PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds statement from Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to find the documents behind big legal cases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Supreme Court 3 (Verge Stock)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lE7yPbOrRipyhKI4eLX3HBJEKs=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69537983/Supreme_Court_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pKDf0I"&gt;Earlier this year, I spent a month covering the trial for a dispute between Apple and Epic. The case was one of the biggest antitrust suits in recent memory, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;brought to light revelations&lt;/a&gt; about both companies and the larger tech industry, often in the form of legal filings. I (and other reporters) try to pick out the most relevant details from these filings for readers. But sometimes, the documents are worth checking out in their own right. A site called &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/"&gt;CourtListener&lt;/a&gt; makes that easier than it might sound — if you know how to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sTwLF"&gt;US federal court documents are supposed to be publicly available through the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system. But as somebody who frequently uses PACER, I can confirm it’s a really frustrating system. Signing up is a hassle, it costs 10 cents to run a search or retrieve a single page of a document, and all those charges add up quickly if you’re hunting down information about a case. PACER is basically a video game loot box mechanic for the legal system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Igqvp9"&gt;This limits access to resources that can help people understand US law &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;countless individual news reports better. (Some journalists re-upload and link filings via Scribd or DocumentCloud, but not every outlet follows this practice.) It also walls off a lot of stuff that’s simply interesting or funny. Want to read about FBI agents hunting a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bradheath/status/1408405285874671624"&gt;possibly mythical&lt;/a&gt; cache of gold stolen from the US Treasury during the Civil War by a secessionist secret society and then hidden in an underground cave network? &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.paed.540418/gov.uscourts.paed.540418.6.0.pdf"&gt;The court system has you covered&lt;/a&gt;. Or take &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.224921/gov.uscourts.dcd.224921.73.0.pdf"&gt;this recent ruling&lt;/a&gt; on the Federal Trade Commission’s case against Facebook, which may include the most portentous description of MySpace and Friendster ever written:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3nlzhm"&gt;At the dawn of our century, in the much earlier days of the internet, a number of websites began to offer what came to be known as “social networking” services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WhNwFa"&gt;If you’d like that in the form of a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; opening crawl:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z3P8et"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Damn someone got there before me! &lt;a href="https://t.co/kKgwv5icl2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kKgwv5icl2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— No Context Paddy O'Connor (@paddypadman2) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/paddypadman2/status/1409622320579284994?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2zu9uM"&gt;Fortunately, there’s an unofficial PACER workaround. Maintained by the nonprofit Free Law Project, CourtListener hosts a free and open archive of millions of filings. It contains court opinions, audio of oral arguments from trials, and something called &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/"&gt;the RECAP archive&lt;/a&gt; — which is where you’ll find a lot of the most interesting material. That includes &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/"&gt;the long back-and-forth between Apple and Epic&lt;/a&gt;, government allegations like the &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.555476/gov.uscourts.nysd.555476.1.0.pdf"&gt;cryptocurrency fraud claims&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547643/john-mcafee-dead-prison-spain-us-extradition"&gt;late antivirus tycoon&lt;/a&gt; John McAfee, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554476/ftc-facebook-instagram-antitrust-case-whatsapp-federal-court"&gt;important legal decisions&lt;/a&gt; like a judge tossing the aforementioned &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/18735353/federal-trade-commission-v-facebook-inc/"&gt;Facebook antitrust suit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCBDfG"&gt;The RECAP archive is a giant crowdsourced library based on a &lt;a href="https://free.law/recap/"&gt;browser extension&lt;/a&gt; of the same name. When a user with the RECAP extension logs into PACER and downloads a document, a copy of it gets saved to the archive. Anybody can access it from there, whether or not they’ve got the extension installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpNNap"&gt;RECAP is dependent on PACER users sharing a file, so you generally can’t get documents that nobody has looked up. But if you’re reading about a lawsuit or a big criminal case in the news, there’s a good chance you can find details in the archive. (One catch: PACER covers the federal court system, so if somebody was sued or charged at a state level, you’re probably out of luck.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2VynUm"&gt;Navigating CourtListener can be a little overwhelming. On the RECAP archive, it’s helpful to search by the name of one of the parties involved, then narrow your search by district or state with the “select jurisdictions” filter. For instance, if you know a company was sued in California, you can select the four California districts under the “Federal Districts” tab. Sorting by “Newest Cases First” can be helpful for lawsuits and criminal charges that were just filed, and “Newest Documents First” can be good for cases that were just decided. If you have one document from a case already, you can look for the case number listed at the top of each page and search that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the “Select Jurisdictions” filter in the RECAP archive, showing the South, Central, Northern, and Eastern districts of California selected." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0V6yoj2yYFPafTZWq3yH_cDLfrc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22695939/Screen_Shot_2021_07_02_at_11.43.31_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R8LseO"&gt;When you click on a case, you’ll get its docket: a long record of everything that’s happened. Near the start of the list, you’ll probably find a complaint or indictment containing the allegations against the defendant in the case. You may also see a list of exhibits, or evidence like email chains or images. Further down you could find orders, where a judge hands down a decision. If these documents have been uploaded to the archive, you’ll see a link to download the file. If they haven’t, RECAP can direct you to PACER if you have an account — in which case this &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; is a great time to &lt;a href="https://free.law/recap/"&gt;install RECAP&lt;/a&gt; and start uploading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoBFtp"&gt;It’s important to remember that court documents are written for companies, individuals, and agencies with a specific agenda, and they don’t necessarily tell the full story of an event. (For example: the FBI did not find that hidden gold.) Interpreting them often requires background knowledge about specific terms and prior cases, although there are resources that can help, like writer and attorney &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1160925"&gt;Orin Kerr’s guide&lt;/a&gt; to reading a judge’s opinion. Even so, they’re a valuable tool for digging into some of the biggest stories &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; covers — and sometimes a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
