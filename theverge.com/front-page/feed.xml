    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BYGNKQ"&gt;Fisker Inc. quietly settled a previously unreported trade secret lawsuit with Volkswagen-backed solid-state battery company QuantumScape last July, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned. The suit, filed in April 2019 in Santa Clara Superior Court, was centered on a former QuantumScape employee who brought thousands of confidential documents with her to a new job at Fisker Inc. in late 2018 and early 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61jx8k"&gt;While the lawsuit played out, Fisker Inc. locked away those documents and the work done by the employee, and even “quarantined” battery cells made while she worked there, though it ultimately argued the information was public domain. As part of the settlement, Fisker Inc. ultimately agreed to delete or destroy the documents the employee brought with her. Fisker Inc. &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1720990/000119312520313931/d92481d424b3.htm"&gt;recently disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; that it agreed to pay $750,000 in cash to settle claims of trade secret misappropriation in July 2020, though it did not name QuantumScape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vqhdJe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fisker paid $750,000 as part of the settlement&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9hH7cB"&gt;The suit was settled at the same time that Fisker Inc. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21322573/fisker-vw-meb-modular-platform-architecture-ocean-suv-apollo"&gt;was trying to strike a deal with Volkswagen to power its first SUV&lt;/a&gt;, the Ocean, with the German automaker’s new modular electric vehicle platform. Those talks have fallen apart, though, as the two companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349464/fisker-volkswagen-vw-ev-platform-deal-spaq-spac-spartan"&gt;blew past their deadline to strike a deal&lt;/a&gt;. Fisker Inc. has since contracted automotive supplier Magna to build the Ocean SUV and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298878/foxconn-fisker-ev-electric-vehicle-wisconsin-deal-fsr-suv"&gt;an agreement with iPhone-maker Foxconn&lt;/a&gt; to build a second vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3C7ru"&gt;Volkswagen made a $100 million investment in QuantumScape in 2018 and &lt;a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-increases-stake-in-quantumscape-6136"&gt;added another $200 million to the joint venture last June&lt;/a&gt;. But the German automaker has been collaborating with the battery company since 2012. A Stanford spinout, QuantumScape is one of many companies working on solid-state batteries, which replace the liquid electrolyte found in lithium-ion batteries with a solid material that could help increase energy density, allow faster charging, and reduce the risk of fire. Like Fisker Inc, QuantumScape merged with a special purpose acquisition company last year and is now publicly traded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDGSLg"&gt;In 2019, Fisker Inc. delayed a luxury sports car that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/18/18270350/henrik-fisker-electric-suv-karma-emotion-delayed"&gt;was supposed to use the solid-state battery it was developing&lt;/a&gt; because the tech wasn’t ready. QuantumScape argued in the lawsuit that the employee, battery researcher Anna Choi, and Fisker Inc. tried to use the information to “redirect Fisker’s development of the thin film ceramic electrolyte for its lithium-based battery to emulate QuantumScape’s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PmsdAl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Electric cars could use another big battery breakthrough — this CEO says he’s got it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/16/17695866/henrik-fisker-solid-state-batteries-electric-cars"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XTDzmY"&gt;QuantumScape described in the suit how Choi brought confidential material to Fisker Inc. before and after taking a job with the EV startup, and she admitted to doing so as part of the settlement. QuantumScape also tried to argue Choi was directed by Fisker Inc. executives to bring over the confidential material, including co-founder Geeta Gupta Fisker and then-head of battery development Fabio Albano. Gupta Fisker and Albano separately denied this, and Fisker Inc. claimed Choi acted of her own volition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IjPtfU"&gt;Choi and QuantumScape did not respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Albano and a spokesperson for Volkswagen declined to comment. Fisker Inc. founder Henrik Fisker declined to comment on the lawsuit in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="TQe43I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Choi gave Fisker a 52-slide PowerPoint “playbook” of QuantumScape’s innovations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5C7L8"&gt;According to the lawsuit, the trouble started when Choi gave Fisker Inc. a 52-slide PowerPoint — described in the heavily redacted lawsuit as a “virtual playbook” to key QuantumScape innovations and trade secrets, with “detailed recipes, processes, [and] ingredients” — in an interview with the EV startup on November 20th, 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEsQ4t"&gt;“Immediately after her interview, [Fisker Inc.] began peppering Choi with requests for her ‘recommendations’ regarding equipment to be used, vendors, and pricing,” lawyers for QuantumScape wrote in a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QV4xxM"&gt;QuantumScape further claimed Choi “emailed highly confidential QuantumScape materials to her personal Yahoo email account” on December 11th and 12th in 2018. On December 14th, again met with Fisker Inc. at the EV startup’s Torrance, California headquarters to attend its holiday party, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bbQyF"&gt;That same day, QuantumScape said Choi logged in to the company’s secure intranet system from an IP address “publicly associated with Fisker” and “reviewed and downloaded several dozen highly confidential technical documents to which she had been granted restricted access.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WhiuNY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fisker said it had no use for the information, and argued it was public anyway&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="An619d"&gt;Fisker Inc.’s legal team pushed back on this, arguing that QuantumScape was broadly using the term “trade secrets” to refer to public information about its battery tech, and “because QuantumScape utterly failed to reasonably protect the secrecy of its ‘trade secrets’ by allowing Choi ‘unfettered and unmonitored access to its networks,’ according to a filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8d8bp"&gt;“It was only by chance (because Choi referenced a QuantumScape item number on a call with a third-party supplier) did QuantumScape learn of Choi’s activity,” lawyers for Fisker Inc. wrote. “[D]espite Choi’s unilateral actions, Fisker never wanted any QuantumScape confidential information, and it has not used any QuantumScape non-public information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tavrv"&gt;Fisker Inc. fired Choi in April 2019 just a few weeks after the lawsuit was filed. Albano, a highly touted battery expert, left Fisker Inc. in May 2019, though Fisker Inc. contends he was fired in court filings. Albano has since filed a previously unreported breach of contract suit against Fisker Inc. in Los Angeles County Superior Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KxYnS"&gt;Since settling the trade secret lawsuit, both Fisker Inc. and QuantumScape have gone public and raised eye-popping amounts of money. Fisker Inc. went public in October 2020 &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2020/11/02/electric-vehicle-stocks-come-unplugged/"&gt;and raised $1 billion&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s now planning to use more conventional lithium-ion batteries in its vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="TvJDGW"&gt;QuantumScape went public in November 2020 and raised around $700 million in the process. In December, it published test results that showed its battery clearing key hurdles. QuantumScape’s CEO claimed to &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; that he thinks it is “the first to solve solid-state.” Volkswagen &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/volkswagen-sinks-another-200-million-into-solid-state-battery-company-quantumscape/"&gt;has said it hopes to put QuantumScape’s battery into production by 2025&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A court is forcing Valve to tell Apple how much money 436 different PC games made</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bpkXCPEO1w3CLMq6sjASc7udQeE=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68875727/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cqMUYh"&gt;Valve has been compelled by a California court to provide sales data on more than 400 Steam games to Apple and possibly reveal its yearly sales, revenue, and profits to Apple as well. The iPhone maker subpoenaed Valve for the data as part of its ongoing dispute with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COCXIQ"&gt;According &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.356.0.pdf"&gt;to a Wednesday order by Judge Thomas Hixson&lt;/a&gt;, Valve will have to provide yearly sales and pricing data on 436 games that are available on both its PC game distribution platform, Steam, and the Epic Games Store. Apple has requested the data so it can define the video game market in its case against Epic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KBOEl4"&gt;In a filing published on February 18th, Valve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291297/apple-valve-data-steam-sales-epic-games-dispute"&gt;had argued&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s demands were overly broad. Apple had asked for even more data in its subpoena, including annual revenues from Steam, the name of every app on Steam, and the date range for when those apps had been available. Valve argued that the demands would “impose an extraordinary burden” on the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMvvZH"&gt;Valve has also been compelled to share “aggregated data” about how much it makes from Steam, though it’s not clear exactly what that will entail. Apple had asked for the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ksuk20"&gt;RFP 2 asks for documents sufficient to show since 2008 Valve’s (a) total yearly sales from apps and in-app purchases from Steam, (b) annual advertising revenue attributable to Steam, (c) annual sales of external products attributable to Steam, (d) annual revenues from Steam, and (e) annual earnings, income or profits from Steam. Apple asks for this information by app if that is available. During meet and confer Apple limited the relevant time period to 2015 to the present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eMV74O"&gt;In his ruling, Judge Hixson largely sided with Apple. “In the letter brief, Valve said this would be an overwhelming amount of work, but other than using adjectives, it did not substantiate or quantify the burden in any way,” Hixson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Y8vCx"&gt;“Apple has shown that it has a substantial need for this information to obtain evidence in support of its arguments concerning market definition and the effects of competition, and it cannot obtain this information elsewhere without undue burden,” he added. “Valve offers several reasons why Apple has not satisfied this standard, but none is persuasive.” Valve is the biggest PC game store in existence and generally doesn’t provide any sales data whatsoever, though you can find &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110?"&gt;simple unordered lists of the bestselling games&lt;/a&gt; each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9dLK4"&gt;Hixson did narrow the amount of information Valve has to provide. While Apple requested data dating back to 2015, Hixson ruled that Valve only needs to produce data from 2017 to the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTzUWa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;Epic sued Apple in August&lt;/a&gt; after Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from the App Store&lt;/a&gt; for introducing an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;in-app payment system&lt;/a&gt; that it says violated App Store rules.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use your Oculus Quest 2 to play any PC VR game wirelessly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q8Sb_6aZYKAVgUN-Mu726FoGJrQ=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68643020/hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh hey, it’s all of my PC games available to play on the Quest 2, wire-free, from within a virtual room. This is getting weird.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vDDDh3"&gt;One of the best features of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt; is it can be manually linked via USB to your gaming PC to play more demanding VR games you couldn’t otherwise run natively on the headset. That’s great if you want a way to play games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; but the obvious downside is that you’re now physically tethered to a PC — so much for the wireless freedom that the Quest 2 advertises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTupji"&gt;Thankfully, the developers at Virtual Desktop have already figured out the seemingly impossible: how to run system-intensive titles on your PC and stream the visual feed to your VR device while syncing all of your movements over Wi-Fi. It gives you the best of both worlds: letting you play the games you want without being attached by a cable to your computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3KFeB"&gt;Doing this is now as simple as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2017050365004772%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22218827%2Foculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buying and installing a $20 app through the Oculus store&lt;/a&gt;, but it wasn’t always so easy. There used to be several steps involved, but Virtual Desktop’s developers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301151/oculus-store-virtual-desktop-native-pc-vr-game-streaming-quest-2"&gt;recently pushed an update&lt;/a&gt; that makes it considerably easier to stream your PC VR games via Wi-Fi. In short, the app can handle it natively instead of requiring a patch as a workaround. And with the latest update to this article, its length has been cut in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="E0oS4h"&gt;Buy the Virtual Desktop app for Quest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qYkSF8"&gt;The Virtual Desktop app lets you access your PC through the lens of a VR headset. You can use it for games, like we’ll be doing, but you can also watch movies you have stored on your PC in a variety of different virtual environments. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2017050365004772%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22218827%2Foculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;There’s a Quest-specific version of the app that you can purchase here for $20&lt;/a&gt;. (Make sure it says that it’s compatible with Quest underneath the purchase button.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsBT4k"&gt;After you purchase it, install it on the headset.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iVvcJViGCifzUvXoqbandzJ1-6Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220864/vd.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virtual Desktop running on the Quest 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7F3xXK"&gt;Download Virtual Desktop Streamer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zwiEFT"&gt;There’s yet one more application to download: &lt;a href="https://www.vrdesktop.net/"&gt;Virtual Desktop Streamer&lt;/a&gt;. It’s free, and made by the same folks who made the Virtual Desktop app you purchased on the Quest 2. This app simply streams PC content to your headset via Wi-Fi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LRXQqT"&gt;Once this app is downloaded and installed, you’ll need to input your Oculus username in the Streamer window &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ovpydi"&gt;If you don’t know it off the top of your head, you can find it by opening the Oculus app on mobile, navigating to “Settings,” and then tapping on the area that shows your name and email address. The name that will display next to your avatar is your username.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Oculus app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R-J0UPjJSbyMOlAcOy2iyZNZhBk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220804/oculusname.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having a hard time finding your Oculus username? Tap on your full name in the Settings menu to see this view pictured above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="dCc3Bu"&gt;After that’s entered, hit “Save”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RXWg5x"&gt;That’s the last step! But remember that it’s crucial to have the Virtual Desktop Streamer app open in order for your headset to communicate with your PC. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop Streamer" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uFCk8sazQ5CJ39c4U4ARWJVRwXA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220811/streamer.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what the Virtual Desktop Streamer app looks like. It’s very simple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FylPqj"&gt;Open Virtual Desktop on your Quest 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tFxMTY"&gt;You should see your PC pop up in the list of available devices to connect to from within the Virtual Desktop app on your Quest 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWDSZP"&gt;Once you’ve connected, the Options button (the left Touch controller’s equivalent of the Oculus button) is mapped to open up the top-level menu for Virtual Desktop, as shown in the image below. From there, clicking “Games” will reveal every game that’s installed on your PC. You can simply boot each one from there, and your PC will handle all of the hard work. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RetcNAlbbLJZGLVlASVqciHC1_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220812/virtudaldesktopgames.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the VR-ready games installed on your PC will show up within Virtual Desktop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E4ucp4"&gt;If you aren’t happy with the visual fidelity within each game, you’re free to customize some settings that affect latency, refresh rate, and more. Note that you’ll likely get a clearer, more fluid image if your PC is powerful. Your wireless router plays a huge role in delivering a smooth experience, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNzjSC"&gt;Streaming VR over Wi-Fi certainly isn’t a perfect solution. I play just a few feet away from a Wi-Fi 6-ready router that’s wired directly to my PC via an ethernet switch, yet I still experience the occasional spot of lag and slightly fuzzy image. Though with enough tweaking on the Virtual Desktop app (turning Wi-Fi off on seldom-used tech items never hurts), I think you’ll have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zU1OZb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook is turning VR into a platform — but some indie devs fear its power","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ot7NCR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The original article erroneously suggested that internet speed played a role in your ability to use this wireless solution to play your VR games. It’s all handled locally. Also, due to a malfunctioning USB-C port on the author’s PC, they erroneously stated that the USB-C cable included with each Quest 2 couldn’t be used to complete this how-to. A reader pointed out that it will work, and the author confirmed it by using the cable with an OTG adapter. We regret these errors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch, owned by Amazon, pulls Amazon’s anti-union ads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fkl2h5YThPKwhZbXStIkKlp8S48=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68875431/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="90e0WO"&gt;Twitch is removing the anti-union ads that its parent company, Amazon, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1364318690271969285?s=20"&gt;was running on the platform&lt;/a&gt;. The ads showed Amazon employees talking about why they want to vote no on unionization and directed viewers to Amazon’s “DoItWithoutDues” website. A Twitch spokesperson said the ads “should never have been allowed to run on [the] service,” as they violate its political advertising policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qhGp1D"&gt;Twitch also says that it is “evaluating [its] review processes to ensure that similar content does not run in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcC1Vz"&gt;The ads were reported by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1364328210771681293?s=20"&gt;More Perfect Union&lt;/a&gt;; their removal was first reported by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1365007592754466825?s=20"&gt;Rod Breslau&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTaiST"&gt;The ads were the latest entry in a long campaign aimed at disrupting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;organization efforts at an Amazon warehouse outside of Birmingham, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;. Those efforts involve pulling employees into mandatory meetings, near-daily texts to employees, relentless anti-union posters in the workplace, and even reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287191/amazon-alabama-warehouse-union-traffic-light-change-bessemer"&gt;changing the timing of traffic lights to disrupt a union drive&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon running the ads on a streaming platform it owns, however, was a very public move. It’s unclear if the company was targeting certain streams or viewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IiOUkB"&gt;Reached for comment, Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) president Stuart Appelbaum denounced the ad. “Amazon feels that it has to go to extremes like this in order to gaslight its workers about the dreadful working conditions at its Bessemer warehouse,” Appelbaum said, “Amazon is leaving no stone unturned - including ads on Twitch - in its efforts to deceive and intimidate their employees into voting against the union.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbkzhN"&gt;Amazon was not immediately available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vE19Pj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Amazon is running a second ad on Twitch in Alabama urging its workers in Bessemer to vote no on the union. &lt;a href="https://t.co/q3wTc0o7Im"&gt;pic.twitter.com/q3wTc0o7Im&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— More Perfect Union (@MorePerfectUS) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1364328210771681293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xfhlPP"&gt;The union has also been having its own media push, with &lt;a href="https://www.al.com/news/2021/02/danny-glover-bessemer-amazon-union-effort-a-strategic-moment-for-labor.html"&gt;actor Danny Glover&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/staceyabrams/status/1363282664384520193"&gt;Georgia politician Stacey Abrams&lt;/a&gt; encouraging workers to vote “yes.” Both talked about their connection with the South and how their upbringings and parents gave them respect for unions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpDr4s"&gt;The unionization fight comes after a string of troubling news for Amazon workers: the company allegedly forced its warehouse workers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266369/amazon-ten-hour-overnight-shifts-warehouse-workers"&gt;to work 10-hour overnight shifts&lt;/a&gt;, made plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265031/amazon-netradyne-driveri-survelliance-cameras-delivery-monitor-packages"&gt;install always-on surveillance cameras in its delivery vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, and is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287204/new-york-amazon-lawsuit-worker-safety-failures"&gt;being sued by the state of New York&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly failing to keep its frontline workers safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpowZT"&gt;The Alabama unionization vote began on February 8th and is scheduled to conclude on March 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7RPYC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 25th, 2:46PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added response from the RWDSU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart will have the Xbox Series X / S available at 3PM ET today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0QLzBUiSLAKlaLPRBADR3OBnbYo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68874647/vpavic_4275_20201030_0033.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Series X | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="njkeDE"&gt;If you missed Target’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22295791/xbox-series-x-s-restock-gamestop"&gt;early morning&lt;/a&gt; Xbox Series X restocks today, you have another chance today to secure Microsoft’s next-gen console. A Walmart spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the retailer will have the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-S%2F606518560&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Series S&lt;/a&gt; available for purchase today, February 25th, at 3PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfM933"&gt;Walmart told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; you will have two options to pay for the Xbox Series X — with a one-time payment of $499.99 or pay with Xbox All Access, which requires a monthly payment for 24 months. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935894/microsoft-xbox-all-access-bundle-offer-project-scarlett-upgrade-deal"&gt;Xbox All Access is a bundle&lt;/a&gt; that splits the cost of an Xbox console; Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes both versions of the video game streaming service; access to xCloud; and Xbox Live Gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AfBWYF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ASjwVc"&gt;If you are buying either an Xbox Series X or Series S, there are a few additional items outside of video games you may want to consider purchasing, such as an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF248LD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;additional controller&lt;/a&gt;. And unlike the PS5, you can purchase a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB SSD expansion&lt;/a&gt; to add to the Xbox’s base storage (512GB on the Series S, 1TB on the X), though it is not cheap. Alternatively, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Game-Drive-Xbox-Special/dp/B072LX7WLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an external hard drive to store your games&lt;/a&gt;, but any games stored through it will not take advantage of the next-gen hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zhFeF"&gt;If you are having trouble deciding on what games to buy, you can always buy a subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you access to a slew of digital games and access to Xbox Live Gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D0rS31"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Here’s where and when you can buy the Xbox Series S and Series X consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ex-5CndmZqOiQxMH1SbbYK2sEo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67448810/vpavic_4275_20201030_0050.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mlkkez"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 25th, 2021 12:36PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Walmart plans to restock both the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-S%2F606518560&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Series S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;today. You can find additional information &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22065347"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZoKH5"&gt;The Xbox Series S and Series X consoles are officially out. Due to the pandemic, combined with the high demand for these consoles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551484/best-buy-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-store-sales-holiday-2020"&gt;retailers like Best Buy and Target are only selling online&lt;/a&gt;. That means you won’t be able to walk into a store to pick one up — unless you’ve purchased it already online. Only then will you be able to arrange an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5s3rFB"&gt;Until we hear updates on stock replenishing from retailers, I recommend keeping it locked to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H75RTZ8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;amp;tag=verge-evergreen-20&amp;amp;linkId=e8ef14f64e0e9e1dacba6db0add8b578&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fxbox-series-x-video-games%2F-%2FN-fd2hh&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpromotions%2Fgaming%2F20-1310%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, and (if you have memberships) &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-brand-showcase.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fprod24980179&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723309405282483811" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy encourages shoppers to visit its site&lt;/a&gt; to order instead of showing up at its stores. It doesn’t have set time slots for when it expects stock to be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVxesu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="hLH7PZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ejjLHa"&gt;If you’re trying to decide between the Xbox Series S or Series X, my colleague Tom Warren recently reviewed both consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cqFv0O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="hCC7LP"&gt;Buy with the Xbox All Access plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="tnxiJL"&gt;As an alternative to paying full price upfront for each console, you can pay a monthly installment for either of them through the Xbox All Access plan. It’s a financing option that lets you get the console upfront at no cost. You’ll be billed one monthly payment for the console and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate together ($24.99 per month for the Series S, $34.99 per month for the Series X) for 24 months. Available at the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-all-access%23findaretailer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fxbox-one%2Fxbox-all-access%2Fpcmcat1579299055180.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1579299055180&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fcp%2Fxbox-all-access%2F8571041&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fxbox-all-access%2F-%2FN-he40f&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="fCqybd"&gt;Nvidia &lt;em&gt;supposedly&lt;/em&gt; launched a $329 graphics card today, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;the GeForce RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve yet to see much proof. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDbKA7"&gt;Orders began today at 9AM PT / 12PM ET for a card whose listed prices ranged from $329.99 &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-floods-us-retailers-starting-from-329-to-629"&gt;all the way up to $629.99&lt;/a&gt;, averaging $471. Those aren’t scalper prices, mind you. They’re the retail prices set by Nvidia’s partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lTz8Q"&gt;As far as I can tell, the only places that actually claimed to stock a card for $329.99 were Newegg and EVGA’s own website, and neither simply put the card on sale: Newegg is only raffling off chances to buy the cards, and EVGA has a queue where you hit a “notify me” button. In both cases, you wait for the company to hopefully email you back with good news.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3_3NgODyeeBdicylvMKe2l_grWU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328790/newegg_3060.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newegg listings pointed you straight to the Newegg Shuffle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eqZqkM"&gt;The raffle and queue are good things, in my opinion! It means you might maybe possibly have a chance to actually get one. You have until 12PM PT / 3PM ET today to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fproduct-shuffle&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F25%2F22301391%2Fnvidia-rtx-3060-launch-supply-demand-newegg-shuffle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;enter the Newegg Shuffle&lt;/a&gt;, which features a PS5 bundle as well, and you’ll know by 2PM PT / 5PM ET if you luck out. But it also means we’ll have little evidence that $329 is the actual price of this GPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQCoPd"&gt;There’s also a question of whether Nvidia initially managed to ship many 3060s. Queues and raffles aside, today seemed to have some of the most sparse GPU availability yet, with some accusing Nvidia of a “paper launch” &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/amds-radeon-rx-6800-cards-sell-out-instantly-sparking-cries-of-paper-launch"&gt;much like AMD’s RX 6800 series in November&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;PCGamer&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/news/live/where-to-buy-nvidia-rtx-3060-graphics-card/"&gt;gave up live-blogging the launch&lt;/a&gt; after an hour of failure. Best Buy barely had them. At some other retailers, they never showed up. I saw listings for some versions straight-up pulled off the web. Micro Center only had them in store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kBB1h"&gt;One bright spot (for US gamers anyhow): Best Buy wound up restocking a variety of &lt;em&gt;other &lt;/em&gt;Nvidia GPUs today, with the 3060 Ti, 3070, and even the hardest-to-find 3080 popping up from time to time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RO1N3D"&gt;In fact, it may have shown just how rough the RTX 3060 launch is: I was sitting &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/falcodrin"&gt;Falcodrin’s Twitch channel&lt;/a&gt;, a popular hangout where people try to track down the cards and share their success, and Falcodrin ran a poll where &lt;em&gt;only two people &lt;/em&gt;admitted to nabbing a 3060 at all:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kE7FT3E2zy5M7r_NWUbtjbTZu4Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328803/falcodrin_poll_600.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Falcodrin’s poll.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jaNeOp"&gt;It’s also worth noting that at least two of the four supposedly $329.99 graphics cards look suspiciously like token offerings to meet that price. EVGA has a second near-identical version of the 3060 with a very slightly higher boost clock that retails for $390.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NYoPw_FT5gqiSdOjT__oRWh1wmY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328825/evga_cards.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ll let you guess which one’s the less expensive “Black” model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nNA5JU"&gt;And while Newegg might be listing Zotac’s 3060 Twin Edge for $329.99, Zotac itself lists it and briefly sold &lt;a href="https://www.zotacstore.com/us/zotac-gaming-geforce-rtx-3060-twin-edge-zt-a30600e-10m"&gt;the exact same card&lt;/a&gt; this morning for $479.99. (I saw the add to cart button on one refresh, but Zotac’s website crapped out, and it was out of stock as soon as I returned.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqI2jk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;The RTX 3060 is a good card&lt;/a&gt;, but even at $330, I think you might want to wait and see what’s next since the 3060 Ti is so much better. At $400 and up, that goes double. But maybe you didn’t have a choice to begin with. We’re asking Nvidia if it has more thoughts, and we’ll let you know what we hear. EVGA would only confirm that it’s shipping a $329.99 GPU, and that “we have more supply on the way.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The House’s three big ideas to take on tech power</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Second Senate Impeachment Trial Of Donald Trump" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ARqdgguGZbwlc-wI_fDxWkHRMlo=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68875284/1231142725.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AulRfL"&gt;Last year, House Judiciary Committee lawmakers topped off a yearslong investigation into anti-competitive behavior in the tech industry by bringing in some of the most powerful chief executives in the market. Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai headlined one of the biggest must-watch hearings last summer and they faced tough lines of questioning from lawmakers who (for the most part) did their homework, prepped with thousands of pages of evidence alleging illegal business practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Up9bLX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10347701"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BJiO1D"&gt;Lawmakers shined a light on some of tech’s shady business practices, and now they’re getting ready to finish the job. On Thursday, the House Judiciary’s subcommittee on antitrust returned for a far less flashy hearing with experts. It’s the beginning of a second and far more important phase of the committee’s work, pinning down new rules that would address those practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BS4a7j"&gt;On paper, Thursday’s hearing was about analyzing how big tech platforms act as gatekeepers and create barriers to entry — but really it was about testing out three new avenues for keeping tech companies in line and seeing which ones might gain support from tech-skeptical Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="esBtra"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IT MEANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="67hO7r"&gt;Arguably, the most revealing parts of last year’s hearing with tech CEOs had to do with their abilities to shove competitors out of the market. Zuckerberg was pressed over an email from former Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom saying that the Facebook CEO would go “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21335706/antitrust-hearing-highlights-facebook-google-amazon-apple-congress-testimony"&gt;destroy mode&lt;/a&gt;” if Instagram didn’t sell. Bezos said he couldn’t “guarantee” that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21347083/jeff-bezos-amazon-tech-antitrust-hearing-jayapal-questioning"&gt;Amazon employees weren’t looking&lt;/a&gt; at data from independent sellers to help develop their own products. Cook and Pichai &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21335706/antitrust-hearing-highlights-facebook-google-amazon-apple-congress-testimony"&gt;were both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21346999/google-sundar-pichai-antitrust-hearing-business-model-david-cicilline-questioning"&gt;pressed on reports&lt;/a&gt; that they used their platforms to squash competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKhC0h"&gt;But at Thursday’s hearing, the subcommittee moved beyond calling out bad behavior and laid out three big areas where Congress could actually take action. They’re still general ideas instead of specific proposals, but you can expect to see these same ideas in whatever tech regulation bills come forward over the next few months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uubzd3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big three: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="XUWG9Z"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Data interoperability and portability:&lt;/strong&gt; Users should be able to take their data elsewhere with ease. &lt;em&gt;Example: Think about how you can move your phone number between carriers. Before the 1996 Telecommunications Act, that wasn’t always an option!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MFGxaV"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Nondiscrimination:&lt;/strong&gt; Basically, a dominant platform shouldn’t be able to preference its own products over those of its competitors. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SJJWNg"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Structural remedies:&lt;/strong&gt; Breaking apart different lines of business or platforms under one company. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="wfwDLE"&gt;Portability and interoperability rules are the measure that’s least threatening to tech companies. A bunch of those products were released in the wake of the GDPR, and it’s easy for Facebook and Google to develop more without touching their core businesses. Nondiscrimination is a little scarier — particularly for Apple and Amazon — but it’s still workable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgnFWU"&gt;Some of those ideas might even get bipartisan support. &lt;a href="https://buck.house.gov/sites/buck.house.gov/files/wysiwyg_uploaded/Buck%20Report.pdf"&gt;In his Third Way&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;report last year&lt;/a&gt;, Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) called for data portability and more funding for antitrust regulators at the Justice Department and FTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57n7tn"&gt;But the antitrust wing of the Democratic Party won’t be satisfied with a few new app store rules and a little more money for the FTC. In &lt;a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3429"&gt;their recommendations last October&lt;/a&gt;, Democrats on the committee called for a kind of Glass-Steagall Act for the internet, breaking apart different lines of business in response to monopoly concerns. It would lay the groundwork for splitting off Instagram from Facebook or Amazon Web Services from Amazon — basically leveling the tech landscape by force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUPsdV"&gt;This is the worst-case scenario for tech companies — and as much as Republicans complain about Jeff Bezos, they still largely oppose the idea. It’s hard to imagine a trust-busting bill attracting support from fence-sitters like Rep. Buck, much less the more tech-friendly members of the caucus. Just like in the stimulus and minimum-wage fights, Democrats have to decide whether to play for a bipartisan fix or push through a more progressive policy on their own. But judging from this hearing, Democrats aren’t ready to give up on a full-scale breakup just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gwkehJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT DIDN’T THEY ASK? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cpjLoI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222637/amazon-workers-aws-stop-hosting-services-parler-capitol-violence"&gt;Amazon kicked Parler off its web hosting service&lt;/a&gt; after last month’s deadly attack on the Capitol. Parler was a popular platform with the rioters who stormed the Capitol, and without Amazon’s web hosting, the platform was effectively kicked offline until it could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22284036/parler-social-network-relaunch-new-hosting"&gt;find a new company to host the site in mid-February&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSJJfA"&gt;Since Parler was deplatformed, &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; Republicans have turned away from Section 230 reform and toward antitrust as a remedy to their beef with a focus on Amazon. Republican FCC commissioners have used the incident to make shaky comparisons to network neutrality and cloud infrastructure. But after Parler went down, Ranking Member Buck tweeted that he would be “introducing legislation this Congress to hold Amazon accountable for their anticompetitive behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SA55Jh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Amazon crushes small businesses. They cheat and steal. Now they want to join Google and Facebook in censoring. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will be introducing legislation this Congress to hold Amazon accountable for their anticompetitive behavior. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BigTechReckoning?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#BigTechReckoning&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/lChxvMFFuZ"&gt;https://t.co/lChxvMFFuZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Congressman Ken Buck (@RepKenBuck) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1348105739760504834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lG5k0b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what I would have liked to hear from Republicans:   &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HsyKfQ"&gt;How do cloud services like AWS fit into antitrust reform outside of just providing an additional line of revenue for companies? What if Amazon deplatformed a nascent e-commerce platform using its services?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iLxvq7"&gt;What are the ramifications of stripping companies like Amazon from their cloud services? Should this be included in any measures the committee proposes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZGg5aN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT’S NEXT? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ctIafC"&gt;The House Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on antitrust &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/house-begins-brewing-new-tech-antitrust-laws-ae61ef26-12d2-4516-89df-6797bfecd249.html"&gt;still has two more hearings&lt;/a&gt; to complete before they start filing legislation. They’re expecting to start introducing those bills this spring, but that doesn’t mean they’ll become law anytime soon. There will likely be even more hearings and a markup process before those bills get close to votes on the floor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4boLNR"&gt;We also need to hear what the Senate is thinking. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), the chair of the Senate’s antitrust panel, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-unveils-sweeping-antitrust-bill-laying-out-her-vision-as-new-subcommittee-chair-.html"&gt;introduced the Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month that doesn’t do nearly as much as the House is considering for legislation. Klobuchar’s bill would provide antitrust enforcers with more resources to bring cases to trial and conduct extensive reviews of markets and merger effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odMhz0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How one of Google’s massive undersea cables detects earthquakes  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T9DSPP8IIwTaDZ-2NHHSlD2R1wQ=/0x5:2040x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68875224/GettyImages_695501024.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An operator works during the mooring of an undersea fiber optic cable at Arrietara beach near the Spanish Basque village of Sopelana on June 13, 2017.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Ander Gillenea / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Em5EY7"&gt;The web of undersea cables that transmit data around the world could one day be used to track earthquakes and tsunamis, according to new research. During a test run last year, one of Google’s fiber-optic cables was able to successfully pick up on nearby earthquakes by detecting distortions in light pulses sent along the cable. It’s a new approach to an idea that researchers have been working on for the past several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K0myoE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Can we find a less expensive way to cover the ocean with geophysical sensors? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W1VWT5"&gt;“Can we find a less expensive way to cover the ocean with geophysical sensors? There’s already this telecommunication cable infrastructure out there. If you can turn them into sensors, that’s wonderful — and that’s what we’re doing now,” says Zhongwen Zhan, an assistant professor of geophysics at the California Institute of Technology and lead author of the research published today in the &lt;a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abe6648"&gt;journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJrhz7"&gt;On top of their main job of sending data all over the world, these cables could one day send early warnings to people on shore when a tsunami is barreling their way. They could also give seismologists and geophysicists a closer look at earthquakes that occur underwater. Since nearly all the sensors currently used to detect earthquakes are on land, these cables could fill in huge gaps in scientists’ ability to observe seismic activity. The novel approach doesn’t even require installing any new equipment to the existing web of more than a million kilometers of fiber optic cables that cut across the seafloor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QVdAl"&gt;The new approach capitalizes on what the cables are already designed to do. When a transmitter at one end of the cable sends out a light signal transmitting data, light waves are oriented in a particular direction. If an earthquake hits, it might shake, bend, or twist the cable — and that changes the orientation of the light waves. At the other end of the cable, Google notices distortions and corrects them. Now, it wants to share its data, changes to what’s called the “state of polarization” of light, with seismologists like Zhan so they can study the earthquakes that caused the distortions.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGh9tM"&gt;Between December 2019 and September 2020, Zhan’s research team documented roughly 20 moderate to large earthquakes using Google’s 10,500-kilometer-long cable, Curie, which runs from Los Angeles, California to Valparaíso, Chile. The cable was also able to pick up swells in the ocean caused by storms. That suggests the technique can also be used to spot tsunamis, which earthquakes can trigger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="5Yq75Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ability to see tsunamis while they’re still far from shore could save lives&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cme1Hw"&gt;The ability to see tsunamis while they’re still far from shore could save lives. Beyond having a better view of the ocean than the small number of existing sensors specifically designed to look for tsunamis, fiber optic cables can also send warnings to shore much faster — perhaps in a matter of milliseconds, according to Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0YHEEb"&gt;“We’re humbled and excited by the possibility of collaborating with the optical, subsea and seismic research communities to use all of our cable infrastructure for greater societal benefits,” Google wrote in a &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/using-subsea-cables-to-detect-earthquakes"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; last July, shortly after the company had reached out to Zhan to further develop the new approach to seismic sensing on the seafloor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BB6UzU"&gt;“We hope this new approach can really give people a better chance of catching those events early on, so that people have more time to react,” Zhan says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuJdxQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/06/seafloor-cables-carry-world-s-internet-traffic-can-also-detect-earthquakes"&gt;In 2018&lt;/a&gt;, similar research was published that showed that seafloor cables had the potential to detect earthquakes and tsunamis — but that approach came with some limitations. Cables needed to be fitted with specialized equipment to shoot lasers down the cable. In comparison, this new approach saves money because it doesn’t require any new infrastructure. There were also concerns that adding equipment to the cables could open the door to security breaches, allowing bad actors to access data sent across the network. Zhan says that’s not an issue with the new approach; scientists can’t see information about the transmitted content when studying the polarization of light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEjWrA"&gt;“It’s a perfectly safe way of leveraging pre-existing infrastructures to do something that is good for the society and science,” Zhan says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="UBjdDT"&gt;Blue Origin is delaying the debut launch of its massive, centerpiece rocket New Glenn to late 2022, the company announced Thursday, citing a key Pentagon contract it lost out on to rival firms SpaceX and United Launch Alliance as the reason for the delay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0PxOB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164469/blue-origin-payload-fairing-nose-cone-new-glenn-rocket-completed"&gt;New Glenn&lt;/a&gt; is a massive, partially reusable heavy-lift rocket designed to launch anything from national security payloads and commercial satellites. Its first flight was previously slated for sometime in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xT0fhY"&gt;“The current target for New Glenn’s maiden flight is Q4 2022,” the company &lt;a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/new-glenns-progress-towards-maiden-flight"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a statement on Thursday. “The Blue Origin team has been in contact with all of our customers to ensure this baseline meets their launch needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsA78Q"&gt;Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin’s founder and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/16/jeff-bezos-reclaims-spot-as-worlds-richest-person-from-elon-musk.html"&gt;currently&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the world’s richest man, has invested billions into the New Glenn program, which has involved the construction of sprawling rocket production facilities in Cape Canaveral, Florida and an extensive renovation to the Space Coast’s Launch Complex 36, which Blue Origin leased in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vs9vOH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That loss “was a big hit for us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SzbocS"&gt;The company bid for hefty launch contracts under the Air Force’s next-generation national security launch program, which guaranteed two winning rocket companies multibillion-dollar contracts and a share of all Pentagon launches between 2022 to 2027. The Air Force &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21359219/spacex-ula-us-defense-department-award-rocket-launch"&gt;announced its decision last year&lt;/a&gt; — Blue Origin lost out to SpaceX and United Launch Alliance (a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVXUl8"&gt;That loss “was a big hit for us,” Jarrett Jones, Blue Origin’s senior vice president for New Glenn, &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/blue-origin-delays-first-launch-of-new-glenn-to-late-2022/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;SpaceNews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, claiming it cost Blue Origin up to $3 billion. The design of New Glenn was partially tailored to send Pentagon satellites to space, and Blue Origin executives “had to consider the economics” when the Air Force went with other companies instead, Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GWuUa"&gt;“We hope to launch [national security] payloads in the future, and remain committed to serving the U.S. national defense mission,” a Blue Origin statement said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WboQsA"&gt;Blue Origin received $255 million of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/10/17961832/defense-department-launch-service-agreement-ula-blue-origin-northrop-grumman"&gt;$500 million award from the Air Force&lt;/a&gt; as part of a precursor program to aid New Glenn development. As planned, the company was cut off from the award’s full amount after losing in the subsequent program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DNpHff"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Freed from Amazon, Bezos is expected to refocus on Blue Origin&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jnkm20"&gt;But Bezos, unshackled from Amazon after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;announcing his decision to step down as CEO&lt;/a&gt;, is now expected to ramp up his involvement in managing Blue Origin, which he founded as a passion project in 2000. He &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/5/15200102/jeff-bezos-amazon-stock-blue-origin-space-travel-funding"&gt;said in 2017 he was liquidating $1 billion a year&lt;/a&gt; in Amazon stock  to help fund Blue Origin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5GIbN"&gt;Though it has yet to reach orbit and has fallen well behind SpaceX, which Elon Musk founded in 2002, Blue Origin in recent years has stepped up its competitive footing in the space industry. It’s currently leading a team of established defense companies in a bid to provide &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22258815/nasa-moon-lander-awards-biden-spacex-blue-origin-moonshot"&gt;NASA’s next ride to the moon&lt;/a&gt; with its human lunar lander Blue Moon. SpaceX is also vying for that award with its Starship rocket system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFAcb3"&gt;Another crucial business line for the company is its liquid BE-4 rocket engine that powers New Glenn. That engine &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/27/17909342/blue-origin-be-4-engine-united-launch-alliance-vulcan-rocket"&gt;will also power United Launch Alliance’s rocket, Vulcan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— the same one that beat New Glenn to a lucrative Pentagon contract. Vulcan is on target for a late 2021 debut launch. And after some development hiccups last year, Blue Origin is expected to ship the flight-ready BE-4 engines to ULA in mid-2021 to keep Vulcan on schedule. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JZCFBK"&gt;In the meantime, Blue Origin is taking its time with New Glenn (its motto, Gradatim Ferociter, is Latin for “Step by step, ferociously”). A test version of a New Glenn first stage briefly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WordsmithFL/status/1360246535225810945?s=20"&gt;emerged from the company’s Florida facilities&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, giving rocket enthusiasts one of the first major peaks at some New Glenn hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iBBVt3"&gt;And the company’s new Tank Cleaning and Testing facility, toured in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1364968720364429317?s=20"&gt;video it tweeted&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, has become one of the only buildings tall enough to share the Cape Canaveral skyline with NASA’s behemoth Vehicle Assembly Building, which stands tall a few miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwj5t4"&gt;Blue Origin said its expanse on Florida’s Space Coast has led to “more than 600 jobs” and represents an investment of $2.5 billion, which includes $1 billion to revamp Launch Complex 36, “which is nearing completion.”&lt;/p&gt;
