    <title>Wooting Two HE review: an analog keyboard in a digital world </title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The ecosystem isn’t quite ready&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Qm6zd3"&gt;Like most PC gamers, I split my time between playing using a mouse and keyboard and a console controller. Nothing beats the precision of a mouse in first- and third-person shooters, but for me, a keyboard is no match for an analog stick in racing games or platformers. They both have different strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2Z5ZT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://wooting.io/wooting_two_he"&gt;Wooting’s Two HE keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, which starts at $174.99 without keycaps, is the company’s latest attempt to bridge that gap, offering some of the benefits of analog control in the form factor of a keyboard. This time around, it achieves this with Gateron-manufactured “Lekker” switches, which use magnetic Hall effect sensors rather than typical metal contacts to detect when they’ve been pressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0bG2D"&gt;It’s an interesting idea, and Wooting has more or less nailed its implementation, with a design and software that makes setting up this unusual form factor relatively painless. But in practice, I found that a lot of PC games end up getting confused by this unusual keyboard’s analog controls, which limits their usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84nBzj"&gt;A quick note on availability: Wooting doesn’t currently have any Two HEs available to ship immediately and lists the Wooting Two HE as being available for preorder. The next US batch is due to ship in April 2022, while in Europe, there is a small number available that’ll ship in December, with the rest expected to also ship in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lu0jam"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10880485"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GDDcoO"&gt;The central feature of the Wooting Two HE is its custom Lekker switches, which are what allow it to offer analog controls. Unlike traditional Cherry MX switches, which use metal contacts to register a keypress, Wooting’s switches have small magnets in their stems and a Hall effect sensor in their circuit board that can sense when it moves. So while Cherry MX-style switches only have two states (pressed or not pressed), Wooting’s latest switches can detect gradients of a press of anywhere between 0.1mm and 4mm, aka the difference between lightly tapping a key or pushing it all the way down. This range of motion is also improved compared to the optical analog Flaretech switches used in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/1/11832654/wooting-analog-mechanical-keyboard-kickstarter"&gt;Wooting One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://wooting.io/wootingtwo"&gt;original Wooting Two&lt;/a&gt;, which could only detect between 1.5mm and 3.6mm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lLhMZc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Magnets, how do they work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IGiwAX"&gt;Considering its unusual functionality, there’s nothing too unusual about the Wooting Two HE’s design. It uses a full-size layout including a numpad (currently available with US, UK, German, and Nordic layouts), features per-key RGB backlighting, and connects to a computer using a detachable USB-C cable. There are three channels for routing the cable out of the top of the keyboard, which is handy if you’d rather have it come out of the top left or top right of the board. Although the cable is nice and braided, the keyboard as a whole has a bit of a plastic feel to it that’s unbecoming of its higher-end price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2s6Jj"&gt;The Wooting Two HE starts at $174.99 without keycaps, but there are keycaps made from ABS plastic available in a bundle for $184.99 or more premium PBT keycaps for $194.99. Regardless of which you opt for, the keyboard currently doesn’t come with its keycaps preinstalled, meaning you have to manually install all 100-plus keycaps yourself. This kind of self-assembly might make sense when you’re buying your keyboard and keycaps from different places, but it feels odd when they come in the same box (Wooting tells me this won’t be the case for future US orders with PBT keycaps). I had no issues with the ABS keycaps that came with my review sample, but for just a $10 premium, I think it makes sense to step up to PBT, a plastic that generally has a reputation for being more durable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t8vpgZfTETKkUhaqwjwFwb9Ct8U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006804/jporter_211111_4873_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An exposed Lekker switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H6j0j1"&gt;The Wooting Two HE’s Lekker switches are also hot-swappable, so in theory, they can be easily removed from the board using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_extractor"&gt;IC extractors&lt;/a&gt; or other switch pullers (sold separately) and without the need for soldering. But this doesn’t matter a huge amount because, for now, at least, there aren’t any third-party compatible alternatives for you to swap in. Wooting includes four spare switches in the box with the keyboard, though, which should be helpful in case one of the switches breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZZcwx"&gt;Use the Wooting Two HE for everyday work, and it feels much like any other linear mechanical keyboard to type on. The Lekker switch’s design isn’t dissimilar to Cherry MX Reds, although weirdly, the typing sound almost reminds me of using a keyboard with Topre switches thanks to its slightly hollowed-out sound. The Cherry stabilizers do rattle, though, so be prepared to make some modifications if you’re sensitive to that sort of thing. It’s not the nicest keyboard I’ve ever typed on, but it’s functional enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="KkQgxl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10880512"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xh2TuO"&gt;Naturally, things get a lot more interesting once you download &lt;a href="https://wooting.io/wootility"&gt;Wootility&lt;/a&gt;, Wooting’s companion software that’s available across Windows, Mac, and Linux. It’s this that lets you get the most out of the keyboard’s analog switches, which it handles alongside other more traditional keyboard companion app tasks like setting up custom lighting schemes with the keyboard’s RGB backlighting or remapping its layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3j7UV"&gt;For starters, you can reprogram their “actuation point,” which is the distance they’re pressed down before a keypress is registered. This can be set anywhere from 0.1mm to 4mm. So if you’re a heavy typist prone to accidental keypresses, you might want to set up the keyboard so you have to press a key 3.5mm before it registers a press. Or, if you want the keyboard to feel as responsive as possible, you might set the actuation point to 0.5mm, so you barely have to touch the key before it actuates. These can even be set on a per-key basis. For what it’s worth, I left the keyboard set on a middle-of-the-road 2mm actuation point, which is similar to what Cherry uses for its standard MX Red switches. I’m a basic man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XNKI8vjRoQ_qdk5eebwudWeQAUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006803/jporter_211111_4873_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The per-key RGB backlighting in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R0UXbu"&gt;Another piece of functionality enabled with analog switches is the Wooting Two HE’s rapid trigger technology. Unlike a traditional switch, which only deactivates once it’s released back to a specific reset point, the Lekker switches can deactivate the second the keyboard senses you’re lifting your finger up and can reactivate the moment you’re pushing your finger back down. In theory, this should make the keyboard feel more responsive, particularly in fast-paced games, but I couldn’t discern much of a difference in everyday usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BFKF6K"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gamepad-style controls, on a keyboard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5GAaIC"&gt;The most interesting aspect of the Wooting Two HE, for me, was the possibility of remapping gamepad-style analog controls to the keyboard. Considering the slightly dizzying array of options at your disposal, Wooting’s software does a surprisingly good job at making this setup process simple and pain-free. For a first-person game, you might want to map the left analog stick’s up, left, down, and right motions to the W, A, S, and D keys, respectively. Or, for a racing game, it might make more sense to have a controller’s right and left triggers mapped to W and S while leaving the A and D keys to tilt a virtual left analog stick left and right. So long as a game supports either Xinput or DirectInput, it should work with the Wooting Two HE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xf1Mvl"&gt;It’s possible to also map non-analog gamepad buttons like A, B, X, and Y to the Wooting Two HE, but in most cases, I found it less complicated to rely on regular keyboard controls for these other commands. So, for example, in &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding,&lt;/em&gt; I set WASD to emulate an analog stick but used regular keyboard controls for every other in-game action (you need to enable the “Enable Keyboards keys” toggle in Wootility for this to work). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-hgofnC5RcmUkx3lqqZF7W1PHbY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006805/jporter_211111_4873_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can switch between analog profiles using the shortcut buttons on the top right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ob5nfa"&gt;These control schemes are very specific to certain genres, so thankfully, it’s possible to save three analog profiles on the keyboard, and then you switch between them using the keyboard’s A1, A2, and A3 keys. You can also save additional profiles and swap them into one of these shortcut slots when necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7tNmu"&gt;That’s the theory, but in practice, it’s a bit more of a mixed bag. Initially, I thought that any games that rely on keyboard for movement and mouse for camera and aiming controls would be a great match for the Wooting Two HE. A mouse is indisputably more accurate for aiming, but a gamepad’s left analog stick offers more fine-grained movement. But the problem is that a lot of games simply aren’t set up to let you control movement using what is effectively an emulated gamepad, alongside a traditional mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TPsxU0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wooting’s software deals well with complexity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YZqaDm"&gt;When trying to play &lt;em&gt;Deathloop, &lt;/em&gt;I found that the game refused to allow me to use a mouse for aiming while it thought I was moving with an analog stick. And I had a similar problem in &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes&lt;/em&gt;. Wooting is aware of these issues, but unfortunately, it’s something that would need to be addressed by individual game developers to fix. Look out for games that support “&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Special:CargoQuery&amp;amp;tables=Infobox_game%2CInput&amp;amp;fields=Infobox_game._pageName%2CInfobox_game.Developers%2CInfobox_game.Publishers%2CInfobox_game.Released%2CInfobox_game.Available_on%2CInput.Simultaneous_input%3DSupported&amp;amp;where=Input.Simultaneous_input%3D%27true%27+OR+Input.Simultaneous_input%3D%27limited%27+OR+Input.Simultaneous_input%3D%27hackable%27&amp;amp;join_on=Infobox_game._pageName%3DInput._pageName&amp;amp;order_by%5B0%5D=%60cargo__Infobox_game%60.%60_pageName%60&amp;amp;order_by%5B1%5D=%60cargo__Infobox_game%60.%60Developers__full%60+&amp;amp;order_by%5B2%5D=%60cargo__Infobox_game%60.%60Publishers__full%60+&amp;amp;order_by%5B3%5D=%60cargo__Infobox_game%60.%60Released__full%60+&amp;amp;order_by%5B4%5D=%60cargo__Infobox_game%60.%60Available_on__full%60+&amp;amp;format=template&amp;amp;offset=100&amp;amp;limit=100&amp;amp;named_args=yes&amp;amp;intro=%3Ctable+style%3D%22text-align%3A+center%3B+margin%3A+0+auto%3B+width%3A+auto%22%3E%0A%09%3Ctr%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd%3E%3Cdiv+title%3D%22Native+support%22+class%3D%22svg-icon+svg-25+tickcross-true%22%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd%3E%3Cbig%3ENative+support%3C%2Fbig%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd+style%3D%22padding-left%3A25px%22%3E%3Cdiv+title%3D%22Limited+native+support%22+class%3D%22svg-icon+svg-25+tickcross-limited%22%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd%3E%3Cbig%3ELimited+native+support%3C%2Fbig%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd+style%3D%22padding-left%3A25px%22%3E%3Cdiv+title%3D%22Always+on+%28no+native+option%29%22+class%3D%22svg-icon+svg-25+tickcross-always-on%22%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd%3E%3Cbig%3EAlways+on%3C%2Fbig%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd+style%3D%22padding-left%3A25px%22%3E%3Cdiv+title%3D%22Hackable%22+class%3D%22svg-icon+svg-25+tickcross-hackable%22%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd%3E%3Cbig%3ERequires+manual+fix%3C%2Fbig%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd+style%3D%22padding-left%3A25px%22%3E%3Cdiv+title%3D%22No+native+support%22+class%3D%22svg-icon+svg-25+tickcross-false%22%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd%3E%3Cbig%3ENo+native+support%3C%2Fbig%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%3C%2Ftr%3E%0A%3C%2Ftable%3E%0A%0A%3Cdiv+style%3D%22margin-top%3A10px%22%3E%3Ccenter%3ENative+support+may+require+selecting+certain+settings+in+the+game+or+launcher.+Refer+to+the+individual+game+pages+for+details.%3C%2Fcenter%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%0A%0A%3Ctable+class%3D%22wikitable+sortable%22+style%3D%22width%3A+100%25%3Btext-align%3A+center%22%3E%0A%09%3Ctr%3E%0A%09%09%3Cth+style%3D%22width%3A195px%3B%22%3EGame%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Cth+style%3D%22width%3A+30px%3B%22%3EDeveloper%3C%2Fth%3E%0A%09%09%3Cth+style%3D%22width%3A+30px%3B%22%3EPublisher%3C%2Fth%3E%0A%09%09%3Cth+style%3D%22width%3A+30px%3B%22%3ERelease+date%3C%2Fth%3E%0A%09%09%3Cth+style%3D%22width%3A+30px%3B%22%3ESystems%3C%2Fth%3E%0A%09%09%3Cth+style%3D%22width%3A+20px%3B%22%3ESupported%3C%2Fth%3E%0A%09%3C%2Ftr%3E&amp;amp;template=Feature%2Frow&amp;amp;outro=%3C%2Ftable%3E"&gt;simultaneous input&lt;/a&gt;” if you want an indication that they’ll work with the Wooting Two HE, but be aware there are many out there where this won’t be an option without jumping through significant hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTQMBW"&gt;I had better luck with other titles. &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead 2 &lt;/em&gt;worked without any issues, as did the &lt;em&gt;Halo: Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer beta and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, but unfortunately, none of these are games that benefit from being able to walk slowly. They’re pretty much designed for you to be running full-pelt at all times. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/umUQShPGZdyt1QFo-bhp1ruMV4k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23034688/wootility_lekker_beta_YGQr4swUO2.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Wootility&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wooting’s software, featuring a keymap designed for racing games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FRKEZ3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; was perhaps the game that most played into the Wooting Two HE’s strengths. Analog control is perfect for the kind of delicate touch the game asks of you as you maneuver Sam Porter Bridges, laden with gear and deliveries, over difficult terrain. The experience wasn’t perfect, however, because of the way the on-screen button prompts would flit between showing keyboard and mouse or gamepad controls depending on what input method it thought you were using with the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CaYcZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; was a much bigger success because it saw me exclusively use the keyboard for control rather than using it alongside a mouse. Rather than using multiple small taps to try and smoothly turn the car, the Wooting Two HE let me half depress the A or D key to make a smooth turn, and I could also roll off the accelerator to try and recover from oversteer without having to either hit the brakes or stop accelerating entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pPSjna"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many games were confused by the Wooting Two HE&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i923M1"&gt;Despite the improvements, given the option, I’d still opt to play a racing game with a force-feedback-enabled controller or, even better, a full steering wheel. For the sake of balance, I tried racing with an Xbox One controller paired with my PC using Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless Adapter, and I immediately felt more at home in &lt;em&gt;Forza&lt;/em&gt;. Nothing beats being able to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; the car start to slide with your hands and then compensate accordingly, rather than having to look out for audiovisual cues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLw5KN"&gt;Maybe this is an unfair comparison. After all, Wooting doesn’t claim that its keyboard is capable of offering force feedback. But it highlights some of the drawbacks of a keyboard like the Two HE. In attempting to bridge the gap between a keyboard and a gamepad, it can end up feeling like a half measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWyTgp"&gt;I also ran into an annoying bug during my time with the keyboard. On more than one occasion, Windows refused to pick up the Wooting Two HE’s gamepad inputs at all. I could usually fix it by unplugging and then replugging the keyboard into my PC using USB or by following the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__wooting.helpscoutdocs.com_article_38-2Danalog-2Dinput-2Dis-2Dnot-2Dworking&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=476jdkIgGUarAZOh8c7rGQ0y2cYvQOVP4r7SgCS1JPE&amp;amp;m=aIkdyzesyzqp1MsLS9Fxw5wrv2CcuyDmuVAW-yFFRbrTXlevOsPs7NDjDTA1t6HC&amp;amp;s=bP66pG50P7gnNfuNki_w7OyBcyGGPSiHRX1yVvQFib0&amp;amp;e="&gt;steps in Wooting’s troubleshooting guide&lt;/a&gt;, but it was far from seamless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WRiG7WT5AWeyUuK9qPVN9vCfjeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006806/jporter_211111_4873_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wooting Two HE in a UK-ISO layout. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r4Zs8v"&gt;The Wooting Two HE achieves more or less what it says it’ll achieve. Its keys are capable of registering analog inputs, and its software makes it easy to remap them to function as gamepad controls. It delivers on its promises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4r0Wc"&gt;But its biggest problem is that it’s a niche product that most PC games aren’t designed to accommodate, and the result is that several of the titles I tried got confused when they sensed me using a gamepad and mouse simultaneously. That’s not the fault of Wooting, but ultimately, its keyboard is operating in an ecosystem that doesn’t recognize it exists. Meanwhile, the benefits of other features like an adjustable actuation point and more responsive keypresses are marginal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="aBpRis"&gt;If you only want to use one peripheral for your PC gaming, then the Wooting Two HE is a much more flexible alternative than most regular keyboards. But I’d stop short of claiming it can match a traditional gamepad, and I think most people would be better off with having both peripherals in their arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="InjNmw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 22nd, 8:25PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Sony appears to have sold out of PS5 consoles for the day. We’ll make sure to let you know when the next opportunity comes up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sw7TZO"&gt;If you’re still trying to get your hands on a PlayStation 5, lining up at Sony’s digital storefront is one of the more reliable ways to snag Sony’s next-gen console. Sony &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/hardware/ps5"&gt;has reopened the digital queue on its direct store&lt;/a&gt; to place orders for the $500 &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/hardware/ps5"&gt;disc-based PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the $400 &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/hardware/ps5"&gt;PlayStation 5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqKvo7"&gt;Provided you’ve already &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/ps5"&gt;registered&lt;/a&gt; and logged into your PlayStation account, you should be able to line up once you’ve hit the landing page. Once you’ve entered the queue, you’ll be given an ETA of when you’ll be able to check out and, once that timer hits zero, it's all systems go. It's no secret that these consoles go quick and getting into the queue doesn’t necessarily guarantee a console, but Sony’s direct store remains one of the more reliable ways to get ahold of the PlayStation 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HI8v4N"&gt;If you’re still deliberating which console is the better fit for you, let's chat a little about the differences between these two consoles. Both models of the PS5, the standard model ($500) and the Digital Edition ($400), are virtually identical with the exception of the inclusion of a UHD Blu-Ray disc drive on the standard edition. Because it doesn’t have a disc drive, the Digital Edition is a little lighter and slimmer, but still features the same 825GB SSD. Both consoles are compatible with the same games, however,&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tile is selling its Bluetooth tracking business to Life360 for $205 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple, Tile, and Samsung all offer smart Bluetooth trackers." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UaLxMRoUeTodLOxMiwLgqQ4HqGg=/291x146:1835x1175/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70180433/ajohnson_210702_4659_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Me6qU1"&gt;Tile popularized marking items and tracking them from your phone with its small Bluetooth tags, but suddenly faces more competition from giants like Apple, Amazon, Google, and Samsung. The company that started out of an incubator &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/tile-grabs-2-6m-via-selfstarter-for-its-lost-property-finding-bluetooth-tags-plus-app/"&gt;and crowdfunding campaign&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/life360-to-acquire-tile-creating-the-world-leader-in-finding-and-location-solutions-301430364.html"&gt;has announced it will be acquired by Life360&lt;/a&gt;, which calls itself a “leading family safety platform.” The deal is valued at $205 million and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3rxcai"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Subscribers to Tile and Life360 services can expect  some new benefits in their packages&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HUtvVv"&gt;Tile has developed its product line over the years with a variety of different trackers and partnerships with other companies to use its technology. It also has a subscription service, Tile Premium, with extra features, battery replacements, and insurance against potential losses. However, the game may have changed once Apple and Google started building their own item-locating features into iPhones and Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Life360 app screenshots" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C7nIpwT2b__Yr89DXqzICIXjBUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23036284/life360_app.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Life360 app screenshots&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="btPUOi"&gt;Life360 bills itself as an overall family safety app, with location sharing between family members, crash detection, and other features. Over the summer, it announced that it has over 1 million paying customers and reported its valuation had crossed $1 billion. It also acquired another item locating hardware startup, Jiobit, which makes cellular-connected trackers for kids and pets.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYn9dH"&gt;Life360 expects the deal will increase the global footprint for both companies, Tile’s non-Bluetooth Finding Network, and create a larger combined subscriber base. Currently listed on the stock exchange in Australia, Life360 says it has plans for a “potential dual listing in the US” next year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="A9LB6Q"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.life360.com%2Fblog%2Ftile-joins-life360%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2F22797559%2Ftile-bluetooth-tracker-location-gps-acquisition-life360" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a blog post announcing the Tile acquisition&lt;/a&gt;, Life360 CEO and co-founder Chris Hulls says, “The combination of Life360 and Tile means safety just got a whole lot simpler for millions of families and individuals around the world. We’ll be bundling Tile devices as part of our Membership plans, and Tile will offer Life360 Membership benefits to its customers. We’ll also start work on integrating our technologies so Tile devices, Jiobit wearables, and Life360 app customers will show up on a unified map – people, pets, and things all in one place.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CG7WTI"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;launched the $29 AirTag earlier this yea&lt;/a&gt;r that also uses Bluetooth for tracking, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;adds precise Ultra Wideband tech and deep integration with the iOS platform&lt;/a&gt; that Tile just doesn’t have. And there are indications &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22540625/google-find-my-device-android-spot-location-network"&gt;Google won’t be left behind&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung launched its own pocket-sized Bluetooth trackers, and Amazon is building on Echo devices to enable tracking via the Sidewalk network (Tile announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424837/tile-amazon-sidewalk-support-release-date-2021-bluetooth-tracking-airtags"&gt;a partnership with Amazon that began in June&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRA5R4"&gt;Tile recently announced its first ultra-wideband enabled tracker, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22716870/tile-ultra-bluetooth-tracker-uwb-ar-early-2022"&gt;the Tile Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, which will launch next year and has the advantage of working with both mobile platforms to provide much more precise tracking. Still, as Tile vice president and general counsel Kirsten Daru &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21070812/sonos-tile-basecamp-popsocket-congressional-hearing-amazon-google-apple-competition"&gt;said to Congress last year about Apple&lt;/a&gt;, “You might be the best soccer team, but you’re playing against a team that owns the stadium, the ball, and the league, and can change the rules when it wants.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tile tracker lineup" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-a9ZFgAH3VZ5sKrfwSPYpJu4Lf8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23036287/Family_Lineup_800.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tile&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Tile tracker lineup&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nMLurb"&gt;Hulls has a more optimistic vision of that reality in mind, as described in his blog post, pointing out that Apple’s introduction of AirPods expanded the market for all Bluetooth headsets much more than a single pioneer like Jawbone could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1YVH9x"&gt;Tile says it will continue to operate as an independent entity with the same team, led by current CEO CJ Prober. Prober will join Life360’s board of directors and says in the announcement, “This acquisition not only brings together two incredible teams with complementary missions and values, it paves the way for us to jointly build the world’s leading solutions for peace of mind and safety. “&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku promises to fix issues with HBO, Netflix, and more caused by 10.5 update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8dFj3liDlncB00d2m13fxzB-bHE=/129x0:1071x628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70180825/Roku_OS_10.5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2WMV7R"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RokuSupport/status/1462904641830617093"&gt;Roku says&lt;/a&gt; it’s working to fix issues that users have been reporting following its 10.5 software update. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/roku-customers-report-streaming-issues-after-10-5-update/?tpcc=tcplustwitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reported the problems&lt;/a&gt; earlier on Monday, citing &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/qyxplo/i_feel_roku_owes_me_money_since_im_now_paying_for/"&gt;posts on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Roku-Device-Features-Settings-Updates/OS-10-5-Roku-TV-experiencing-loading-channel-issues/td-p/738115/"&gt;Roku forums&lt;/a&gt; where users said that apps like HBO Max, ESPN, Disney Plus, and more wouldn’t allow them to watch any video content after updating the OS on their smart TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JY9bcR"&gt;According to Roku, “certain older Roku TV models or older Roku Ultra players” are affected by the problematic update. &lt;a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Playback-Issues-Audio-Video-Power/OS-10-5-Some-older-Roku-TVs-and-Roku-Ultra-players-are-experiencing-playback-issues-after-update/m-p/741618#M34138"&gt;In a post on its forum&lt;/a&gt;, the company instructs users with Roku Ultra models 4660, 4661, 4662, or 4670, and users with a Roku TV model 7XXX to manually check for a software update, and tells owners of other devices to subscribe to the thread for future details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1X0PKK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;System update got you down? We're aware of a small set of users on older Roku TVs or Roku Ultra who are experiencing issues after the OS 10.5 release and are working quickly to resolve. See our realtime updates here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/fZYqfsgNBS"&gt;https://t.co/fZYqfsgNBS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Roku Support (@RokuSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RokuSupport/status/1462904641830617093?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kG9r8V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;says Roku has been having users roll back their OS to a previous version on a case-by-case basis, after the user contacts support with information about their devices. While &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/qzyz5g/downgrade_from_105_to_100/"&gt;at least one Reddit user&lt;/a&gt; has reported seeing a prompt to “upgrade” from 10.5 to 10.0, Roku doesn’t mention that it’ll be widely offering a downgrade in its posts &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RokuSupport/status/1462904641830617093"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Playback-Issues-Audio-Video-Power/OS-10-5-Some-older-Roku-TVs-and-Roku-Ultra-players-are-experiencing-playback-issues-after-update/m-p/741618#M34138"&gt;its forums&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s65mnG"&gt;While Roku users have also reported issues with streaming using the YouTube TV app, that particular issue doesn’t appear to be limited to just one platform — &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-tv-has-been-freezing-up-on-smart-tvs-everywhere/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that YouTube TV users have been having issues across almost every device, from streaming boxes like Apple TVs, Amazon Fire sticks, and even Google’s own Chromecasts, to consoles and smart TVs (though it notes that iOS and Android users seem unaffected). YouTube’s support team &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1462134163872624649"&gt;initially said&lt;/a&gt; that it was working on a fix for the issue on Roku devices, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1462922337033105413"&gt;later said&lt;/a&gt; that the company was looking into the issue on other devices as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xrpS6j"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sorry to hear about the trouble – we've seen similar reports of YouTube TV freezing intermittently, and our team is looking into the issue. Mind sharing what device (model) you're using, and if this is happening to all programs? Appreciate your patience in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;— TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1462922337033105413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AMWhOl"&gt;While it’s certainly odd that the two issues appear to be happening at the same time, they don’t seem to be related given that YouTube TV users are seeing freezes regardless of device. Thankfully, both companies appear to be working on ironing out the problems. Roku is actively updating its support post with instructions to check for updates, and &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; notes that YouTube TV is getting fewer outage reports on DownDetector.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vozi16"&gt;While the fix for Roku users may solve their problems with Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming services, their YouTube TV troubles may not be over — Roku and Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412430/roku-youtube-tv-google-feud-explainer-timeline"&gt;are actively feuding&lt;/a&gt; over the YouTube TV not being available on the platform’s store, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738333/roku-google-youtube-tv-app-contract-competition-klobuchar"&gt;Google has threatened&lt;/a&gt; to stop distributing its regular YouTube app on Rokus as well come December.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals at Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XgTd1mZd-FZpefnC-KfdRdsUAEo=/212x0:2497x1523/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154121/LG_C1_Lifestyle_Photo.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AtjyQ3"&gt;As Black Friday approaches, several retailers are already offering significant discounts — and Walmart is no exception. Right now, the retail giant is dropping early Black Friday deals on everything from the AirPods Pro to the most popular TVs and streaming devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uTIwf"&gt;We’ve featured a few of these items in our guide to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, however, the list below highlights all of the best sales Walmart is offering across several categories rather than just a few. It’s perfect, then, for anybody who plans on shopping primarily at Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OVcC4"&gt;The store will continue to publish more deals as we get closer to the big day, with many of the better deals going live on November 22nd, according to &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fstore%2F3520-secaucus-nj%2Fweekly-ads&amp;amp;subid1=VergeWalmartBFDeals111721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a recent online circular&lt;/a&gt;. If you subscribe to Walmart Plus, the retailer’s equivalent to Amazon Prime, you’ll also gain access to the deals four hours in advance. Regardless of when you plan on doing your shopping, however, we’ll continue to update this page throughout Black Friday and Cyber Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes tells the jury that at least some of Theranos was real</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;“A success was that we had successfully achieved the objectives of the program.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="0e0HOu"&gt;So far, Elizabeth Holmes’ defense has been at pains to show us that Theranos had a real device and worked with real pharmaceutical companies. That actually hasn’t been in question, particularly in the time period the defense was asking about. Still, the point seems to be &lt;em&gt;hey, look, some things at Theranos were real&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPQ2k9"&gt;But today, in her wire fraud trial, we saw a science-y presentation — not actual science, just the marketing version. We saw the guts of Theranos devices. We heard about the company iterating on the device. We saw emails with pharma companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R0Z2vO"&gt;Theranos’ work with drug companies was never in question; we saw money Theranos made from that work early in the prosecution’s case, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674657/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-wire-fraud-financial-witness"&gt;comptroller Danise Yam&lt;/a&gt;. The issue with drug companies has been the “validation” reports that Theranos produced about its own technology in those partnerships. Though those reports were written by Theranos employees, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760601/theranos-pfizer-schering-plough-logo-memo"&gt;investors said&lt;/a&gt; they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747918/theranos-devos-due-diligence-fraud-trial"&gt;thought the reports&lt;/a&gt; had been written by the pharmaceutical companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="e8mefs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Holmes acknowledged that Theranos didn’t work with the Defense Department at all&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FWlRvr"&gt;Making matters worse, two reports we saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760601/theranos-pfizer-schering-plough-logo-memo"&gt;bore logos for Schering-Plough and Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;. The Schering-Plough memo had also been gussied up relative to its original version. When Theranos first sent the report to Schering-Plough, it did not have the pharma company’s logo on it, and read that Theranos “give accurate and precise results.” The version Walgreens saw had Schering-Plough’s logo and language that said “give more accurate and precise results… than current ‘gold standard’ reference methods.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mo9pdO"&gt;Investors testified that the work Theranos had done with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786461/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-brian-grossman-pfm-investor-testimony"&gt;pharmaceutical companies and the armed forces&lt;/a&gt; had been important. They thought that meant the drug companies and the Defense Department had co-signed the technology, using it on clinical trials and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos/card/JQ8iFuWnlVuVFvduRrBp"&gt;in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; — a lie journalist &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790541/elizabeth-holmes-fraud-lies-recording"&gt;Roger Parloff heard, too&lt;/a&gt;. Today, Holmes acknowledged that Theranos didn’t work with the Defense Department at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ym8zJ5"&gt;Her testimony was brief — the trial was delayed an hour and a half for a meeting in the judge’s chambers between attorneys for the two sides. The reason for the meeting wasn’t explained. The court session also ended relatively early, at 1PM Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZqZOv"&gt;Holmes, who seemed at ease on the stand, was asked to explain why the cartridges on the Series 1.0 device didn’t work. They were stacked and held together with adhesive, but the adhesive could come loose, which let the stacked layers peel apart so they wouldn’t work properly. I wasn’t entirely sure why this would matter — we knew Theranos was iterating on the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="AMDJKl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A success was that we had successfully achieved the objectives of the program.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pXAPS9"&gt;Her answers were largely non-technical; whether that was because she didn’t have technical knowledge, or because she wanted to make sure she wasn’t confusing the jury, wasn’t clear to me. At times, Holmes’ testimony hewed so closely to documents that we were being shown that it was funny. After reading emails, she’d be asked what they meant, and would respond with, nearly word-for-word, a sentence in the email. In a slideshow, one slide was titled “Completed Successes.” Holmes’ attorney, Kevin Downey, asked her what success meant in that context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xg0fOh"&gt;“A success was that we had successfully achieved the objectives of the program,” she replied. And when it came to Theranos’ performance? “I remember it being really good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nExXfI"&gt;The “completed successes,” in Theranos’ parlance, were almost all preliminary drug company studies. One exception was a study done with Stanford, which &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4091290/"&gt;was actually published.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mtjj2y"&gt;The outlines of the work with many drug companies were largely the same. A big drug company would do preliminary work with Theranos, which Holmes would typically characterize as successful. But no clinical trial work manifested. This was true for Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Celgene. Theranos did create tests for AstraZeneca and worked on a clinical trial for Centocor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="oHnILI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think calling her every single morning for the last three weeks finally paid off…”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PuQb2F"&gt;In the Centocor trial, the Theranos device was tested against standard labs. Asked about how her device fared in comparison, Holmes said, “It performed well.”  Many of her answers were brief and matter-of-fact, as though she were discussing the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbWEsA"&gt;The most interesting parts of her testimony, however, had to do with Pfizer and Schering-Plough. Crucially, for Holmes to be found guilty of wire fraud, the government must show that she knew she was lying when she gave investors bad information — mistakes aren’t illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKE7Yj"&gt;So we saw some emails. At Schering-Plough, Constance Cullen had been Theranos’ main point of contact. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760601/theranos-pfizer-schering-plough-logo-memo"&gt;Cullen testified earlier&lt;/a&gt;, for the prosecution.) As Cullen testified, her company was bought by Merck while she was in contact with Holmes, and since she was put in charge of a newly-combined group, work with Theranos fell by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wl8D96"&gt;In an email from a Theranos employee to Holmes, the employee wrote that Cullen was swamped with work from the acquisition. “All in all it was awesome,” the email went on. “I think calling her every single morning for the last three weeks finally paid off…” Holmes was asked directly if Cullen informed her of Schering-Plough’s low opinion of Theranos’ tests. Holmes said no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q63jnp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We’ve seen that a lot of drug companies passed on doing real work with Theranos&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0EqchN"&gt;You can see where this is going — a &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;generous read of the situation is that Holmes didn’t realize the technology was bad or that Merck didn’t want to work with her, she just thought that her contact dropped the ball. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9EXwl"&gt;As for Pfizer, the defense produced emails that showed Holmes had continued talking to the company about a partnership as late as 2015. In that email, a Pfizer employee proposed using Theranos’ Walgreens centers as clinical trial sites. This did not come to fruition, and Thearnos didn’t work on a clinical trial for Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CO25d2"&gt;It is possible to believe that all these drug companies looked into Theranos’ device and chose not to move forward for unrelated reasons  — but that’s a big stretch. Put together, we’ve seen that a lot of drug companies passed on doing real work with Theranos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvZCqK"&gt;The thing about today’s presentation, though, is that Theranos’ early work isn’t contested. According to the government, the fraud didn’t start until later. Besides, liars don’t lie &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="L11i8Z"&gt;As she gets closer to testifying about some of the other areas of interest, though, I hope there’s just as much contemporaneous email evidence. Because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790541/elizabeth-holmes-fraud-lies-recording"&gt;having now heard Parloff’s tapes of Holmes&lt;/a&gt;, I was struck by how confidently she’d lied and how believable she sounded. Being preceded by those tapes means that no matter how confident or trustworthy she sounds, I still find myself doubting what she says unless there’s something else to confirm it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jwB5Xm"&gt;Food delivery platform &lt;a href="https://www.sfcityattorney.org/2021/11/22/san-francisco-secures-over-5-million-settlement-for-doordash-workers/"&gt;DoorDash has agreed&lt;/a&gt; to pay $5.3 million to the city of San Francisco to settle allegations it failed to provide healthcare and paid sick leave to some 4,500 delivery drivers, as the city requires. The company did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement, most of which will be used to reimburse drivers who made deliveries in the city between 2016 and 2020, before a new state law covering gig workers took effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ICKaI"&gt;California’s gig workers law, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;voters approved in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; as ballot measure Proposition 22, allows companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash to treat workers as independent contractors, not employees. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/21/22635286/judge-rules-california-prop-22-gig-workers-law-unconstitutional"&gt;judge ruled in August&lt;/a&gt; that the law was unconstitutional, but it remains in effect pending an appeal by the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3brQHp"&gt;“We believe (DoorDash couriers) were misclassified and should have been employees for years,” San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu told the &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/DoorDash-to-pay-5-3-million-to-S-F-couriers-16636498.ph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was first to report the news Monday. “That is not part of the settlement but it is the perspective of the city.” As part of the settlement announced Monday, most drivers will get between $500 and $1,000, and the Chronicle reported that both sides agreed to the settlement to avoid a prolonged court battle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERyhcR"&gt;“We are proud of the flexible earning opportunities and meaningful benefits and protections Proposition 22 affords Dashers across California,” DoorDash spokeswoman Briana Megid said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “While we deny any wrongdoing, we feel that this settlement represents a fair compromise that will allow us to focus on continuing to provide the best experience for Dashers.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC approves $6 billion Verizon-Tracfone acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S2GUm5vwQHbxbIjEWs02y1pEK5Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70180043/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ib4gJG"&gt;On Monday, the Federal Communications Commission voted to approve Verizon Wireless’ purchase of Tracfone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21435980/verizon-tracfone-acquisition-prepaid-phones-budget"&gt;in a deal worth more than $6 billion&lt;/a&gt;, positioning Verizon to become one of the largest prepaid service providers in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQJqTB"&gt;Tracfone is the largest reseller of wireless devices in the US and maintains over 20 million subscribers with more than 90,000 retail locations. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621905/verizon-tracfone-merger-lifeline-fcc-public-interest"&gt;Verizon’s Tracfone acquisition&lt;/a&gt; combines the largest mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) with the largest wireless provider in the country. When Verizon first proposed the deal last September, the company said that the acquisition would bolster Tracfone’s networks while making low-income wireless services more competitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wN31HY"&gt;“After rigorous review, the Commission found that the transaction, as modified by Verizon’s enforceable commitments, will make Verizon and Tracfone stronger providers of prepaid and Lifeline services,” the FCC said in a Monday press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MItMBV"&gt;It’s unclear which commissioners voted to approve the deal. Currently, there are only two Democrats and two Republicans serving at the agency, meaning at least one Democrat would have been required to approve the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GoxN4U"&gt;As part of its decision to approve the deal, the FCC said that it would be requiring Verizon to make several consumer protection agreements with the agency. First, Verizon promised to continue its participation in the Lifeline subsidy program for at least seven years. The company must also provide “cost-effective” 5G devices and services to Lifeline customers. Verizon must also submit semi-annual reports describing how its compliance meets these restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zJIEE"&gt;Last Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/news-and-updates/all-news/cpuc-requires-consumer-protection-measures-for-verizon-acquisition-of-tracfone"&gt;the California Public Utility Commission&lt;/a&gt; approved the deal, mandating similar restrictions to those imposed by the FCC. However, the California regulators required Verizon’s Tracfone to participate in the Lifeline program for at least 20 years. Customers will also receive free 5G-compatible devices and should not see wireless plan price increases over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em4Fas"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Ysdobu3Dq5hfr7-QRZnyVxadrk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079139/Early_Black_Friday_Deals.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, many retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score a great deal before it sells out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nypGAV"&gt;Latest deal highlights:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YeaHyy"&gt;If you’re a PlayStation gamer, Amazon is offering a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Membership-Digital/dp/B09JTZSB3R/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year membership to PlayStation Plus for just $40&lt;/a&gt; ($20 off). This service grants you access to online multiplayer, exclusive discounts, and complimentary titles each month to add to your PSN account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0CAnqM"&gt;The Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 2 is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NFP7KYJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available in either blue or gray&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon for $80, one of the better prices we’ve seen on the waterproof Bluetooth speaker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7PLK8F"&gt;Amazon’s 11th-gen Kindle Paperwhite Kids is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P52R2PL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $115&lt;/a&gt;, its best price to date. The kid-centric Paperwhite is the same as the 8GB base model, but comes with a cover, a two-year warranty, and a year-long subscription to Amazon Kids Plus, which provides your child access to a trove of kid-friendly books and other content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bEsScB"&gt;A bundle containing the Roomba i3 Plus with a self-emptying base and the Braava Jet m6 mop is on sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3scripyja?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22553352%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fgood-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $585 (regularly $850).

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="lwMndD"&gt;Right now, Amazon is discounting all sizes of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, the LG C1. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model is on sale for $1,097&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,297, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is selling for $1,297&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $1,797&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, all sport several features gamers will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, and support for HDMI 2.1. Best Buy is offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWewqARCyb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same discounts&lt;/a&gt;, except with 30 days of FuboTV Pro and three months of Apple TV Plus, as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV, a camera accessory that brings wide-angle video chats to your TV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="MqKN84"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="E5gVG7"&gt;Amazon is also discounting various sizes of Samsung’s The Frame, a unique kind of TV that functions both as wall art and an HDR-compatible QLED. Right now, for example, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,498&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $998&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. The TV offers a decor-friendly design while also displaying customizable images when somebody’s in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into a smart 4K TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and a 120Hz refresh rate. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeAej60sy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is matching this deal&lt;/a&gt; as well, and including 30 days of FuboTV Pro as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="jNcvZm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="mExVb6"&gt;This 70-inch LG TV may only feature midrange specs, but Best Buy has brought it down to its lowest price ever. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTimnyrsb7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG NanoCell 75 series TV is down to just $750&lt;/a&gt; for a limited time, a staggering $450 off the list price. The 4K panel is powered by LG’s WebOS smart platform, which offers a solid array of streaming services and includes HDR10 for vivid picture quality. The 75 Series also comes equipped with three HDMI ports and ARC compatibility, as well as Apple’s AirPlay 2, which allows you to cast content from your Apple device to your TV. It may not be as impressive as an OLED TV, but $750 for a 70-inch panel is still a solid value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="YkAdjB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10835005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="wcr0Gl"&gt;Naturally, Amazon is offering some great discounts on its own products, taking between $140 and $150 off the Omni Series (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6F8YBH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;) and 4-Series 4K Fire TVs (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08SVZ775L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QB66R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lDDnQ9"&gt;The best Black Friday deals on streaming devices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="qcHKiS"&gt;The latest Roku Streaming Stick 4K, which just launched in September, is selling at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Froku-streaming-stick-4k-2021-streaming-device-4k-hdr-dolby-vision-with-voice-remote-and-tv-controls%2F-%2FA-52709600%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayTechDeals111921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vrWZYkTQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; at a record low. Normally $50, the retailer is offering the streaming device for just $29. The 2021 model is faster, comes with improved Wi-Fi performance, and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. Roku’s players also now support AirPlay 2, which means you can use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to easily cast content to the device. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="PuNKYt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="xfNVil"&gt;This accessible Roku alternative from Google features support for Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, and the current sale at the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/chromecast_google_tv?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1JKx5U7SD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has brought the Chromecast with Google TV down to $40, saving you $10 off the regular price.

You can even cast media from your phone through the Chromecast app. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="bsLjhK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10872711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ADYgqg"&gt;The best Black Friday deals on laptops and tablets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="c5Ol71"&gt;The Lenovo Yoga 9i remains one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687992/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-pro-8-hp-spectre-macbook-air-creator-laptops-compare-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our favorite alternatives to the Microsoft Surface line of ultrabooks&lt;/a&gt; and, right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThlWBLJhS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is offering the slick 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; for $1,350. While this model received a similar discount a couple of months ago, it still remains a solid value. The foldable laptop boasts some impressive specs, too, with an 11th Gen Core i7 CPU, 512GB of storage, and Iris Xe integrated graphics. This hardware, paired with a 4K touchscreen display and a garaged stylus, makes the 9i a great choice for creators.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="nisc5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10689258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1BiPh2"&gt;HP’s 15.6-inch laptop with Windows Home in S Mode is on sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3sBxrPIx7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $330&lt;/a&gt; instead of $500. This particular model features 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i3 processor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9kKV5j"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Chromebook-Celeron-Processor-Gigabit/dp/B07XL4JHXR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 11.6-inch Galaxy Chromebook 4&lt;/a&gt; is now on sale for $180 instead of $250 at Amazon. This particular model includes 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eNqjUh"&gt;The Dell XPS 15 ultrabook is currently enjoying a solid discount. &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-14349898?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Fxps-15-9510-laptop%2Fsmx15w11p1c6700p%3Fpreview%3Doff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has reduced the price of this particular configuration to $2,199&lt;/a&gt;, taking $396 off the usual price tag. This is the best deal we’ve seen on this laptop so far, with some retailers charging as much as $2,600 for the same configuration. This model boasts some impressive specs with an 11th Gen Core i9 CPU and an RTX 3050 Ti graphics card, not to mention 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Our reviewer, Monica Chin, liked the 16:10 display and snappy keyboard, even though the XPS 15 tended to get a little hot under load. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="vAdouM"&gt;The latest model of the Dell XPS 13 takes what made last year’s model so great and makes it better. During its Black Friday sale, &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-12578053?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops-and-notebooks%2Fxps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fsmx13w11p2c3100p" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has marked down this configuration to $1,369&lt;/a&gt;, taking about $260 off the regular MSRP. While not quite the same configuration, aforementioned reviewer Monica Chin described the Dell XPS 13 as the company’s “best-in-class 13-inch ultraportable laptop.” This particular configuration comes equipped with an Intel Core i7-1195G7, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. While the integrated Iris Xe GPU doesn’t have enough juice for gaming, this lightweight laptop is remarkably versatile and remains a powerful choice in the 13-inch laptop class. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21310825" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

The 2021 iPad Pro is also a speed demon thanks to Apple’s M1 chip and comes with welcome features such as a Mini LED display, Thunderbolt connectivity, Wi-Fi 6 support, and Face ID, which allows you to unlock the device with just a glance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="AygW13"&gt;The best Black Friday deals on noise-canceling headphones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="fDTpC7"&gt;Typically $400, Amazon is currently selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best-sounding noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for non-Apple users — the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VW98ZKG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; — in black for $247 or in white for $223. That’s one of the lowest prices Amazon has ever sold them for. As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the comfortable headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound while providing 17 hours of playback per charge. They even come outfitted with a USB-C port and a compact, foldable design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

It may not be the all-time low as far as pricing goes, but it’s the closest you can get right now if you’re shopping early. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Although they’re beginning to show their age, we initially praised the comfortable headphones in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14051984/beats-solo-3-review-apple-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2016 review&lt;/a&gt; and noted how well they isolate exterior noise.

While this phone doesn’t come packaged with a complimentary pair of earbuds like some other models, you do get a free 11-inch Chromebook.

This is the only model currently on sale that doesn’t net you any extra goodies, but it’s a solid value regardless. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

While all eyes are on the new Pixel 6, we still stand by the Pixel 5A as a solid and affordable entry. Featuring one of the best cameras available in a midrange smartphone, the 5G-compatible 5A also comes equipped with 128GB of onboard storage, IP67 water resistance, and improved battery life. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Other retailers offer &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3ssYV7eRw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the camera alone for $250&lt;/a&gt;, so this bundle is the better value. It includes a dual battery charger and a total of three batteries, so you’ll never run out of juice. This rugged digital camera is perfectly suited for capturing fast-moving action wherever and whenever it happens. The HyperSmooth technology provides an amazing level of image stabilization, while the LiveBurst feature automatically records anything that happens two seconds before and two seconds after your shot. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20891984/gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera-image-stabilization-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Normally $500, B&amp;amp;H is now selling the popular action cam for $450. The Hero10 Black boasts all the amazing features found on its predecessor — which we once called the “biggest, baddest action camera out there” — and more, like a new processor that allows it to shoot in higher frame rates and upload videos to the cloud while charging. It’s also compatible with Hero9 accessories, meaning those looking to upgrade won’t necessarily need to purchase new add-ons. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

These include some of the heavy-hitters of the podcast world, like the broadcast-quality SM7B and its newer offspring: the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B08G7RG9ML?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MV7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B09BZZCGC8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MV7X&lt;/a&gt;. All three mics are discounted, with, for example, the Shure SM7B going for $359 instead of $399 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-SM7B-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B0002E4Z8M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AhcBZ8"&gt;This 38-inch soundbar from Samsung is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkK7MFOaD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $280 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The 7.1 soundbar comes packaged with a wireless subwoofer and rear-channel speakers, too, helping keep cable clutter to a minimum.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Prime Gaming is giving away EA games over the next few months</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LIGPO3"&gt;Amazon and EA will be &lt;a href="https://primegaming.blog/tis-the-season-for-even-more-new-free-games-and-in-game-content-for-prime-gaming-members-9fd509131336"&gt;giving away free PC games&lt;/a&gt; and content through Amazon’s Prime Gaming program for the next few months, so it may be time to &lt;a href="http://gaming.amazon.com/"&gt;check in on the gaming service&lt;/a&gt; if you’ve forgotten that it comes included with Prime. This month, Prime subscribers will be able to get a free Origin code for the surprisingly decent remaster of 2010’s &lt;em&gt;Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit,&lt;/em&gt; and Amazon says that four more of EA’s “most popular titles” will be coming in 2022 (though given the starting game, it may be worth keeping your expectations in check).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aCQrd"&gt;If it’s still November when you’re reading this, you &lt;a href="https://primegaming.blog/spend-the-holiday-season-gaming-with-family-and-friends-with-new-free-games-and-content-from-prime-b180be31c66e"&gt;can also snag&lt;/a&gt; EA’s &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age Inquisition&lt;/em&gt; for free from Prime Gaming. Amazon’s partnership with EA also includes skins for games like &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;, as well as some additional content for EA Sports games that’ll be “rolling out over the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="jnGOwK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;EA games aren’t the only ones on offer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ldhwr5"&gt;As usual, you’ll also be able to get a number of other free games with Prime Gaming as well. The games available in December probably won’t blow your mind but should be good romps for any holiday vacations you have coming up; there’s &lt;em&gt;Frostpunk&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Journey to the Savage Planet&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Football Manager 2021&lt;/em&gt;, and TellTale’s take on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F9ahZQ7oP0"&gt;beloved &lt;em&gt;Monkey Island&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tales of Monkey Island&lt;/em&gt;. Also included are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Yrj10r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morkredd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RsbI49"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spellcaster University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RIQ7I2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTubers Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="A8e2cn"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse (&lt;/em&gt;what a name)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lDVaOs"&gt;Amazon hasn’t said what EA games will be coming next, but it’s probably worth keeping an eye on. As maligned as the publisher can be (oftentimes for good reasons), it does have some solid titles, and it’d be hard to complain about getting them for free. Personally, I’m crossing my fingers that the collection of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjZQZgeSMx8"&gt;remastered &lt;em&gt;Command &amp;amp; Conquer&lt;/em&gt; games&lt;/a&gt; will be one of the upcoming free titles so I can get a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w-FQoNrwHM"&gt;sweet, sweet hit of nostalgia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
