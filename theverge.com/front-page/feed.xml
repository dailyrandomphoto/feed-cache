    <title>Elon Musk is hosting Saturday Night Live and no this is not a joke</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Acvs7t"&gt;Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, will be hosting &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; on May 8th, the official &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1386033593772826624?s=21"&gt;tweeted &lt;/a&gt;Saturday. The musical guest will be Miley Cyrus. Musk is known for his— how shall we put this — quirky sense of humor on Twitter, his preferred method of social media communication, but it’s not totally clear whether he’s actually funny enough to sustain a 90-minute hosting gig on the late-night comedy show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KpH6x6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;    &lt;a href="https://t.co/WyTGhSsSVg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WyTGhSsSVg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Saturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1386033593772826624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o4tHbM"&gt;Musk has made many notable media appearances over the years— there was that time he &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/01/tech/elon-musk-joe-rogan"&gt;smoked weed on Joe Rogan’s podcast&lt;/a&gt;, and he had a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfiRd4Y5z_g&amp;amp;ab_channel=ShortClips"&gt;cameo in &lt;em&gt;Iron Man 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (he even had a line for his debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe). He also played himself on an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;, titled “&lt;a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Musk_Who_Fell_to_Earth"&gt;The Musk Who Fell to Earth&lt;/a&gt;,” and on the now-retired show &lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGR5HP3KSBk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Bang Theory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and its spinoff &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jAlPQau5Hc&amp;amp;ab_channel=HouseofGamers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Young Sheldon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When he appeared on the Stephen Colbert show, the host&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gV6hP9wpMW8&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheLateShowwithStephenColbert"&gt; likened him to Lex Luthor&lt;/a&gt; (which, all things considered, he probably enjoyed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KyJ794"&gt;So he’s not totally without some show biz chops. How willing he’ll be to parody his — unique— public persona, well, we’ll have to wait a few weeks to find out. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this saga of McDonald’s ice cream machines and why they’re out of order all the time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="McDonald’s Same-Store Sales Top Estimates as Declines Abate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EgKJgvfBho7BoLU0BzmsIlVHuaU=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69180993/462010750.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sCitTa"&gt;If you’ve ever tried to get ice cream at a McDonald’s restaurant, there’s a better-than-average chance you were stymied in your quest for soft-serve goodness by an out-of-order ice cream machine. A &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/they-hacked-mcdonalds-ice-cream-makers-started-cold-war/"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;attempts to get to the bottom of the mystery of the McDonald’s ice cream machines, why they have a secret repair menu that most McDonald’s workers don’t have access to, and one couple’s attempts to hack the machines for the greater good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="4gcX0p"&gt;...after years of studying this complex machine and its many ways of failing, O’Sullivan remains most outraged at this notion: That the food-equipment giant Taylor sells the McFlurry-squirting devices to McDonald’s restaurant owners for about $18,000 each, and yet it keeps the machines’ inner workings secret from them. What’s more, Taylor maintains a network of approved distributors that charge franchisees thousands of dollars a year for pricey maintenance contracts, with technicians on call to come and tap that secret passcode into the devices sitting on their counters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="iWiX7L"&gt;It’s weird to consider that a company the size of McDonald’s would be hampered by what is mainly a right-to-repair issue. The restaurants have to use Taylor’s repair techs, and the machines themselves tend to be fragile and temperamental, according to franchisees bound to use the machines by agreements with McDonald’s. So Jeremy O’Sullivan and Melissa Nelson created a device that would hack into the machines and provide diagnostic info, including access to the secret menu. They called it Kytch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6BL50x"&gt;One franchisee, who asked that WIRED not identify him for fear of retribution from McDonald’s, told me that the ice cream machine at one of his restaurants had been down practically every week due to a mysterious failure during its pasteurization cycle. He’d scrutinized the assembly of the machine again and again, to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqzCZW"&gt;Installing Kytch revealed almost instantly that an overeager employee was putting too much mix in one of the machine’s hoppers. Today he wakes up every morning at 5:30, picks up his phone, and confirms that all his machines have passed their treacherous heat treatment. Another franchisee’s technician told me that, despite Kytch nearly doubling its prices over the past two years and adding a $250 activation fee, it still saves their owner “easily thousands of dollars a month.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JIYBC0"&gt;I’m not going to spoil the plot twists, but suffice to say that &lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;reporter Andy Greenberg tells the tale of the ice cream machines and the well-intentioned hackers almost like a spy thriller; I was half-expecting a Jason Bourne-like hero to come in and set everything right. Go read this fascinating deep dive into the wonky ice cream machines that even &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/McDonalds/status/1293189912913743877?s=20"&gt;McDonald’s itself jokes about&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zbdabt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter censored tweets critical of India’s handling of the pandemic at its government’s request</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hd6hjZ2eLcuDhwLFDXNosuGXH6w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69180500/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pH0mtx"&gt;Twitter has removed more than 50 tweets critical of the Indian government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and did so at the request of the Indian government. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.medianama.com/2021/04/223-twitter-mp-minister-censor/"&gt;Indian news site &lt;em&gt;MediaNama&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Indian government sent Twitter an emergency order on Friday to censor 52 tweets, according to a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22466918/April_23_2021_Lumen_India.pdf"&gt;disclosure notice on the Lumen database&lt;/a&gt;. The censored accounts include a sitting member of India’s Parliament, two filmmakers, an actor, and a West Bengal state minister. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmRLuS"&gt;A Twitter spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company may make certain tweets unable to be viewed by people within India if the tweets violate local law. Twitter says it notified account holders before it withheld content to make them aware that the action was taken in response to a legal request from the government of India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUt8Lk"&gt;“When we receive a valid legal request, we review it under both the Twitter Rules and local law. If the content violates Twitter’s Rules, the content will be removed from the service,” according to the Twitter spokesperson. “If it is determined to be illegal in a particular jurisdiction, but not in violation of the Twitter Rules, we may withhold access to the content in India only. In all cases, we notify the account holder directly so they’re aware that we’ve received a legal order pertaining to the account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvMJg3"&gt;It isn’t the first time that Twitter has bowed to pressure from the Indian government. During protests by farmers in February, the company permanently blocked more than 500 accounts and removed others from being visible within India. The Indian government issued a notice of noncompliance to the company, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/india-twitter.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; at the time, which could have meant jail time for Twitter’s employees in India if the company had refused. Among the accounts suspended in February was Indian news magazine &lt;em&gt;The Caravan&lt;/em&gt; (which was later reinstated): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SzqJ2f"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The official handle of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thecaravanindia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@thecaravanindia&lt;/a&gt; is withheld in India: &lt;a href="https://t.co/2t4FV5IgM0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2t4FV5IgM0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Vinod K. Jose (@vinodjose) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vinodjose/status/1356165300840968192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iSuPzN"&gt;Indian law restricts the publication of material that the government considers defamatory, or which could incite violence. According to the Lumen notice, one of the tweets that was censored in India (but which is still visible outside the country) was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GhatakMoloy/status/1384385821956923393"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; from West Bengal state minister Moloy Ghatak, accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of downplaying the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOs8iG"&gt;“India will never forgive PM @narendramodi for underplaying the corona situation in the country and letting so many people die due to mismanagement. At a time when India is going through a health crisis, PM chose to export millions of vaccine to other nations,” the tweet reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QfCQDc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;India will never forgive PM &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@narendramodi&lt;/a&gt; for underplaying the corona situation in the country and letting so many people die due to mismanagement.&lt;br&gt;At a time when India is going through a health crisis,PM chose to export millions of vaccine to other nations &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ModiHataoDeshBachao?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ModiHataoDeshBachao&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/5sQRfT7kpB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5sQRfT7kpB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Moloy Ghatak (@GhatakMoloy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GhatakMoloy/status/1384385821956923393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYLxHz"&gt;India is in the midst of a second wave of COVID-19 cases, which has made ventilators, medicine, and oxygen scarce. According to the Johns Hopkins coronavirus resource center, &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/india"&gt;India reported 346,786 new cases&lt;/a&gt; of the coronavirus on Friday, a new record high, and 2,624 deaths, also a new record. Less than 1.5 percent of the country’s population has been fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8njKe5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How many layers of copyright infringement are in Emily Ratajkowski’s new NFT?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image of Emily Ratajkowski in front of a painting by Richard Prince, which includes a photo of Ratajkowski." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5I8lfBLV6A7Qet_GVBmjHIJLH8k=/0x569:1366x1480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69180421/23EMRATANFT_superJumbo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Emily Ratajkowski’s artwork is being sold as an NFT. | Image: Emily Ratajkowski&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vfJTtO"&gt;Model and actress Emily Ratajkowski is selling a link representing a composite image that features a photograph of herself in front of a print by another artist that contains a photo (of herself) taken by (presumably) yet another artist. In other words, she is selling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;an NFT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JS85fu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/23/style/emily-ratajkowski-nft-christies.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Ratajkowski will be selling the NFT at Christie’s, the storied auction house that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;sold Beeple’s NFT for $69 million&lt;/a&gt; in March. The NFT is, for Ratajkowski, an effort to reclaim images of herself that have been created and sold, sometimes without her permission, throughout her career. Last year, Ratajkowski &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/emily-ratajkowski-owning-my-image-essay.html"&gt;published an essay in &lt;em&gt;The Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;describing moments when she was unable to control often vulnerable images of herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An image of Emily Ratajkowski in front of a painting by Richard Prince, which includes a photo of Ratajkowski." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7ISRzqE60tjYHGWOumONYDGBKeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465946/23EMRATANFT_superJumbo.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Emily Ratajkowski&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A0l1Md"&gt;“As somebody who has built a career off of sharing my image, so many times — even though that’s my livelihood — it’s taken from me and then somebody else profits off of,” Ratajkowski told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. The NFT, titled “Buying Myself Back: A Model for Redistribution,” is meant to let Ratajkowski profit directly, continually, and significantly off of works containing her image that she did not previously have much (or any) stake in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sz4d5P"&gt;The NFT, also, is a copyright nightmare, much like many of the images that Ratajkowski described grappling with throughout her career. To break down the situation at hand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="PJOMC1"&gt;There is the NFT. An NFT contains, essentially, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs"&gt;just a link&lt;/a&gt;, but the terms of sale imply ownership over whatever the NFT links to. Ratajkowski can definitively sell a link. Is she really selling the underlying image? Are all NFTs a sham? Further study is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t2wJYX"&gt;The composite artwork being NFT-ized contains two discrete images: the first is a photo of Ratajkowski in her apartment, the second is (what appears to be) a digital copy of a “painting” by Richard Prince. Someone owns the foreground photo of Ratajkowski in her apartment (possibly the photographer, possibly Ratajkowski herself). Ratajkowski owns a physical copy of the painting by Richard Prince, but she likely does not own rights to digitally reproduce it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LJIcsg"&gt;The Richard Prince painting is itself a copyright nightmare. It is a print of an Instagram post by Ratajkowski, which features a photo of Ratajkowski taken for &lt;em&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/em&gt;, as well as a profile photo of Ratajkowski (possibly a selfie?) and comments written by other viewers of the photo. Richard Prince almost certainly did not get permission to use either of the photos or the comments included in his painting. Is the font copyright protected, too? Please help me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RaDJ88"&gt;This is an entire bullet point just to mention that Richard Prince’s entire thing as an artist is transforming other artists’ work, sometimes in fascinating ways, other times in really gimmicky ways, and seemingly always in ways that inevitably piss people off because he ends up making a ton of money off of minor alternations to someone else’s art. This approach has resulted in many complaints and lawsuits, which have mostly worked out in Prince’s favor, insofar as he has continued to work and make a lot of money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SI0c1N"&gt;Ratajkowski is trolling Richard Prince by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/18/17979422/richard-prince-instagram-lawsuit-fair-use-defense-guide"&gt;stealing his move&lt;/a&gt;, transforming his own work (a transformation of her), and reselling it (seemingly without his permission). Honestly, good work here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aExYrP"&gt;If we’re counting: there seem to be at least four images within this single image. We can reasonably assume that Ratajkowski owns two of them (the core photo of herself, plus her profile picture inside the Richard Prince painting). Richard Prince owns one of them (although that &lt;a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/proof-is-in-the-pixels-for-appropriation-artist-richard-prince/"&gt;could be litigated&lt;/a&gt;). And &lt;em&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/em&gt; and/or a photographer associated with &lt;em&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/em&gt; presumably owns the final image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qGzYoD"&gt;You’ve gotta assume Richard Prince isn’t suing over this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gZHJYN"&gt;Ratajkowski has become, perhaps by necessity, a consistent proponent for allowing transformative use of photographs. In a lawsuit over a paparazzo’s photo she posted to her Instagram Story with a caption over top of it, &lt;a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/emily-ratajkowski-says-instagram-post-is-fair-use-in-extortion-copyright-case/"&gt;Ratajkowski has argued&lt;/a&gt; that her amendment to the photograph should qualify her work for fair use protections. (This is, of course, the same general argument that Richard Prince makes about his work. It’s messy!) A similar, albeit more deliberate, situation is at play here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WSUufS"&gt;More broadly, Ratajkowski seems to be pushing for a rethinking of copyright law that would give subjects more control over how their images are displayed and who profits off of them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ML1wLC"&gt;Maybe none of this matters anyway because, again, what even is an NFT?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="l5ez2h"&gt;Ratajkowski will receive a cut every time her NFT is resold, therefore giving herself some degree of continued ownership over her image(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KOEBka"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The digital terrain should be a place where women can share their likeness as they choose, controlling the usage of their image and receiving whatever potential capital attached. Instead, the internet has more frequently served as a space where others exploit and distribute image&lt;/p&gt;— Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/emrata/status/1385710647204265987?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5qOllh"&gt;And here’s the wonderful thing about doing this all on the blockchain and other distributed networks: say copyright law comes crashing down on Ratajkowski, say the profits are taken from her and she’s ordered to stop marketing the NFT and reposting the image in the future — there’s still nothing anyone can do to wipe out the image. It’ll still be linked on the blockchain and hosted on a distributed network where she wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first problem was vaccine supply. Now, it’s demand.   </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PFK6XR"&gt;Thursday marked a major milestone in the United States’ COVID-19 vaccination campaign: 200 million shots given in President Biden’s first 100 days in office. Over 40 percent of the US population now has at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pidgWd"&gt;But over the past week, the average number of vaccinations reported per day started to fall. Last week, the US was averaging around 3.3 million shots per day. This week, that number dropped to around 3 million shots per day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="hwHHuM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tgaSDY"&gt;Every one of those shots takes us another step closer to the end of the pandemic in the US. The slowing pace, though, is a warning sign that we’re reaching an inflection point where the supply of COVID-19 vaccines will outpace the demand. It’s already happening in &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/21/states-covid-vaccine-problem-483872"&gt;some places&lt;/a&gt;: states have vials of vaccine, but people aren’t signing up for open appointments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuJyoW"&gt;We’re reaching that point because almost all of the people most eager to get vaccinated have already gotten their shots, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/supply-vs-demand-when-will-the-scales-tip-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-the-u-s/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released this week. Polling from the end of March found that 61 percent of US adults wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible — around 157 million people. We’ve only got around 27 million people to go before we hit that number, which the report says could happen in &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/supply-vs-demand-when-will-the-scales-tip-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-the-u-s/"&gt;just a few weeks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8AOMcE"&gt;“Once this happens, efforts to encourage vaccination will become much harder, presenting a challenge to reaching the levels of herd immunity that are expected to be needed,” the &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/supply-vs-demand-when-will-the-scales-tip-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-the-u-s/"&gt;report read.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgkHvV"&gt;Experts warned from the start of the pandemic that it would be a &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/09/17/u-s-public-now-divided-over-whether-to-get-covid-19-vaccine/"&gt;struggle to vaccinate everyone&lt;/a&gt;. A pocket of people in the US is skeptical of any and all vaccines. For some people, the fast development and rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine seemed worrying; for others, the politicization of the pandemic means that they don’t think the virus is enough of an issue to go and get a shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UG7vNN"&gt;Reaching some of those people will be harder than others. There’s a group of hard-line anti vaxxers who probably won’t ever get the shot, or at least won’t for a long time. People who identify as Republicans are &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/dashboard/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-dashboard/"&gt;most likely&lt;/a&gt; to fall into that category. No matter what outreach strategies doctors and officials use, this group of people will still probably turn the shot down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OTu6ON"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“As long as there are places with more supply than demand, then there is more work to be done on demand,”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B4yZll"&gt;But a significant chunk of the people who aren’t particularly &lt;em&gt;eager&lt;/em&gt; to get the vaccine say they still probably will get it, they’re just not actively tracking it down. That group doesn’t want to be first in line; they want to wait and see before they roll up their sleeves. With some effort and creativity, it’s possible to get them on board. It’ll take changing tactics. Officials may make it easier to get a vaccine by offering walk-in appointments. Communities may offer incentives, like the New Orleans bars and restaurants holding &lt;a href="https://nola.eater.com/2021/4/12/22376260/new-orleanss-bars-restaurants-join-covid-19-vaccination-effort-shot-for-shot"&gt;“shot-for-shot” events.&lt;/a&gt; People who have questions about the vaccine may prefer to get it at their doctor’s office instead of a vaccine site — talking with a trusted doctor is a powerful way to overcome hesitancy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sFU1CP"&gt;“As long as there are places with more supply than demand, then there is more work to be done on demand,” said Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard epidemiologist, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/21/states-covid-vaccine-problem-483872"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “If a strategy is only sort of working, which I think is the case, we could do better by experimenting with different approaches.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZakFP"&gt;Figuring out a way to maintain the pace of vaccinations and get the available shots in arms is the next public health challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic. As each person gets vaccinated, they’re safer, and their world expands. But they also start being able to protect others — the vaccines make it less likely that they’ll carry and spread the virus, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ILYqM"&gt;As the number of people who are vulnerable to catching it shrinks, the virus has fewer pathways to travel from person to person. At a certain point, once the vast majority of pathways are blocked off by people who are protected, it will become much harder for the virus to spread — a milestone called&lt;a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/achieving-herd-immunity-with-covid19.html"&gt; herd immunity&lt;/a&gt;. It’s still not entirely clear what that threshold is for this pandemic. The virus is still very new. But some experts think that about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22370176/covid-19-vaccinated-people-cdc-guidance-herd-immunity"&gt;70 to 80 percent of people&lt;/a&gt; in a population need to be vaccinated before herd immunity kicks in.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VZs97"&gt;That’s why ending the pandemic isn’t individual — it’s collective. In order to reduce the risk of COVID-19 for everyone, we have to encourage as many people to get their shots as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy A52 5G review: a midrange phone that will last</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s not the cheapest budget phone, but it will go the distance&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="q8E5E4"&gt;If a $100 budget phone is the fast-food dollar menu and a $1,000 flagship is a steakhouse dinner, then the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G sits comfortably halfway between the two: the laid-back all-day cafe with surprisingly tasty food. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6762Rt"&gt;It’s good. More importantly, it’s good where it matters. Sure, you have to order your food at the counter and get your own water refills, but it’s worth it because brunch is fantastic and the prices are reasonable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frUf4o"&gt;The A52 5G is the highest-specced of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370189/samsung-galaxy-a52-a42-a32-5g-a12-a02s-price-specs-price"&gt;budget A-series Galaxy phones&lt;/a&gt; we’ll see in the US this year, offering all of the basics for its $499 price tag along with a few good extras. Its 6.5-inch screen comes with a fast 120Hz refresh rate that’s scarce at this price point. Its main camera includes optical image stabilization, something I missed when I used the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;more expensive OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;. The A52 5G is rated IP67 waterproof for some extra peace of mind. And hey, there’s still a headphone jack! In this economy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CbrcLy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10462503"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r4ql9c"&gt;Still, this isn’t a flagship, and costs had to be cut somewhere. The device’s frame and back panel are plastic, and while I like the matte finish on the back, there’s a certain hollowness when you tap on it that’s not very reassuring. There’s also no telephoto to complement the wide and ultrawide cameras, just digital zoom plus a depth sensor and macro camera of dubious usefulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHb7bt"&gt;The important stuff is here, though. Samsung has the A52 5G on its list for monthly OS updates currently, and it says it will offer three years of major Android OS updates and at least some security support for four years. That will go a long way toward making the most out of your investment in this phone, and it will help you take advantage of its headline feature: 5G — Sub-6GHz, specifically, with hardware-level support for the C-band frequencies carriers will start using in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ags8Hc"&gt;It’s getting more common to see 5G offered in midrange and budget phones, but in this country, it’ll be a couple more years before our 5G networks are truly good. Healthy device support for the next few years makes it more likely that the A52 5G will actually last long enough to make it to that 5G promised land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N1lu981XZQQIMuwY7AbVUo_HWFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465665/ajohnson_20210419_4541_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A52 5G offers solid everyday performance with a Snapdragon 750G chipset and 6GB of RAM.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vTC01h"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G performance and screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xBcTmE"&gt;The A52 5G uses a Snapdragon 750G processor with 6GB of RAM, and the combination feels like a good fit here. You can certainly push it out of its comfort zone with heavier tasks like webpages with JavaScript, and I noticed it hesitating a moment too long when opening the camera app from the lock screen. But for day-to-day tasks and social media scrolling, it keeps up well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHF1lS"&gt;As in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"&gt;last year’s model&lt;/a&gt;, the screen is where the A52 5G (and Samsung generally) really stand out. This is a 6.5-inch 1080p OLED panel that’s rich, bright, and generally lovely to look at. Plus, it offers all of the velvety smoothness that comes with its 120Hz refresh rate. Swiping between home screens, opening apps, scrolling through Twitter — it all just feels nicer with a fast refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TlJgv3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One feature I continue to fight a losing battle with on the A52 5G is the in-display optical fingerprint sensor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5WXx6D"&gt;Even considering the additional power needed for the 120Hz screen, the A52 5G’s 4,500mAh battery consistently lasted well into the next day in my use. I managed to get two full days out of it when I forgot to charge it overnight and decided to embrace chaos and just plow through on the remaining charge. This was with light to moderate use, and I was down to low double-digit battery percentage by the end of day two, but my gamble paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jvn5CE"&gt;One feature I continue to fight a losing battle with on the A52 5G is the in-display optical fingerprint sensor. I’ve been chastised by the phone many times for not leaving my finger on the sensor long enough, and I almost always need at least two tries to get it to register. That hit rate goes down significantly outside in bright light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gO7BU8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I see enough ads throughout my day as it is, and I do not appreciate seeing one more when I check the weather&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3s0y6"&gt;These problems aren’t unique to this device, and you can just opt to use (less secure) facial recognition or a plain old PIN to lock and unlock the phone. But there are nicer in-display fingerprint readers in pricier phones like the OnePlus 9 and Samsung’s own S21, so it’s a trade-off to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vk5IWZ"&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G ships with Android 11, which is great. The less good news is, as we saw in the S21 devices earlier this year, Samsung’s latest take on the OS stuffs a lot of unwanted apps, ads, and general clutter into the UI. I see enough ads throughout my day as it is, and I do not appreciate seeing one more when I check the weather on my phone’s own weather app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPpfpU"&gt;If there’s a positive way to look at this situation, it’s that it feels more forgivable on a budget phone than on a $1,000-plus flagship. But I’d rather not have the ads at all. If you buy the similarly priced Pixel 4A 5G, you give up a lot of other features from the A52 5G, but you get an ad-free experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZhUR-qGtJB0ABj4ns-AbLqIMuEs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465664/ajohnson_20210419_4541_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Housed in the rear camera bump are a standard wide, ultrawide, macro, and depth sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HaqLe9"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TGVjuj"&gt;The A52 5G includes three rear cameras, plus a 5-megapixel depth sensor. You get a 64-megapixel standard wide with OIS, 12-megapixel ultrawide, and the seemingly obligatory 5-megapixel macro camera. There’s also a front-facing 32-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1n9yk3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10462184"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LfMrMu"&gt;The 64-megapixel main camera produces 16-megapixel images in its standard photo mode that are bright with the very saturated colors you’d expect from a Samsung phone. Sometimes the look is pleasant, but more often than not, it’s a little much for my taste. The good news is that this sensor is capable of capturing lots of fine detail in good lighting, and it even does well in dim to very low-light conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmGCNi"&gt;I put its night mode up against the Google Pixel 4A, which is still the low-light champ in the midrange class. There’s more noise visible in the A52 5G’s night mode shot, and details have a watercolory look, but while the 4A hangs on to its title, the A52 5G is quite close behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="muSVAD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10462353"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fL9uTL"&gt;The Pixel 4A is still the better camera in good lighting, too, but the differences are more subjective here. The 4A goes for more subdued color rendering, and the A52 5G’s images lack a little contrast in comparison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b2waOI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10462360"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rEZCg3"&gt;So the A52 5G can’t beat the generation-old imaging tech in the 4A, but that might say more about the Pixel than anything else. Aside from that, the A52 5G turns in good all-around camera performance. Images from the ultrawide sometimes have a little cooler color cast but are generally good. The selfie camera offers two zoom settings: a slightly cropped-in standard wide view and an ever-so-slightly wider angle. The “focal length” difference between the two is almost laughably small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4meBPd"&gt;At its default settings, the selfie camera does a fair amount of face smoothing and brightening. I don’t think it quite crosses the line into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;hamcam territory&lt;/a&gt;, but it certainly has that telltale “maybe it’s AI, maybe it’s Maybelline” smoothed look to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uhpTk3"&gt;If you want to go full hamcam, there’s a new mode just labeled “fun” in the camera app with AR face filters brought to you by Snapchat. There’s a different selection of them every day, and you don’t need a Snapchat account to use or share them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rqpRt"&gt;I’m tempted to dismiss them as “for the youths,” but maybe this is really for the olds like me who would rather not join another social platform if I can possibly avoid it, thank you very much. At last, I can transform my face into a piece of broccoli and share it with the world without logging in to Snapchat — three years after the kids have all moved on to something else. Anyway, it’s there, it works, and you can indeed turn your face into broccoli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h1oKBK3JdgYUcwZh5b6fILyiLJ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465662/ajohnson_20210419_4541_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good hardware and healthy software support make the A52 5G worth spending a little more on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8blwo0"&gt;There’s a lot that the Galaxy A52 5G gets right. Maybe the most important feature is one that sounds much less exciting than cool headline specs: security updates for at least the next few years. At $500, this is the higher end of the budget market, but a few extra hundred dollars is likely easier to swallow if you know you’ll get a couple more years out of your investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QxfsaW"&gt;Samsung has invested in hardware in all the right places: the 120Hz screen makes for an elevated user experience, battery life is good, camera performance is strong, and a healthy processor / chipset combination handles daily tasks well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pVgjzT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The A52 5G is a good midrange phone today — but just as importantly, it will be a good phone a few years from now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fXjffS"&gt;What I didn’t love — the cluttered software, fussy fingerprint sensor, a tendency toward oversaturated color in photos — feels more forgivable when the phone gets the nonnegotiable stuff right. The Pixel 4A 5G is probably this device’s closest competition, and it beats the A52 5G on camera quality and a cleaner UI, but it’s a smaller device without a fancy fast refresh rate screen. Depending on how you feel about either of those things, the 4A 5G might be the better pick for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="w7Ybue"&gt;In any case, the A52 5G is a good midrange phone today. But just as importantly, it will be a good phone a few years from now. With solid hardware and a software support system to back it up, this is a pricier budget phone that’s worth budgeting a little extra for.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="TCL Alto 8 Plus " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tHvFjNCstH092eC60eC4cM1x_NY=/0x0:1041x694/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69180108/altohed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;TCL’s Alto 8 Plus soundbar | TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FgFSwe"&gt;It’s the weekend, so that’s our cue to fire off this handy list of the best tech deals we’ve laid eyes on over the past few days. There weren’t many big surprise price drops, but that doesn’t mean there weren’t some great pieces of tech to buy. This week’s best deals are for people trying to stretch their dollar as far as possible. There’s a discount on a feature-packed soundbar for under $100, and Google’s Pixel 3 that has a solid camera is just $170. Plus, there are some more gaming deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2E0Y3R"&gt;Have a nice weekend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="KmGms5"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CJn9s7"&gt;Save on this capable yet affordable TCL soundbar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XQEtEr"&gt;TCL might be known more for its TVs than soundbars, but we still think this deal from Woot is worth sharing. The TCL Alto 8 Plus, which has both a subwoofer and Amazon’s Fire TV 4K streaming hardware built in, is just $70 new at Woot. It has a one-year warranty through TCL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uWsvjm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10459877"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="hVZ6T4"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ayf3NN"&gt;Google’s compact Pixel 3 is just $170 at Woot and Daily Steals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bEXUTb"&gt;If you’re looking for a phone that doesn’t cost too much money but also doesn’t compromise on camera quality, check out this deal. The Pixel 3 is available at Woot and Daily Steals for $170. At Woot, you don’t need an offer code. But if you’re shopping through Daily Steals, you’ll need to enter the code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEPXLE &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout to save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kGaOLG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295850"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="yDbwUM"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="picMwV"&gt;Razer’s DeathAdder V2 Pro is more affordable than ever&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Rve4TR"&gt;GameStop’s Pro Day sale has the best discount we’ve seen yet for the Razer DeathAdder V2 Pro wireless gaming mouse. It’s normally $130, but you can snag it today, April 24th, for $80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="riz8XG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736462"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8qozOs"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1i1fWK"&gt;Get Cyberpunk 2077 for $40 at GameStop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dGRUIM"&gt;Joke all you want about Cyberpunk 2077’s disastrous launch, there’s still a lot of solid gameplay to enjoy here. If you own an Xbox Series X or PS5, you’ll certainly have a better, smoother experience than those who still have an Xbox One or PS4. Get this game for $40 during GameStop’s Pro Day sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XBfJ7M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10197689"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>SpaceX capsule with four astronauts on board docks with the International Space Station</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lheOYH"&gt;A SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft with four astronauts aboard successfully docked with the International Space Station early Saturday to start its six-month mission, &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/crew-2/2021/04/24/spacex-crew-2-astronauts-join-station-crew/"&gt;NASA announced&lt;/a&gt;. Crew-2, as it’s been dubbed, is SpaceX’s third astronaut mission under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. It brings NASA’s Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, Akihiko Hoshide of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and Thomas Pesquet, a French aerospace engineer from the European Space Agency (ESA) to the ISS, which travels at more than 17,000 miles per hour in orbit roughly 250 miles above Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niO07n"&gt;A Falcon 9 rocket which was used for SpaceX’s Crew-1 mission in 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22398981/spacex-launches-third-nasa-astronaut-crew-used-crew-dragon-capsule"&gt;launched early Friday&lt;/a&gt; for its 24-hour trip to the ISS. The Falcon 9 carried Endeavour, the same Crew Dragon capsule that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/30/21269703/spacex-launch-crew-dragon-nasa-orbit-successful"&gt;launched SpaceX’s debut astronaut mission last year&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="liVW9c"&gt;The four astronauts were welcomed aboard the ISS shortly before 8AM ET by the Expedition 65 crew of Shannon Walker, Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover, and Mark Vande Hei of NASA, as well as Soichi Noguchi of JAXA and Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg Novitskiy and Pyotr Dubrov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nLAM2P"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"Endeavour arriving!" Welcome to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Space_Station?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Space_Station&lt;/a&gt;, Crew-2! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their arrival means there are now 11 humans aboard our orbiting laboratory, a number not seen since the space shuttle era. Hugs abound. &lt;a href="https://t.co/uSwW3JFl6K"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uSwW3JFl6K&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA (@NASA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1385923550738100228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VDVKxF"&gt;Kimbrough, McArthur, Hoshide, and Pesquet will now spend six months in space conducting &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/crew-2-microgravity-science-space-station"&gt;science experiments&lt;/a&gt;, including a focus on “&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/tissue-chips"&gt;tissue chips&lt;/a&gt;,” which NASA describes as “small models of human organs containing multiple cell types that behave much the same as they do in the body.” The chips may help identify drugs or vaccines more quickly than the current processes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gg3kWN"&gt;The mission marks the first time SpaceX has reused a craft for a crewed mission. SpaceX has launched and reused several Falcon 9 rockets and uncrewed Dragon capsules as part of an initiative to save time and money on space exploration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vaNObR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo Flex 3 Chromebook review: good price, bad screen</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;If you squint, it’s a good laptop&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mJpAgB"&gt;Lenovo’s Ideapad Flex 3 Chromebook is one of the tiniest Chromebooks I’ve ever used. It’s also one of the cheapest, retailing for just $349.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSaYIO"&gt;Any laptop that costs that little is going to have some serious drawbacks — and the Flex 3 certainly does. On the other hand, if you’re the sort of shopper who’s willing to set those aside, this little IdeaPad also has a number of pleasant surprises up its sleeve. There are even a few areas (in particular, the battery life) where it gives significantly more expensive devices a run for their money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="IoI416"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10462824"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="983yJe"&gt;I’ll start with the pleasant surprises. The Flex 3 offers a more modern port selection than I’d expect at its price point — there are two USB 3.1 Type-C Gen 1 ports and two USB 3.1 Type-A Gen 1 ports (one on each side, which is really handy for charging and connecting accessories), as well as a microSD reader, an audio combo jack, and a lock slot. There’s a 720p webcam that works decently well if you’re not in low light. And the touchpad is surprisingly sturdy — I often find that touchpads in this price range feel plasticky. The Flex even comes with a Google Security H1 chip, which encrypts sensitive on-device data.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Ideapad Flex 3 Chromebook sits open on a table in front of two houseplants. The screen displays the upper windows of a large building." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MjAXXv269bHXVJp5D5GcMXbzyh4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465928/mchin_20190715_4544_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a power button on the side, as well as a volume rocker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ctkol8"&gt;There are two features that really impressed me (in addition to the battery life, which I’ll discuss later on). First, I can’t stop talking about the keyboard. It’s great, with tons of travel and a satisfying click. The keys have a slightly rough texture that really grew on me. I got one of the highest scores I’ve ever gotten on my usual typing test, with almost no errors. The only note is that it lacks backlighting, a feature you’ll find on more expensive devices like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt; (our current top Chromebook pick) and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Flenovo%2Fstudent-chromebooks%2FIdeaPad-F5-CB-13CML-05%2Fp%2F88IPFC51448&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22400085%2Flenovo-ideapad-flex-3-chromebook-review-price-screen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo’s Flex 5 Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Ideapad Flex 3 keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2pw40tT5NaVBOgqkSG-hFJguNHo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465938/mchin_20190715_4544_0015.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;God, I love a good keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ib8FQC"&gt;Second, audio. The balance and volume that these 2W stereo speakers deliver are on par with those of any number of more expensive Chromebooks. They easily beat the Spin 713, which sounds tinny and thin. There are caveats, of course: There’s very little bass, percussion is weak, I heard a bit of distortion at max volume, and you’ll want an external speaker for any crowded setting. But the Flex is great for video conferences and regular music-listening, and certainly beats what I’ve heard from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22368806/msi-prestige-14-evo-review-price-specs-features-intel-1185g7"&gt;all kinds of Windows laptops&lt;/a&gt; that are over $1,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrS84j"&gt;Now, for the major drawbacks. First, this thing is a clunker. It’s not too heavy, at 2.65 pounds, but it’s 0.7 inches thick, and it’s not too far from the size of many modern 13-inch laptops despite having just an 11-inch screen. My main turnoff, though, is the bezels. Good lord, the bezels are enormous. When I’m using the Flex 3, I feel like I’m looking at a small window of screen floating in an abyss of black. It looks like a device you’d have bought in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Ideapad Flex 3 Chromebook open from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ILkVWQvleiFgAepA9jHh_U2eYy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465929/mchin_20190715_4544_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wish Lenovo had sprung for a better screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Ideapad Flex 3 Chromebook from the left side, half open on a table in front of two houseplants." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6OJ9zjZpOm0K4KITiX_1FrxwJuU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465931/mchin_20190715_4544_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use the Flex 3 in laptop tent, stand, or tablet modes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Ideapad Flex 3 Chromebook closed from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Kb6kKtGBaLeXd46bXenxUVpVUE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465932/mchin_20190715_4544_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is from the other side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F8q4kL"&gt;I do like some things about the chassis, though. It doesn’t feel at all flimsy, with an aluminum cover and a non-plasticky finish. The display and keyboard are free of flex (despite the laptop’s name). And the 360 hinge is sturdy, with very little wobble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="E5IDM2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10462832"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RM0LtC"&gt;Speaking of the display, though: That’s the second major drawback here. It’s cramped — I often use two windows side-by-side and I’ve been squinting at tiny text in order to make that work on the Flex 3. Moreover, it’s dim (maxing out at 250 nits), kicks back a ton of glare even indoors, and is quite low-resolution (1366 x 768). I’m gonna be real: It’s pixel-y to look at. I’ve been using the Flex 3 as my primary driver for a week, and while I will miss the keyboard and audio when I send it back, I can’t wait never to have to look at this terrible screen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77uXF3"&gt;That’s the lowdown on the chassis — let’s look inside. This Ideapad Flex 3 Chromebook configuration is powered by Intel’s dual-core Celeron N4020. That’s the bottom of the barrel as Intel processors go, and it comes with just 4GB of memory (LPDDR4-2400, soldered) and 64GB of eMMC 5.1 storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNLDff"&gt;On a Windows machine, these specs would be a hard pass. But Chrome OS is a lighter load, and I can vouch that the Flex 3’s screen is a bigger limit on multitasking than its horsepower is. I was &lt;em&gt;able &lt;/em&gt;to use the laptop for a substantial workload, jumping between dozens of Chrome tabs and some apps, but the experience was cramped enough that I wouldn’t recommend it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Ideapad Flex 3 Chromebook open, seen from the back, angled slightly to the right, on a table in front of two houseplants." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KpKqNTq7XHlcBJ_EH2hKOz6yJVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465933/mchin_20190715_4544_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The color is called “almond”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rvio6t"&gt;Scrolling got a bit sluggish when I tried to work on top of a Spotify or YouTube stream, and the transitions between laptop and tablet mode were a bit slower than I would’ve liked. The only task where I ran into real trouble, though, was sorting through a batch of shots in Google Photos (with a couple other apps running on the side). The Flex 3 did get the job done, but it was quite slow. The one Zoom meeting I tried (on top of some other tabs I needed) was also a bad experience — audio randomly cut out a couple times, and video was stuttery throughout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBJKQV"&gt;Overall, this device is best if you’re looking to do basic office or school tasks, and don’t think you’ll need to have more than a few things open at a time. (And in case this doesn’t go without saying, you’ll want to stay far away from this thing if you plan on doing anything fancy with Linux.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DctQbr"&gt;The flipside of the weak processor is that the Flex 3 has excellent battery life. I averaged eight hours and 45 minutes to a charge with brightness at 50 percent — and I was pushing the thing harder than most people probably will be, as noted above. You can expect that this thing will last all day, and certainly longer than many more powerful Chromebooks. The 45W charger is acceptably quick, juicing the device up to 60 percent in 52 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Ideapad Flex 3 Chromebook laid flat on a wooden table, seen from above, angled slightly to the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rf1F4Xqkb01JrMUPcSDbk5q3OBc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465934/mchin_20190715_4544_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Six rows of keys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="duyeAB"&gt;The Flex 3 runs Chrome OS, which means it can run Android apps natively. Some of these have improved since the last time I used this operating system — Messenger is now functional and no longer a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;complete disaster&lt;/a&gt; that bricks the machine, for example. But most of the services I use daily (Slack, Twitter, Gmail, Reddit, etc.) are just better experiences in a browser, so I didn’t use the dedicated app functionality all that often. There’s also still a double-notification problem — every time I got a Slack message, I got a notification both from the Slack Android app and my browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4hEib"&gt;The Flex 3 also supports Chrome OS’s tablet mode, which has gotten quite good. It supports Android-esque gesture controls, which should help flatten the learning curve for new Chromebook users (though they were a bit sluggish on this device). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Q5sYgc"&gt;Deciding whether to buy a $350 Chromebook comes down to understanding what the big drawbacks are. In this case, there are two: The screen is cramped, and the processor is weak. So the question to ask is: Given those caveats, can you get your stuff done? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cID626"&gt;If you’re just using this device to pay bills, email people, and run some YouTube videos, I would say you can. It’ll be a little cramped, but you can. And if you can stomach that, the Flex 3 does deliver some great benefits in other areas, from the great keyboard and convenient ports to the outstanding battery life and respectable audio. In these categories, it rivals or surpasses our top Chromebook pick (the Spin 713). If you’re okay with its flaws, you’ll find that the Flex 3 offers quite a bit for its budget price. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Guacamole may be premature, but it sounds ripe to become an Android feature</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QgiIuq"&gt;Google probably wasn’t planning to reveal this until &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371782/google-io-2021-date-announcement-virtual-online-event-date-android"&gt;the company’s I/O developer conference on May 18th&lt;/a&gt;, but it looks like a cat may be out of the bag: the company’s testing a feature that should let you stop alarms and answer calls on your Android phone simply by saying “stop” — no need to pick up your phone or even say “Hey Google.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfJrAn"&gt;We know this because a mysterious new setting called “Guacamole” has popped up in the Google app on Android 11 for some users — including me. (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/23/googles-guacamole-isnt-just-a-delicious-dip-its-a-mysterious-new-assistant-feature/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/23/google-assistant-guacamole/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tipped us off.) And while none of us journalists have been able to actually turn on the feature yet, it’s fairly easy to imagine what it does.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R8TKHNyd4pn8JRw2MsKun1uidj4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22466190/guacamole_google.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The menus where Guacamole can be found, for some users running Android 11 and Google app version 12.15.9.29.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iCGMuz"&gt;If you’d rather not imagine, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;’s sources say it specifically will handle alarms, timers, and calls by letting you say “Stop”, “Snooze” and “Answer/decline the call” respectively. None of those worked for me after I flicked the switch, likely because I wasn’t able to access a Google internal website for dogfooding employees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CR9sGeTza32x4HOSzk_BGhDr4Is=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22466225/guacamole_web.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TAqzgC"&gt;I even tried adding a period to make it g.co/assistant-guacamole, thinking the “go” might have been a typo for one of Google’s g.co shortlinks, but no dice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBwruN"&gt;If the feature sounds familiar, it’s probably because Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18535647/google-assistant-alarm-stop-timer-hey-update-io-2019"&gt;already shoved some guacamole into its Google Home / Nest Hub smart speakers and displays at Google I/O 2019&lt;/a&gt;. You’ve been able to simply say “stop” to stop their alarms ringing for nearly two years already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jC4zaF"&gt;“We’re constantly experimenting with new ways to improve the overall experience with Google Assistant. We have no additional details to share at this time,” Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
