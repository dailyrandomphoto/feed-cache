    <title>The new Beats Studio Buds are already $20 off at Amazon and Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qh5ECz"&gt;The Beats name carries quite a bit of clout, which is perhaps the reason Apple is able to sell headphones and earbuds that fall under the Beats umbrella for a premium, regardless of their performance. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22533158/beats-studio-buds-features-price"&gt;Beat Studio Buds&lt;/a&gt; are a great case in point. The fitness-focused earbuds lack wireless charging and suffer from lackluster noise cancellation, however, they typically command a higher price than some of the like-minded competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJri1v"&gt;Thankfully, they’re currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/1141873/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBeats-Studio-Buds-True-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Black%2F643659699&amp;amp;partnerpropertyid=1065598" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $20 off, the first discount the colorful earbuds have received since making their debut in June. Noted flaws aside, the Beats Studio Buds still tout a comfortable, stem-less design and satisfying sound for the price, along with USB-C charging and support for a handful of Android-specific features — a hallmark we hope Apple brings to more devices in the future. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RN8hwK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10693512"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LmGDy1"&gt;The latest iPad Air is, arguably, the best tablet for most people right now. The well-built, midrange device adopts some design elements from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features"&gt;2018 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; and is compatible with many of the same devices, yet it’s not nearly as big or expensive as its larger sibling. Nonetheless, it comes with a terrific display, USB-C connectivity, and Apple’s A14 Bionic processor, a chip that promises to provide ample speed for years to come. Normally $600, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748634717956796230#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are selling the 10.9-inch iPad Air with Wi-Fi and 64GB of storage for $500, matching the best price we’ve seen on the 2020 iPad Air this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

While still occasionally pricier than similarly specced Chromebooks, Google’s sensible 13.3-inch laptop remains one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; you can buy, with good battery life, an excellent keyboard, and an attractive, understated design that makes the most of its sturdy magnesium chassis. This particular model — which is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YMM4YC1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748639044897168537#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $749&lt;/a&gt; — also packs in a Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM, while remaining plenty light at 2.3 pounds. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi announces Mix 4 with under-display camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jo5Uu8jPjslxptbyKiozr17qA9E=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703667/mix4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pf5xvq"&gt;Xiaomi has announced the Mix 4, the first phone in the Mi Mix series to be announced in nearly three years. The Mix phones have always been about bezel-less designs with seamless screens, and the Mix 4 carries on that idea by commercializing a technology that Xiaomi has been working on for a long time: a selfie camera that’s located directly under the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PziUla"&gt;Xiaomi calls this CUP (Camera Under Panel) technology, though it’s similar to the under-display selfie cameras we’ve seen from other companies. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608812/oppo-next-generation-under-screen-camera-tech-announced"&gt;Oppo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597594/zte-axon-30-refresh-specs-availability-under-display-phone-camera"&gt;ZTE&lt;/a&gt;’s latest efforts, the Mix 4’s screen has a 400ppi area that lets light pass through to the selfie camera, which Xiaomi describes as “virtually invisible.” The camera is 20 megapixels and the display is a 6.67-inch 120Hz 1080p curved OLED panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ky1XD1"&gt;Xiaomi says CUP is “a technology iterated through three major generations, five years, sixty patents, a $77 million investment, and hundreds of engineers.” Last year the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405241/xiaomi-under-display-selfie-camera-no-notch-hole-punch-2021-mass-production"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; to start mass-producing smartphones with its third-generation under-display camera technology in 2021, so it’s making good on that promise with the Mix 4. Xiaomi first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650166/xiaomi-under-display-selfie-camera-weibo-teaser-mi-9-notch-hole-punch"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; its take on the idea back in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JS4R8h5931q5lgahRKBbyHVS2HU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773053/Xiaomi_MIX_4_13.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MBQ0Ih"&gt;The Mix 4 is the first phone to be announced with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550723/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-cpu-ai-performance-mwc-2021"&gt;Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 Plus processor&lt;/a&gt;, a speed-bumped version of the flagship 888 chip with a top clock speed of 3GHz. (Honor did already say that it would use the 888 Plus in the Magic 3, but that phone is yet to be revealed in full.) The processor is paired with 8GB or 12GB of RAM and 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQ1Axr"&gt;The camera system centers around a 108-megapixel Samsung HMX sensor, suggesting similar or identical performance to the slightly outdated but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;still pretty good Mi 11&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also a 13-megapixel ultrawide and an 8-megapixel 5x periscope telephoto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tajwxO"&gt;The Mix 4 has a 4,500mAh battery that can charge at up to 120W wired and 50W wireless. This isn’t Xiaomi’s first phone with 120W fast-charging, but it might be the fastest — Xiaomi claims the battery will get a full charge in under 15 minutes, compared to 23 minutes for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363317/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-announcement-twitter-fast-charging"&gt;last year’s Mi 10 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. 50W wireless charging, meanwhile, will take 28 minutes to get you to 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgxMRA"&gt;Xiaomi will only confirm a mainland China launch for the Mix 4 so far. Preorders will start there tomorrow with general availability coming on August 16th, and the pricing starts at 4,999 yuan (~$770) for an 8GB/128GB model, going up to 6,299 yuan (~$970) for 12GB/512GB.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue’s $50 Icepop mic brings subtle improvements to some Logitech headsets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logitech Blue Icepop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7aLnFia2LUTCk6Z_5BKyiMTHqWk=/0x0:2056x1371/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703641/gproxicepop1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Icepop is compatible with the G Pro X Wireless, the G Pro X, G Pro, and Astro A40.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kGagu1"&gt;Not content with cornering the market with its USB microphones, the latest product from Logitech-owned Blue is a detachable mic called the Icepop. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluemic.com%2Ficepop&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F10%2F22612829%2Flogitech-blue-icepop-microphone-g-pro-x-wireless-gaming-headset" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s a $49.99 upgrade&lt;/a&gt; that can replace the default mics included with Logitech’s G Pro X Wireless gaming headset, the G Pro X, the G Pro, as well as Astro’s A40 headsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5Gjo1"&gt;Logitech is promising that the Icepop will deliver enhanced “broadcast-quality” performance with its 10mm electret condenser mic. It has a built-in pop filter that aims to eliminate those hard “b” or “p” sounds that can be a giveaway that you’re using a lesser mic, and its unidirectional cardioid pickup is said to eliminate background noise and focus more on your voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXxObM"&gt;Installing the Icepop is as simple as plugging it into one of the compatible headsets’ 3.5mm mic jack. Logitech sent over a G Pro X Wireless for testing, and there were no firmware or software updates required to get it working. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech Icepop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9bdgKTqn0l3vB7nvlSUPfQ9mgQg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766156/gproxicepop2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Icepop plugs into one of the compatible mics via 3.5mm jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NfHzF7"&gt;Now, yours truly isn’t a podcast host, so I don’t have preferred voice settings locked in for the times when I need to jump into a voice chat. But to illustrate how the recording quality differs between the Icepop and the default mic that ships with the G Pro X Wireless, I recorded several samples to show what they sound like with and without the special Blue Voice features built into Logitech’s G Hub software. If you’re using the Astro A40, you won’t be able to access the Blue Voice features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6kwBK"&gt;The first is a clean feed from the G Pro X Wireless default mic with no special voice presets via Blue Voice. (My voice sounds a little dull with this mic, and it’s relatively easy to hear my air conditioner running in the background once my voice stops near the end.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yrE8Ks"&gt;&lt;audio controls=""&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766084/gproxwirelessdefaultmic.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sslJH6"&gt;Here’s the default mic again but with Blue Voice turned on with the “Broadcaster 1” preset activated. (Background noise has been hushed, and my voice has much more depth, though it’s still not particularly warm-sounding.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hkig1g"&gt;&lt;audio controls=""&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766095/gproxwirelessdefaultmicbluevoice.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YDHFj0"&gt;Now, here’s how the Icepop sounds without any tweaks made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k8Dq2y"&gt;&lt;audio controls=""&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766097/icepopdefault.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bVQrg2"&gt;Lastly, here’s how the Icepop sounds with the same “Broadcaster 1” preset turned on in Blue Voice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sFSIms"&gt;&lt;audio controls=""&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766100/icepopbluevoice.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ehVM6u"&gt;After listening to the samples over and over, the difference in quality between Logitech’s default mic and the Icepop, while noticeable, isn’t as apparent as I was expecting considering its $49.99 cost. Of course, it’s not reasonable to expect this add-on to rival standalone microphones that cost more, and there are some things that I like about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5iQ6Y"&gt;The Icepop does a better job of accurately capturing what my voice sounds like in real life, replacing some of that shrill effect from the default mic with warmth. And those “b” and “p” sounds do sound great, as advertised, though I was surprised to hear it fumble a little when I made “x” and “s” sounds. That could be my slight lisp or it could be a flaw with the tuning or a limitation of the mic. Turning on the Blue Voice feature fixed most of my complaints, but I was expecting a little more out of the raw feed captured through the Icepop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9tPpiV"&gt;Given that voices have so much range and that hearing is, of course, subjective, I recommend giving this a try if you’re curious and already own one of the compatible headsets. Depending on how you like to gussy up your voice for chats, streams, or podcast appearances, you might be able to get some solid performance out of the Icepop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0mvab"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FxoabH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rsutNN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP announces new detachable and all-in-one Chrome OS computers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jItH8BcKBYolBcYJSTILEKQg-sg=/0x150:3600x2550/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703584/HP_Chrome_Family_August_2021_new_Shot2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eEQVW6"&gt;HP is announcing two new Chrome OS computers for its consumer-focused lineup. The first is the Chromebase AiO, an all-in-one desktop computer with a screen that can rotate from landscape to portrait. The second is the Chromebook x2 11, a lightweight detachable that can easily shift from laptop to tablet modes. The company is also announcing a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183975/google-works-with-chromebook-badge-accessories-chargers-keyboards-mice"&gt;Works With Chromebook-certified&lt;/a&gt; 24-inch USB-C monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WF2kW"&gt;All three new products are designed for students, families, and general consumers. The Chromebase AiO will be available at HP, Amazon, and Best Buy this month, while the Chromebook x2 11 will be available from Best Buy this month and from HP’s website in October. Both computers start at $599.99 for base configurations. The M24fd USB-C monitor will be available in October from HP directly for $249.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="K1Q2tY"&gt;HP Chromebase AiO&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/55n2Ny3lr-nlyjude26Lm2EMzvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769857/HP_Chromebase_AiO_FrontFace_Articulation_Hero.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chromebase AiO’s 21.5-inch touchscreen display can rotate from landscape to portrait orientation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lTvLkm"&gt;The $600-and-up Chromebase AiO is an all-in-one computer with a rotating display — a first for all-in-one Chrome OS desktops. Its 21.5-inch touchscreen has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and it comes with either an Intel Pentium Gold processor or a 10th Gen Core i3 chip. The base Pentium Gold configuration has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage; you’ll be able to get up to 16GB RAM and a 256GB SSD with an upgraded model, but oddly, there isn’t a configuration with 8GB of RAM available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UT6pLi"&gt;The conical base of the Chromebase AiO is made of aluminum and houses dual 5-watt speakers and four ports — two USB-C and two USB-A — as well as a 3.5mm headphone jack. A 5-megapixel camera is available for video calling. You can selectively disable the camera or microphones with the Chromebase’s built-in shutter. Included in the box is a wireless mouse and keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hqf83O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A first look at HP’s new all-in-one Chrome OS desktop","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22379888"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qA2-s3L2totXG7x7kVdypZnO_ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769858/HP_Chromebase_AiO_RearFace_Landscape.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the Chromebase AiO’s ports are located on the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QyhvY0"&gt;Along with its ability to rotate from landscape to portrait, the screen can be tilted back 20 degrees, though there is no height adjustment. HP says portrait mode makes it easier to read long webpages or work with documents. I had a chance to test out a pre-production version of the Chromebase AiO to see how useful the rotating screen is in person — you can read my impressions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22379888"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xVxoXx"&gt;HP Chromebook x2 11&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RfEO5xja_iWk-T5ByQr9eIlSDwY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769859/HP_Chromebook_x2_11_NightTeal_Hero_Front_Left.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Qualcomm-powered Chromebook x2 11 comes with a detachable keyboard, kickstand, and rechargeable pen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zlTP06"&gt;The Chromebook x2 11 is an 11-inch Chrome OS tablet that comes with a magnetic keyboard and kickstand to use it in laptop mode. It has Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7c processor (the first-generation chip, not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451392/qualcomm-snapdragon-7c-gen-2-arm-processor"&gt;more recently announced second-gen version&lt;/a&gt;) and optional 4G LTE connectivity (but not 5G). HP claims it will last up to 11 hours between charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QFfGd"&gt;The 11-inch touchscreen display features a 3:2 aspect ratio and 2160 x 1440 resolution. The tablet itself is made of aluminum and has two USB-C ports for charging and data transfer and a microSD card reader. A fingerprint reader is integrated into the power button for biometric logins, while dual speakers provide audio. Unfortunately, HP wasn’t able to find room for a 3.5mm headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFg0Um"&gt;A 5-megapixel camera is available for video calls, while an 8-megapixel camera is on the back for photo taking or document scanning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JWA2jh0ErhPyMe9LP0TQtTrOufU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769862/HP_Chromebook_x2_11_ShadeGrey_Hero_Front.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The x2 11’s display features a productivity-friendly 3:2 aspect ratio.&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KBH4Gm"&gt;The Chromebook x2 11 will be available with either 64GB or 128GB of storage paired with 8GB of RAM. The LTE-equipped models come with either 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage or 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tHq8L"&gt;Included in the box is a wireless pen that magnetically attaches to the side of the x2 11 to recharge. It can be used with Google’s new Cursive progressive web app for note-taking and sketching. The x2 11 will be the first device on the market with the Cursive app; Google says it will be made available to other Chrome OS devices in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9wBhUA"&gt;HP M24fd USB-C monitor&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3RiO0zoGwLCV6Ki13OEz1yI6dW0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769865/HP_M24fd_USB_C_Monitor_FrontLeft.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M24fd USB-C is certified to be plug-and-play with Chromebooks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4k4k2w"&gt;The M24fd is a USB-C monitor that has Google’s Works With Chromebook certification for simple setup with a Chrome OS laptop. It can provide up to 65 watts of power to the connected laptop over the USB-C cable, or you can connect it to other devices over HDMI (1.4) or VGA. There are also two USB-A ports on the monitor for other peripherals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQMR87"&gt;The 23.8-inch display is IPS and has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. HP says it has horizontal and vertical viewing angles of 178 degrees and supports AMD’s FreeSync tech for more fluid gameplay, with refresh rates up to 75Hz. Brightness is rated up to 300 nits and there is an anti-glare coating on the display itself. HP claims up to 99 percent coverage of the sRGB color space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/04X3gLPAJQeX6ZJJ5n8sAjP7vhg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769866/HP_M24fd_USB_C_Monitor_Rear.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition to a USB-C port, the M24fd has HDMI, VGA, and two USB-A ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UVSSah"&gt;The M24fd’s detachable stand doesn’t rotate like the Chromebase AiO, but it does allow for tilt adjustment from negative 5 to positive 25 degrees. There is no height adjustment, however.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP’s new Chromebase AiO has a screen that rotates from portrait to landscape</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WMU1qTxhw13HQCUqvxEc3o9oQzw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703548/dseifert_4699_hp_chromebase_21_5_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Chromebase AiO all-in-one computer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TWaqDM"&gt;HP has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22379829"&gt;just announced three new Chrome OS-focused products&lt;/a&gt;: a detachable tablet, a new all-in-one, and a Works With Chromebook-certified monitor. All of them are designed to capitalize on the explosive growth Chrome OS devices have seen over the past year and a half, as many students and families have had to adopt remote schooling. I’ve had a chance to try out a pre-production version of the new Chromebase AiO ahead of the announcement, read on for some first impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypwWDH"&gt;The Chromebase AiO is the first all-in-one Chrome OS desktop with the ability to rotate its screen from landscape to portrait. You can switch modes with just a light push on the corner — the content on the screen will automatically rotate to match the new orientation for you. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9hwq2BGzN_LnsqF8q2GpKcR5SdM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769958/dseifert_4699_hp_chromebase_21_5_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chromebase AiO’s claim to fame is the ability to rotate its display to portrait orientation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d89p4v"&gt;HP claims this makes the Chromebase more versatile and easier to use for scrolling through long webpages or working with long documents. But in practice, I didn’t find the portrait mode very helpful in my day-to-day work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="b8VyHR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"HP announces new detachable and all-in-one Chrome OS computers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22379829"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ESMkTb"&gt;For starters, whenever I rotated the screen from landscape to portrait or vice versa, my window arrangement would get lost, forcing me to reset everything. It might be fine if all you use is a single window, but the 21.5-inch screen is large enough to invite you to open multiple windows for side-by-side comparisons or just better multitasking. This obviously works best when the screen is in landscape mode, but whenever you switch to portrait and back again, you’ll have to rearrange all of your open windows. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fine when the screen is in landscape, but becomes awkwardly tall and long in portrait mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R47RJ3"&gt;Additionally, the built-in webcam is on the long edge of the screen, making it most useful in landscape mode. When the screen is rotated to portrait, the camera is awkwardly off to the side. (It’s effectively the opposite of the problem with the webcam placement on the iPad Pro.) A portrait orientation screen can be very useful as a secondary display, but it doesn’t make as much sense to me for a primary one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6GrpPEGMg4YrmI2w0cnf3gpd_C4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769966/dseifert_4699_hp_chromebase_21_5_18.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The base of the Chromebase AiO is aluminum with light gray fabric and is attractive without being ostentatious.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qe9SlZ"&gt;Though the marquee feature didn’t win me over, the rest of the Chromebase’s design is quite nice. The base is wrapped in attractive fabric, the dual speakers kick out a surprising amount of sound and are clear when used for video calls. The general design is modern, yet understated enough to fit in most home decors. This isn’t a bright yellow iMac, which is probably a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ClJCJy"&gt;The screen itself is bright enough for indoor use and is fine for typical productivity or school work, even if its 1080p resolution isn’t the most pixel dense. The touch response is suitable and a nice thing to have if a younger student is using the computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ExXJVS"&gt;The model I’ve been able to try out is the mid-tier version with a 10th Gen Core i3 processor and 4GB of RAM. As this is a pre-production model, I haven’t done any formal benchmarking, but in general usage the processor is more than up to the task of running Chrome OS at this resolution, even when I have multiple desktops, windows, and tabs going at the same time. (The only real sluggishness I noticed was when I tried to play 4K YouTube videos.) The RAM, on the other hand, was an unsurprising bottleneck: I frequently had tabs or windows reload in the background, causing me to miss things like email notifications or lose my place in a paused YouTube video. Just 4GB of RAM might be passable on a small tablet where you are likely only working with one window at a time, but on a device with a large screen that invites you to multitask, it’s not enough. The top-spec configuration comes with 16GB of RAM, but I’m not sure why HP isn’t offering one with 8GB, which is enough for most people and doesn’t have the limitations of 4GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ouXbJFS2L0s6En8xygHM3M9BT2s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769948/dseifert_4699_hp_chromebase_21_5_17.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the Chromebase’s ports are arranged on the back of the base.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5sxJ1eAwFBdWJCJG7pFrEZGKBJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769956/dseifert_4699_hp_chromebase_21_5_11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The included wireless mouse and keyboard use AAA batteries and connect over Bluetooth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sRxzm2"&gt;All of the ports on the Chromebase AiO are neatly arranged in a vertical column on the back of the computer and should be plenty for most people. There are two USB-C ports rated at 10Gbps and two USB-A ports rated at 5Gbps and all of them can be used to charge mobile devices. The only inconvenient part of this design is the 3.5mm headphone jack, which requires reaching around the back of the display to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0ghh3"&gt;The included wireless keyboard and mouse are simple, but mostly fine. They run on AAA batteries and connect via Bluetooth. The keyboard is plasticky, but pleasant enough to type on, while the scroll wheel and buttons on the mouse are stiffer than I’d like. Sadly, there’s no biometric authentication on the Chromebase AiO, requiring me to type in a PIN or password to log in each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzqXzo"&gt;HP says the pricing for the Chromebase AiO starts at $599.99, which would be for the model with the lower-tier Pentium Gold chip and slower eMMC storage. The company didn’t have pricing information for the spec tier I was able to test, but the top-tier model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage will sell for $770. If you’re willing to spend that much, the Chromebase AiO might be an interesting desktop to consider, provided Chrome OS meets all of your computing needs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameMaker Studio 2 will now let you publish on desktop, mobile, and the web for $9.99 per month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zZY9GBSmW8TTPztHn4jdm0iFdEM=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703528/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YoYo Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xLMac8"&gt;GameMaker Studio 2, the game development software used to create indie darlings like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/9/4819852/hyper-light-drifter-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyper Light Drifter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/7/7/4497618/undertale-combines-classic-rpg-gameplay-with-a-pacifist-twist"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is introducing new pricing options today that should make it even more affordable to develop independent games. GameMaker Studio’s developer YoYo Games is now offering an updated “unlimited” free version of the software for hobbyists, a new “Indie” price tier that bundles all non-console platform licenses together for $9.99 per month, and cheaper licenses for studios publishing games on consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9Bm2S"&gt;Prior to today, GameMaker Studio 2 had a free price tier mostly intended for learning how to use the software. It had a monthlong time limit and required you to pony up for a subscription (starting at $39 per year to develop for Mac or Windows) to keep experimenting, among other restrictions. The new unlimited version ditches the time limit but will still require amateur developers to pay to export and publish their game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="laCH4b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Publish games everywhere for a lot less&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xmJt9G"&gt;The price to export and publish is luckily also going down. The new Indie price tier bundles licenses for Mac, Windows, Android (including Amazon’s Fire OS), iOS, UWP (Universal Windows Platform), Ubuntu, and HTML5 for $9.99 per month / $99.99 per year. Previously, non-console pricing broke down into two categories: Creator offered $39-per-year subscriptions to licenses for either PC or Mac; and Developer&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;gave $99-a-piece permanent licenses to export games for mobile, desktop (Mac, Windows, and Ubuntu), HTML5, and UWP. Packaging them into a single option simplifies things and makes it easier to get games released across a greater variety of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhtKd9"&gt;The final pricing change is to console licenses. YoYo Games used to charge $199 per year to publish on either Xbox, PlayStation, or Switch. Those prices will now be replaced by a single Enterprise tier for a $79.99 per month / $799.99 per year subscription. That’s the same offering as YoYo Games’ old $1,500-per-year Ultimate license for a dramatically lower price. Some of the flexibility of picking and choosing a specific console to publish on is lost, but the benefit of a lot more platform options might be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxJxIs"&gt;Developing games has obvious hurdles (learning how to code is just scratching the surface), but the price is one of the larger ones. Lowering the cost to develop and publish on popular platforms like iOS and Android could make a big difference for developers just getting their start. Even if it doesn’t, now anyone can experiment for free at their own pace.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is bringing Samsung to the Apple Watch fight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Rumored Galaxy Watches" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lHR93ChNVZ3qCQpGsLLfZGg5-nM=/1x0:1600x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703617/Samsung_Galaxy_Watch_4_Classic_AH_02_1420x799.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Rumored Galaxy Watches | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic" target="_blank"&gt;Android Headlines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zJEfSe"&gt;On Wednesday, August 11th Samsung is expected to announce a couple new smartwatches: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22608535/samsung-unpacked-event-date-time-galaxy-z-fold-flip-earbuds-watches"&gt;widely rumored Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic&lt;/a&gt;. The company that has the most to gain — or lose — from the success of these watches isn’t Samsung, however, it’s Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GwQ0w"&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17924798/google-smartwatch-wear-os-tick-tock-apple-watch-competitor"&gt;many years now&lt;/a&gt;, I have decried the lack of good smartwatch options for Android phones. There’s nothing in the Android ecosystem that matches the quality and utility of the Apple Watch. As the pace of development in phones seems to slow, the pace of development on wearables still has a chance of growing. And without a viable alternative for Android users, it’s ever more likely that Apple will peel off users (or keep iPhone owners from ever trying Android).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYEp1H"&gt;At long last, Google seems to be ready to finally make a strong attempt to get back in the wearables game. But despite buying Fitbit and despite rumors that Google is working on some kind of Pixel watch, Samsung will be the first out of the gate with Wear OS 3 smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NeABQc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung is first out of the gate with Wear OS 3&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="drgemK"&gt;They will be based on the collaboration between Google and Samsung that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;announced earlier this year at Google IO&lt;/a&gt;. In essence, Samsung is abandoning its custom Tizen OS for watches and instead contributing parts of it to a newly-invigorated version of Google’s moribund Wear OS. Both Google and Samsung are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch"&gt;promising better battery life, nicer software experiences, and more robust third party app support&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYyk3n"&gt;But making a smartwatch that’s better than current Wear OS watch options is embarrassingly easy. Samsung has been doing it for years with its Tizen watches — watches which only really work well with Samsung devices and have been hampered by awful third party app support. We’ve often recommended Galaxy watches as the best option for Android users — but “best” is not the same thing as “great.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plmQPU"&gt;It’s not just about improving on the low bar of either Wear OS or Tizen. There are low bars everywhere for Android users. As Wear OS stagnated, OnePlus, RealMe, Oppo, Fitbit, and others have turned to proprietary, simplified platforms that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380322/oneplus-watch-review-price-specs-features"&gt;lack the features you’d expect&lt;/a&gt; in a smartwatch today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="secmdD"&gt;So the pressure is quite high for both Samsung and Google to deliver to make a pair of smartwatches that are good enough to keep Android owners who want a smartwatch from feeling like they’re missing out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvjHTt"&gt;We will obviously have to wait to review the watches to see if Google and Samsung can meet the moment, but it’s not likely that this first go-round of Wear OS 3 watches from Samsung will be able to match the ecosystem or integration of the Apple Watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCnqHo"&gt;As of right now, the only Wear OS 3 watches we know for sure are coming are these two from Samsung. Fossil will be making watches for this holiday season, but they will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; launch with this new Wear OS 3 platform — instead they’ll use the current, disappointing software until an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588440/google-wear-os-3-update-smartwatch-samsung-2022"&gt;update is made available&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond that, we have no idea what the roadmap for Wear OS looks like. Many companies you’d expect to churn out Wear OS watches have bailed in favor of their own platforms — or bailed on smartwatches altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CRtYcW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung will be the sole provider of Wear OS 3 smartwatches for awhile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QkJERr"&gt;Which means that when it comes to competing with the Apple Watch, Samsung’s Galaxy Watches are going to be the only game in town. And that’s a problem for Google, because Samsung’s Galaxy Watches will be designed with Samsung’s Galaxy ecosystem in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwHPEq"&gt;Like Apple, Samsung is trying to build out an entire suite of associated products and services for its Android phones. It has its own line of headphones, its own system for smart home controls, its own watches, and its own fitness offerings. It even has its own voice-controlled virtual assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgra41"&gt;Samsung’s smartwatches have always worked well with Samsung Galaxy phones, but have been a pain on non-Samsung phones. They’ve required installing multiple apps and plug-ins and came with confusing options for tracking fitness and health. We don’t know yet how closely these watches will be tied to Samsung’s ecosystem, but it could mean that non-Samsung Android users will be put off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhqbgT"&gt;Smartwatches are increasingly defined by their ability to do different kinds of fitness and health tracking. And though I am sure that Samsung will not be shy about putting lots of heath-related sensors into the upcoming Galaxy Watches, Samsung Health is not up to the challenge of competing head-to-head with Apple Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dsmN3"&gt;It gets more complicated with Google’s acquisition of Fitbit. Google has said that it wouldn’t stop using its own health tracking system, Google Fit. That means that these watches could theoretically have three different fitness tracking software options: Samsung, Google, and Fitbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m48vhA"&gt;More consumer choice at the cost of a little confusing software isn’t necessarily a bad tradeoff. Competition is good. But as the new standard bearer for smartwatches for Android, I hope Samsung doesn’t push non-Samsung users too hard into the Galaxy ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9IwmA"&gt;Samsung is so dominant in the world of Android phones that in some regions it can often feel like it’s the only option. For at least the next few months, it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be the only option for Android users looking for a full-featured smartwatch running the latest software. That is a lot of ecosystem power — will Samsung handle it responsibly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a26a0d"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYNUYe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google restricts ad targeting of minors and will delist photos of kids at their request</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/deMVcuNuh3-WUHd8pQ0Eze12oas=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703530/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GjSm2A"&gt;Google will no longer allow ad targeting of children based on their age, gender, or interests as part of a new series of measures designed to protect kids under 18 using its services, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/families/giving-kids-and-teens-safer-experience-online/"&gt;the company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Other changes include a new option for anyone under the age of 18 to ask for their images to be removed from Google’s image results, while YouTube uploads from children will also gradually default to the most private setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFl8WW"&gt;The changes are similar to what Facebook introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595897/instagram-under-16-accounts-private-default-limited-advertising"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt; when it said Instagram accounts for kids under 16 will be set to private by default, meaning users have to choose to make their profiles public. It also banned ads targeted at children based on their interests or their activity, although it still allowed them to be targeted based on age, gender, and location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7FhFUZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube uploads will also be more private by default&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wdvwgq"&gt;Google says it’s introducing its changes based on new regulations being introduced in some countries, and that it wants to offer “consistent product experiences and user controls” globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SiK2mA"&gt;Requesting an image’s removal from Google’s image search won’t remove it from the web entirely, Google cautions, but it says this should give users more control over the spread of their images. Alongside its changes to ad targeting, Google also says it’s expanding safeguards to stop “age-sensitive ad categories” from being shown to teens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CiEgb9"&gt;The search giant is also making a number of other tweaks to its services for children. SafeSearch will now be on by default for users under the age of 18, after previously being on by default for users under 13. The feature, which blocks explicit results from appearing in search, is also coming to Google’s web browser on smart displays. Users under the age of 18 will also no longer be able to turn Location History on in their Google Account settings (Google says the setting is already off by default for all accounts). Assistant-enabled smart devices will also be able to block news, podcasts, and access to the web in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ocJFL"&gt;On YouTube, autoplay will be off by default for kids under 18, and it’s turning on break reminders. YouTube Kids is getting a new autoplay option, but it’ll also be off by default. And there will be new resources available “for young people and their parents to help them better understand [Google’s] data practices.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hh6WrV"&gt;The new features are being introduced on different time scales. The option to request that images be removed from Google’s image search, as well as changes to default YouTube video privacy settings, will rollout in the coming weeks. The new restrictions on ad targeting, SafeSearch changes, and tools to block content on Google Assistant-enabled smart devices are launching in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell Latitude 9420 review: pricey performance</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A dream for workers and IT departments alike&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="z9M093"&gt;Dell’s Latitude line is the answer to Lenovo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;ThinkPad business notebooks&lt;/a&gt;, some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt; on the market. Latitudes aren’t much to look at, but they come packed with security features. There’s a proximity sensor that automatically locks and unlocks the screen. There’s a physical webcam shutter that moves on its own. There’s the Dell Optimizer program which (in theory) learns your behavior over time and tailors everything from audio quality to charging speed accordingly. Most significantly, the Latitude line supports Intel’s vPro, a hardware and firmware platform that includes a number of security features and makes it easier for IT departments to manage devices remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAl8ml"&gt;The Latitude 9420 replaces last year’s Latitude 9410, and the two products look pretty darn similar with a thin, light, CNC-aluminum build. But with the combination of vPro and Intel’s prestigious Evo standards, the 9420 offers a compelling package for business users who are willing to pay a premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell Latitude 9420 keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PHDnHoLiZJiISNrACqGquMRyHT8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22771148/mchin_210802_4692_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dell says the Latitude is “leading the new age of intelligence.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="gmW5J6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10689760"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="BZd85N"&gt;The first thing to emphasize about the 9420 is that it’s not at all cheap. The &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/2-in-1-laptops-tablets/latitude-9420-2-in-1-or-laptop-build-your-own/spd/latitude-14-9420-2-in-1-laptop/ctol942014us" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;base model&lt;/a&gt; starts at $2,039 and includes a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 14-inch 1920 x 1200 screen. (Since these are business laptops, companies often buy them in bulk for lower prices.) I tested a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-latitude-9420-2-in-1-or-laptop-build-your-own/spd/latitude-14-9420-2-in-1-laptop/ctol942014us?configurationid=f22f6c0b-6032-4d15-ab34-2e46c2615c5b" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;more expensive 2-in-1 model&lt;/a&gt; listed at $2,926.75 that includes a Core i7-1185G7, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and a 2560 x 1600 touch display. You can go all the way up to a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/2-in-1-laptops-tablets/latitude-9420-2-in-1-or-laptop/spd/latitude-14-9420-2-in-1-laptop/maxl942014us" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$3,309 model&lt;/a&gt; with the same processor and screen but 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3efnGF"&gt;But if money’s no object for you or your company, the Latitude offers a suite of benefits — particularly for folks who work on remote teams. New to this Latitude model is the SafeShutter, an automated physical camera cover. It covers the webcam whenever you’re not using it, and disappears when you pull up Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or anything else that needs to access the camera. This worked very well and should be convenient for folks who are in and out of virtual meetings all day. (There’s also a physical on / off switch on the keyboard.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrH4sx"&gt;The camera itself — a 3.5mm shooter that supports Windows Hello — is actually good, delivering one of the best pictures I’ve ever seen from a laptop’s webcam. The speakers (two upward-firing and two downward-firing) deliver average volume but clear audio with booming bass and percussion. The four microphones had no trouble picking up my voice, and they succeeded in making me audible above my loud typing and some assorted background noise. Dell also says that Optimizer will direct your bandwidth to videoconferencing applications while they’re in use. It’s a good package for meetings overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Dell Latitude 9420." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ps702wVyzHxZXE-3GV6RMypvUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22771149/mchin_210802_4692_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can plug in a webcam or other peripherals with the two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Z9Ahu"&gt;Another highlight is the 16:10 aspect ratio, which gives the QHD screen extra vertical space. Less scrolling than a typical 16:9 screen, more room for tabs and apps — all good things. You can configure the 9420 with 5G or 4G, and Dell says that Optimizer automatically finds the strongest Wi-Fi access points. And you get a fine port selection, including an HDMI 2.0, two USB-C ports that support Thunderbolt 4, a uSD4.0 memory card reader, a combination audio jack, a wedge lock slot, and a USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell Latitude 9420 on a wooden table, open, angled slightly to the right. The screen displays a blue desktop background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E--nvgqG7FLWMbzmQGOWb6g-FsU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22771147/mchin_210802_4692_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;91.6 percent screen-to-body ratio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="og3qb6"&gt;The only real issue I ran into was with the touchpad. It was unresponsive compared to most laptop touchpads — I felt like I was coaxing the cursor along at times, and it didn’t always go quite where I wanted it to. The device sometimes thought I was clicking when I wasn’t clicking, resulting in accidentally closing windows or leaving my active screen all the time. I brought this up to Dell and I was sent a replacement unit, which had the same issues. (I’ve asked Dell for any other potential fixes, but didn’t hear back by press time.) It shouldn’t be the end of the world, especially if you often use a mouse, but it was odd to see on such an expensive device nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell Latitude 9420 open on a wooden porch table. The screen displays a blue desktop background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i7t_wRVOCUXPDIg_h-LIowLJ7Zs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22771151/mchin_210802_4692_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The touchpad is larger than those of previous generations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="BtJVhX"&gt;The biggest upgrade over previous Latitudes comes on the inside. Dell claims that the new 11th Gen vPro processors deliver 66 percent more CPU power than their 10th Gen counterparts did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gb4zT3"&gt;The 9420 is something of a milestone for the business laptop market — it’s the first vPro device to also be verified through Intel’s Evo program, which certifies that a device meets Intel’s various requirements to be a top competitor in the consumer space including instant wake, fast charging, and responsive performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6COWJ"&gt;Dell and Intel are pushing this combination as a way to please IT departments while also competing with the best consumer laptops on performance, battery life, and other standard productivity metrics. “We’re used to mobile devices that project a certain confidence, style, status, that’s an important part of what Evo also brings,” Intel VP and GM of mobile innovation Josh Newman told me in an interview. “vPro, it’s the performance and security that IT wants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFx9Dt"&gt;That’s especially important as remote and hybrid work blurs the line between business and personal laptops for some customers. “This environment that we’re all living in, it’s so hybrid. You really, from an IT perspective, cannot predict where your end users are going to be, and so security becomes really important, and that’s where vPro comes into play,” added Meghana Patwardhan, Dell’s VP and GM of mainstream commercial PCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id="PFnBX3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10689768"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="EDK8so"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I didn’t experience any lag or sluggishness&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dp5UX3"&gt;When it came to the tasks that many business laptops are most often used for these days — videoconferencing, word processing, photo editing, research, and other tasks in Chrome — the Latitude performed quite well. I didn’t experience any lag or sluggishness, even when I was doing photo work on top of a dozen Chrome tabs with Spotify streaming. The fans did sometimes get quite loud, though you can switch to a Quiet cooling profile in Dell’s Power Manager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell Latitude 9420 facing away from the camera, angled slightly to the left, on a porch table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tf925VnDgN6ZSr7xAL9YMJpF68U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22771153/mchin_210802_4692_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not quite a gaming PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZU7VjO"&gt;For more intense workloads, the Latitude is a solid contender. The 9420 took eight minutes and 16 seconds to export a five-minute, 33-second 4K video in Adobe Premiere Pro. That beats last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519885/dell-latitude-9510-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Latitude 9510&lt;/a&gt;, with a 10th Gen vPro Core i7, which took just over 28 minutes. That’s quite a delta. For a more modern comparison, both the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; (both with a Core i7-1165G7) took over 10 minutes to complete the task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61Dz7P"&gt;Updates to Premiere Pro can impact export time, so a better apples-to-apples comparison is the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/"&gt;Puget Systems benchmark for Premiere Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which tests live playback and export performance at both 4K and 8K. The Latitude scored a 261, which also beats the most recent &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=16041"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=50457"&gt;XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;. (These results are mostly for the sake of performance comparison — the Latitude wouldn’t be the best choice for anyone regularly working with 4K and 8K video.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymgJzD"&gt;While the 9420 wouldn’t be recommended as a primary gaming device, some gaming is certainly possible. Despite its business focus, the laptop beat some of the best consumer thin and light laptops on a few titles. It averaged 55fps on &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s Ultra settings at native resolution and 58fps at 1920 x 1200, where the XPS 13 averaged 48fps. We saw 22fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at native resolution and 35fps at 1920 x 1200, which also beats the XPS. (This was on the title’s lowest possible settings, of course, so it wouldn’t be the most fun to play on this machine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iip13N"&gt;The Latitude did not do as well on lighter titles. It averaged 95fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;’s maximum settings and 157fps on &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, which are both worse than what we saw from the XPS 13. The Latitude also lost to the XPS 13 2-in-1, which performed slightly better than its clamshell counterpart in our testing, on every title here. That device averaged a whopping 226fps on &lt;em&gt;League of Legends. &lt;/em&gt;(Of course, you’ll only see a maximum of 60fps from any of these devices.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dh0RST"&gt;It’s interesting that the Latitude is beating these consumer laptops in Premiere Pro tasks, but losing in other graphic benchmarks. I’ve asked Dell if it has any insight here and will update this review if we make any headway, but my guess is that Dell’s software is better optimized for production workloads than it is for games (which makes sense for a business laptop). My other takeaway here is that even where the Latitude is outperforming the best consumer laptops, it’s not by a ton — which emphasizes how much extra you’re paying for vPro and the Latitude’s business features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="O9SZDl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10689775"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i7WODS"&gt;Cooling was a mixed bag. During both Premiere Pro tests, the CPU spent a worrying amount of time around 99 degrees Celsius. It was much better controlled during gaming, staying between the mid 60s and high 70s. That does indicate that the Latitude may be hitting a cooling wall when it comes to video work. (The keyboard and palm rests did remain comfortable, on the plus side.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UcT2v"&gt;Finally, battery life has been a strength of Latitudes in the past but was a mixed bag here. The device averaged five hours and 41 minutes of continuous use (at around 200 nits of brightness). But the stamina seemed to be heavily influenced by certain settings. When I ran a trial on the Better Performance Windows profile, I got under two hours of juice. I averaged over 10 hours when I ran trials on the Windows Battery Saver profile and Dell’s Quiet cooling profile with Dell’s Battery Extender on, Intel’s power savings on, and the AI features in Dell Optimizer (including the proximity sensor) off. There wasn’t much of a performance difference during these tests, so I recommend switching to all the battery-saving stuff whenever you need an all-day life span.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Tv9a7"&gt;Apart from the wonky touchpad, I have very few complaints about this Latitude. Even things I usually complain about on laptops — the webcam and the audio — were pretty good here. The 9420 is a solid ThinkPad competitor, and easily one of the best business convertibles you can buy. It can accommodate photo and video work, and it can even run lighter games on the side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SI4sEk"&gt;But, of course, there’s the price. Even the base model’s price tag will be out of reach for many people. And if you’re a freelancer or small-business worker, or you’re just looking for a personal device, you can get the same build quality, a 16:10 touchscreen, and performance that’s fairly similar (and even better if you’re gaming) from the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-13-2-in-1-laptop/spd/xps-13-9310-2-in-1-laptop/x27310ekpts#customization-anchor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;over $1,000 cheaper&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="WdmNMx"&gt;As Dell’s and Intel’s representatives have noted, this laptop is really for folks who need both the vPro platform and the Evo platform — the best business features and the best consumer features in one product. If you are in that group, the Latitude 9420 is a solid package that asks very few compromises. It’s premium technology for a premium price. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT review: built for 1080p</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;AMD can now compete with Nvidia at the entry level&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="dxphrD"&gt;AMD has returned to challenge Nvidia with its entry-level RX 6600 XT. This $379 (on paper at least) card is built on the same RDNA 2 architecture that AMD is using for its high-end cards, but it’s designed to boost 1080p gaming instead of reaching the heights of 4K gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="auAliC"&gt;Nearly 70 percent of PC gaming on Steam is &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam"&gt;still at 1080p&lt;/a&gt;, so if you’re one of the millions enjoying 1080p gaming with an older card like the GeForce GTX 1060, this latest RX 6600 XT might be a tempting upgrade when it launches on August 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALsfmv"&gt;It sits at $50 more (again, on paper) than Nvidia’s RTX 3060, and $20 less than the RTX 3060 Ti. AMD claims the RX 6600 XT should perform around 15 percent better than an RTX 3060 at 1080p, for the extra $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PegDGg"&gt;But AMD’s latest RDNA 2 cards have barely registered on Valve’s latest Steam hardware survey, suggesting that Nvidia is producing far more RTX cards compared to AMD. So even if AMD can beat Nvidia at the entry level, it needs to make cards that people can actually buy for it to matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uUXXH1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10693483"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JIYoJ2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dp8T4q"&gt;AMD isn’t creating its own RX 6600 XT, so it’s relying on board partners like ASRock, Asus, Biostar, Gigabyte, MSI, PowerColor, Sapphire, XFX, and Yeston to produce cards. I’ve been testing Gigabyte’s version of the RX 6600 XT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwbF2K"&gt;This particular RX 6600 XT has three fans, with the fan in the middle spinning in an opposite direction to help with cooling. There’s a metal back plate that includes a cutout for the air to dissipate from the heatsink below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NM_SbNEJgxYvlJJ7vpWkNEcTIeo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22772014/twarren_210809_4700_0008.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Fmzte6W6CGaFTtA92yP5-KsgnM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22772008/twarren_210809_4700_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f1fmZA61kWGlAW-c5C_vzZhiqYg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22772011/twarren_210809_4700_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gigabyte’s RX 6600 XT includes a triple-fan design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IgpjRL"&gt;As the RX 6600 XT only draws around 160W of power, it only needs a single eight-pin PCIe power connector. The recommended minimum power supply is 500W, so this is ideal for those not wanting to upgrade their entire systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1gJJcY"&gt;At more than 11 inches long, Gigabyte’s version is a surprisingly big card for an entry-level GPU, but it’s lightweight to hold so it shouldn’t put any strain on your motherboard. The card is also a traditional dual-slot width, despite its bulky look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2ATdM"&gt;Gigabyte has equipped its RX 6600 XT with an RGB light system that lights up its logo on the side of the GPU. By default, this will cycle through a rainbow of colors, but with 16.7 million color options and the ability to sync to other Aorus devices, there are plenty of options for customizing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKXk2P"&gt;At the rear of the RX 6600 XT there are two HDMI 2.1 ports and two DisplayPort 1.4 ports. The card also supports PCI Express 4.0 and includes 8GB of GDDR6 memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sKtb4E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1080p testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MJuXpn"&gt;I’ve been testing the RX 6600 XT with Intel’s latest Core i9 processor. For both 1080p and 1440p tests, I’ve paired this GPU with a 32-inch Samsung Odyssey G7 monitor. This monitor supports refresh rates at up to 240Hz, as well as AMD’s FreeSync support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFXXdA"&gt;I wasn’t able to test the RX 6600 XT directly against Nvidia’s RTX 3060 as I don’t own one of Nvidia’s entry-level cards, but you can see how well the RTX 3060 performed in my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;colleague Sean Hollister’s review&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve been testing the RX 6600 XT against AMD’s RX 6700 XT to see just how much performance you get for $100 less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhqYbZ"&gt;I tested a variety of AAA titles, including &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;. All games were tested at high or ultra settings on the RX 6600 XT with resizable BAR enabled, and most comfortably exceeded 60fps at 1080p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CRFpVe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10693504"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N6arTx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; topped out at an impressive 150fps on average, while &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt; managed 105fps at ultra settings. Even &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; nearly managed 60fps, thanks to a recent update that has greatly improved how the game runs on all hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUjCkf"&gt;Where I really saw the 6600 XT struggle was in ray tracing performance. &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; only managed a pathetic 6fps with ray tracing settings maxed out, but it held at 60fps without ray tracing turned on. There appears to be some issues with this card and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;, though. AMD supplied a new driver for testing midway through the review period to specifically help with &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;, but it didn’t improve ray tracing performance in my tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPlVWC"&gt;“We are aware of some lingering performance issues when DXR is enabled at max settings in &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;,” says an AMD spokesperson. “In our findings, reducing quality settings with DXR enabled delivers a better user experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ntVhqB0RfkkuFfIcYB_-vVDGmok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22772013/twarren_210809_4700_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMD’s Radeon RX 6600 XT is a dual-slot card.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2zXzb4My9nNk4w9LCZfePI-fq4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22772012/twarren_210809_4700_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gigabyte’s RX 6600 XT has a cutout to help with cooling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AFlbKU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; seemed to run well with ray tracing enabled, but you’re cutting performance in half if you want this visual quality and there’s no DLSS, or FSR in AMD speak, to make up for it yet. &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt; was practically unplayable with ray tracing and settings maxed out, averaging 24fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhO9Ro"&gt;So this isn’t a ray tracing card, but for an entry-level budget GPU, I wasn’t really expecting it to be. For everything else, it performs well for its price point at 1080p. When you compare it to the RX 6700 XT, with its $100 price premium, you’ll get around 20 percent more performance if you’re willing to pay extra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prwYIP"&gt;Performance in &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt; was 18 percent better on the RX 6700 XT over the RX 6600 XT, ranging all the way up to 29 percent better in &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; and 31 percent with &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;. Given the issues with &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; on the RX 6600 XT, that’s a gap that may be closed with driver updates, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83KoOU"&gt;Where things get really interesting is when you consider Nvidia’s RTX 3060 Ti. At a $20 price premium (in theory at least) over AMD’s RX 6600 XT, you’ll get between 10 percent and 25 percent better performance in the majority of games. There are some rare exceptions where games like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla &lt;/em&gt;are clearly optimized for AMD, but it’s certainly worth paying extra if pricing and availability is realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/46R4nBDCfX0sp1eMlA6Kufpuq2I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22772009/twarren_210809_4700_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bonus puppy for scale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tsF1YZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1440p testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IucUKF"&gt;While AMD might be marketing the RX 6600 XT at 1080p, lots of PC gamers are still considering the move to 1440p, even at the entry-level side of the market. I also tested the RX 6600 XT at 1440p to see if it could stretch to this resolution, and to be honest... the results were better than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fX5odN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt; manages 70fps on average at ultra 1440p settings, and &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; hits 62fps. I was surprised that &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; didn’t manage better during my tests at 1440p, though. While it hits 60fps on average, it dropped to the 30fps range at more demanding parts of the game. If you enable ray tracing in &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; at 1440p, it makes the game really unplayable in lots of spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v03wIt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10693509"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hNcisA"&gt;AMD’s RX 6700 XT manages 81fps on average in &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;; that’s a surprising 42 percent performance jump over the RX 6600 XT. Elsewhere, the performance gap ranges from &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; running at 21 percent better on the 6700 over the 6600, up to &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; with a 32 percent gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVLx9W"&gt;Still, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; managed 75fps on average with everything maxed out, and &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; got all the way up to 107fps during my tests. There’s certainly room here to play at 1440p with this card, but you’ll likely need to adjust image quality to get there in a lot of titles. &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt; was unplayable in lots of parts of the game at extreme settings and 1440p, and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; crawled along at just 3fps with ray tracing enabled (clearly due to some driver issues).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wZd2E"&gt;I wouldn’t recommend this card for 1440p gaming, nor is it really designed for it. As more demanding games arrive this year and next, you’ll undoubtedly need to keep adjusting settings down if you really want to pair an RX 6600 XT with a 1440p monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnSPRb"&gt;If you’re willing to stretch another $20, if you can actually get a card at retail price, then Nvidia’s RTX 3060 Ti excels at 1440p in comparison. There’s a decent gap of 25 percent or more in most games, and frame rates are closer to 60fps or above in the majority of games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u5W4TR_4iRAsASiLNheYsLgUk24=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22772010/twarren_210809_4700_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMD’s RX 6600 XT is best suited for 1080p gaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3z7GWM"&gt;AMD’s new FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) could help with the longevity of the RX 6600 XT either way. Much like Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), AMD’s FSR aims to upscale games from a lower resolution to provide smoother frame rates without a noticeable compromise in image quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXfcE9"&gt;It’s really early days for FSR, so none of the games we’ve been testing for this review have FSR support. FSR is off to a promising early start in the games that do support it, offering higher frame rates at the flick of a switch. But you shouldn’t necessarily expect it to help at 1080p: like Nvidia’s DLSS, the machine-learning upscaling technique seems to offer worse image quality at lower resolutions. If anything, FSR could help push the RX 6600 XT into 1440p territory, but only if AMD manages to get widespread support for its technology into games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPfhom"&gt;AMD will also have to match that widespread support for FSR with more widespread availability of its GPUs. As I mentioned earlier, the latest Steam hardware survey suggests that AMD’s struggling to produce enough GPUs, and while it’s not the most accurate way of tracking GPU sales, it does show how well Nvidia’s RTX 30-series cards are making their way into PC gamers’ hands despite a global chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Lv4TTc"&gt;With the exception of ray tracing performance, AMD is now competing with Nvidia both in entry-level GPUs and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22524897/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-ti-review-test-benchmarks"&gt;at the $599 price point&lt;/a&gt;. There are plenty of gaps elsewhere in AMD’s lineup, but the $379 RX 6600 XT fills an interesting one between the $329 RTX 3060 and the $399 RTX 3060 Ti. If you’re able to spend the extra $20 on an RTX 3060 Ti (if it’s even available at that price) then it will outperform AMD’s entry-level card in the majority of games. AMD still packs a bunch at the entry level here, but only if its board partners can create enough cards to make the RX 6600 XT a potential option for those on a budget.&lt;/p&gt;
