    <title>DoorDash will let you order at-home COVID-19 testing kits delivered to your door</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rwwgy8"&gt;DoorDash has partnered with two US-based digital health companies, Vault Health and Everlywell, to help distribute at-home COVID-19 test kits across the country, the company announced on Monday. The partnerships will allow DoorDash customers to order the testing kits directly from the company’s app in 12 markets or, conversely, to order the kits from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vaulthealth.com%2Fcovid&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F22%2F22340706%2Fdoordash-covid-home-testing-kits-delivery-vault-health-everlywell" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vault Health’s website&lt;/a&gt; in 20 markets with same-day delivery from DoorDash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZ8N9x"&gt;Both kits contain polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which is a molecular test and considered the most accurate of the testing varieties on the market. Both kits have also received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for at-home testing. The Everlywell testing kit ($109) is a self-administered nasal swab that can be done unsupervised, while the Vault Health kit ($119) is a saliva test that involves supervision from a staffer over Zoom. Both companies promise to return results within 24 to 48 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P4I_CNNHLXjnkCyXjuu2DR-ZMY4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388449/PRImage_COVIDTests.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DoorDash&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HC5VXK"&gt;The markets supported by the DoorDash app include Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Minneapolis, and Phoenix, with more cities to be added soon, the company says. Vault Health’s direct online order option will be supported in Baltimore, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, Phoenix, and San Diego, among other markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dUolQ"&gt;The initiative is part of DoorDash’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355625/doordash-dashmart-convenience-store-launch-snacks-groceries"&gt;DashMart convenience store platform&lt;/a&gt;, a new type of virtual marketplace the company launched last summer as the pandemic was in full swing. DashMarts act similar to a CVS or 7-Eleven but they’re available at all hours of the day from the DoorDash app for ordering convenience store items, light food and groceries, and other products you’d typically find at a corner store or pharmacy. The stores also source from a variety of different vendors, so there’s just not one list of limited inventory to choose  from. In some cases, DoorDash even sources local restaurants’ products to give DashMart the feel of a boutique store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixwCgZ"&gt;Now, in addition to buying supplies, food, and other items, you’ll also be able to start buying COVID-19 testing kits in what DoorDash is positioning as a push into health products. “Amidst the pandemic, one of our priorities has been to make health and wellness essentials more accessible for customers, with the goal of helping businesses leverage our last-mile logistics infrastructure to provide more convenient and timely access to their health supplies,” Anna Katherine Barnett-Hart, director of new verticals at DoorDash, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get an unlocked Google Pixel 4 or 4 XL starting at $250 on eBay</title>

  &lt;p id="eB088h"&gt;A well-rated eBay seller is offering the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923660/google-pixel-4-xl-review-camera-radar-face-unlock-90hz-display-telephoto"&gt;Google Pixel 4 and 4 XL&lt;/a&gt; phones at very reasonable prices for a limited time.

Each of these phones will arrive factory unlocked and be usable with most carriers that support 4G LTE. They’re in new / open-box condition, which the seller indicates as meaning the phones show no signs of wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KV6GXu"&gt;eBay allows up to 60 days to make a return, and the phones are covered with a 90-day warranty. It’s unclear if these models are still covered by Google’s one-year manufacturer warranty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6AlOh"&gt;This could be a good deal for you if you have either the Pixel 2 or Pixel 3 and want to extend how long you’ll get major software updates without breaking the bank. (The Pixel 2 won’t get Android 12, while it’s the last big update for the Pixel 3.) For the price, the Pixel 4 offers better performance than the Pixel 3A and 4A, as well as a 90Hz refresh rate screen to make everything animate more fluidly.&lt;/p&gt;

The deal works the same way regardless of where you shop: add a total of three items to your cart, then the one with the lowest price will be marked down at checkout. You can filter the view at each store to show you just movies, or just video games, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0dAKQ"&gt;Some inclusions that might be of interest to &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers are &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings Trilogy&lt;/em&gt;  on 4K Blu-ray, &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt; for PS5, &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt; on PS4, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kuTwx3"&gt;Speaking of video games, if you have a Nintendo Switch, you owe it to yourself to get the best controller made for that platform. Nintendo’s own Switch Pro controller is usually $70 (rarely dropping in price), but it’s $59 at a few retailers right now. I know, that’s the price of a new game, but if you value comfort, long-lasting battery life, and just all-around good build quality, you should pick this up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/spJhXlqpS2ljV6inVMR0CTAysv4=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69005552/jpeters_210301_4457_0020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our desks can tell their own stories — and ours&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="CGOpiX"&gt;Now that many of us are working from home (and it looks some will continue to do so, even after we’ve gotten past the worst of the pandemic), one of the most important places in those homes is our workspaces — in other words, our desks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6iJY2"&gt;Everyone’s workspace is different. What kind of desk — and desk chair — do you use? Is your workspace neat and organized or filled with tchotchkes and toys? Do you have an old-fashioned wooden desk or a mechanized standing desk? Are you sitting on a stool or the latest Herman Miller desk chair? Is your workspace filled with this year’s high-end tech for working and gaming, or are you happy with a five-year-old laptop and a pair of headphones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EiPNnQ"&gt;In our “What’s on your desk?” series, we look into how people organize and use their workspace so that you can find out all of the various ways we see our spaces and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C33Cp8"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s HomePod mini reportedly has a secret temperature and humidity sensor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TD_fj5raCoRVePli0YJ9Ge0ocWo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69005418/dseifert_201107_4281_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HomePod mini, released last year.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="77cWg6"&gt;Apple’s HomePod mini smart speaker has an as-yet-undisclosed temperature and humidity sensor in its casing, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/apple-homepod-mini-secret-sensor-for-smart-home-thermostats?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The sensor’s exact location was confirmed by iFixit, and it appears to be placed away from the speaker’s internal components so it can measure the external temperature. The exact sensor used is a 1.5 x 1.5mm HDC2010 Humidity and Temperature Digital Sensor from Texas Instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70XPfF"&gt;Although the sensor isn’t currently usable by HomePod mini owners, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg, &lt;/em&gt;Apple has internally discussed allowing the sensor to provide information to other smart home devices like thermostats or fans. This could give smart heating equipment more information about how warm a room is or allow the speaker to trigger a device like a fan if it senses a room has reached a certain temperature. The functionality could work via HomeKit, Apple’s smart home ecosystem, which currently integrates with dozens of internet-connected thermostats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N5TJSb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The sensor may eventually be used with HomeKit devices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8qi1Th"&gt;Amazon has previously included temperature sensors in Echo speakers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;its 2020 model&lt;/a&gt;, where the sensor can be used to trigger other devices via Alexa routines. Meanwhile, Google sells &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/5/17820594/nest-thermostat-remote-temperature-sensors-review-price-specs"&gt;standalone sensors via its Nest sub-brand&lt;/a&gt;, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22331567/google-nest-hub-new-2021-smart-display-sleep-tracking-soli-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest Hub announced last week&lt;/a&gt; also includes a similar built-in sensor to help monitor your room’s temperature while you sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQzZm6"&gt;Although Apple declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; on its report (and did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; request for comment), on at least one occasion, it’s included hardware in a device that’s only been officially activated months later. Its 2008 iPod touch included a Bluetooth chip, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, but it wasn’t able to connect with Bluetooth devices until the year after its release. The hope is that a similar software update may be on the way for the HomePod mini. For those keeping track, major new HomePod firmware tends to release in the fall of each year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft to start reopening headquarters on March 29th, with hybrid workplace focus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L3kUbAJNZQWFne5U2upN_xqabBU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69005322/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nDr8uT"&gt;Microsoft is planning to start reopening its Redmond and Seattle, Washington-based headquarters later this month. The software giant originally started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164522/microsoft-coronavirus-response-comment-employees-memo-work-from-home"&gt;encouraging employees to work from home&lt;/a&gt; more than a year ago, just as the coronavirus pandemic began, and the company’s main US offices have remained closed for months as a result. This will start to change on March 29th, with a limited reopening of Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond and Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvMu86"&gt;“Currently, Microsoft work sites in 21 countries have been able to accommodate additional workers in our facilities – representing around 20% of our global employee population,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/03/22/the-philosophy-and-practice-of-our-hybrid-workplace/"&gt;says Kurt DelBene&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s head of corporate strategy. “On March 29, Microsoft will also start making this shift at our Redmond, Washington, headquarters and nearby campuses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBdU4Q"&gt;Microsoft says it’s taking this gradual approach to be in line with local authority restrictions and that the company has determined it can now safely accommodate more workers while sticking to Washington state capacity limits. “As we watch for progress against the virus in the region and continue to evaluate our guidance, employees who work at Redmond work sites or nearby campuses have the choice to return to those facilities or to continue working remotely, and also have the flexibility to do a mixture of both,” explains DelBene.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8oBKe1ZLHufCw8onyxAkhusZDWQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388422/rXHFyu8.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s hybrid workplace dial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bFlbZ9"&gt;This is the beginning of a reopening of Microsoft’s offices, as part of six stages &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349969/microsoft-offices-reopen-january-2021-workplace-dial"&gt;the company outlined last year&lt;/a&gt;. This is stage four, or what’s called a soft opening, to allow more employees back. Stage five moves offices into open with restrictions, before stage six is fully open without restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHDZS8"&gt;Alongside this reopening, Microsoft is also focusing on a hybrid workplace as it anticipates a continued demand for remote working and flexibility among its own employees and elsewhere. Microsoft is releasing a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fworklab%2Fwork-trend-index%2Fhybrid-work" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2021 version of its Work Trend Index&lt;/a&gt;, a report that includes data and research on how employees and businesses are responding to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1FuZj"&gt;Microsoft has found that 73 percent of workers surveyed want to continue with flexible remote work. Microsoft itself now considers working from home part-time as standard for employees, and the company is looking into new ways of using technology to bridge the gap between remote work and traditional offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9rTG1"&gt;“We’ve pulled together a group of Microsoft researchers, engineers and real estate and facilities experts to prototype hybrid meeting spaces at our Redmond, Washington, and U.K. campuses,” explains DelBene. “The group is investigating different meeting configurations and technologies like multiple screens, cameras and mixed reality scenarios to understand the most effective, inclusive set-up for hybrid work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;this is what Microsoft Teams and the future of work will look like, according to Microsoft &lt;a href="https://t.co/rpHMtux3c8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/rpHMtux3c8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1366814328704409604?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vDDw9u"&gt;This work is still early, but Microsoft is prototyping tweaking existing technology to help with meetings and remote work and even improving Microsoft Teams to bridge the gap. That may well involve turning all of the screens in your home into Teams-capable devices to allow home workers to see employees on the big screen. Microsoft hinted at this type of concept during its Ignite event earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INwA2Y"&gt;“Though we don’t know how far off a new normal is, we are adapting to a new way of working with an expanded understanding of flexibility,” says DelBene. “We know there are thousands of ways of working – in the last year our employees have shown what is possible – and we believe that flexibility is essential to maintaining work-life balance.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine 79 percent effective in US study</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CYPRUS-HEALTH-VIRUS-PANDEMIC-VACCINE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Z3iWGCe_tOzqTDGNwhRJqyoH5M=/44x0:4198x2769/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69005164/1231870504.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XjjM7t"&gt;A fourth COVID-19 vaccine has shown that it can protect people against the worst effects of the disease in a large United States-based trial. Two doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine were 79 percent effective at preventing people from developing symptomatic COVID-19, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2021/astrazeneca-us-vaccine-trial-met-primary-endpoint.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from the company today. No one in the US trial who received the vaccine was hospitalized for COVID-19, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxUm3Q"&gt;It’s a good result for a vaccine that’s been dogged by clinical trial issues, poor transparency, and skepticism &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22274371/covid-vaccine-astrazeneca-south-africa-variant"&gt;since last fall&lt;/a&gt;. AstraZeneca said the vaccine was up to 90 percent effective in November based on data from the United Kingdom and Brazil, but that number was based on a half-dose of the vaccine given to trial participants by mistake. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/astra-vaccine-shows-82-efficacy-with-3-month-gap-oxford-says"&gt;Additional analyses&lt;/a&gt; found that the two-dose vaccine was around 82 percent effective against symptomatic COVID-19 when the doses were given three months apart. It has already been authorized and is being used in other countries around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVJvgu"&gt;The company said that participants in the clinical trial did not have any usual or dangerous blood clotting. Over the past few weeks, some European countries halted the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine after at least 13 people who received the vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/03/it-s-very-special-picture-why-vaccine-safety-experts-put-brakes-astrazeneca-s-covid-19"&gt;showed signs&lt;/a&gt; of an unusual clotting disorder. It’s not clear if the vaccine is linked to the disorder, and the &lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-benefits-still-outweigh-risks-despite-possible-link-rare-blood-clots"&gt;European Medicines Agency said&lt;/a&gt; the benefits of the vaccine outweigh that potential rare risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hVnjI6"&gt;Today’s release did not include any information on how well the vaccine performed against variant forms of the coronavirus. South Africa stopped using the AstraZeneca vaccine in February after a small study found that it did not protect against mild and moderate COVID-19 caused by the B.1.351 variant. That variant was first found in South Africa and may dodge antibodies created by vaccines. However, the vaccine &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3779160"&gt;appears effective&lt;/a&gt; against the more-contagious B.1.1.7 variant, which took over in the United Kingdom and is now spreading in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIqQXZ"&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255968/johnson-and-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-single-shot-coronavirus"&gt;the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, this vaccine was made using a weakened form of an adenovirus, which usually causes mild illnesses like pink eye. The gene for part of the coronavirus called the spike protein is inserted into that virus. When the vaccine is injected, the body makes copies of the spike protein and produces antibodies that can fight the coronavirus. This vaccine can also be stored in the refrigerator and is relatively cheap, especially compared to the Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHpy8B"&gt;AstraZeneca said it plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization in the United States “in the coming weeks.” But the US may end up not using much of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the vaccine, even if it is authorized. The country already has orders for enough doses of the Pfizer / BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccines to cover every adult &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/us/politics/merck-johnson-johnson-vaccine.html"&gt;by the end of May&lt;/a&gt;. The US has tens of millions of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine on hand, and it announced last week that it plans to send at least 4 million of them &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/world/americas/usa-mexico-vaccine-coronavirus.html"&gt;to Canada and Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP’s new Envy x360 15 with AMD Ryzen chips starts at $749.99</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HP Envy x360 15 in tablet mode on a purple desk. Above it is a red beanie and to its right is a stylus. The screen displays a photo editing software. The carpet has a green square pattern." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SMIBGTIXrjVmuSyRyUm5BmmEW-A=/0x0:8071x5381/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69004936/AMD_HP_ENVY_x360_15_NightfallBlack_5173_v06.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Envy x360 15 (AMD). &lt;/em&gt; | Image: HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pGhb6Y"&gt;HP has announced two new budget workstations for content creators: an Envy x360 15 and an Envy 17. The 15-inch convertible, starting at $749.99, is available with both AMD Ryzen 7 and Intel 11th Gen processors. The 17-inch clamshell starts at $999.99 and is Intel only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43AIh3"&gt;The Envy x360 comes in either “natural silver” or “nightfall black” and includes a magnetic active pen. Its bezels appear to have shrunk slightly since last year’s model. Models have an 88.7 percent screen-to-body ratio and weigh around four pounds. (Not that last year’s model had terrible bezels, but I’ll never say no to more screen real estate.) You can configure it with a 4K OLED display as well as an Nvidia MX450 graphics chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bOL0BS"&gt;The top Intel model will include a Core i7-1165G7, while AMD models go up to a Ryzen 7 5700U. I tested the former in last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;, and it delivered a noticeable performance increase over its 10th Gen predecessor, particularly in integrated graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Envy 17 on a desk, open. The screen displays a photo editing software. On its left is a camera and a bin of notebooks, on its right are a notebook, a pair of earbuds, and a lamp." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8aVJN_yPLUrQDbPaHcdCzxpXBFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22383856/HP_ENVY_17_NaturalSilver_FPR_HD_Cam_Lifestyle.jpg_renamed_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Envy 17, in “natural silver.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Glkqv"&gt;The larger Envy 17 has an 86.3 percent screen-to-body ratio and weighs just over 5.5 pounds (a bit less than last year’s model). It also comes with an MX450 and a 4K display (though there’s no OLED option). You can configure it with up to 1TB of PCIe SSD storage and 32GB of memory. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HP’s Envy x360 15 (Intel) in tent mode on a yellow background seen from above. To its right is a pair of headphones and to its left is a stylus. Above it is a stack of multicolored post-it notes.

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Intel Envy x360 15 model in “natural silver.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="t7ZgxH"&gt;Both models have a 19 percent larger touchpad than their predecessors as well as a physical camera shutter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvfGja"&gt;In the past, I’ve been very impressed by the Envy line. Last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt; was one of my favorite laptops of 2020 and my favorite under $1,000: it delivered a sturdy and attractive chassis, a great keyboard, strong performance, and all-day battery life. (Basically, I had very few complaints.) They tend to be good options for budget and midrange shoppers who are still looking for excellent specs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZS9zUx"&gt;Last year’s Envy x360 15 offered great value for its price. At the $749.99 price point, this year’s base model (with a Ryzen 5 5500U) seems like it will be fairly competitive with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21174917/lenovo-yoga-c740-review-laptop-specs-features-price-2-in-1-convertible"&gt;Lenovo’s Yoga C740&lt;/a&gt; (which starts at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fyoga%2Fyoga-2-in-1-series%2FLenovo-Yoga-C740-14%2Fp%2F88YGC701292%23tab-customize&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F22%2F22340902%2Fhp-envy-x360-15-17-intel-amd-new-price-release-date-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$794.99&lt;/a&gt; for more storage but a weaker 10th Gen Intel processor). The Envy 17 is also competing on price with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327454/dell-xps-17-2020-laptop-review-display-test-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell’s XPS 17&lt;/a&gt;, which is almost &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fxps-17-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-17-9700-laptop%23configurations_section&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F22%2F22340902%2Fhp-envy-x360-15-17-intel-amd-new-price-release-date-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,000 more&lt;/a&gt; for comparable specs. I’ll have more information about how this device actually compares to those when I’ve gotten my hands on one myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mGRo9"&gt;All of the models are available for preorder now and will ship in April. The &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/DVVm3d" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Envy x360 15 &lt;/a&gt;starts at $749.99, and the &lt;a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/LPP12M" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Envy 17&lt;/a&gt; starts at $999.99. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTuber David Dobrik parts ways with disposable camera app amidst controversy  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o9uqrNM-SPFP29Fv-oIttrGaITk=/518x0:2357x1226/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69004826/Screen_Shot_2020_01_09_at_11.05.35_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Dispo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZlwDjQ"&gt;David Dobrik has parted ways with Dispo, the disposable camera app co-founded by the YouTuber in 2019, after allegations of sexual assault were made against a former member of his Vlog Squad, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/29a2fc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRnICq"&gt;“David has chosen to step down from the board and leave the company to not distract from the company’s growth,” Dispo said in a statement, “Dispo’s team, product, and most importantly — our community — stand for building a diverse, inclusive, and empowering world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="heCs9t"&gt;Dobrik’s decision to leave Dispo follows a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in which one of the women featured in a 2018 vlog said a former member of Dobrik’s Vlog Squad engaged in sexual activity with her while she was too drunk to consent. She was 20 years old at the time, and said friends of Dobrik supplied her and her friends with alcohol as they were too young to buy it for themselves. Dobrik posted footage from the night of the incident in a video titled “SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE PLAYED WITH FIRE!!” which was later taken down at the request of the woman involved. “We’re all going to jail,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/defnoodles/status/1372024094867091461"&gt;Dobrik said&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VX6FWb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“David has chosen to step down from the board and leave the company to not distract from the company’s growth”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TGng3h"&gt;On the same day as Dobrik’s departure from Dispo, venture capital firm Spark Capital announced that it was cutting ties with the company after leading its recent $20 million funding round. “In light of recent news about the Vlog Squad and David Dobrik, the cofounder of Dispo, we have made the decision to sever all ties with the company,” the firm tweeted, “We have stepped down from our position on the board and we are in the process of making arrangements to ensure we do not profit from our recent investment in Dispo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTBnQS"&gt;Multiple sponsors have also either cut ties, or are reviewing their partnerships with Dobrik in light of the allegations. The &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/19/style/david-dobrik-youtube-explained.html?utm_content=buffer3b11f&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=buffer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that sponsors including HelloFresh and Dollar Shave Club are no longer working with the YouTuber or his team. Dobrik’s main YouTube channel has lost over 100,000 subscribers after the allegations were made public, and Dispo’s App Store page was bombarded with negative ratings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bslsyH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;2/ We have stepped down from our position on the board and we are in the process of making arrangements to ensure we do not profit from our recent investment in Dispo.&lt;/p&gt;— Spark Capital (@sparkcapital) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sparkcapital/status/1373855197831720963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x1mHN5"&gt;While Dobrik declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; on its report, he later published a video titled “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=260IAJdFvl0"&gt;Let’s talk&lt;/a&gt;” in which he discussed the controversy in general terms. “I don’t agree with some of the videos I’ve posted,” he says in the video, adding that there’s “been moments where I’ve looked back on videos, and I realize that these don’t represent me anymore, and they’re hurtful to other people.” &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/seth-david-dobrik-prank-sexual-assault"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on separate allegations about the YouTuber last month made by a former Vlog Squad member, which he addresses in the same apology video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnptLn"&gt;“I’ve been really disappointed in some of my friends, and for that reason I’ve separated from a lot of them,” Dobrik said. &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; notes that the Vlog Squad member accused of sexual assault stopped appearing in videos on Dobrik’s channel in late 2019. “Consent is something that’s super super important to me,” Dobrik said. “I’m sorry if I’ve let you down, and things like that won’t happen again and I’ve learned from my mistakes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1icnm"&gt;Dispo is an &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1491684197"&gt;iOS app&lt;/a&gt; designed to imitate the process of using a disposable camera. Photos it takes only become available at 9AM the following day, and can be ordered as prints directly from the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfSDDp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SyKK3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch this amazing footage of a drone flying right through an erupting volcano in Iceland</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qGopej8sIeMsCaFNivAGo8Zzjrg=/47x0:553x337/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69004672/volcano_fly_by.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qGpu6o"&gt;Last Friday, the Fagradalsfjall volcano near Iceland’s capital of Reykjavik &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/19/iceland-volcano-eruption-under-way-in-fagradalsfjall-near-reykjavik"&gt;began erupting&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in 800 years after the island nation was hit by thousands of small earthquakes. Thankfully, the eruption was small and has not put anyone in danger. Instead, it’s gifted the world with some awe-inspiring views of lava flowing from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6N2qd6"&gt;The sight has been best captured by Icelandic drone pilot Bjorn Steinbekk, who took the straightforward approach of flying right through the eruption. We spotted the footage from Steinbekk (above) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnthonyQuintano/status/1373787472493170695"&gt;via Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems he flew several sorties through the airborne lava — a daring feat that makes us wonder how his drone survived the high temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rkbTMS"&gt;If the eruption of Fagradalsfjall looks relatively minor for a volcano, that’s because it is. “The eruption is considered a small one and the eruption fissure is about 500-700 metres (1640-2300 feet) long,” said the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) in a statement. “The lava is less than 1 square kilometre (0.4 square miles) in size.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xV1S1q"&gt;You can get a better sense of the scale of the thing in these images taken on Sunday below. They show crowds of hikers admiring the eruption, which is located around 40 kilometers west of the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="S0RKhE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10405689"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ShwJBp"&gt;This video below also shows you a before and after of the eruption site, which is nestled in a small valley in an uninhabited region of the country. &lt;a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210320-iceland-volcano-reykjavik-eruption"&gt;News reports&lt;/a&gt; say there’s been no ash fall created by the eruption, but residents living downwind of the volcano have been told to close their windows due to possible gas emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nxpWSb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7C7wiTJHHJ8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JAJ2NH"&gt;None of that has stopped Steinbekk from getting up-close-and-personal with Fagradalsfjall. And if you want to see more of his fantastic videos and images of Iceland from the air, you can check out his &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/offtoiceland/"&gt;official Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. There are some truly wonderful shots to admire. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Burberry designed character skins for China’s biggest video game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wnejvIMK-U6GlYBjSDkzjt69Jxk=/0x0:3375x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69004601/The__Spirit_of_Nature__new_skin___2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NQdNMm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt; is among the biggest games in the world — and soon, it’ll be among the most fashionable as well. Today, Tencent-owned developer TiMi Studios announced a collaboration with fashion house Burberry on new character skins. The skins were designed by Riccardo Tisci, chief creative officer at Burberry, for the character Yao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nn65GZ"&gt;“Burberry’s signature gabardine, pioneered by founder Thomas Burberry and designed to protect the wearer against the elements, fits seamlessly with Yao, who personifies the role of a protector for her teammates,” the company says. The two skins were designed with the “spirit of nature” in mind and will be available to purchase for players in mainland China, though there’s no word on a release date. You can get a look at Tisci’s design process in the sketches below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4iz8DE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10402269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kkDQDe"&gt;If you haven’t heard of &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt;, it’s a competitive multiplayer game in the same mold as&lt;em&gt; League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; but for mobile devices. It’s so popular that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/4/15918624/tencent-china-gaming-addiction-honor-of-kings-limit"&gt;Tencent has had to impose daily limits on players&lt;/a&gt; in the past; the developer says &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt; averaged 100 million daily players during November 2020. A Western version, &lt;em&gt;Arena of Valor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/18/16469736/tencent-arena-of-valor-honor-of-kings-north-america-launch"&gt;launched back in 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ogihp2"&gt;The collaboration, meanwhile, is part of an ongoing trend of fashion infiltrating video games and vice versa. &lt;a href="https://au.louisvuitton.com/eng-au/articles/series-4-lightning-a-virtual-heroine-"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIII&lt;/em&gt; protagonist Lightning served as a model for Louis Vuitton&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, and the fashion house &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937187/league-of-legends-true-damage-hip-hop-group-kda-louis-vuitton"&gt;also designed in-game outfits for &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; characters&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, streetwear brands like BAPE have designed skins for games like &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150152/complexcon-virtual-music-streetwear-complex-food-festival"&gt;Complex even turned its annual streetwear convention into an interactive video game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
