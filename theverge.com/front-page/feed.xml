  &lt;p id="ptwfwV"&gt;At its big Tudum event, Netflix showed off a nice, two-minute-long look at one of its most exciting upcoming movies: &lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wLHpg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662504/netflix-dont-look-up-trailer-leonardo-dicaprio-jennifer-lawrence"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt; is one of the more interesting films in Netflix’s slate&lt;/a&gt;, a story about astronomers trying to save the world from an impending asteroid collision. it also happens to have a stellar cast. Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence play the aforementioned astronomers, while Meryl Streep is the president, Jonah Hill is her chief of staff, and the rest of the lineup includes Ron Perlman, Timothée Chalamet, Ariana Grande, Kid Cudi, Cate Blanchett, and Tyler Perry. Adam McKay is writer and director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vewNR0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt; is due to hit Netflix on December 24th but will be in select theaters before that on December 10th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the opening title sequence for Netflix’s Cowboy Bebop series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="cowboy bebop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FgpWHP76GrCGnApGWsHkUc4yJmQ=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69908343/COWBOYBEB_Unit_07433RC2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Geoffrey Short / Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G9YuHS"&gt;We’ve still only caught glimpses of Netflix’s upcoming live-action take on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22634321/netflix-cowboy-bebop-release-date-john-cho-photos"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and today delivers yet another tease: a kinetic opening title sequence for the show. It’s not quite a proper trailer (which we’re still waiting on), but it does give a good sense of the vibe the series is going for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWeGlp"&gt;The Netflix adaptation stars John Cho as Spike Spiegel, Mustafa Shakir as Jet Black, and Daniella Pineda as Faye Valentine, and last month we got our first proper look at the cast   — and Spike’s hair — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22634321/netflix-cowboy-bebop-release-date-john-cho-photos"&gt;thanks to a series of photos&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been a long time coming, as news of the adaptation was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18115752/cowboy-bebop-netflix-live-action-series-announced"&gt;first revealed in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295535/netflix-cowboy-bebop-john-cho-spike-live-action-series"&gt;with the cast announced a year later&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier this year, Netflix confirmed that Yoko Kanno, the original composer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22463620/netflix-live-action-cowboy-bebop-release-date-john-cho"&gt;was on board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fo5pZe"&gt;Chances are a full trailer isn’t far off, though, as the series is set to debut on November 19th. In the meantime, here are a few more photos.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tiger King season 2 premieres November 17th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HJKUyaKFI8xEKQPQAvjfREydmFI=/228x0:2631x1602/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69908287/E__ZQVtUUAgAWLw.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G10PQk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt;, the hugely popular documentary heavily associated with the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkgSGrdL4SE"&gt;will premiere on November 17th&lt;/a&gt;, Netflix revealed at its Tudum event on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="StORaF"&gt;Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689601/tiger-king-season-2-netflix-announcement-2021-joe-exotic"&gt;just announced&lt;/a&gt; the second season, which it is calling &lt;em&gt;Tiger King 2&lt;/em&gt;, on Thursday &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo3WUYBcNJI"&gt;as part of a short trailer&lt;/a&gt; revealing many other true crime shows heading to the streaming service. Netflix is promising that it will have “just as much mayhem and madness” as the first season. While it’s unclear exactly what the second season might be about, Netflix’s Tudum trailer showed a brief clip of Joe Exotic, the main focus of the first season, in prison, so it could focus in part on that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wbZIJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt;’s first season was a cultural sensation; in a press release, &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/tiger-king-2-leads-pack-of-upcoming-documentaries-exploring-crimes-cons-and"&gt;Netflix said&lt;/a&gt; that it “attracted 64 million households in the first four weeks after its March 2020 premiere.” By making a season 2, Netflix seems to be attempting to recapture that lightning-in-a-bottle popularity once again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s new trailer for Arcane, its upcoming League of Legends series, reveals November 6th premiere date</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZY9GSSwGkhX9HltVea5pj8XcLf0=/127x0:1417x860/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69908235/Vi_Lookingup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4Lkt79"&gt;Netflix has released &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmAurh012s"&gt;a new trailer for &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, its upcoming series based on the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; universe, and also revealed when the show will premiere: November 6th. But you won’t be able to watch all of &lt;em&gt;Arcane &lt;/em&gt;on that day, as Netflix plans to release the season in three separate “acts,” each consisting of three episodes released one week after the last. That means the first act will be out on November 6th, the next will release on November 13th, and the final one will premiere on November 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2wMoU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; was first announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915338/league-of-legends-animated-series-fighting-game-cards-arcane-runeterra-project-l-trailers"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; developer Riot Games delayed the series &lt;a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/dev/an-update-on-arcane/"&gt;to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. In May, the news broke that Netflix had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417254/league-of-legends-animated-series-arcane-netflix"&gt;picked up the show&lt;/a&gt; and that it would debut in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDa17H"&gt;Earlier this week, Netflix and Riot revealed some of&lt;em&gt; Arcane’s &lt;/em&gt;voice cast. That list is headlined &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1440332544784748550"&gt;by Hailee Steinfeld&lt;/a&gt;, who you might recognize as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942091/dickinson-apple-tv-plus-review-hailee-steinfeld"&gt;Emily Dickinson in Apple TV Plus’ &lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Kate Bishop in the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22671358/hawkeye-first-trailer-disney-plus-christmas-jeremy-renner-hailee-steinfeld"&gt;in Disney Plus series &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;, Steinfeld will be playing Vi, one of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;’ playable champions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0kwJI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; is Riot’s latest expansion of the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; franchise, which includes a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358213/league-of-legends-wild-rift-iphone-android-preview"&gt;mobile spinoff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408504/league-of-legends-tellstones-board-game-spinoff"&gt;a board game&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18099147/league-of-legends-marvel-comics-game-lore-riot"&gt;comic books&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also the latest video game series to appear on Netflix, joining other franchises like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22566778/the-witcher-season-2-release-trailer-netflix-henry-cavill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232750/netflix-pokemon-exclusive-episodes-disney-hbo-max-kids-tv-anime-streaming-wars"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Delta Airlines wants competitors to share info about unruly passengers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Delta Air Lines Airbus A330neo Landing" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FWctvo6VUCBK16IUXQaZkmLLhI8=/0x0:5300x3533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69908212/1232127899.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZcnYxO"&gt;Delta Airlines said in a &lt;a href="https://news.delta.com/memos-reflect-deltas-commitment-employee-and-passenger-safety"&gt;pair of internal memos&lt;/a&gt; to employees this week that it’s asked competitors to share their no-fly lists, to try to keep passengers who cause disturbances on planes from bringing their mayhem to other airlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xuTX0"&gt;Since January 1st, the Federal Aviation Administration &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/unruly"&gt;says it has received&lt;/a&gt; 4,385 reports of unruly behavior by passengers, which includes 3,199 reports of passengers “refusing to comply with the federal facemask mandate.” The FAA has issued more than $1 million in proposed fines, but the agency does not have the authority to conduct criminal prosecutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41sb2Y"&gt;Among the incidents, according to the FAA (these are across various airlines):  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yOxqdp"&gt;On a May 24th flight from New York to Orlando a passenger was “allegedly throwing objects, including his carry-on luggage, at other passengers; refusing to stay seated; lying on the floor in the aisle, refusing to get up, and then grabbing a flight attendant by the ankles and putting his head up her skirt.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SwXu78"&gt;On a May 16th flight from New York to San Francisco, a passenger was “allegedly interfering with crewmembers after failing to comply with the facemask mandate; making non-consensual physical contact with another passenger; throwing a playing card at a passenger and threatening him with physical harm; making stabbing gestures towards certain passengers; and snorting what appeared to be cocaine from a plastic bag, which the cabin crew confiscated.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="seP91t"&gt;On an April 12th flight form Boston to Orlando a passenger was “allegedly interfering with crewmembers after refusing to comply with the facemask mandate. She also shouted obscenities at the flight crew, and intentionally bumped into a seated passenger on her way to the lavatory. When the seated passenger objected to this behavior, she punched the passenger in the face.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="GaswoX"&gt;The passengers in those incidents were referred to law enforcement and the FAA has proposed fines ranging from $29,000 to $45,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etIxa7"&gt;Delta sent its memos to employees the same day that airline industry representatives took part in an &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/unruly-us-airline-passenger-incidents-fall-still-higher-than-2020-faa-2021-09-23/"&gt;“air rage” hearing&lt;/a&gt; before the House Committee on Transportation &amp;amp; Infrastructure, asking Congress to encourage the Department of Justice to take more serious measures against unruly passengers, including possible criminal indictments. Interfering with flight crew aboard an airplane is a federal crime that has a max sentence of up to 20 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix debuts video from its adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="pmDE6N"&gt;Netflix debuted &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBXqrBl6pEo"&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; from its upcoming series based on Neil Gaiman’s DC comic book series &lt;em&gt;The Sandman&lt;/em&gt;. The video was brief, but it gave us a good glimpse at actor Tom Sturridge as Dream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaiJZt"&gt;The video was shown during Netflix’s Tudum event that took place Saturday. The show also also featured Gaiman, Sturridge, and Kirby Howell-Baptiste (who plays Death) talking about the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qBR7d"&gt;If you want to get another preview of what to expect from the series, check out the character posters Netflix shared for Sturridge’s Dream, Howell-Baptiste’s Death, and Mason Alexander Park’s Desire &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1441813546560630784"&gt;in a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="zXvb7Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sandman&lt;/em&gt; has been in development for years, with Netflix picking up the show in 2019 in a deal with Warner Bros., which owns DC Entertainment, that was reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/sandman-tv-series-neil-gaiman-david-goyer-a-go-at-netflix-1220761/"&gt;“massive.”&lt;/a&gt; Earlier this year, Netflix announced &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/the-sandman-tom-sturridge-gwendoline-christie-vivienne-acheampong-boyd-holbrook-charles-dance-asim-chaudhry-sanjeev-bhaskar-netflix-neil-gaiman-1234681995/"&gt;some of the cast for the show&lt;/a&gt;, which also includes Vivienne Acheampong as Lucienne and Gwendoline Christie (known for playing Brienne of Tarth in &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; and Captain Phasma in &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;) as Lucifer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85NuPR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sandman&lt;/em&gt; is just the latest show based on Gaiman’s work. Amazon adapted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645935/neil-gaiman-interview-good-omens-amazon-adaptation-terry-pratchett-michael-sheen-david-tennant"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good Omens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for Amazon Prime Video, and the show was successful enough that the company opted to pick it up for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555489/good-omens-second-season-amazon-prime-video-neil-gaiman-terry-prachett"&gt;a second season&lt;/a&gt;. Starz made three seasons of &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt;, the last of which debuted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22233014/american-gods-season-3-premiere-review"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>See inside the iPhone 13 Pro in iFixit’s latest teardown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zPGKdX2GYMScpQ9aCS8Mt6E-oV0=/0x0:2025x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69908059/vpavic_210916_untitled_0027.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tXl1KP"&gt;The team at iFixit has a new teardown of the iPhone 13 Pro, finding it has an enormous battery and some small internal changes to how the components are laid out to accommodate the smaller notch on this year’s models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4DUVl"&gt;First, the battery. After conducting battery swap tests, on the iPhone 13 Pro, iFixit found its tests succeeded, but still got a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F32343%2Fapple-is-locking-batteries-to-iphones-now&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F25%2F22693123%2Fiphone-13-pro-ifixit-teardown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;warning notification.&lt;/a&gt; The L-shaped battery echoes the iPhone 12 Pro Max, iFixit notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="HInpUx"&gt;This beefy L caps out at an expected 11.97 Wh compared to the 10.78 Wh obelisk found in the iPhone 12 Pro (and non-Pro), but loses out to the standard’s 12.54 Wh rectangular cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dWFmkpVEq1xlFSZr_DTup5QPyPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22877335/ifixit_x_ray.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;An X-ray image of iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vxtXHE"&gt;iFixit posits that Apple was able to shrink the screen notch partly by moving the earpiece speaker from the back of the display to inside the chassis. It does make replacing the earpiece speaker more difficult, iFixit notes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9XB-bKQOtb76HRX2raPxiZwRDWs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22877338/earpiece_ifixit.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dxHGY6"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro is sealed with adhesive, like the iPhone 13 and some prior iPhones, and iFixit says the display came off relatively easily. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Stranger Things season 4 gets a new teaser trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8GZ3G6fY4P5gYfpKa-qvgfWhrJY=/160x0:1716x1037/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69908053/Screen_Shot_2021_09_25_at_9.16.11_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fxTVh1"&gt;Netflix debuted a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgsUzL75Yjk"&gt;new teaser trailer&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; season 4 as part of its Tudum event on Saturday. It opened on a family going into an old-timey house, but in classic &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; fashion, things quickly got spooky and, well, strange. The new season will premiere sometime in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Y7wDy"&gt;The fourth season has been a long time coming. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20683399/stranger-things-season-3-review-duffer-brothers-finn-wolfhard-millie-bobby-brown-david-harbour"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;’ third season&lt;/a&gt; debuted more than two years ago, on July 4th, 2019, so fans have been waiting for quite a while to see what happens next in Netflix’s hit series. (Season 3 was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20692109/stranger-things-3-netflix-nielsen-media-research-hit"&gt;quite popular&lt;/a&gt; — just four days after it launched, Netflix said that 18.2 million accounts had watched the whole season.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVZ6xU"&gt;The company has already shared a few very fleeting hints about what to expect in season 4, though. In February 2020, a teaser revealed that a fan-favorite character &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137590/netflix-stranger-things-4-trailer-character-teaser-missing-return"&gt;would be returning&lt;/a&gt;. A teaser from May appeared to show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422642/stranger-things-4-new-trailer-netflix-eleven"&gt;a brief glimpse&lt;/a&gt; of Eleven’s past. And an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612753/netflix-stranger-things-season-four-release-date"&gt;action-packed 30-second teaser&lt;/a&gt; shared in August provided a lot of brief flashes of the new season and gave a non-specific 2022 release window.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly told a TV and movie workers’ union its TV Plus had fewer than 20 million subs </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Apple TV+ (Plus) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xlEbrp2g2zhJqYZb7Ky9Flk9pXg=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69907526/1233058085.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A union for TV workers says Apple claimed its TV Plus streaming service had fewer than 20 million subscribers as of July 1st | Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1qauvj"&gt;Apple told the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) that its Apple TV Plus streaming platform had fewer than 20 million subscribers, which allowed it to pay lower rates to IATSE workers than bigger streaming platforms, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/24/apple-told-a-showbiz-union-it-had-less-than-20-million-tv-subscribers.html"&gt;CNBC reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jynhWz"&gt;Apple has never publicly released subscriber numbers for its streaming network, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20850842/apple-tv-plus-release-date-price-shows-oprah-streaming"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; in November of 2019. But Apple TV Plus has fewer original shows than larger, more established streaming rivals like Netflix, which &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FINAL-Q2-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;said in August&lt;/a&gt; it had 209 million subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7T5itS"&gt;“Workers on certain ‘new media’ streaming projects get paid less, even on productions with budgets that rival or exceed those of traditionally released blockbusters,” according to a press release IATSE posted on Tuesday. The release didn’t mention any streaming platform by name, but a spokesman told CNBC that Apple claimed under 20 million subscribers in the US and Canada as of July 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HpKP6"&gt;The union is preparing for a possible strike after negotiations with production companies have stalled, saying in the release that “the explosion of streaming combined with the pandemic has elevated and aggravated working conditions, bringing 60,000 behind-the-scenes workers covered by these contracts to a breaking point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ALLId"&gt;Apple TV Plus has several big-budget shows on its roster, including &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt;, which stars Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, and &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, its surprise hit comedy about an American coaching an English football club. &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; had a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/emmy-awards-2021-list-winners-nominees-11632095321?mod=article_relatedinline"&gt;big showing at the Emmys&lt;/a&gt; last week, taking awards for Outstanding Comedy, Lead Actor in a Comedy for star Jason Sudeikis, and supporting acting awards for Brett Goldstein and Hannah Waddingham. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyu1vc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/apples-bumpy-tv-launch-inside-tech-giants-impending-arrival-hollywood-1247577/"&gt;reportedly costs Apple $15 million&lt;/a&gt; per episode, and many of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s writers and stars have &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/ted-lasso-pay-raises-season-three-1235011799/"&gt;reportedly negotiated&lt;/a&gt; more lucrative contracts for the show’s third season. Apple said in July that it had a net profit of $21.7 billion on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596120/apple-q3-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;$81.43 billion in revenue&lt;/a&gt; in its third quarter of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPbyfC"&gt;Apple and IATSE didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday. An Apple spokesperson told CNBC that it pays rates comparable to leading streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;
