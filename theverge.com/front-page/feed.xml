    <title>1Password subscriptions are 50 percent off for Verge readers today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/52UQahxcn0uMeTuTL6gMzvbz41s=/63x0:1938x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69802439/item_details_view.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yk8VZ1"&gt;Many of us would agree that online protection is more vital than ever before, but trying to remember a random string of letters and symbols for every site you frequent — or don’t — isn’t always easy. Password managers like 1Password are a great way to store your login credentials and beef up your security, however, one that can also save you plenty of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MDv1yP"&gt;Thankfully, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers can save 50 percent on their first year of 1Password for a limited time, whether they opt for an &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-15026552?sid=VergeDeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;individual plan&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-15026551?sid=VergeDeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;family subscription&lt;/a&gt;. The individual plan normally runs $2.99 a month and comes out to be around $36 per year, yet our exclusive discount brings the annual price down to $18. The family plan, meanwhile, will run you $2.50 a month instead of $5, culminating in $30 a year. Keep in mind, however, that the family plan is limited to five people and that each plan is only available to new 1Password users, not returning customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7rckI"&gt;In terms of features, 1Password offers quite a few. Not only does the service store your login details, but it will send you alerts for compromised sites and vulnerable passwords, while security features like authenticated encryption keep your data safe. You can also use the service on unlimited devices and enjoy 24/7 customer support if you hit a snag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0nXk1j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10426335"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="XTiUco"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10437502"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Us84ji"&gt;If you have yet to pick up a smart speaker, the second-generation Echo Show 8 is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-8-2nd-Gen-2021-release/dp/B084DC4LW6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750688708099700197#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $100, matching its best price ever. Unlike the previous generation, the 2021 Echo Show 8 boasts faster performance and a superior 13-megapixel camera. It also features the same display, design, and speaker system as its predecessor, which is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-8/dp/B07PF1Y28C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale for $80&lt;/a&gt;. We consider the second-gen model the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best smart speaker you can buy&lt;/a&gt;, especially if you intend to use the smart display for video calls. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qwPCKk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10611942"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mdfWru"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-75-Inch-Class-QLED-Built/dp/B08WFTZ9LY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling&lt;/a&gt; the 75-inch QLED Q80A Series TV at an all-time low, taking around $500 off the typical list price. Normally $2,700, you can pick up the TV — which was released earlier this year — for just $2,198. Better yet, a few &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffers saw in the fine print that if you purchase it before September 30th and use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;B6PXLX23DQL9&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout, Amazon will give you $400 in credit to use on future purchases. Not a bad deal at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSEQma"&gt;The 4K TV delivers wide viewing angles thanks to its IPS panel while producing bright and colorful images. It’s a good buy for gamers, too, who will enjoy the low input lag and support for variable refresh rate (VRR) and AMD FreeSync technology. While we haven’t tested this specific model, &lt;a href="https://www.reviewed.com/televisions/content/samsung-q80a-qled-tv-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reviewed&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that movie fans may not appreciate the low contrast levels or relatively lackluster local dimming feature, which can make it hard to watch HDR content or films in a dark room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Op1XkD"&gt;Amazon’s current deal comes just a week after the retailer also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-75-Inch-Class-QLED-Built/dp/B08WFLBLWP?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cut the price of the 55-inch model by $200&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it to a record low of $1,098. Other sizes are similarly discounted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="g1p9br"&gt;If you’re looking for a pair of true wireless earbuds, you can pick up a refurbished pair of Jabra Elite 85t for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F164914311936%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeGetaoneyear1Passwordsubscriptionfor50percentoffAUG312021%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F1%2F22651065%2F1password-amazon-echo-show-8-samsung-qled-tv-jabra-elite-85t-apple-deals-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$117 at eBay through Jabra’s digital storefront&lt;/a&gt; with promo code &lt;strong&gt;SAVE15LABORDAY&lt;/strong&gt;. They’re also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale at Amazon for $180 new&lt;/a&gt;, meaning eBay’s refurbished discount equates to an additional $63 in savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qk6SHI"&gt;Released in November, the 85t are the first pair of earbuds from Jabra to ship with active noise cancellation. In contrast to the AirPods Pro and Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds, they’re also capable of simultaneously pairing with two devices. You can also buy the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750688339690161172#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jabra Elite 75t at best Buy right now for $100&lt;/a&gt;, however, if you want solid noise cancellation and excellent on-earbud controls, it may be worth forking over the extra $17 for the refurbished Elite 85t. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="2zWZiX"&gt;For a limited time, Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro Smart Battery Case is more than half off its usual price. Once again, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081SHMJ77/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750684926448631384#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are both selling the $130 case for a record low of $52. Best Buy is also throwing in a free, six-month subscription to Apple Music and Apple News Plus for new users. The case offers a decent amount of charge — Apple says you can expect “up to 50 percent” extra battery life — while boasting features such as a physical camera button and the ability to charge your iPhone and battery case simultaneously. At the same time, its soft microfiber lining gives your phone some additional protection.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fy2ETY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10607518"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>DJI’s next smartphone gimbal might include a telescoping selfie stick</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ZfpmDxIWRHnYXuIONr6WuQxIYs=/0x0:1068x712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69802338/DJI_OM_5_1630481788_0_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gimbal, meet selfie stick.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,124942.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7Ab4x2"&gt;DJI appears to have another smartphone gimbal on the way with a telescoping selfie stick built into its handle, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,124942.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Osmo Mobile 5, which is an apparent successor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21401564/dji-osmo-mobile-4-phone-gimbal-magnetic-announce-price-release-date"&gt;last year’s Osmo Mobile 4&lt;/a&gt;, is likely to make its first appearance at DJI’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DJIGlobal/status/1432690094750588932"&gt;September 8th launch event&lt;/a&gt; where it will reportedly earn a European price of €159, which roughly translates to a tax-inclusive price of $188. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEY3D2"&gt;The Osmo Mobile 5 reportedly folds down to around 17cm (6.7 inches), but can be extended when you need to get closer to your subject, or further away from yourself. From the pictures, it doesn’t seem to extend quite as much as a traditional selfie stick, but it should be enough to give you a little extra flexibility with your shots. When extended, the gimbal’s controls sensibly remain down by your hand. Sure, selfie sticks have a pretty terrible reputation as the chosen accessory of inconsiderate tourists, but they’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2014/12/31/7470713/selfie-stick-haters-hate"&gt;pretty damn handy in the right circumstances&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oO61bB_XKLObrYmMDIs5f5cm0Z8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22819574/msedge_RuyuCYhmHG.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,124942.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It appears to fold down as compactly as DJI’s existing gimbals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WER3hx"&gt;Unfortunately, it sounds like the telescoping mechanism built into the Osmo Mobile 5 has had an impact on battery life, which reportedly stands at around 6 hours and 20 minutes compared to 15 hours for the Osmo Mobile 4. Thankfully the magnetic mounting system from the Osmo Mobile 4 has stuck around, which should mean it’s as easy as ever to quickly attach and detach your phone from the gimbal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXNl8b"&gt;Alongside the Osmo Mobile 5, &lt;em&gt;WinFuture’s&lt;/em&gt; Roland Quandt also reports that there’s a more affordable $99 version of the Osmo Mobile 4 on the way, which won’t include the original $149 gimbal’s magnetic mounting system. A shame for sure, but it’s hard to argue with the discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QGNn0e"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;btw... DJI OM 4 SE is also incoming: 99$ and basically the same as the original OM4, but w/o the magnetic smartpone holder. &lt;a href="https://t.co/dQO5LhKMMQ"&gt;https://t.co/dQO5LhKMMQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Roland Quandt (@rquandt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1433023533001629699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Telegram uncaps live stream viewers as part of big version 8.0 update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/30qryDtAhkxKIX5Gssm4rnMluGQ=/61x0:1195x756/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69802138/aed1cb7af8c96e961b.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Telegram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sOEgks"&gt;Telegram, the messaging app that’s becoming more and more like a fully-fledged social media network, is expanding support for video live streams with its latest update. &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/live-streams-forwarding-next-channel"&gt;Version 8.0 of the app&lt;/a&gt;, which is available now on both iOS and Android, allows live streams to be watched by an unlimited number of viewers, up from the &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/video-1000"&gt;previous limit of 1,000&lt;/a&gt;. Other new features include more options when forwarding messages, and a shortcut to switch between channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NbmZv"&gt;Increasing the maximum number of viewers like this opens the door to Telegram becoming a full-on mobile live streaming platform, complete with the ability for as many as 30 users to broadcast at once. “The power to run your own TV station is here, right in your pocket,” is how Telegram puts it. The service also supports &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/voice-chats-on-steroids"&gt;Clubhouse-style voice channels&lt;/a&gt; with support for “millions” of live listeners. It’s rapid progress considering Telegram’s group calling feature only launched in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551652/telegram-adds-group-video-calling-chat"&gt;June this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0C5u4A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The power to run your own TV station is here, right in your pocket”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8Iohab"&gt;Also included with version 8.0 of the app is an option to remove captions and hide sender names when forwarding messages and media. Scrolling to the bottom of a text channel now includes a new option to quickly swipe up to jump to the next unread channel. Other interface tweaks include a new “choosing a sticker” status in chats, and an unread messages counter in comment threads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yISqmy"&gt;As of January this year, Telegram boasted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1349014065931284480?s=20"&gt;500 million active users&lt;/a&gt;, compared to around 2 billion for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134652/whatsapp-2-billion-monthly-active-users-encryption-facebook"&gt;Facebook’s rival WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VanMoof raises $128M to become ‘most funded e-bike company in the world’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OrCFF_k0K8JRncAnn-eIzdv78kY=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69802019/verge_DSC_7394_2040pxl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;VanMoof S3 e-bike in Amsterdam | Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ebsx0K"&gt;VanMoof just raised another $128 million in funding, after announcing a $40 million investment round in September 2020. That brings Amsterdam-based VanMoof’s total haul to $182 million raised in the last two years, excluding crowdfunding rounds in 2018 and 2019, making it “the most funded e-bike company in the world,” &lt;a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/news/en-GB/202064-vanmoof-raises-128m-to-make-its-high-tech-e-bikes-the-new-standard-in-cities-worldwide"&gt;according to VanMoof&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2hBGy"&gt;The company claims to have almost 200,000 bikes on the road currently, with the goal of getting 10 million people on VanMoof e-bikes in the next five years. Such aggressive expansion goals require significant capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vuED3R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Improve the quality and reliability of the bike&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="940gwS"&gt;VanMoof’s new funding round has been earmarked to expand production and to “reinvent the way in which hardware and software components are made,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/news/en-GB/202064-vanmoof-raises-128m-to-make-its-high-tech-e-bikes-the-new-standard-in-cities-worldwide"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the new investment round. More specifically, VanMoof co-founder Taco Carlier tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in a phone interview that most of the funds will go towards R&amp;amp;D, “having more people on the hardware and software development in order to improve the quality and reliability of the bike.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbRi0G"&gt;Last September, the company said it was using about a third of its $40 million investment round to improve after-sales support that had faltered under the strain of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;troubled launch of its S3 and X3 e-bikes&lt;/a&gt; during a pandemic. That money is already being used to expand the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/news/en-GB/197430-vanmoof-announces-global-service-expansion-across-50-cities"&gt;dedicated service hubs from 8 to 50 worldwide cities&lt;/a&gt; by the end of 2021, and develop a “Bike Doctor Network” that sends support technicians directly to customer locations when service is needed. Today’s investment round will allow for more service hubs and branded stores in (a few) more cities, according to Carlier, while paying for the rollout of the Bike Doctor Network to those cities starting in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBErDa"&gt;For comparison, RadPower, the largest e-bike maker in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266143/rad-power-bikes-investment-electric-ebike"&gt;raised $150 million earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, adding to the $25 million it garnered the year prior. Investors are pouring money into electric bike makers in the hope of capitalizing on the global e-bike market which is expected to be worth almost &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/06/2204781/0/en/Global-e-bike-market-size-to-reach-USD-48-46-billion-by-2028.html"&gt;$50 billion by 2028&lt;/a&gt;. In March 2021, e-bikes already represented 17 percent of all bicycle sales in Europe, and accounted for more than 50 percent of all new bike sales in countries like Germany and the Netherlands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBV3qq"&gt;E-bike sales in the US are also on the rise. As of April, sales were up 139 percent to $681 million for the year-to-date, compared to the same period in 2020, according to market research firm NPD Group. VanMoof says that the US is its fastest growth market, “with the post-pandemic e-bike wave showing no sign of slowing down.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is kicking unsupported PCs out of Windows 11 testing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zODPjlEqGOmHbnnA1pGBcwDgiy8=/50x0:1550x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69801954/windows11stock.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Windows 11 is launching on October 5th. | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y3UAaC"&gt;Microsoft is starting to drop PCs from its Windows Insider testing program that are ineligible to upgrade to Windows 11. If you’ve been helping Microsoft test Windows 11 on a machine that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware requirements, you’ll likely see a message in Windows Update warning that you’ll need to reinstall Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9uAx7H"&gt;“Your PC does not meet the minimum hardware requirements for Windows 11,” says Microsoft’s warning. “Your device is not eligible to join the Windows Insider Program on Windows 11. Please install Windows 10 to participate in the Windows Insider Program in the Release Preview Channel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1oThq"&gt;Windows 11 testers in both the Dev and Beta channels have started receiving the message on incompatible PCs this week, just as Microsoft has announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649940/windows-11-release-date-features-devices-free-upgrade"&gt;October 5th release date&lt;/a&gt; for the upcoming OS. It’s something that Microsoft warned testers would happen at the beginning of the beta period of Windows 11, but it still highlights the often confusing minimum hardware requirements that Microsoft has set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9uUMSX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft has now dropped ineligible systems from the Insider program and tells them to install Windows 10. &lt;a href="https://t.co/zfALanmcuq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zfALanmcuq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— BetaWiki (@BetaWiki) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BetaWiki/status/1432806974022995971?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o5Li6C"&gt;Windows 11 testers that have been running the OS on unsupported hardware will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22644194/microsoft-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements-processors-changes"&gt;be able to use a workaround&lt;/a&gt; to install an ISO version of the final release. But Microsoft warns that devices in this unsupported state won’t be eligible for Windows Updates, and that could include security patches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErthgY"&gt;Microsoft recommends that Windows 11 testers that don’t meet the hardware minimums should install Windows 10, as this OS will be supported until 2025. Many Windows 11 testers, who are often loyal Microsoft enthusiasts, will still be left confused why their PC isn’t officially supported even though it has likely been running the OS just fine for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jc3qJ"&gt;Microsoft has attempted to justify its Windows 11 minimum hardware requirements around a push for security and reliability, but it still leaves some PCs sold just a few years ago from being able to upgrade. Windows 11 raises the baseline of security to the CPU level, and Microsoft has been clear it wants to enforce or support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;Trusted Platform Module (TPM)&lt;/a&gt;, UEFI Secure Boot, and virtualization-based security methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Nlkn8"&gt;Windows 11 will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649940/windows-11-release-date-features-devices-free-upgrade"&gt;now arrive on October 5th&lt;/a&gt;, and Microsoft will continue to release new Dev builds of the OS to testers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650000/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support"&gt;Android app integration isn’t arriving at launch&lt;/a&gt; but Windows Insider testers will get access in the coming months to the feature which relies heavily on modern hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Midrange Samsung Galaxy S21 FE appears again in leaked manual</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pZZyie-EG6IUu6-eJO8tlaTIF0E=/1x0:1147x764/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69801948/msedge_cwyTkgz4Rn.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A render of the unannounced phone from the leaked manual.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s21-fe-5g-user-manual-makes-no-mention-of-microsd-slot/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_CNo4aG0QZ2u7M8IsX0IwJps0YlMeItRJH4K0Ll1_CzQ-1630443096-0-gqNtZGzNArujcnBszQ0l" target="_blank"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qYtVdr"&gt;A user manual for Samsung’s Galaxy S21 FE (aka “Fan Edition”) has been &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s21-fe-5g-user-manual-makes-no-mention-of-microsd-slot/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_CNo4aG0QZ2u7M8IsX0IwJps0YlMeItRJH4K0Ll1_CzQ-1630443096-0-gqNtZGzNArujcnBszQ0l"&gt;published online by &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, giving us another look at the unannounced midrange counterpart to the company’s Galaxy S21 flagship. As you’d expect from a manual, the document spends more time outlining how to use the phone than it does describing its specs, but it’s a guide for what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHbW9V"&gt;For starters, images included in the manual appear to confirm that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1400945475558199298"&gt;previously leaked renders&lt;/a&gt; are accurate. That means we’re looking at a similar design to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt;, albeit seemingly with a less premium finish. Three cameras are shown on the S21 FE’s rear while on the front there’s an in-display fingerprint scanner and a hole-punch notch for a selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a-XbCbJJT3RrrhDqLSUVxy0rvuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22819522/msedge_K8x7I5KuYH.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One section of the manual describe’s the phone’s reverse wireless charging feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9wSAPz"&gt;Other details mentioned in the manual include an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, an ultra-wide camera, and support for Samsung’s Wireless DeX software to allow the phone to mirror its display to supported TVs and use its screen as a touchpad. There’s no sign of a headphone jack, microSD card slot (which appeared on last year’s S20 FE), or an included charging brick in the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncznlI"&gt;In terms of specs, &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; notes that previous rumors claim the phone will be powered by a Snapdragon 888 or Exynos 2100 processor depending on the market, which would put it roughly in line with the Galaxy S21 flagship from earlier this year. Its battery is expected to have a capacity of 4,500mAh, with support for 25W fast charging and reverse wireless charging also mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2SlIL"&gt;The question now is when, if ever, we might see the phone officially announced. Earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532816/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-production-reportedly-halted"&gt;Samsung was forced to deny reports&lt;/a&gt; that it had cancelled production of the unannounced phone due to production difficulties caused by the global chip shortage. The emergence of a user manual suggests the phone will see an official release, though it doesn’t outright confirm it. For reference, last year’s Galaxy S20 FE was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451701/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-price-release-date-specs-features"&gt;announced on September 23rd&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of its release on October 2nd, suggesting we might not have long to wait to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Internet shutdowns by governments have ‘proliferated at a truly alarming pace’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FWbqJUz8ajVnwFEKZBcj_8REK4k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69801939/jbareham_170410_1605_0035.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H9atqg"&gt;The number of government-led internet shutdowns has exploded over the last decade as states seek to stifle dissent and protest by limiting citizens’ access to the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVRjKN"&gt;Nearly 850 intentional shutdowns have been recorded over the past 10 years by nonprofit Access Now’s &lt;a href="https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/"&gt;Shutdown Tracker Optimization Project&lt;/a&gt; (STOP), and although the group acknowledges that data on incidents before 2016 is “patchy,” some 768 of these shutdowns took place in the last five years. There were 213 shutdowns in 2019 alone, with this figure ticking down to 155 in 2020 as the world adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic (which delayed elections and led to lockdowns that kept populations at home more often). And already in the first five months of 2021 there have been 50 shutdowns across 21 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BbxImH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It has moved from the fringes to become a common method”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OVstsN"&gt;“Since we began tracking government-initiated internet shutdowns, their use has proliferated at a truly alarming pace,” Access Now’s Felicia Anthonio, campaigner and &lt;a href="https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/"&gt;#KeepItOn&lt;/a&gt; lead, said in a report on the issue in &lt;a href="https://jigsaw.google.com/the-current/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Current&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a publication of Google’s internet thinktank Jigsaw. “As governments across the globe learn this authoritarian tactic from each other, it has moved from the fringes to become a common method many authorities use to stifle opposition, quash free speech and muzzle expression.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYybKa"&gt;The first significant internet shutdown took place in Egypt in 2011, as a response to protests against then-president Hosni Mubarak. As a result, an &lt;a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/internetintelligence/egypt-leaves-the-internet-v3"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; 93 percent of Egyptian networks were blocked for five days. Earlier internet shutdowns and slowdowns were carried out in Guinea in 2007 and in Iran in 2009, but Egypt’s was the first to affect internet connections across an entire country where more than a quarter of citizens had access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C99kyL"&gt;Since then, shutdowns have spread across the world, most prominently in Asia and Africa. They’re most frequently deployed during elections or times of protest, with governments claiming shutdowns are needed to stem the spread of misinformation. In reality, though, as the report in &lt;em&gt;The Current&lt;/em&gt; notes, the intention is to “prevent opposition candidates from connecting with voters to build support, restrict the ability of citizens to organize, and undermine the efforts of election observers to ensure the integrity of the vote.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="99sWsr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many governments see the internet “as a threat that needs to be ‘controlled’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pHDkyj"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Marianne Díaz Hernández, a Venezuelan lawyer and #KeepItOn Fellow, says the rise in shutdowns is a response to the internet’s increasing utility for organizing protest. “As more and more people use the internet, and particularly social media, to document and denounce human rights violations, civil unrest and other events, some governments start seeing the internet as a threat that needs to be ‘controlled,’” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPiT7u"&gt;In addition to the stifling of free speech and assembly, internet shutdowns have significant economic harms. In Myanmar, which has seen the longest-ever government-led internet shutdown in history as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-55902070"&gt;recent coup&lt;/a&gt;, it’s estimated the &lt;a href="https://www.top10vpn.com/cost-of-internet-shutdowns/"&gt;economic loss&lt;/a&gt; has been equal to 2.5 percent of the country’s GDP — around $2.1 billion. The report in &lt;em&gt;The Current&lt;/em&gt; notes that this “inflicted on the country approximately half the damage wrought by the Great Recession on the US economy in less than a third of the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJbwQ0"&gt;Combatting the issue seems difficult at a high level. Internet shutdowns have been condemned by various international organizations, including the G7 and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and Special Rapporteurs, but as Access Now’s data shows, this doesn’t seem to have dinted their use. There have also been some legislative wins, as when the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Community Court, ruled that &lt;a href="https://www.accessnow.org/ecowas-togo-court-decision/"&gt;a 2017 internet shutdown in Togo was illegal&lt;/a&gt;, but it also seems unlikely such actions will actually dissuade governments who feel shutdowns are necessary to hold power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOzS8e"&gt;The best method to combat internet shutdowns seem technological. VPNs and proxy servers allow users to rout internet traffic through another country to avoid certain blocks, while mesh networking apps can connect directly from one device to another, providing basic messaging functionality though no access to the wider internet. But access to such tools is not guaranteed: it depends on people knowing they can be used in the first place and downloading them in advance of a shutdown. At least the internet can be used to help get the word out. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Philips Hue partners with Spotify to turn all your lights into a music visualizer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A person on a bed listening to music with way too many pink and purple lights in their room" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nNKoEMl2fxwfURSgeoBlxHPQjhY=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69801785/Philips_Hue___Spotify___Image_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Signify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9if6Zf"&gt;If you’ve got a home full of Hue lights, there’s an easy new way to set the mood for your next party. Signify, which makes the Philips Hue line, is partnering with Spotify so that your lightbulbs can automatically sync up with whatever music you have playing, changing color and flashing along to the beat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZ5GLO"&gt;There are already plenty of ways to sync your lights to music — including Signify’s own Hue Sync app — but those methods typically require letting an app or some external hardware listen in on everything you’re playing. This new partnership avoids that by letting the Hue Bridge tap directly into Spotify to see what’s playing once you’ve linked your accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6FJkTm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A Hue Bridge and color bulbs are required&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6zetiK"&gt;That close partnership is also supposed to provide a better experience, letting the Hue system adjust lighting effects based on specific data about the music you’re playing, including its genre, tempo, volume, mood, and more. You can also go into the app and customize the effects if you don’t want the system deciding how to light things on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTczIH"&gt;The system comes with a couple of catches: to use it, you’ll need a Hue Bridge, which not every Hue owner is going to have (newer bulbs can be used over Bluetooth without the dedicated hub); and the feature only supports color bulbs. On the other hand, you &lt;em&gt;don’t &lt;/em&gt;need a paid Spotify subscription — free accounts will work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="enZnM5"&gt;Signify says the feature will start rolling out today and be available to all Hue users within a week. It’s initially being billed as an “early access” feature; in October, it’s supposed to get more prominent billing as a “permanent part” of the Hue app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hhyCUs"&gt;In addition to the Spotify partnership, Signify announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22414992"&gt;a whole bunch of new Hue lights today&lt;/a&gt;, including more filament lights, brighter bulb configurations, and updated lamps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Philips Hue adds a whole bunch of new lights, including a ‘light tube’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aAiDdpI8eyGe21tAQtThgeOoPok=/770x310:4878x3049/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69801783/Philips_Hue_Play_gradient_light_tube_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Hue light tube beneath a TV. | Image: Signify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1uTVX7"&gt;The Philips Hue line of smart bulbs is growing today with the addition of a bunch of new lights, strips, and lamps. There’s a bunch of stuff, so here’s a quick rundown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FyQ0wZ"&gt;New filament bulbs that can change color temperature (plus a new candle shape for filament bulbs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZpSiM3"&gt;Brighter options (75 watt and 100 watt equivalent) for color-temperature changing and full color versions of the standard Hue bulbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9fGmmE"&gt;A “light tube” for illuminating around your TV (it’s meant to sync the colors to what’s on screen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qkQUJv"&gt;Enhanced versions of the Signe floor and table lamps that can display multiple colors at once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oqj5Z5"&gt;An upgraded TV-focused lightstrip, the “Hue ambiance gradient lightstrip,” which can likewise display multiple colors at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="k8EMDd"&gt;A new ceiling light called Infuse that can change colors and throws a bit of light up onto the ceiling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VQss7i9bFbXvL7jemqPKnhFw5i4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22818294/Philips_Hue_Filament_White_Ambiance.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Signify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Hue filament lights&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9YhKYS"&gt;The products are rolling out over the coming months, with some configurations of the brighter bulbs and filament bulbs available right away, the lightstrip and lamps coming in October, and the light tube coming and ceiling coming in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIlyGf"&gt;Signify, which makes the Hue lineup, is also releasing a Hue app update today that’ll allow for “dynamic scenes,” which let lights continually shift colors. Later this fall, the company plans to launch a “natural light” scene that’ll let your lights adjust their color temperature throughout the day to mimic the light of the sun, with cooler tones in the morning and warmer tones at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cV0VkF"&gt;The Hue Play HDMI sync box, which syncs lights with your TV screen, is also getting an update later this fall to support 120Hz gaming. Unfortunately, it’ll only support up to 1440p resolution at that high refresh rate, so you’ll have to choose what to prioritize. The box already supports 4K gaming but at only 60Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4on0Y"&gt;In addition to the new bulbs, Signify also announced a partnership with Spotify to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22414937"&gt;sync your lights to whatever music you have playing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ivermectin misinformation has poisoned Amazon’s platform, with few fixes planned</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P8SF6L"&gt;Earlier this week, I started a search on Amazon and mistyped, entering just two letters in: “iv.” Amazon then helpfully compiled a list of suggested search results, almost all of which were for the horse de-worming version of the drug ivermectin. That drug is at the center of one of the more recent and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneunderscore__/status/1431040456364810242"&gt;more mind-boggling&lt;/a&gt; parts of the anti-vaccine misinformation story, a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ivermectin-demand-drives-trump-telemedicine-website-rcna1791"&gt;false cure touted by hucksters and others out to make a quick buck&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ni2rc3"&gt;This evening, Amazon spokesperson Craig Andrews tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “Amazon’s autocomplete responses are driven by customer activity. We are blocking certain autocomplete responses to address these concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfKxJd"&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644579/tiktok-reddit-facebook-ivermectin-covid-19-misinformation"&gt;Facebook, TikTok, and Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon has not gotten a lid on limiting the spread of COVID-19 misinformation. Unlike those platforms and others, Amazon has seemingly done very little to try to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Autocomplete results on Amazon for “iv” showing ivermectin." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m_XiNgN1O8l-CcsOQ6s_3teK2O4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22819245/Screen_Shot_2021_08_31_at_8.28.23_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Autocomplete results on Amazon for “iv” showing ivermectin.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="clcsdW"&gt;Amazon is not unique in using an algorithm to drive its autocomplete results. But as companies like Google have learned, there are “data voids” for previously unpopular search terms that can suddenly skew the algorithm when those terms get swept up in a new misinformation campaign. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550430/google-search-results-changing-quickly-warning-breaking-news"&gt;Google has gone to some length&lt;/a&gt; to try to solve the data void problem, most recently by presenting warnings on search results it thinks might suffer from the issue. As of the publication of this article, Amazon’s search results still show entries for ivermectin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSy53W"&gt;When you click through to one of those suggested search terms, Amazon simply lists many options for purchasing the drug meant to treat animals — without any further context about its dangers when ingested by humans. Although there are legitimate uses for ivermectin in humans, treating COVID-19 isn’t one of them. And though it should go without saying that taking the veterinary version is a very bad idea, that’s exactly what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hyu0u4"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/resources/15400.pdf"&gt;bulletin issued by the Mississippi department of health&lt;/a&gt;, the agency says that “At least 70% of the recent calls [to poison control] have been related to ingestion of livestock or animal formulations of ivermectin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrvAaf"&gt;Ivermectin can cause side effects ranging from “skin rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, facial or limb swelling, neurologic adverse events (dizziness, seizures, confusion), sudden drop in blood pressure, severe skin rash potentially requiring hospitalization and liver injury (hepatitis),” &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/faq-covid-19-and-ivermectin-intended-animals"&gt;according to the FDA&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g2CS74"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y'all. Stop it. &lt;a href="https://t.co/TWb75xYEY4"&gt;https://t.co/TWb75xYEY4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— U.S. FDA (@US_FDA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1429050070243192839?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FadffS"&gt;Where other platforms have put effort into presenting information boxes leading to reliable and trustworthy information about COVID-19 and COVID-19 treatments, Amazon shows no such information in either its search results nor on product pages for ivermectin. An Amazon spokesperson tells me that if you search specifically for “ivermectin for covid,” it does display only a link to the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19"&gt;FDA’s warning page about the drug&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bL6Xo1"&gt;It does appear that on at least some product listings, at least some moderation teams at Amazon are keeping an eye out for problems. Some of the top search results for ivermectin have very few written reviews. Scroll down a bit, however, and there are plenty that are clearly meant to discuss the use of the drug in humans. One reviewer, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Duramectin-Ivermectin-Paste-1-87-Horses/dp/B07PT9NGGQ/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=ivermectin&amp;amp;qid=1630467118&amp;amp;sr=8-9&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for example&lt;/a&gt;, wrote that it “Worked good on my 200lb horse” and that “long CV already going away.” Another &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bimectin-Paste-For-Equine/dp/B003UO0QOS/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=ivermectin&amp;amp;qid=1630468754&amp;amp;sr=8-7&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rated&lt;/a&gt; a product 5 stars, writing that “I love the taste [...] Ivermectin too hard to get, but so effective at preventing something I cannot mention here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SPmdv"&gt;Over on Reddit, more than a hundred subreddits &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/08/reddits-teach-the-controversy-stance-on-covid-vaccines-sparks-wider-protest/"&gt;went dark today&lt;/a&gt; in protest of that platform’s refusal to ban communities that spread COVID-19 misinformation. TikTok appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644579/tiktok-reddit-facebook-ivermectin-covid-19-misinformation"&gt;playing whack-a-mole&lt;/a&gt; with videos on its platform, and Facebook has struggled to enforce its policies against misinformation as communities &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ivermectin-demand-drives-trump-telemedicine-website-rcna1791"&gt;resort to euphemisms&lt;/a&gt; like “moo juice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwN9pb"&gt;On Amazon, veterinary ivermectin remains easy to find without being shown any science-based information that could inform a consumer of the dangers of taking a drug that is meant for animals. It also remains easy to purchase on that platform, in some cases with free Amazon Prime delivery, fulfilled by an Amazon warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BqwBVJ"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hey Amazon this autocomplete result for just two letters is VERY BAD on so many levels. Not only does it reveal how easily your algorithm can be skewed by misinformation, it’s also possibly leading to genuine, human harm. &lt;a href="https://t.co/A2hfsKIcQr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/A2hfsKIcQr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1432548841518092292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
