    <title>Samsung tries to prove its foldable phones are tough in a new test video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UarNK6vTmdy6i9vxmbC12o2a_ys=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69981970/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_22.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mE5U41"&gt;Samsung is sharing new details about how it tests the durability of the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3. However, it’s unclear exactly why Samsung is releasing this information now, especially given that both phones launched in August; that makes us think it could be an attempt to assuage fears sparked by recent reports of cracks on Galaxy Z Flip 3 screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9pkuS"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpWHBvxmDV0"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; posted on &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/how-samsung-galaxy-z-fold3-flip3-5g-test-behind-the-scenes/?utm_source=pr_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung shows four separate tests. One has the phones in an environmental chamber, where Samsung tests the phones under different climates to make sure they still work. Another test engulfs the phones in water. One uses a robot arm to test the performance of the S Pen on the Z Fold 3. A fourth test folds both phones over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mcZ5Vm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung has shown off its stress tests in the past&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uj2fHy"&gt;Samsung has shown off its stress tests in the past — one video &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-11-26-samsung-smartphones-stress-test.html"&gt;from 2012&lt;/a&gt; showed a robot butt sitting on phones, for example. And it’s not just Samsung; Apple described its phone antenna testing in detail &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9eXYOA8TCk&amp;amp;t=701s"&gt;in response&lt;/a&gt; to the iPhone 4’s “Antennagate” scandal and showed off its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/25/6845611/inside-apples-iphone-6-torture-building"&gt;iPhone testing lab&lt;/a&gt; after the iPhone 6 was found to be prone to bending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZjJur"&gt;Samsung’s tests shown on Monday don’t specifically address the issue of why Z Flip 3 screens seem to be cracking, though. There are increasing numbers of reports of cracks appearing in the middle of the screen right about where the phone’s hinge is. &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; had &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/07/galaxy-z-flip-3-glass-durability-diary/"&gt;a particularly worrying story&lt;/a&gt; on October 7th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="sdT2jI"&gt;Recently, I picked up my Galaxy Z Flip 3 review unit after a few days of no use, and I was shocked to see that the ultra-thin glass had broken. I hadn’t dropped the phone in recent days (only once in my usage, &lt;em&gt;weeks &lt;/em&gt;beforehand), I hadn’t exposed it to extreme heat or cold, I hadn’t even really touched it over the course of at least a few days, so the shattered glass came as a genuine shock to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="26l9NY"&gt;A user on Reddit posted about a similar issue after &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxyzflip/comments/q2sz16/got_the_thing_less_than_three_days_ago_treated_it/"&gt;less than three days of owning the phone&lt;/a&gt;. Another said their phone’s screen cracked &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxyzflip/comments/p9a646/galaxy_z_flip_3_screen_fails_withing_24hrs_of/"&gt;within 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;. And the problem doesn’t seem to be exclusive to the Z Flip 3; as pointed out by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;, Michael Fisher (aka MrMobile) said he saw tiny cracks &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/XnHJhBNpWb4?t=562"&gt;on the hinge on his Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TiRMl7"&gt;One of the biggest questions about Samsung’s foldables has always been their durability, especially after the first Fold &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18511170/samsung-galaxy-fold-delay-indefinitely-statement-screen-display-broken-issues"&gt;was delayed&lt;/a&gt; because screens were breaking on review units. The reported issues with cracks show that there might still be some problems for Samsung to solve to ensure that their foldable phones don’t break over the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_0jG4qDGtvO2-VxvVC5PUlh1ldA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/akrales_181101_3056_0132.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2018 Kindle Paperwhite might not be the newest model, but it’s available for $35 off.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AZCNr8"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon, having helped pioneer the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of three unique models with their own pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRHBaM"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each model currently available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one, or any, of the products. In those instances, we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price so you know what a good Kindle deal looks like when you see one. Note that Amazon also offers a 20 percent off all of its Kindles when you trade in select devices, so there are still other ways to save money if when none of the models are available on discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hittMf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s older Kindles will start to lose their internet access in December","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598747/kindle-3g-network-shutdown-e-readers-no-internet"},{"title":"You can now preorder the new Kindle Paperwhite","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685873/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="r36wrm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741941"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;Kindle (10th-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mXAcFi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10363966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfprjz"&gt;This is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, and as such, it usually retails for $90. Released in 2019, the base Kindle includes a front light, 8GB of storage, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, this model has slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy a 10th-gen Kindle with lockscreen ads for $90 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VT322X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxG6j9qO2d#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, its full retail price. If you want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you can grab it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$110 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy either Kindle model at Amazon, you’ll also receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $120 ($15 off its usual price) at Amazon; it includes one of three printed covers and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkX3DN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ze80m8"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition (2019)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019. Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $110 ($20 more than the base Kindle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon Kids Plus service. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their kids access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost. We’ve seen the Kindle Kids Edition drop to as low as $70 during Amazon Prime Day, however, right now it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746224890339507137" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $110.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3DEvBp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="iYO8oT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21546591/best-amazon-echo-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (2018)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="deHMlR"&gt;Amazon’s latest Kindle Paperwhite is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685873/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;forthcoming 11th-gen model&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with USB-C support, adjustable color temperature, longer battery life, and a larger, 6.8-inch display. Given the new e-reader hasn’t even launched — it’s set to arrive on October 27th starting at $140 — we have yet to see any discounts. Thankfully, you can still pick up the last-gen model, which is frequently available for far less than the standard retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkwzBt"&gt;The 2018 Kindle Paperwhite starts at $130 and comes in four different configurations: an 8GB Wi-Fi model, a 32GB Wi-Fi model, and a configuration of each that drops the ads from the lock screen. The Paperwhite features a 6-inch, pin-sharp backlit display, which is the main reason to get the Paperwhite over the base Kindle. The 2018 model also added a few useful features normally found on Amazon’s flagship reader, the Oasis, such as water resistance and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;As far as deals go, you can currently pick up the 8GB Kindle Paperwhite with ad support for $95 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ96B6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxHjGSDlV6#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTCW9G7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad-free edition at Amazon for $115&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PP49ZDW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxHnfba6HB#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are also selling the 32GB Paperwhite with ads for $110. Just like the base Kindle, Amazon is running a promotion where you can grab the e-reader plus three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. We also expect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emeowb"&gt;If you don’t mind paying for a leather case and a power adapter, Amazon has discounted its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HL49FCK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader bundle for $170&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKT4M5K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB reader with ads for $200&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a fan of Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games trilogy, Amazon also offers a bundle that includes a Kindle Paperwhite, a power adapter, and a Mockingjay-emblazoned cover. It’s currently available in two ad-supported configurations and colors: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB version for $160&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $190&lt;/a&gt;, both of which save you $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vOUHwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Oasis (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof, 7-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. Unlike previous models, however, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we have seen the 32GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $200, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are currently no deals on just the Oasis itself, configurations start at $250 at Amazon and include three free months of Kindle Unlimited. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $250 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VDMJJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads is $270&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB version is $280 with ads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 without&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGlPY"&gt;Amazon is currently offering an Essentials Bundle for $30 off its normal list price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RNPKRKW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported configuration for $290&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RW2K1MD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $310&lt;/a&gt;, both of which come with a leather cover, a power adapter, and three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hPPu8s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552599"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="4mZNi9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Magic Leap somehow raised $500 million to make another AR headset</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w05BvxMDffSE4MUmEDUXm8wv32U=/457x0:984x351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69981458/ML_Teaser_Desktop.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yqv66W"&gt;Magic Leap has raised $500 million in funding and is preparing to release a new AR headset, the Magic Leap 2, next year, the company &lt;a href="https://www.magicleap.com/en-us/news/news/magic-leap-raises-usd500-million-in-funding"&gt;announced Monday.&lt;/a&gt; The headset will be generally available next year, the company said, and “select customers” are using it as part of an early access program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1Bp1W"&gt;CEO Peggy Johnson said in a statement that with the new funding “Magic Leap will have greater financial flexibility and the resources needed to continue our growth trajectory as we expand on our industry-leading AR technology.” She revealed the new device in an Monday appearance on CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;

Built for enterprise, it is more immersive and comfortable, with the largest FOV, and dimming – a first-to-market innovation enabling use in brightly lit settings. &lt;a href="https://t.co/jSPUGd4P9N"&gt;https://t.co/jSPUGd4P9N&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/LVpUX6YfcW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LVpUX6YfcW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Magic Leap (@magicleap) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/magicleap/status/1447645627547017218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rq6x9j"&gt;Magic Leap, of course, is the company that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/21/7026889/magic-leap-google-leads-542-million-investment-in-augmented-reality-startup"&gt;began its existence as a mysterious AR startup&lt;/a&gt;, received almost &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/8/17662040/magic-leap-one-creator-edition-preview-mixed-reality-glasses-launch"&gt;$3 billion to fund its consumer-friendly AR headset,&lt;/a&gt; before changing its headset’s name from Magic Leap 1 to The Magic Leap One Creator Edition in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21003361/magic-leap-1-ar-headset-update-professional-business-customer-pivot"&gt;attempt to attract professional customers.&lt;/a&gt; The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21231236/magic-leap-ar-headset-layoffs-coronavirus-enterprise-business-shift"&gt;laid off 1,000 employees&lt;/a&gt; — roughly half its workforce — in 2020, and was reportedly abandoning its consumer business. Cofounder and CEO Rony Abovitz left the company in July 2020, and was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315864/magic-leap-new-ceo-microsoft-business-vp-rony-abovitz-step-down"&gt;replaced by Johnson. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCiRAB"&gt;In April, Johnson said limited quantities of Magic Leap’s second-gen headset, 20 percent lighter and with a doubled field of view, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395867/magic-leap-2-release-date-ceo-peggy-johnson-2021"&gt;would ship later this year&lt;/a&gt;. According to its statement Monday, the Magic Leap 2 will be the industry’s smallest and lightest device built for enterprise, “designed to increase business adoption of AR.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1WXLP"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.magicleap.com/en-us/news/op-ed/my-first-year-at-magic-leap-and-the-opportunity-ahead"&gt;separate post &lt;/a&gt;Monday, Johnson reflected on her first year as Magic Leap’s CEO. She cited a “growing demand for AR” across industries, and cited research from International Data Corp. (IDC) that showed the AR/VR market is expected to grow to $140 billion by the end of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4hm3w1"&gt;She listed the company’s enterprise customers, including Ericsson, and Farmers Insurance, the latter of which used the company’s tech to train new employees remotely during the pandemic. Johnson said Magic Leap has added strategic partnerships with Google Cloud, PTC, NVDIA, and VMWare&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qUoOF"&gt;Johnson said Magic Leap’s core business is focused on enterprise solutions, but added “there continues to be intense interest in the application of Magic Leap’s technology in the consumer space. In fact, we have received several requests to license our technology and will actively pursue these opportunities if they enhance our position and ability to innovate in the enterprise market.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC’s new Vive Flow headset reportedly launches this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R4h_ZCQfiiUF9jnEMZHKFNoyntw=/39x0:1229x793/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69981389/Go_with_the_Flow.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A promotional image for HTC’s upcoming event.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://engagevr.io/go-with-the-flow/" target="_blank"&gt;Engage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O6OvdJ"&gt;HTC is planning to release a new VR headset this week and is also working on its own metaverse-like virtual world, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/htc-flow-hue-viveport-verse"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9m6ye1"&gt;Let’s start first with that new headset. It’s reportedly a standalone VR headset called the Vive Flow and is intended to be a media consumption device “with access to some casual gaming,” &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; says. However, it won’t ship with controllers and will be less powerful than the Oculus Quest 2, &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; reports. The Vive Flow will reportedly be announced at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vive.com%2Fus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F11%2F22721337%2Fhtc-vive-flow-vr-headset-vivport-verse-metaverse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HTC’s October 14th event&lt;/a&gt;, which would make sense, as HTC is &lt;a href="https://engagevr.io/go-with-the-flow/"&gt;promoting the event&lt;/a&gt; with the “Go with the Flow” tagline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kClC6m"&gt;The new metaverse space is apparently called Viveport Verse. According to a &lt;a href="https://metaverse-prod-1-app.viveportverse.com/"&gt;site about the service&lt;/a&gt; (which was live as of publishing this article), you’ll be able to make your own 3D avatar and explore “a variety of events,” but the space will also have an “NFT Showroom” and user-generated content “available soon.” You seemingly won’t need a VR device to visit Vivepoint Verse, though; the website says it will be compatible with desktop devices, laptops, mobile devices, tablets, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; VR headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlOROl"&gt;We’ve collected screenshots of the Viveport Verse website in the gallery below, in the event that HTC closes access to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="orWVah"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10802077"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MX29SV"&gt;It’s unclear how this new Viveport Verse space would differ &lt;a href="https://sync.vive.com/"&gt;from the enterprise-focused Vive Sync&lt;/a&gt; experience. It seems like Viveport Verse could be more of a series of virtual worlds of many kinds, perhaps similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714876/facebook-horizon-worlds-creators-fund-social-vr-platform-metaverse"&gt;Facebook’s Horizon Worlds&lt;/a&gt;, as opposed to Sync’s virtual meeting spaces intended for work. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook Oversight board also very interested in what Frances Haugen has to say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Facebook Whistle Blower Frances Haugen Testifies To Senate Committee" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w_tmLkjM9QdG5SZJ-C6Q0iq9mow=/0x31:4109x2770/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69981155/1235715452.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testified before Congress on October 5th.  | Photo by Matt McClain-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W2pVIt"&gt;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen said Monday that she will speak to the platform’s independent Oversight Board at its invitation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2smht"&gt;“I have accepted the invitation to brief the Facebook Oversight Board about what I learned while working there,” Haugen &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FrancesHaugen/status/1447617378402160642?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “Facebook has lied to the board repeatedly, and I am looking forward to sharing the truth with them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vwu4Yo"&gt;Haugen, a former product manager in Facebook’s civic integrity group, leaked a large &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;cache of internal Facebook documents&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; showing problems within the organization.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;She appeared &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-whistleblower-misinformation-public-60-minutes-2021-10-03/"&gt;on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; two days before she &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;testified before Congress&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook “repeatedly” misled the public about “what its own research reveals about the safety of children and the efficacy of its artificial intelligence systems as a role in spreading divisive and extreme messages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ETHtw"&gt;In a statement &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/1232363373906301-oversight-board-to-meet-with-frances-haugen/"&gt;posted to its website&lt;/a&gt; Monday, the Oversight Board said in recent weeks “new information about Facebook’s approach to content moderation has come to light” as a result of Haugen’s actions. The board seeks to “discuss Ms. Haugen’s experiences and gather information that can help push for greater transparency and accountability from Facebook through our case decisions and recommendations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INJFBS"&gt;The board said it was looking into whether Facebook “has been fully forthcoming.” The board did not immediately reply to a request seeking comment on any specific information it hoped to discuss with Haugen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64j48a"&gt;Facebook’s Oversight Board &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21755133/facebook-oversight-board-supreme-court-first-cases-hate-speech-pandemic-misinformation"&gt;began hearing appeals&lt;/a&gt; of content moderation decisions on Facebook and Instagram in December 2020. The &lt;a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/"&gt;board is composed&lt;/a&gt; of independent members from around the world, who make what are meant to be final and binding decisions on what content the social media platforms should allow or remove. The board &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22320329/facebook-oversight-board-trump-ban-decision"&gt;decided in May&lt;/a&gt;, for example, that Facebook’s ban on former President Trump could remain in effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I7Tw1h"&gt;Facebook declined to comment on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUt9Dk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7DFtY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 11th 5:11PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds Facebook declined comment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Now every Twitter web user can ‘soft block’ annoying followers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p7uUthE9NbYbAcnFGm0G287olkc=/0x33:1200x833/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69981071/E_tLi7fWUAAEGSL.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Twitter web users can now soft block followers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3wEKq6"&gt;Twitter is rolling out a new feature that lets any user on the web remove a follower &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1447630725746987013"&gt;without blocking them&lt;/a&gt;, an action also known as a “soft block.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVkqre"&gt;To soft block a follower, head to your profile, click followers, click the three-dot menu next to a follower, and then click the option “Remove this follower.” (You can see what that option looks like in an image from Twitter at the top of this post.) A follower you remove won’t be notified of the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CZS2LE"&gt;A soft block is different from a block because it allows a user to still see your tweets and direct message you, but they won’t see your tweets on your feed. That said, when you remove a follower, they can follow you again if they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k666Tk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new method is easier than the previous one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LDj6Pp"&gt;The feature might be useful if you don’t want to do a full-on block but want to create some space from another user. This new method from Twitter is a little easier than the previous one, which required you to block and unblock someone manually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLFl61"&gt;The ability to remove a follower is Twitter’s latest feature to give users more control over their experience on the platform to help curb abuse and harassment. In September, the company began testing a new Safety Mode feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652572/twitter-safety-mode-autoblocks-abusive-accounts-beta"&gt;temporarily autoblocks abusive accounts&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s unclear when that may roll out more widely.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new work-from-home policy: let teams decide</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vgLYq6sT4AOD90zHZCbYSL-2yBw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69980922/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dPi5fj"&gt;Amazon CEO Andy Jassy sent an email to employees on Monday outlining a shift in work-from-home policies for its office workers. As of August, the plan had been for employees to return to the offices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611439/amazon-office-employees-postpone-back-to-work-january-2022"&gt;in January 2022&lt;/a&gt;, with the expectation being that workers spent three days a week in the office and two days a week remote. However, under the new policy &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/amazon-offering-teams-more-flexibility-as-we-return-to-office"&gt;announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon lets individual teams decide how often their people need to come into the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNhyv3"&gt;Here’s Jassy’s explanation of the new policies and how they will work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="q6zezF"&gt;For our corporate roles, instead of specifying that people work a baseline of three days a week in the office, we’re going to leave this decision up to individual teams. This decision will be made team by team at the Director level. We expect that there will be teams that continue working mostly remotely, others that will work some combination of remotely and in the office, and still others that will decide customers are best served having the team work mostly in the office. We’re intentionally not prescribing how many days or which days—this is for Directors to determine with their senior leaders and teams. The decisions should be guided by what will be most effective for our customers; and not surprisingly, we will all continue to be evaluated by how we deliver for customers, regardless of where the work is performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="NPwGz8"&gt;Jassy says that employees should expect to hear from their team leaders on their plans before January 3rd. However, “we want most of our people close enough to their core team that they can easily travel to the office for a meeting within a day’s notice,” according to Jassy. Employees will also be able to work up to four weeks per year fully remote, as long as they work within the country where they are employed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5RVnu"&gt;These changes only apply to office employees; other workers, including the company’s warehouse workers, drivers, AWS datacenter employees, retail staffers, and employees developing devices, won’t have as flexible of schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQAxns"&gt;Amazon is not the only company to have recently revised its plans for bringing employees back to the office due to uncertainties regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. In August, both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633616/apple-delays-mandatory-office-return-january-covid-surge"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650639/google-mandatory-return-january-2022-remote-work"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; pushed their mandatory return to the office to January 2022. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664284/microsoft-office-reopening-plans-us"&gt;In September&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft went a step farther, indefinitely delaying its office reopening.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2020 MacBook Air, one of the best laptops you can get, is now available at Amazon starting at $850.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including some equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the discounts that are currently available for the latest MacBook models, as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — which will be compatible with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; upon its release later this year — and we’ll highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15- to 20-percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. For now, however, these are the best MacBook and Mac Mini deals you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="15A2tS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;The best MacBook Air deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FJU3RG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance. It ticks all right boxes when it comes to performance and price, which is why it’s our number one pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptop of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iF2kto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It typically sells for $999, however, it’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08N5M7S6K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747531561997035408#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $850. The $1,249 512GB configuration is also on sale in all three colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747532219045612135#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $1,100, its best price to date. These deals can come and go quickly, though, we expect more to come as the holiday shopping season draws near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;The best MacBook Pro deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The touch bar-equipped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; comes in more sizes and options than the Air, and it’s geared more toward demanding use cases. The base model is the 13-inch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-powered variant&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a brighter screen, longer battery life, and an internal fan designed to maintain performance under increased workloads. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1,299, but the base model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is on sale for $120 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to $1,179. The larger, 512GB variant is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LM1K3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $1,349, its second-best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjmE4B"&gt;While there have been rumors throughout the year of a r&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/6/9/22526584/apple-m1x-macbook-pro-wwdc-2021-youtube-tags" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;edesigned MacBook Pro, one with an M1X processor and additional ports&lt;/a&gt;, we might not see it until further into the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ue6Q0U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="44XxWs"&gt;Of course, you can also buy some older MacBook Pro models, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch, mid-2020 model&lt;/a&gt;. The older device features four Thunderbolt ports, Windows bootcamp-ready Ice Lake processors, the current scissor-switch keyboard, increased RAM, and various storage configurations. Right now, the 13-inch model is available in several configurations at Amazon, including one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Pro-10th-Generation-Quad-Core/dp/B08DTPQ9XB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th-gen i7 Intel processor and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $1,999 and one with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB of storage and a 2.0GHz 10th-gen Intel Core i5 processor&lt;/a&gt; for $1,700, which is $300 off the list price. You can also pick up the model with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B0881Z844Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage and a 10th-gen Intel Core i5&lt;/a&gt; for $1,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hij1MQ"&gt;If you want a bigger laptop with more horsepower, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2019 MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; is the top-of-the-line model. Compared to its predecessor, it has a better keyboard, newer processors, and improved speakers. There are several configurations available with more storage and speedier processors — you can also get the 16-inch model with an Intel Core i9 CPU and 1TB of storage &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FTNGNC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $2,695 at Amaz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FV1Y57/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt;, for instance — but deals are few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjWXtS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10469149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LYpjlZ"&gt;The best Mac Mini deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the Mini features Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. The outright best deal on the base Mac Mini is at Amazon, where you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $600&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5P7TLW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB configuration for $799&lt;/a&gt;. B&amp;amp;H Photo is also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604800-REG%2Fapple_mgnt3ll_a_mac_mini.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;matching Amazon’s current price&lt;/a&gt; for the 512GB model, though, no other retailers are at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix suspends trans employee who tweeted about Dave Chappelle special </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tRVfaK15zP4joimNtKX0flxFAao=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69980712/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SKBZdc"&gt;Netflix has suspended a trans employee who tweeted about Dave Chappelle’s comedy special &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Closer&lt;/em&gt;. In the stand-up set, which was released on October 5th, Chappelle &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/dave-chappelle-the-closer-comedy-review.html"&gt;doubles down on his jokes about LGBTQ groups&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rsYwg5"&gt;The next day, Netflix software engineer Terra Field tweeted about Chappelle, writing that the comedian “attacks the trans community, and the very validity of transness” in the special:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gmWqkc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I work at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@netflix&lt;/a&gt;. Yesterday we launched another Chappelle special where he attacks the trans community, and the very validity of transness - all while trying to pit us against other marginalized groups. You're going to hear a lot of talk about "offense".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are not offended  &lt;/p&gt;—   Terra Fied   (@RainofTerra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RainofTerra/status/1445914236668895236?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YpdJFv"&gt;The tweet thread went viral, quickly spiraling into a conversation about free speech and cancel culture. Netflix then suspended Field along with two other employees for trying to attend a director-level meeting they weren’t invited to. Another trans employee is quitting the company over how the special — and Field’s comments — were handled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6X7Ne"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Netflix spokesperson pushed back against the idea that Field was suspended for tweeting. “It is absolutely untrue to say that we have suspended any employee for tweeting about this show,” they said. “Our employees are encouraged to disagree openly and we support their right to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbcyMm"&gt;The special has sparked significant controversy inside Netflix. (&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; is producing a forthcoming show for Netflix.)&lt;/em&gt; Shortly after it came out, employees started asking pointed questions about whether or not trans people were included in the decision to air the special and where the company draws a line between commentary and transphobia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrjJCq"&gt;“We repeatedly provide a platform for content that is harmful to the trans community,” wrote a current employee in Netflix’s open Q&amp;amp;A document. “These decisions have a material impact on our business, including harm to our current employees and talent declining to work with us. What is our plan on how we are going to repair this situation in particular?” None of the questions seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked for the special to be taken down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bxhlax"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You can’t do a carbon offset for bigotry”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fAhkAM"&gt;On October 8th, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos responded to the questions in an internal email. “It never feels good when people are hurting, especially our colleagues,” he wrote. “You should also be aware that some talent may join third parties in asking us to remove the show in the coming days, which we are not going to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZDm6t"&gt;Sarandos also said that Chappelle’s last special, &lt;em&gt;Sticks &amp;amp; Stones&lt;/em&gt;, is Netflix’s “most watched, stickiest, and most award winning stand-up special to date.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVowoJ"&gt;He added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="PGXJoI"&gt;Several of you have also asked where we draw the line on hate. We don’t allow titles on Netflix that are designed to incite hate or violence, and we don’t believe &lt;em&gt;The Closer &lt;/em&gt;crosses that line. I recognize, however, that distinguishing between commentary and harm is hard, especially with stand-up comedy which exists to push boundaries. Some people find the art of stand-up to be mean spirited but our members enjoy it, and it’s an important part of our content offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5jqqqr"&gt;The trans employee resource group at Netflix has been meeting with executives for years to try and educate them about the impact of transphobic content, according to a current employee. When Netflix bought the movie &lt;em&gt;Girl&lt;/em&gt;, about a fifteen-year-old ballet dancer preparing for gender confirmation surgery, it sparked multiple internal conversations about cisgender directors creating content about trans people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8WHRB"&gt;Sarandos said that the company’s commitment to inclusion is reflected in titles like &lt;em&gt;Sex Education&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Disclosure&lt;/em&gt;, a documentary about Hollywood’s impact on the trans community. But one current employee tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;they were not swayed by the statement. “You can’t do a carbon offset for bigotry,” they said dryly. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SamFederFilm/status/1447122238847733761"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure&lt;/em&gt; director Sam Feder also tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that Netflix “rented [the documentary] for half of what it cost to make it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRNuuJ"&gt;Netflix has a long history with Dave Chappelle. In 2016, the comedian signed a deal to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/21/13702948/dave-chappelle-netflix-standup-comedy-specials"&gt;create three specials for the platform&lt;/a&gt;. Four years later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21643473/netflix-dave-chappelle-show-removal-viacomcbs-comedy-central-deal"&gt;Netflix pulled &lt;em&gt;Chappelle’s Show&lt;/em&gt; from the streaming service&lt;/a&gt; at the comedian’s request. (It then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279727/dave-chappelle-show-back-netflix-comedy-central-beef"&gt;reinstated it in 2021&lt;/a&gt; after Chappelle’s beef with Comedy Central died down.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwEi7B"&gt;But while the comedian’s earlier specials have drawn controversy, Chappelle’s most recent has evoked a much stronger response. &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt; has drawn criticism from GLAAD, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/glaad/status/1445870767548231685"&gt;which wrote on Twitter that&lt;/a&gt; “Dave Chappelle’s brand has become synonymous with ridiculing trans people and other marginalized communities.” &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/dave-chappelle-netflix-special-glaad-national-black-justice-coalition-1235082813/"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the National Black Justice Coalition said: “Perpetuating transphobia perpetuates violence. Netflix should immediately pull &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt; from its platform and directly apologize to the transgender community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gU7bUB"&gt;Read Ted Sarandos’ full email below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="ftNwwo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10801698"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vt88gZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 11, 1:30pm ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with a statement from Netflix. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple releases iOS 15.0.2 with some Find My fixes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pJ0CrmeKrfc3RniV9709J3cIJ0s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69980678/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5fu32v"&gt;Apple released iOS 15.0.2 on Monday, and it has some important bug fixes, including a couple specific to Find My. For the iPad and iPhone, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212846"&gt;it also fixes a security flaw&lt;/a&gt; that Apple says may already be under attack, so update ASAP. Credited to an anonymous researcher, CVE-2021-30883 could allow an attacker to exploit the IOMobileFrameBuffer to “execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges,” and take over your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhHCdF"&gt;On my iPhone 12 Mini, the update clocks in at 531.1MB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8yv5S"&gt;Here are the patch notes from Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FopdTk"&gt;This update includes bug fixes for your iPhone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3MJUf"&gt;Photos saved to your library from Messages could be deleted after removing the associated thread or message&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5CT2w"&gt;iPhone Leather Wallet with MagSafe may not connect to Find My&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bMpUfp"&gt;AirTag might not appear in the Find My Items tab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7QEnL"&gt;CarPlay may fail to open audio apps or disconnect during playback&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0DXbL"&gt;Device restore or update may fail when using Finder or iTunes for iPhone 13 models&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="J3QrME"&gt;iPadOS 15.0.2 is also out. Here’s what’s included in that, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/11/ios-15-0-2-release-bug-fixes-features/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="g9dGNd"&gt;Photos saved to your library from Messages could be deleted after removing the associated thread or message&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="viecq8"&gt;AirTag might not appear in the Find My Items tab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZHtKI"&gt;Device restore or update may fail when using Finder or iTunes for iPad mini (6th generation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="MFXd1s"&gt;Apple released iOS 15 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;on September 20th&lt;/a&gt;, and already updated it once &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704524/apple-ios-15-0-1-update-fix-iphone-13-watch-unlock-bug"&gt;to iOS 15.0.1&lt;/a&gt; to fix an issue where people couldn’t use their Apple Watch to unlock their iPhone 13 while wearing a mask. Apple is also testing iOS 15.1 in beta, which currently includes features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686897/ios-15-1-beta-shareplay-feature-announced-removed-coming-soon-vaccine-card"&gt;SharePlay&lt;/a&gt;, support for adding a COVID-19 vaccination card to Apple Wallet, and new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713135/iphone-13-camera-features-prores-macro-ios-15-1-beta-3"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro camera features&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juV9qt"&gt;Apple posted watchOS 8.0.1 on Monday, too. According to Apple, here’s what’s fixed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jXq4WQ"&gt;Software update progress may not be displayed accurately for some Apple Watch Series 3 users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aelWgd"&gt;Accessibility settings may not have been available for some Apple Watch Series 3 users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jKrbSj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
