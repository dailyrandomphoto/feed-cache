    <title>Christchurch shooter was radicalized on YouTube, New Zealand report says</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pLAjaz"&gt;The Australian white supremacist who killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand was radicalized by YouTube, according to &lt;a href="https://christchurchattack.royalcommission.nz/the-report/"&gt;a 792-page report&lt;/a&gt; on the March 2019 shooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmwIax"&gt;“What particularly stood out was the statement that the terrorist made that he was ‘not a frequent commentator on extreme right-wing sites and YouTube was a significant source of information and inspiration’,” said Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s Prime Minister, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/dec/08/christchurch-shooting-royal-commission-report-to-be-released-live?page=with:block-5fcee6ea8f084f47a8a41296#block-5fcee6ea8f084f47a8a41296"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; “This is a point I plan to make directly to the leadership of YouTube.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gEWAm"&gt;This is not the first time YouTube has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/8/28/20836019/youtube-ceo-quarterly-letter-radicalization-pipeline"&gt;linked to radicalization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/mbzzzx/youtube-decides-to-leave-neo-nazi-propaganda-online"&gt;white supremacist content&lt;/a&gt;. There has been an ongoing argument about whether YouTube’s algorithm pushes people &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html"&gt;toward more extreme views&lt;/a&gt; over time. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/30/critics-slam-youtube-study-showing-no-ties-to-radicalization.html"&gt;Although this is not a universal conclusion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/how-youtubes-algorithm-distorts-truth"&gt;some researchers say&lt;/a&gt; that the combination of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/19/17876892/youtube-extremism-report-rebecca-lewis-data-society"&gt;a business model that rewards edgy content&lt;/a&gt; and a personalized algorithm meant to keep viewers hooked is a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/opinion/sunday/youtube-politics-radical.html"&gt;recipe for radicalization&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKHQLs"&gt;The YouTube citations are part of a larger inquiry into the hate crime to see if it could have been prevented. The shooter &lt;a href="https://christchurchattack.royalcommission.nz/the-report/part-6-what-public-sector-agencies-knew-about-the-terrorist/evaluation-of-what-public-sector-agencies-did-with-the-information-they-had-about-the-individual/"&gt;sent an email&lt;/a&gt; to Parliament, the Prime Minister’s office, and news outlets eight minutes before he began his attack, according to the report. His manifesto was attached to the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HT1RwS"&gt;The authorities weren’t the only ones the shooter alerted. His manifesto was also posted to 8chan, &lt;a href="https://splinternews.com/meet-the-man-keeping-8chan-the-worlds-most-vile-websit-1793856249"&gt;a message board that often hosts far-right content&lt;/a&gt;; included in the post was a link to a Facebook page, where the poster said a livestream of the attack would be broadcast. (Facebook later removed the page and video.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w17pnw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The shooter also modified his firearms before the attacks using YouTube tutorials&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uipKCb"&gt;A 17-minute video that appeared to show the shooting was uploaded to Facebook YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266859/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media-manipulation"&gt;The video and the manifesto were mirrored worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and re-uploaded to platforms repeatedly over the following days, often faster than platforms could take them down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keau0x"&gt;The report &lt;a href="https://christchurchattack.royalcommission.nz/the-report/firearms-licensing/general-life-in-new-zealand/"&gt;goes on to say&lt;/a&gt; that though the shooter frequented far-right message boards on 4chan and 8chan, the evidence shows a more substantial use of YouTube. The shooter also  modified his firearms before the attacks using YouTube tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h83SCS"&gt;The shooter also used his Facebook account to discuss Adolph Hitler’s &lt;em&gt;Mein Kampf, &lt;/em&gt;particularly the parts about propaganda that could draw in new extremists, in a group called The Lads Society Season Two. He often posted Islamophobic rhetoric in the group, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now use Waze on CarPlay’s home screen instead of flipping between apps while driving</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo showing CarPlay Dashboard with Waze showing directions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P1EO1ZuMtd6WBDDy3fg3DBYbs80=/0x0:2200x1467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68476259/20201208_Mitchell_Clark_Verge_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hlh2tm"&gt;If you use Waze and ever needed to take your eyes off the road to control your music alongside your maps, a new update is starting to roll out that should let you spend more time driving and less time fiddling with that touchscreen. &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; is reporting that &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/06/waze-carplay-dashboard-goes-live/"&gt;Waze has started rolling out&lt;/a&gt; Apple CarPlay Dashboard support, which will allow you to see directions on CarPlay’s home screen, alongside media controls, calendar events, and more. When I heard about it, I ran out to my car and sure enough, Waze’s directions showed up on the home screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of Apple CarPlay with Waze directions on the left half and top right of the screen, and media controls in the bottom left" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ovvaa1ZZonqS_DZccSkQ065K3gc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22153560/IMG_0241.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Waze directions and music controls, all on one screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cUVvUV"&gt;The company started beta testing the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591151/waze-carplay-split-view-dashboard-apple"&gt;late last month&lt;/a&gt;, but CarPlay Dashboard has been around for Apple Maps users since the launch of iOS 13 (though it’s only been open to third-party developers since iOS 13.4). The integration is a win for driving safety, as the golden rule for car UI is basically “look at and touch the screen as little as you possibly can.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwyfBf"&gt;Before this update, if you wanted to change the song that was playing, you’d have to go to the Music app, press the next button, then make your way back to Waze. That could be anywhere from 3 to 6 taps on the screen, depending on if Waze was in the app launcher on the side. That’s a lot, especially if you’re going 70 miles an hour. Now, you can have both Waze, the next turn you need to take, and the music controls on the same screen, and changing the song will only take one tap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cYiwL"&gt;In keeping with the safety theme, the update also includes lane guidance, a feature that lets you know in advance what lane you should be in for your next turn or freeway exit. This should help reduce those “I have to be four lanes over in a quarter mile” moments that trip me up on occasion. Happy (and safe) driving!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia will let all users livestream games directly to YouTube tomorrow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d0zhwxV8Jt91kcL208LFAOYm6Qg=/0x0:1475x983/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68475868/stadia.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jvALho"&gt;From the very beginning, Google Stadia and YouTube were supposed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18274184/google-stadia-youtube-streaming-future-gaming-cloud"&gt;to work together&lt;/a&gt; — thanks to the magic of cloud computing, you’d be able to click a YouTube ad to instantly begin playing a game, YouTubers would be able to invite their viewers to instantly join their game, and — perhaps most importantly — creators would be able to instantly, effortlessly be able to livestream their Stadia games to YouTube just by pressing a button on the controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKvmnJ"&gt;None of those things happened at Stadia’s launch last November, but the biggest one is apparently arriving tomorrow: every Stadia user will be able to livestream directly to YouTube starting tomorrow, a representative confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FX6kPM"&gt;This afternoon, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/07/stadia-youtube-streaming-rollout/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;noticed&lt;/a&gt; that the feature appeared to be rolling out, and we spotted the ability to link a YouTube account in our Stadia accounts as well — though not the ability to actually stream yet. I guess we’ll try that tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wyI6QqpcHzBw5rNHI0j_QeHPpEs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22153571/stream_to_youtube_stadia.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Zu9VPy"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll still have to give your stream a title and tweak a few settings, like whether your stream is appropriate for kids (to comply with children’s protection rules). It’s also not clear whether you’ll be able to stream in 4K quite yet, as Stadia originally promised. You’d also likely need a $9.99 a month Stadia Pro subscription for that, like you do for 4K gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uJJSt"&gt;The feature couldn’t come at a more important time for Stadia: the service’s most important game yet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is arriving this week, at a time when next-gen consoles and the latest graphics cards to build your own powerful PC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;are incredibly difficult and expensive to buy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575100/google-stadia-one-year-anniversary-cloud-gaming-cyberpunk-2077-launch-test"&gt;biggest test for Stadia yet&lt;/a&gt;, and one the company is banking on: buying &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk &lt;/em&gt;on the service comes with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/19/21572301/cyberpunk-2077-google-stadia-free-premiere-kit-preorder-deal"&gt;a full set of free Stadia hardware for a limited time&lt;/a&gt; — not unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558820/youtube-premium-subscribers-free-stadia-premiere-edition-bundle-deals"&gt;the set it gave free to YouTube Premium subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpFaHl"&gt;People streaming &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; from Stadia to YouTube could be the single biggest opportunity yet for Google to prove what its service can do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Second judge says Trump can’t ban TikTok </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1b0iBxG466TlEnGi73g_W59q89w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68474797/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gx9fDf"&gt;A federal judge has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F487297117%2FCase-1-20-cv-02658-CJN-Document-59-Filed-12-07-20&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F7%2F22160239%2Ftiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;granted a preliminary injunction&lt;/a&gt; that should keep the US Commerce Department from banning transactions with TikTok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BycUMg"&gt;The Trump administration issued an executive order &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21358505/trump-tiktok-wechat-tencent-bytedance-china-ban-executive-order-legal-sanctions-rules"&gt;on August 6th&lt;/a&gt; that would have blocked transactions between US companies and TikTok and WeChat’s Chinese parent companies, ByteDance and Tencent. Trump declared TikTok and WeChat a “national emergency,” citing privacy and security concerns. That order invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a law that allows Trump to ban transactions between the US and foreign entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LQVgoy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The government likely exceeded IEEPA’s express limitations.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n8lozD"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F487297119%2FCase-1-20-cv-02658-CJN-Document-60-Filed-12-07-20&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F7%2F22160239%2Ftiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in his opinion&lt;/a&gt; accompanying today’s decision, US district judge Carl Nichols said that “the government likely exceeded IEEPA’s express limitations.” He granted TikTok’s motion for a preliminary injunction against each item the Commerce Department was attempting to prohibit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3HpvQ"&gt;Nichols also previously granted a preliminary injunction on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/27/21458375/tiktok-judge-trump-china-ban-app-bytedance"&gt;September 27th&lt;/a&gt; that allowed people to continue downloading the app in the US. At that time, he didn’t rule on the Commerce Department’s other restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pj0xF3"&gt;A Pennsylvania federal judge had already effectively stopped TikTok from shutting down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21542641/tiktok-ban-commerce-department-blocked-november-12-influencers"&gt;on October 30th&lt;/a&gt;, in a ruling on a lawsuit brought by three TikTok creators. The Commerce Department had already conceded the matter last month, saying it wouldn’t enforce the shutdown order &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562947/tiktok-us-government-no-shutdown-china-trump-security"&gt;on November 12th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DluYYd"&gt;“We’re pleased that the court agreed with us and granted a preliminary injunction against all the prohibitions of the Executive Order,” a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement. “We’re focused on continuing to build TikTok as the home that 100 million Americans, including families and small businesses, rely upon for expression, connection, economic livelihood, and true joy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1bABR"&gt;“The court’s ruling is consistent with the nationwide preliminary injunction granted by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on October 30, 2020,” a Commerce Department spokesperson said in a statement. “The Department maintains that the E.O. is fully consistent with law and promotes legitimate national security interests. The Government will continue to comply with the injunctions and has taken immediate steps to do so, but intends to vigorously defend the E.O. and the Secretary’s implementation efforts from legal challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHLgaK"&gt;The Trump administration had set a December 4th deadline for ByteDance to sell or spin out TikTok’s business in the US, but the government said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22154801/us-government-tiktok-ban-deadline-bytedance-trump-administration-cfius"&gt;that day&lt;/a&gt; that it would not extend or enforce the deadline. President Trump has said he approves of a bid by Oracle and Walmart “in concept” that would create a US-based entity, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/19/21437850/president-trump-approves-oracle-tiktok-partnership-bytedance-china-ban"&gt;TikTok Global&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not clear how that would address some security risks, and the deal has not received final approval from China. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7ZjnLP"&gt;Eight months ago, Deborah Birx of the White House Coronavirus Task Force &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-dr-deborah-birx-discusses-coronavirus-on-face-the-nation-april-19-2020/"&gt;praised Florida’s COVID-19 dashboard&lt;/a&gt; as an example of “the kind of knowledge and power we need to put into the hands of the American people.” That dashboard was built by Rebekah Jones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwXwwE"&gt;But in May, Jones was fired by the Florida Department of Health for reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/29/884551391/florida-scientist-says-she-was-fired-for-not-manipulating-covid-19-data"&gt;refusing to manipulate that data to justify reopening the state&lt;/a&gt; — and now, Florida state police have raided her home and taken the equipment she was using to maintain a new, independent COVID-19 tracker of her own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUXgIo"&gt;Jones posted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeoRebekah/status/1336065787900145665"&gt;a series of tweets&lt;/a&gt; about the incident, including a video of police entering — with guns drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YjXZgx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;1/&lt;br&gt;There will be no update today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 8:30 am this morning, state police came into my house and took all my hardware and tech.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They were serving a warrant on my computer after DOH filed a complaint.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They pointed a gun in my face.  They pointed guns at my kids.. &lt;a href="https://t.co/DE2QfOmtPU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DE2QfOmtPU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rebekah Jones (@GeoRebekah) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeoRebekah/status/1336065787900145665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HnS2GZ"&gt;Florida’s Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article247680010.html"&gt;to the &lt;em&gt;Miami Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2020/12/07/agents-raid-home-fired-florida-data-scientist-who-built-covid-19-dashboard-rebekah-jones/6482817002/"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Tallahassee Democrat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that police had a search warrant and had seized her equipment. Here’s the department’s full statement as provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Txnc2f"&gt;“This morning FDLE served a search warrant at a residence on Centerville Court in Tallahassee, the home of Rebekah Jones. FDLE began an investigation November 10, 2020 after receiving a complaint from the Department of Health regarding unauthorized access to a Department of Health messaging system which is part of an emergency alert system, to be used for emergencies only. Agents believe someone at the residence on Centerville Court illegally accessed the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SiBuLx"&gt;When agents arrived, they knocked on the door and called Ms. Jones in an attempt to minimize disruption to the family. Ms. Jones refused to come to the door for 20 minutes and hung-up on agents. After several attempts and verbal notifications that law enforcement officers were there to serve a legal search warrant, Ms. Jones eventually came to the door and allowed agents to enter.  Ms. Jones family was upstairs when agents made entry into the home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="isKyMx"&gt;As the &lt;em&gt;Tampa Bay Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2020/11/27/floridas-emergency-communications-channel-hacked-according-to-state-officials/"&gt;reported last month&lt;/a&gt;, someone mysteriously sent an unauthorized message to the state’s emergency public health and medical coordination team, reading “speak up before another 17,000 people are dead. You know this is wrong. You don’t have to be a part of this. Be a hero. Speak out before it’s too late.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lL9ZCf"&gt;According to an affidavit provided to us by the FDLE, law enforcement believes that Jones or someone at her address was the one who sent it. We’re not publishing the affidavit because it contains lots of personally identifying information, but the FDLE claims the message was sent from a Comcast IP associated with her home address and email address, and the affidavit asks permission to seize and search all computer equipment police might find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ivIi6Z"&gt;While there was a suggestion last month that the system might have been hacked, it apparently didn’t have particularly strong security anyhow: the affidavit says all of the registered users shared the same username and password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZMdGD"&gt;Jones didn’t comment when we asked, but on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeoRebekah/status/1336081235907637255"&gt;she says&lt;/a&gt; she’s getting a new computer and will continue to update her new website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NT73MJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If Desantis thought pointing a gun in my face was a good way to get me to shut up, he's about to learn just how wrong he was. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'll have a new computer tomorrow. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then I'm going to get back to work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want to help, my website is still at &lt;a href="https://t.co/JbQtrVbRuv"&gt;https://t.co/JbQtrVbRuv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rebekah Jones (@GeoRebekah) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeoRebekah/status/1336081235907637255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 vaccine monitoring program may be at risk of false reports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SroJ7n"&gt;A text-messaging program to monitor any side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine may be open to manipulation, &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/07/v-safe-tool-covid-vaccine-side-effects/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Experts worry that the newly-developed system focuses more on ease of use than security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxcaDH"&gt;The program, called v-safe, is being developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to check in with people after they’ve received a COVID-19 vaccine. After getting a shot, they’ll be given a piece of paper with a QR code, which lets them sign up to receive texts. The texts will direct them to online surveys that ask questions about any symptoms someone experienced after receiving the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ebx9WX"&gt;Other vaccine safety monitoring systems that have been in place for decades, including the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), will also be used to follow COVID-19 vaccine recipients. Those are passive systems, and rely on patients or doctors reaching out to make a report. V-safe is intended as an early, active way to understand people’s experience with the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVgS7o"&gt;“It’s going to start collecting data immediately on day zero, and collects data out to 12 months after the second vaccination,” said Tom Shimabukuro, a member of the Vaccine Safety Team on the CDC’s COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force, during the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/COVID-04-Shimabukuro.pdf"&gt;meeting last week&lt;/a&gt;. Any serious side effects reported through v-safe could trigger a follow-up call from experts in the call center at VAERS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="clPpUV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fliers with the codes could be misplaced or left at a vaccination site&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uCNJh3"&gt;Asking people to access the system through a QR code, though, may leave it vulnerable. Fliers with the codes could be misplaced or left at a vaccination site, and QR codes could be posted online. Anyone picking up that sheet of paper or finding the code could register and submit false responses to the system, unnamed officials told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post. &lt;/em&gt;The anti-vaccine movement organizes online, and officials worry those groups could flood the system. Verification of concerning reports would be time consuming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zb5TWQ"&gt;In a statement to the &lt;em&gt;Post, &lt;/em&gt;the CDC said the system, “is in the final stage of development, which includes security testing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcnJ3l"&gt;The simplicity of the program has benefits, and unlike other vaccine safety reporting systems, could collect information from people who don’t directly seek medical care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gShTpG"&gt;“With any widely available technology, there’s an opportunity for people to use spoofing and other nefarious techniques,” said Ed Simcox, former chief technology officer at the Department of Health and Human Services, according to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. “That would undermine what is so potentially valuable about this system — going directly to patients, or citizens, to get their feedback about multiple vaccines administered in diverse settings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2K51hH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Google’s COVID contact tracing tech is finally coming to their home state of California</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KgYcPpAYyppTXI5dXs4jNWVGPyU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68473379/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qQmGdz"&gt;After a month of testing on university campuses, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1336006920923013122"&gt;California’s governor just announced&lt;/a&gt; that the state is launching its &lt;a href="https://canotify.ca.gov/"&gt;COVID contact tracing app&lt;/a&gt; to the public this Thursday, December 10th. The app is called CA Notify, and its launch makes California &lt;a href="https://www.komando.com/coronavirus/states-with-contact-tracing-apps/758717/"&gt;the 18th state&lt;/a&gt; (plus Washington, DC) to release a contact tracing app. It’s also the largest to have done so since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216484/google-apple-coronavirus-contract-tracing-bluetooth-location-tracking-data-app"&gt;technology was announced&lt;/a&gt; in April. The first app of its kind was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355500/virginia-apple-google-contact-tracing-app-covid-alabama"&gt;released in Virginia&lt;/a&gt; back in August, so it’s been quite a long time coming, especially considering California is home to Apple and Google, the two companies that developed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216484/google-apple-coronavirus-contract-tracing-bluetooth-location-tracking-data-app"&gt;contact tracing technology&lt;/a&gt; the app uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSNLgb"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai have tweeted in support of the app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dOJSYC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As we work together to fight the rise in cases in California, exposure notifications will help slow the spread of COVID-19 and put our neighbors’ health first. Thank you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GavinNewsom&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Google?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Google&lt;/a&gt; for helping bring CA Notify to Californians while putting privacy at the very center. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LbsBQn6zCD"&gt;https://t.co/LbsBQn6zCD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1336026658201997318?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Z33EIl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;California is facing one of its biggest challenges yet in its fight against COVID-19. CA Notify with the exposure notification technology we developed with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; will be a helpful tool as we work together to slow the spread. Thank you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GavinNewsom&lt;/a&gt; for your leadership. &lt;a href="https://t.co/mnAJBdL1bb"&gt;https://t.co/mnAJBdL1bb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1336010297883066368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1gfRhj"&gt;The app uses the contact tracing API that was added to iOS and Android back in May, and it requires an iPhone with iOS 14.2 or a phone running Android 6.0 or above with Bluetooth Low Energy. Basically, your phone will automatically exchange a private key with another phone if they’re within Bluetooth range. (The key doesn’t contain location or any personally identifying information.) When someone tests positive, they can press a button to send a notification to every other person using the app whose phone virtually bumped into theirs, letting them know that they should get tested and quarantine. If you’re concerned about privacy, it’s worth noting that the exposure notification won’t include any information about who exposed whom or when and where it happened. It will only say that you’ve been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7K8rN"&gt;If you have an Android phone, the CA Notify app will be available on December 10th for download on the Google Play Store. California’s site &lt;a href="https://canotify.ca.gov/#section4"&gt;has a guide&lt;/a&gt; for iPhone users, but it’s pretty simple: go to the Settings app then to Exposure Notifications. Tapping “Turn on Exposure Notifications” will let you select California as your region and turn on the tracing. (iPhone owners won’t need a separate app.) It also seems like iPhone users will be able to turn it on before the official launch, as shown in the tweet bellow. I’ve tested it, and it does let you add it, but warns you that “you will not be able to share a COVID-19 Diagnosis with other users until CA Notify is fully enabled statewide”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Iypq5x"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;br&gt;If you live in California, and have an iPhone running iOS 14.2 or newer, you can turn on Exposure notifications ahead of the official launch this Thursday. &lt;br&gt;   &lt;a href="https://t.co/zsMA1w2Af5"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zsMA1w2Af5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ericjboyd (@ericjboyd) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericjboyd/status/1336045941288095745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vZeafs"&gt;Since California is home to the tech companies behind the tracing technology, I’m hoping we’ll see a high rate of adoption. It’s just unfortunate that it’s taken seemingly tech-forward states like California (which is currently seeing a spike in cases) this long to roll out the app. Washington state, the home of Microsoft and Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/more-than-1-million-sign-up-for-covid-19-exposure-app-in-washington-state/281-45e39f68-2663-49f4-a8e9-ef0ac8398a6d"&gt;just rolled out its app last week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzRO87"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 7th, 5:50PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added tweet showing how you can turn on exposure notifications early on iOS if you live in California.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6GFtx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s new Blade 15 Base model is just $1,499</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Razer Blade 15 Base sits on a stand on a table with a pair of headphones and a mouse." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/leQolvdkLYpUJeJk_sX0lHli2q0=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68473475/Razer_Blade_15_Base_Model___GTX_1660_Ti__Late_2020__Setup.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sUVaxL"&gt;Razer’s Blade 15 is one of the best 15-inch gaming laptops. It’s far from a budget purchase, but Razer has released the most affordable model you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4qnBu"&gt;As of today, there’s a new &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-03519E11-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Blade 15 Base&lt;/a&gt; model up for preorder that is just $1,499. It’ll ship on December 25th. The model includes a Core i7-10750H, 15.6-inch 120Hz screen, GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of SSD storage, plus an open M.2 slot. For ports, you’ll get two USB 3.2 Gen 2, two USB-C 3.2 Gen 1, and an HDMI 2.0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfMdD4"&gt;Note: these are almost the exact same specs as the $1,599 Blade 15 Base that you can already buy. The biggest difference is that more expensive model has a 144Hz display. As of this writing, that model is on sale for &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-03289E21-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,499&lt;/a&gt; on Razer’s website. That means there’s little reason to preorder the upcoming Base model when you can get a better screen right now for the same amount of money. (Both of those prices will likely change down the line.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uWZMnNurDUy_p2ZtqZCUzfTzpkY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22151755/Razer_Blade_15_Base_Model_GTX_1660_Ti__Late__2020__01.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;aside id="vPwpsI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Razer’s Blade 15 Advanced review: runs fast, runs hot","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pKR4gF"&gt;Another thing to note is the storage. Let’s face it, 256GB is not a lot of storage for a gaming laptop. You won’t be able to fit a ton of titles on there. The expandable storage means the 256GB is more forgivable, but you’ll still need to go through the hassle of buying an additional drive if you plan to upgrade. Alternatively, a Blade 15 Base with a 512GB SSD is currently on sale for &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-03286E22-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,599 on Razer’s website&lt;/a&gt;, which is only $100 more than the base model. As long as it stays at that price, it’s certainly better value. (You’ll also get the 144Hz screen, as well as a GeForce RTX 2060, and you can buy the model right now rather than having to preorder.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bw8EJ1"&gt;But if $1,499 really hits the sweet spot for you, and you’ve missed the sale on the 144Hz model, you can preorder the &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-03519E11-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new Blade 15 Base model&lt;/a&gt; on Razer’s website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comcast extends offer of free Wi-Fi hotspots through June 30th, 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="comcast" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9yul-6KM4eWRpUy39cofQPGInG0=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68473280/comcast.1419979278.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MLxDP6"&gt;Comcast is extending its COVID-19 support programs &lt;a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/covid-support-extended"&gt;through June 30th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, including free access to public Wi-Fi hotspots and discounts on internet service plans. The company says this is the third time it has extended its programs during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ka57rH"&gt;Comcast’s Internet Essentials plan for low-income households is currently free for the first 60 days for new subscribers. With this extension that offer will be available through June 2021. Additionally, access to free Xfinity WiFi hotspots will be extended as well, regardless if you’re a Xfinity subscriber or not. Comcast’s “Lift Zones” — its name for local community centers wired with Comcast internet — are also continuing as an ongoing project. Lift Zones are meant to reach low-income students who might have inconsistent internet access at home. Switching to remote learning or a combination of in-person and online instruction has made internet access critical for students, so having a place to log on that’s theoretically close to home helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u5wXPV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Switching to remote learning has made internet access critical for students&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="34RGdj"&gt;Comcast isn’t alone in offering discounts during the pandemic. AT&amp;amp;T’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Finternet%2Faccess%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F7%2F22158985%2Fcomcast-free-wifi-internet-extension-2021-low-income-students#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Access from AT&amp;amp;T” program&lt;/a&gt;, which offers discounted internet service for families that participate in certain government assistance programs, was expanded to include families that meet a basic income eligibility during the pandemic. AT&amp;amp;T is also waiving data overage fees for all of its home internet plans, though both changes are currently slated to end on December 31st, 2020. Verizon’s offerings are slightly different. The company has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2Fupdate-verizon-serve-customers-covid-19&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F7%2F22158985%2Fcomcast-free-wifi-internet-extension-2021-low-income-students#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a $20 discount on monthly payments for new Fios subscribers&lt;/a&gt; who qualify for the Federal Communications Commission’s low-income Lifeline discount program, along with 60 days of free router rentals. Sign-ups are accepted through the end of 2020, and customers can keep the discount as long as they qualify, according to Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbPbhP"&gt;All three companies signed on to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21178451/fcc-coronavirus-keep-americans-connected-pledge-att-comcast-charter-att"&gt;“Keep Americans Connected” pledge&lt;/a&gt; created by the FCC in March when the main focus at the time was not terminating internet service for 60 days, whether or not customers were able to pay their bills. Those 60 days have long been up, and despite the pandemic continuing to infect wide swaths of the country, there’s currently no equally expansive measure to protect customers. AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast are all offering ways to maintain your connection — but not without subscribers taking action first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDBX2L"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: A previous version of this article suggested that “Lift Zones” were also being extended through June 30th, 2021. Lift Zones are an ongoing project with no end date. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC awards SpaceX $886 million for satellite internet network</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Spectators watch from Canaveral National Seashore as a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying 60 Starlink satellites launches from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center on October 6, 2020 in Cape Canaveral, Florida.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SzNvoC"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-368588A1.pdf"&gt;announced $9.2 billion in awards&lt;/a&gt; to companies providing broadband internet to rural areas across the US, and Elon Musk’s SpaceX was one of the biggest winners. The company will receive $886 million over the next 10 years for its Starlink satellite broadband project, under the Federal Communication Commission’s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaVfWg"&gt;Starlink is SpaceX’s constellation of satellites that will fly at low altitudes around the Earth, providing internet on the ground below. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317082/spacex-falcon-9-starlink-blacksky-rideshare-launch-time-visor-watch-live"&gt;SpaceX already has launched&lt;/a&gt; 900 of the planned 12,000 satellites needed for the Starlink system into low-Earth orbit. Musk has said the company needs 800 satellites in space to provide “significant operational capabilities.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536073/spacex-starlink-public-beta-testing-email-user-terminal"&gt;SpaceX kicked off its Better Than Nothing Beta&lt;/a&gt; for Starlink broadband in October after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325413/spacex-starlink-user-terminals-antennas-internet-satellite-constellation-beta-testing"&gt;introducing a private beta&lt;/a&gt; over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99Pj40"&gt;Other big winners in the FCC auction included LTD Broadband, which will get  $1.3 billion; Charter Communications, which will receive $1.2 billion; and the Rural Electric Cooperative Consortium, which is getting $1.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BjxEg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21117306/iowa-caucus-rural-broadband-access-election-campaign-sanders-warren"&gt;Between 24 and 163 million people&lt;/a&gt; lack broadband internet access in the US, and the problem is especially acute in rural areas. The incoming &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/20/biden-congress-broadband-internet/"&gt;Biden administration is expected to increase&lt;/a&gt; federal broadband spending in 2021 to bridge the so-called “digital divide.” &lt;/p&gt;
