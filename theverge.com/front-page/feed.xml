    <title>Apple defends upcoming privacy changes as ‘standing up for our users’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i2gU3K"&gt;Apple has responded to Facebook’s critiques of its upcoming privacy changes by saying that is “standing up for our users,” in a statement shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Facebook has been criticizing the company ahead of a future iOS update that will require users to give their permission for apps to collect data about them. Facebook took out full-page newspaper ads today &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;attacking Apple&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that the changes will “limit businesses’ ability to run personalized ads and reach their customers effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rW1vJL"&gt;Here is Apple’s full statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="4s8wWG"&gt;We believe that this is a simple matter of standing up for our users. Users should know when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites — and they should have the choice to allow that or not. App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14 does not require Facebook to change its approach to tracking users and creating targeted advertising, it simply requires they give users a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tshaoY"&gt;Apple’s statement comes as Facebook reportedly plans to run another anti-Apple ad on Friday, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnPaczkowski/status/1339375939369615360"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; editor John Paczkowski&lt;/a&gt;. This new ad will reportedly claim that Apple’s software update will “change the internet as we know it for the worse” because places like blogs and cooking sites will have to charge for subscriptions or in-app purchases instead of running personalized ads that would allow them to offer content for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sYx9Lw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Facebook?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Facebook&lt;/a&gt; plans to run a second anti-Apple ad tomorrow. This one will claim &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; is trying to stop the internet from being free. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here’s some draft text: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Spzx1rwJSc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Spzx1rwJSc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— John Paczkowski (@JohnPaczkowski) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnPaczkowski/status/1339375939369615360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GJ5myY"&gt;Apps won’t be required to ask for users’ permission until &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;sometime early next year&lt;/a&gt;. The change has already been delayed once — it was originally supposed to kick in with the release of iOS 14 this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flCVEL"&gt;The spat between the two companies comes on the heels of Apple adding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;new App Store privacy labels&lt;/a&gt; that spell out how iOS apps use your data. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hilary Duff says the Lizzie McGuire Disney Plus series is officially dead</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yOFqhDRvPwgQopkwvyfYuQGjp6c=/74x0:649x383/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68526670/lizzie_mcguire_lizzie_and_gordo_photo_e1574211145930.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LBhTYK"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Lizzie McGuire&lt;/em&gt; Disney Plus series is officially dead, according to an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CI3x83hDMYt/"&gt;Instagram post&lt;/a&gt; from Hilary Duff. The series was reportedly going to feature an adult Duff reprising her role as Lizzie in her 30s, navigating a career in New York, and dealing with more “adult” themes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3Rlvz"&gt;“It’s been an honor to have Lizzie in my life,” Duff wrote. “I know the efforts and conversations have been everywhere trying to make work, but sadly and despite everyone’s best efforts [the reboot] isn’t going to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UQkpar"&gt;The new &lt;em&gt;Lizzie McGuire&lt;/em&gt; series’ original showrunner Terri Minsky was fired by Disney over “differences” in creative direction only two episodes into production, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/lizzie-mcguire-disney-plus-showrunner-1203462382/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Following Minsky’s removal, work on the show was halted completely in January 2020, with the future of it unknown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3pE4d"&gt;Disney has taken steps in the past to maintain Disney Plus’ family friendly image, even going as far as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220576/splash-tom-hanks-disney-plus-butt-cgi-hair-streaming-physical-digital"&gt;censoring a nude butt in the film &lt;em&gt;Splash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company has placed movies and shows that it considers “adult” on Hulu. For instance, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152428/love-simon-spinoff-hulu-disney-plus-xmen-simpsons-streaming"&gt;it moved &lt;em&gt;Love, Victor&lt;/em&gt; to the service&lt;/a&gt; from Disney Plus for featuring alcohol use and sexual exploration. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/28/21158617/hilary-duff-wants-lizzie-mcguire-on-hulu-not-disney-plus"&gt;Duff publicly asked Disney&lt;/a&gt; to consider moving her show as well, but no change ever came, and Duff’s announcement has sealed &lt;em&gt;Lizzie McGuire&lt;/em&gt;’s fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAlDg4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vmD6gA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R0KWId"&gt;Twitter will no longer automatically show the quote tweet prompt when you try to retweet something starting on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1339350334162890753"&gt;the company announced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZhvcw"&gt;The change to the way retweets worked was first implemented &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21509439/twitter-election-trump-quote-tweet-labels-rules-election"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the 2020 US presidential election. Twitter’s aim with the change was to encourage people to tweet and amplify information more thoughtfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCz77h"&gt;“We don’t believe that this happened, in practice,” Twitter said in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1339350334162890753"&gt;a series of tweets&lt;/a&gt;. “The use of Quote Tweets increased, but 45 percent of them included single-word affirmations and 70 percent had less than 25 characters.” Twitter also saw a 20 percent decrease in retweets and quote tweets while the automatic quote tweet prompt was in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uqNu7L"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The increase in Quote Tweets was also offset by an overall 20% decrease in sharing through both Retweets and Quote Tweets. Considering this, we'll no longer prompt Quote Tweets from the Retweet icon. For more details: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Were7yWdOz"&gt;https://t.co/Were7yWdOz&lt;/a&gt; (3/4)&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1339350336184541184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NqqXZH"&gt;While the changes to retweets were in place, you didn’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to write anything in the quote tweet prompt that appeared. Leaving the prompt blank and hitting the retweet button in the prompt would share that tweet to your followers with no context from you. But apparently, the change to retweets didn’t exactly accomplish what Twitter wanted, so the company is changing how retweets work back to the way they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom is lifting its 40-minute meeting limit for several upcoming holidays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M3ENwNELmbGFDRwDniQeoOXlTuo=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68526416/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DYBFah"&gt;Zoom will be lifting its 40-minute meeting limit for free accounts globally in recognition of several upcoming holidays, the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The limits will &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-together/"&gt;be removed&lt;/a&gt; in recognition of Hanukkah, Christmas Eve, Christmas, New Year’s Eve, New Year’s Day, and Kwanzaa. The company similarly lifted its 40-minute limit last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564310/zoom-40-minute-time-limit-thanksgiving-restriction-lifted-temporary"&gt;for Thanksgiving Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDx2vK"&gt;Here’s exactly when Zoom will be removing the 40-minute limit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6sadZX"&gt;10AM ET Thursday, December 17th, to 6AM ET Saturday, December 19th, for the end of Hanukkah&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QHQQDC"&gt;10AM ET Wednesday, December 23rd, to 6AM ET Saturday, December 26th, for Christmas Eve and Christmas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hrZ2Lt"&gt;10AM ET on Wednesday, December 30th, to 6AM ET on Saturday, January 2nd, for New Year’s Eve, New Year’s Day, and the end of Kwanzaa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Hzqzjk"&gt;Normally, meetings with three or more people hosted on Zoom’s free tier can’t last longer than 40 minutes. If you wanted to talk longer, you’d have to go through the hassle of starting another meeting and getting everyone to join again. By removing the limit for these holidays, hopefully virtual meetups with friends and family can be less focused on the clock and more on catching up with loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PpWEy"&gt;If you prefer to use Google Meet to connect with family and friends, that’s an option, too, as Google is letting free users host calls that last for up to 24 hours &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494189/google-meet-limit-calls-minutes-march-2021"&gt;through March 31st, 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google acquires Neverware, a company that turns old PCs into Chromebooks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Chromebooks 2020: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lq0RXPCU0qoaoS5ivSXeslciQko=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68525840/mchin_181029_4126_0006.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZSw8JL"&gt;Today, Neverware &lt;a href="https://cloudreadykb.neverware.com/s/article/Neverware-is-now-part-of-Google-FAQ"&gt;announced in an FAQ&lt;/a&gt; that it’s now part of Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFgilf"&gt;Neverware, based in New York City, makes a software application called CloudReady that allows you to convert a PC into a system that runs Chrome OS. In its FAQ, Neverware states that it and its CloudReady software are “officially part of Google and the Chrome OS team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JcdbJC"&gt;CloudReady offers a free version for personal use, as well as paid tiers for enterprise and education. The idea is that companies and schools (as well as individuals) can convert old, slow systems into Chromebooks rather than throwing them out — Chrome OS is a less demanding operating system for these machines to run than Windows 10 is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZVs9U"&gt;According to Neverware’s FAQ, not much is going to change for current CloudReady customers in the near future. The company’s website, forums, customer support, and admin portal will continue to function as usual, though it seems that they’ll eventually migrate over to Google’s services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p18zbV"&gt;As the &lt;a href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/google-acquires-neverware-cloudready-chrome-os-chromebooks/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;About Chromebooks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; site notes, some of the software that Neverware makes could help Google continue to push Chrome OS updates to older devices, extending the time frame in which some Chromebooks can receive the latest software. (Google hasn’t said anything of the sort, so that’s just hopeful speculation for now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWvcow"&gt;Google and Neverware are well acquainted — Google led an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/11/16455490/google-invest-neverware-chromebooks-refurbish"&gt;investment round&lt;/a&gt; in the startup back in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Massachusetts governor won’t sign facial recognition ban</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EcjhZVueXpOjD6WAIiHZH9E0cWI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68525691/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EIUyre"&gt;Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker has refused to sign a law banning most government use of facial recognition. &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/12/10/metro/baker-sends-police-bill-back-legislature-asking-changes/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last week that Baker sent an omnibus police reform bill back to state lawmakers, asking for changes that included striking the facial recognition rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRC0cT"&gt;Massachusetts legislators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22094902/massachusetts-facial-recognition-ban-bill-vote-passed-police-reform"&gt;passed the first&lt;/a&gt; major state-level facial recognition ban, following a model set by individual cities like Boston and San Francisco. &lt;a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/S2963?=11302020"&gt;The bill&lt;/a&gt; says public agencies, including police departments, can’t use or acquire biometric surveillance systems. It makes exceptions for running facial recognition searches against a motor vehicles registration database, as long as police obtain a warrant or demonstrate “immediate danger” that requires a search. It would help fill a gap left by federal lawmakers, who haven’t passed a nationwide framework for using potentially invasive facial recognition technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUVmub"&gt;But in a letter to lawmakers, Baker said the reform package “ignores the important role [facial recognition] can play in solving crime.” His office told the &lt;em&gt;Globe&lt;/em&gt; that he plans to veto the bill if lawmakers don’t make changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4h1XbG"&gt;Facial recognition is just one facet of the sweeping bill, which aims to reform police tactics, training, and accountability. The package would create a new oversight commission to investigate misconduct and potentially revoke officers’ licenses, and it would restrict the use of chokeholds, rubber bullets, and tear gas. In addition to the facial recognition ban, &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2020/12/10/heres-what-charlie-baker-wants-changed-in-the-police-reform-bill"&gt;Baker objected&lt;/a&gt; to policies like shifting police training oversight to a civilian-led committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="12zflY"&gt;The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts urged lawmakers to reject the proposed changes. “Governor Baker rejected a crucial due process provision that would protect Massachusetts residents from unregulated police use of face surveillance technology, which has been proven to unfairly target Black and brown people, leading to the arrest of innocent people. Unchecked police use of surveillance technology also harms everyone’s rights to anonymity, privacy, and free speech,” said executive director Carol Rose.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now watch HBO Max on your PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A PlayStation 5 in front of a TV showing HBO Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i_0VDitIy-PluZd9L1mD4RNDtqM=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68525502/DSCF1971.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3VFbSb"&gt;Sony on Wednesday announced that HBO Max is finally available for its next-gen console. Support for the app, revealed in a tweet from the official PlayStation account, should be great news if you managed to get a PS5 and were planning to use it as an entertainment hub for movies in addition to games, as HBO Max was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528372/ps5-streaming-apps-support-day-one-netflix-disney-plus-twitch"&gt;last major streaming service&lt;/a&gt; absent from the console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtqeaT"&gt;If you’re still on the PS4, this update likely won’t mean much to you, as that device has had the app for a while now. But it does mean any PlayStation fans should now be able to watch &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;, which will be available in 4K HDR for PS5 owners with supported TVs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;and other Warner Bros. movies&lt;/a&gt; coming out next year on HBO’s new streaming service. (Xbox Series X / S owners have had access to the app since the consoles launched.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v87Z1s"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Settle in with the biggest movies and TV series — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbomax?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@HBOMax&lt;/a&gt; is available now on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PS5?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PS5&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/EYBzSZdJrL"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EYBzSZdJrL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PlayStation (@PlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1339265875518451717?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jI3WwP"&gt;When I went to download HBO Max on my PS5, it told me the app was only available for PS4, but a quick reboot made it available to download. If you want to download it as well, you can go to the media tab on the PS5’s home screen and scroll down to the All Apps section. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKS1R2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 16th, 4:47 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Removed a line about the app only being available in the US, as HBO Max as a service is only available in the US.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is finally coming to Roku </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v55zOM-iA-FZm6b1Z93IuaG04s4=/31x0:1576x1030/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68525627/Screen_Shot_2020_11_19_at_11.17.04_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tJvSVY"&gt;One of the biggest hurdles facing &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=1&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=verge"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; is no longer a problem: the streaming service will finally be coming to Roku devices, starting December 17th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLgDIw"&gt;The move comes just after after WarnerMedia announced that it will simultaneously release its 2021 movies on HBO Max the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;same day they debut in theaters&lt;/a&gt;. The move follows &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21504152/wonder-woman-1984-release-delay-new-date-warner-bros-disney-black-widow-dune-tenet"&gt;debuting on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; the same day as its released in theaters on December 25th. &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;and many of Warner Bros.’ 2021 slate&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;are the types of movies that will drive subscribers to HBO Max, so it’s a win-win for both parties to have a deal by then. Roku can reap some of the reward from those signups, and HBO Max is now available to tens of millions of people who use Roku devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S73ujb"&gt;Once available, Roku users will be able to simply install the HBO Max channel on their devices, just like any other streaming application. Customers who already have the HBO app installed will be automatically updated to the HBO Max app, too. HBO Max on Roku will also work with Roku Pay, meaning that you’ll be able to subscribe for the service directly through a Roku account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cONTwU"&gt;With approximately 46 million active accounts on Roku, it’s important for WarnerMedia to have HBO Max available to as many of those customers as possible. HBO Max hasn’t been available on Roku since the streaming service launched at the end of May, and WarnerMedia recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569441/hbo-max-amazon-fire-tv-tablets-roku-prime-video-channel-membership"&gt;made an agreement with Amazon&lt;/a&gt; so Fire TV and Fire tablet users could access the app. HBO Max has just over 12 million active subscribers — and while executives publicly state they’re happy with HBO Max’s performance, competitors like Netflix and Disney Plus are growing at faster rates. Disney Plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165579/disney-plus-86-million-subscribers-netflix-hbo-max-streaming"&gt;amassed nearly 87 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; in just a little over a year; HBO Max can’t even convince current HBO subscribers to upgrade for no additional cost to Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2JMq2u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Roku’s 46 million accounts will now be able to subscribe to HBO Max&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QXF0Am"&gt;Roku and Amazon make up a combined 33 percent market share for people who stream entertainment, according to Parks Associates. Not being on those platforms has likely played a role in HBO Max’s less-than-stellar subscriber numbers over the last several months. Considering that HBO has more than 35 million subscribers in the United States, and all of those subscribers can sign up for Max for free, WarnerMedia has only activated 12.7 million customers. Not great! Up until now, Roku and WarnerMedia have been in a long-standing reverse carriage dispute — something traditional television has dealt with for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6w7BIO"&gt;Think of it like this: cable operators pay television networks to carry their channels. If they want content, cable operators have to pay for it. When distribution arguments arise, these become carriage disputes. Consumers know these situations as blackouts. Suddenly, a channel that was once available is no longer. Essentially, one party holds out from distributing until an agreement is reached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBSMKM"&gt;Streaming hubs like Roku want new players like WarnerMedia (when it comes to HBO Max) &lt;em&gt;to pay them&lt;/em&gt;. The same result happens: negotiations are held until it’s resolved — it’s essentially a reversed carriage dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obKwpa"&gt;The bottom line is WarnerMedia needs Roku to reach the tens of millions of people who use that as a primary entertainment source. Roku would like to give HBO Max to its customers so they spend more time in that overall ecosystem. A deal was inevitable, but not having Roku as a partner the second HBO Max went live, leading to mass confusion, didn’t help. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Canadian astronaut will fly around the Moon on the first crewed mission of NASA’s new rocket</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W-4JZbqx3oCXBj60MKcoQB76E8A=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68525620/maf_20200108_artemis_roll_out_dn_5673_0__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vKW5Xq"&gt;One of Canada’s astronauts will be sent around the Moon as part of a partnership between NASA and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-canadian-space-agency-formalize-gateway-partnership-for-artemis-program/"&gt;NASA announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The two organizations have formally agreed to collaborate on building a lunar space station called the Lunar Gateway. The Gateway is just one part of NASA’s larger Artemis program, which is focused on landing a woman on the Moon by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WK8tI9"&gt;A Canadian astronaut will participate in NASA’s planned Artemis II mission, and the CSA also has a seat on a future flight to the Gateway once it is complete. By joining the Artemis II mission, Canada will become the second country to have an astronaut fly around the Moon, the CSA says. Canada currently has &lt;a href="https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/astronauts/canadian/active/default.asp"&gt;just four active astronauts&lt;/a&gt;, and the CSA has not announced which will be participating in this partnership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBstln"&gt;Artemis I is the uncrewed test of NASA’s new rocket, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/overview.html"&gt;the Space Launch System (SLS)&lt;/a&gt;, and its Orion capsule. Artemis II will be the first flight of the system with people on board, and during its 10-day mission, the crew will test the spacecraft’s systems on a trip that will take them &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-first-flight-with-crew-important-step-on-long-term-return-to-the-moon-missions-to"&gt;4,600 miles past the far side of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;. Actually landing on the Moon is planned for the next mission, Artemis III.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vi8vi7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sRSNeGXTj6Q?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sOnDbZ"&gt;Along with crew, the partnership signed today says that the CSA will provide &lt;a href="https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/canadarm3/about.asp"&gt;external robotics assistance for the Gateway, including the construction of Canadarm3&lt;/a&gt;, an autonomous robotics system with multiple arms and detachable tools. Canadarm3 will inspect and repair the outside of the Gateway, catch visiting vehicles, and relocate modules of the Gateway as it orbits the Moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nj8RYZ"&gt;Building and maintaining the Gateway is a critical step in NASA’s plan to create a long-term foothold on the Moon. The Gateway is intended as a research station and rest stop for longer missions to the Moon and into deep space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MiXrL3"&gt;Whether NASA can meet its ambitious goal of landing people on the Moon in 2024 remains to be seen. NASA has struggled with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173176/nasa-space-launch-system-inspector-general-audit-over-budget-schedule"&gt;budgeting issues in building the SLS&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726753/nasa-orion-crew-capsule-power-unit-failure-artemis-i"&gt;component failure in the Orion capsule&lt;/a&gt; it’s supposed to carry. Despite the concern, NASA says it will still be able to launch the Artemis I mission in November 2021. Artemis II, with its new Canadian crew member in tow, is planned for 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch bans ‘simp’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fsnLHkzJPBF0_93ILPdQ6A3z_Mg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68525493/acastro_200901_1777_twitch_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B02KAQ"&gt;Twitch will no longer allow streamers and commenters to go around calling one another “simps.” The term — a recent favorite in the Twitch community that nominally refers to men who seem desperate for a woman’s attention — will be banned when used as an insult under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165342/twitch-hateful-conduct-harassment-policy-update"&gt;Twitch’s upcoming revamp of its harassment policy&lt;/a&gt;. “Incel” and “virgin” will be banned as insults, too, Twitch COO Sara Clemens said during a live-streamed town hall this afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a18Nyy"&gt;The new policy, first spotted by esports consultant &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1339312480057782273"&gt;Rod Breslau&lt;/a&gt;, will go into effect on January 22nd. It also includes stricter rules around sexual harassment and seems to give Twitch more leeway to ban streamers and commenters who make offensive comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Fq7VeV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitch is also rejecting emotes that include “simp”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BeE5XR"&gt;The policy overhaul comes after Twitch was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303185/twitch-sexual-harassment-assault-permanent-bans-streamers"&gt;inundated with reports of sexual harassment within its community&lt;/a&gt; and complaints that the company had ignored the issue for years. Twitch said in June that it was “committed to continuing our efforts to make Twitch a safer environment” and that a review of its hateful conduct and harassment policies was underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVlRW1"&gt;“Simp” is being banned under a portion of the revamped policy that prohibits derogatory statements about another person’s perceived sexual preferences. “And that does include negatively targeting another person with sexually focused terms,” Clemens said. Twitch is also “proactively denying” emotes that include all three of these terms as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mgFk5T"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=NastyFragileTomatoSeemsGood&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hBOc5f"&gt;The words “simp,” “incel,” and “virgin” will not be banned in all situations. Twitch will only take action when they’re used for harassment — but, typically, that’s how these terms come up on Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqpu9l"&gt;“We will take action against the use of terms like ‘simp,’ ‘incel’ or ‘virgin’ specifically when they are being used to negatively refer to another person’s sexual practices. Using these terms on their own wouldn’t lead to an enforcement but we would take action if they were used repeatedly in a harassing manner,” a Twitch spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgGXFO"&gt;Twitch’s &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/harassment/20210122/"&gt;updated harassment policy&lt;/a&gt; lists a number of banned behaviors relating to sexual harassment. Among them is a ban on “making derogatory statements about another person’s perceived sexual practices or sexual morality.” The policy goes on to say that would include “repeatedly negatively targeting another person with sexually-focused terms, such as ‘whore’ or ‘virgin.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYl51p"&gt;There aren’t details on exactly how Twitch will enforce the ban around “simp.” But moderators may find it to be tricky given just how often the term is thrown around on Twitch. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out to Twitch for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TQU5G"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 16th, 5:40PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with a statement from Twitch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
