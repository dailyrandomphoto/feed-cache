    <title>The Fitbit Charge 5 and its features are shown off in leaked video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KpcaskhFFHUkG0j6iM_RCilR4CA=/0x0:2403x1602/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69765895/Screen_Shot_2021_08_23_at_1.12.21_PM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8JbScN"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_snoopytech_/status/1429512996510912516"&gt;leaked video&lt;/a&gt; seems to show off the rumored Fitbit Charge 5, just over a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626752/fitbit-charge-5-leaked-images-specs-news"&gt;we saw renders of it hit the internet&lt;/a&gt;. The video shows off some of the features of the new wearable, including daily readiness and stress management scores, as well as ECG capabilities. The leaker also reveals that the device will cost $179.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqcOh0"&gt;The $179 price tag is $50 more than &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitbit.com%2Fglobal%2Fus%2Fproducts%2Ftrackers%2Fcharge4%3Fsku%3D417BKBK&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22638452%2Ffitbit-charge-5-leak-features-premium-fitness-tracker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a Charge 4 costs now&lt;/a&gt;, but the new version features a color screen instead of a monochromatic one, and adds support for ECGs. Like the Charge 4, the Charge 5 will also have built-in GPS, according to the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wT2JKE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Em46YC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The concept of rest days is something that the Apple Watch sorely lacks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8XZWr"&gt;The main new feature appears to be the Daily Readiness Score, which is only available to those with a $10 a month or $80 a year &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitbit.com%2Fglobal%2Fus%2Fproducts%2Fservices%2Fpremium&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22638452%2Ffitbit-charge-5-leak-features-premium-fitness-tracker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitbit Premium subscription&lt;/a&gt;. The video shows that the score will be calculated based on your exercise history, sleep, and heart rate, and that Fitbit will recommend what kind of exercise you should do for the day. For example, if you went hard at the gym the day before, or didn’t sleep well, the Fitbit may recommend a light yoga workout instead of a 15-mile run.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z6cLBHed_JwnOeU7REiC_dPt3sI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801309/Screen_Shot_2021_08_23_at_1.28.44_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Readiness Score telling you to take a break.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P4KJbN"&gt;The concept of rest days, or days where you’re just not feeling well is something that the Apple Watch sorely lacks, and a color screen would definitely help push the Charge 5 closer to the smartwatch side of the wearable spectrum. Fitbit Premium also competes with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;Apple’s Fitness Plus service&lt;/a&gt;, as it also offers audio / video workouts that you can follow along with (as well as access to a health coach for an extra $45 a month). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ME1rUS"&gt;The leaked video doesn’t mention a release date, but this leak (along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626752/fitbit-charge-5-leaked-images-specs-news"&gt;the recent renders of the device&lt;/a&gt;) seem to imply that the device is coming sooner rather than later. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Oculus Quest feature can automatically sync VR photos and video clips to your phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HTtyXKMQ1Y5G3IvBELdzxy3TV34=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69765336/akrales_200904_4160_0390.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7C411b"&gt;Oculus has begun rolling out a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fa-more-flexible-oculus-move-improved-gifting-and-more-in-the-latest-oculus-software-update%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;set of new software features&lt;/a&gt; for Quest and Quest 2 virtual reality headsets. The v32 update introduces some small, but important tweaks to the in-headset user experience, as well as to the Oculus Move health tracking app. The feature that most piqued my attention is an option to automatically sync saved photos and videos captured within VR to the Oculus mobile app for iOS and Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8IBUO"&gt;In an earlier update, Oculus let you upload files from a headset through the Browser app within VR, an improvement over the original method of plugging the headset into a PC. But this update goes a step further in removing friction for viewing or sharing content, as it lets you do it without a headset on. To sync items from your headset (running v32 software, of course) to the app for the first time, open up the Files app from your Quest’s app library within the headset, then click the cloud icon that will appear at its top-right corner. It’ll ask you to turn on the syncing feature. Once you’re finished, your clips and pics will be viewable and shareable within the “Devices” pane in the Oculus mobile app. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4yY7Yhqi8ngeKk4GQGFWwqxel9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800904/oculusv32.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6YL3Zm"&gt;Oculus has made a few other changes, including the ability to gift apps and games while you have a headset on. Previously (and frustratingly), gifting had to be done by the Oculus app or through a browser, but you can do it all in one place now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmQJuF"&gt;If you like to chat with your Oculus friends while in virtual reality, you’ll soon find these contacts in the “People” tab within Facebook Messenger in VR, not as a separate section. Oculus contacts will be placed in the same list as your Facebook friends, but Oculus says that the friends you made in VR won’t be able to see Facebook activity unless you add them as friends on Facebook, so they remain separate despite how it may appear within the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1J1jb6"&gt;Oculus told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that this will be the new setup for everyone who installs the v32 software, though you can use a filter that can display your Oculus or Facebook friends instead of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNnqXj"&gt;Lastly, Oculus is making tweaks to its Move fitness platform that can monitor your movements within games to report metrics, much like a fitness tracker does. Instead of only tracking daily goals, Oculus added a new weekly goal metric that lets you select how many days you’re aiming to work out in VR each week. It’s also letting you share Oculus Move workout stats that you’re proud of to your Facebook timeline, groups, or within Messenger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nvMYg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 23rd, 4:47PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Oculus clarified that, while all Quest users who have v32 software will see Oculus and Facebook friends listed together in Messenger within VR, they will be able to use a filter within Messenger to display either Oculus or Facebook friends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google plans to customize Play Store app ratings for users’ country and device</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/63cSpH_4TeCyYeJfG168C4M1ma0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69765618/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s7cn2N"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/08/making-ratings-and-reviews-better-for.html"&gt;announced changes&lt;/a&gt; to how it calculates and displays app ratings on the Play Store on Monday that could make them more useful and relevant to users and developers (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/23/google-play-ratings-country-form-factor/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). In place of one rating for an entire app, which can come in a variety of forms and levels of relative goodness depending on the device, Google plans to break things down with specific ratings for the country your device is registered in and specific ratings for the form factor of the device you’re using to browse the Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yE5JAW"&gt;There are some clear-cut reasons why this change might be helpful. First, not every app offers the same features or functionality everywhere because of national laws, and one universal law — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20847758/google-android-update-problem-pie-q-treble-mainline"&gt;Android fragmentation&lt;/a&gt;. If I’m a developer selling a messaging app in the Play Store, I don’t want my ratings to be bombed because the payment feature I only offer in a single country is currently borked. The other, even more important reason: some apps just suck in larger tablet or foldable forms. Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18700394/google-tablets-android-chromeos-priorities-cancellation"&gt;had issues with anything larger than a phone&lt;/a&gt;, so specific ratings for alternative form factors mean you can be warned in advance when you’re downloading something for your Android tablet that might not work as well as you remember it working on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cTxwXQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An incentive to make apps work better on devices other than phones?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYolTJ"&gt;Google plans on rolling out the country-specific ratings this November and form factor-specific ratings in 2022 (for tablets, foldables, Chrome OS, Wear OS, or Android Auto). The company will also notify developers ahead of both changes if Google’s new method of calculating ratings meaningfully changes their apps’ rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="BrudT0"&gt;At least 10 weeks before any change in Play Store, we’ll automatically analyze the change your app can expect to see and reach out to any developer that will see a change of more that 0.2 stars on any device type in a key market (one with greater than five percent of your store listing visitors). This will give you time to plan if you want to make key changes to your app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="E8ibQB"&gt;Both changes should be helpful, but particularly the upcoming device form factor considerations. Foldables like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617206/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-features-specs-price-hands-on"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; are becoming more popular, but not every app has adapted to them yet (looking at you, Instagram). Now there’ll be a slightly stronger incentive to do so or risk a worse rating from the people actually using the app on those devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxHP9V"&gt;As part of Google’s announcement, the company is also surfacing more Play Store data and metrics for developers to pour over in the Google Play Console, including device type insights that break down ratings based on what device is using an app. You can &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/08/making-ratings-and-reviews-better-for.html"&gt;check Google’s blog&lt;/a&gt; for all of the other changes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sex workers made OnlyFans valuable —  then it sold them out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EuvzyisksNlUPeNnSn_XHnUN4uU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69765584/jbareham_180207_2293_0057.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Graphic by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Pressure from payment processors is leaving OnlyFans creators with nowhere to turn&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="AlNOrM"&gt;In 2019, OnlyFans, a content subscription platform founded three years prior, had about &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/business/onlyfans-pandemic-users.html"&gt;120,000 creators&lt;/a&gt; registered with the site. But after the pandemic left millions of people out of work and sex workers unable to safely meet with clients in person, people flocked to the platform, which was already well-known for its adult content. By the end of 2020, OnlyFans boasted 1 million creators and 90 million users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NcY2Sm"&gt;Creators liked the control the platform gave them over the kind of work they wanted to do — but the more the site grew, the more nervous they got. “OnlyFans is not going to last, but it is a hell of a ride,” OnlyFans creator Kimberly Kane told the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/18/magazine/onlyfans-porn.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in May. “They’ll take it away from us, just like they do everything else. It’s only a matter of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Aep61W"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’ll take it away from us, just like they do everything else.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yhng2V"&gt;She was right. On Thursday, the site announced it would ban sexually explicit content beginning in October, in order to “comply with the requests of [the platform’s] banking partners and payout providers” as it seeks to attract outside investors. OnlyFans said &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-19/onlyfans-to-block-sexually-explicit-videos-starting-in-october?sref=nF2P89s4"&gt;it would still allow&lt;/a&gt; its now more than 2 million creators to post nude photos and videos that comply with the platform’s new policies — though many creators on the platform are still confused about precisely what will be allowed. It’s part of a longtime confusion in how sex workers interact with the app, which is known for X-rated content but rarely marketed as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfGrVs"&gt;Put another way, OnlyFans had buckled under pressure from companies &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/business/visa-mastercard-block-pornhub.html"&gt;like Mastercard and Visa&lt;/a&gt;, which last year implemented more stringent requirements for banks that process payments for sites where adult content is sold. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.xbiz.com/news/258606/heres-what-the-new-mastercard-rules-mean-for-adult-sites-producers"&gt;new guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, banks must ensure that sellers have provided documentation about their age and obtained consent from anyone else who appears in their posts. Though these verification processes were already standard for OnlyFans, the specter of liability looms large for companies that have become targets of the &lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160488/nick-kristof-holy-war-pornhub"&gt;longstanding conservative war&lt;/a&gt; on internet pornography and sex work. Finding it somewhat difficult to win their battles legislatively — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21026787/sesta-fosta-congress-study-hhs-sex-work-ro-khanna-elizabeth-warren-ron-wyden"&gt;though they have managed that, too&lt;/a&gt; — religious groups have zeroed in on individual websites and apps, as well as the banking institutions they rely on to enact their agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="aTgruB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a softer version of censorship”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tkyT4c"&gt;“Banking institutions are tremendously conservative — much moreso than the general culture — and they’re risk averse,” said Mike Stabile, the director of public affairs at the Free Speech Coalition, an advocacy group for workers in the adult industry. “What they’re doing is a softer version of censorship. It doesn’t come from the government; it happens at the credit card level. They set the terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UByWTg"&gt;Banks’ and credit card companies’ influence over adult content has been a slow creep, spanning years. PayPal, Chase, and Mastercard have shut out sex workers &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-02-paypal-square-and-big-bankings-war-on-the-sex-industry.html"&gt;for well over a decade&lt;/a&gt; and have only continued to make their policies more stringent. In 2014, Melissa Gira Grant reported on the payment processor WePay, which at the time was &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/05/30/spying_sex_and_finance_what_banks_and_payment_processors_are_secretly_watching_to_avoid_risk/"&gt;blocking sex workers&lt;/a&gt; from using its services — even when they weren’t using them for sex work. The result is almost always the same: platforms end up banning sexual content, driving sex workers off the site and forcing them into unsafer situations. During the pandemic, that might mean doing in-person sex work that increases their risk of contracting COVID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkYsMj"&gt;Mary Moody, a cam model and board member of the advocacy group Adult Industry Laborers &amp;amp; Artists, called the move “a workers rights and human rights disaster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QjcmCT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the privileged few are able to move and adapt”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GIvsBR"&gt;“When you rip a huge market share out of the adult industry — such as PornHub or OnlyFans — suddenly they have no way to interact with fans, no way to sell or market their content,” she says. “So what happens is the privileged few are able to move and adapt, while more marginalized workers, who may have worked in riskier street-based sex work prior to OnlyFans are pushed offline, and into the streets.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rBKOs"&gt;As betrayed as sex workers may feel by OnlyFans specifically, Moody called for most of the focus to be put on the forces exerting pressure on the platform. Unless advocates and organizers can tamp down on the groups influencing sites’ policies, sex workers will continue hopping from one platform to another, losing huge portions of their fan base — and therefore huge portions of their income — each time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UiwsGE"&gt;What the new policies mean for OnlyFans is still yet to be seen. When PornHub &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/pornhub-visa-mastercard-major-changes-platform-rules-revenge-porn-2020-12"&gt;altered its community standards&lt;/a&gt; last year, the site expanded its content moderation team and prohibited unverified users from uploading new content. But while it was a significant shift for the site and the creators who use it, the changes didn’t necessarily change the essential nature of the platform — PornHub is still a porn site. The same goes for a platform like Patreon, which &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-27-patreon-adult-content-crowdfunding-uncertainty.html"&gt;cracked down on adult content&lt;/a&gt; in 2017; Patreon wasn’t necessarily &lt;em&gt;known&lt;/em&gt; for its adult content. But if sex workers vanish from OnlyFans over the next couple of months — as well as their vast fan bases — it would seem that much of the site’s value could disappear, too. Who would be left? The fitness instructors, influencers, and celebrities OnlyFans has promoted over the sex workers who form the foundation of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mb5lYE"&gt;“What sex workers have learned to do is find platforms where the conditions are at least somewhat amenable and make them their own,” Stabile said. “Sex workers really did build this up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="Zdx0SE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They want to remove discussions of sex and sexuality from the public sphere”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UjSK8g"&gt;Other sites, like FanCentro, have remained more loyal to sex workers over time, by more readily embracing their identity as a website for adult content. When FanCentro launched in 2017, its founders built its own payment processor to ease some of the complications that can arise when contracting services like PayPal. “We don’t have to see who’s going to help us this time, what are their rates,” said Kat Revenga, FanCentro’s vice president. “It can make things less complex since it’s seen as a high-risk industry.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="veAPSh"&gt;Since the OnlyFans announcement, FanCentro has seen a massive boom in people registering with their platform. Whereas before they were averaging less than 70 new signups a day, over the last few days that number has jumped to 5,000, Revenga says. But while FanCentro may be more welcoming of sex workers on their platform, it’s not immune to Mastercard’s and Visa’s policies, since users will still pay for content using those credit card companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAAwMv"&gt;That’s why advocates are sounding alarm bells about banks, censorship, and net neutrality, emphasizing a larger narrative about who controls the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HTMap"&gt;“OnlyFans deplatforming legal sex work is a perfect example of why we need an Internet with fewer choke points for censorship,” Lia Holland, the director of campaigns and communications at Fight for the Future, a digital rights advocacy group, said in a statement last week. “Big Banks and payment processors should never be the arbiters of who or what can exist online, and it’s disturbing that in the year 2021 these behemoth monopolies are still throwing their weight around to censor consensual, legal, online self expression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKjaAm"&gt;The deplatforming of sex workers on sites like OnlyFans, TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter has the most immediate and life-threatening consequences for sex workers. But for the reasons Holland says, these policies have the potential to change the way everyone uses the internet, dictating what we can see, sell, buy, and say online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="P9yWml"&gt;The conservative groups behind the anti-porn and anti-sex work campaigns “actually want to turn back time,” Stabile said. “They want to remove discussions of sex and sexuality from the public sphere — which of course disproportionately targets women, LGBTQ people, and other marginalized people. And that hurts all of us.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>See how the Playdate’s crank cranks in new teardown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6XKhW6AEhBelcwRK0gzsFXpp9GY=/0x211:5055x3581/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69765474/KTqHw5sPOfPaw4qw.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zeg00n"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview"&gt;The Playdate&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most interesting pieces of new gaming hardware in years, with a fun, colorful design that evokes old handhelds like the Game Boy and a unique crank for interacting with games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="js1C57"&gt;And thanks to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FPlaydate%2BTeardown%2F143811%3Fvgo_ee%3De7Weq7FR70rsahrmxyFMM4vy7T5YEJ8ohjC9vauJg30%253D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22638347%2Fpanic-playdate-ifixit-teardown-crank-parts" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the good folks at &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (to whom Panic sent a Playdate specifically for disassembly purposes), we’ve now gotten a good look inside at the upcoming handheld — and how that crank actually works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GqPwc0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Playdate hands-on: a Game Boy from a different dimension","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MGNaKv"&gt;Most of the internal pieces more or less track with what you’d expect from a diminutive console: a 2.74Wh battery (about a quarter of the size of an iPhone 12), an LCD display, and an easily replaced headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RbZQky9vBq1v9UDvKsCalQgvblc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801098/PQhIfZNkWDEDJphx.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FPlaydate%2BTeardown%2F143811%3Fvgo_ee%3De7Weq7FR70rsahrmxyFMM4vy7T5YEJ8ohjC9vauJg30%253D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22638347%2Fpanic-playdate-ifixit-teardown-crank-parts" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EARKvR"&gt;But the star of the show is, of course, the crank, which uses a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor"&gt;Hall effect sensor&lt;/a&gt;. Rotating the crank in turn rotates a cylindrical magnet embedded in the shaft, whose magnetic field then activates the sensor as it turns (thus, providing an input). That means that there are no gears or traditional mechanical parts, which is interesting and should hopefully prevent things from breaking down long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="loc4nc"&gt;Despite the teardown, though, it seems that Panic would prefer if users didn’t crack up their Playdates; the warning sticker on the inside advises that breaking internal parts voids the warranty. Probably best to avoid it, since &lt;a href="https://shop.play.date/"&gt;shipping has slipped to 2022&lt;/a&gt; for preordering a replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Playdate comes with a helpful warning to not do exactly what iFixit is doing in this picture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

    <title>Poly Network hacker gave back more than $600 million in stolen crypto</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AMQCyvZWjGbvXR-Yaw00Otsmm4M=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69765460/acastro_170726_1777_0007_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wBM6qw"&gt;The hacker that stole around $600 million worth of crypto coins from Poly Network has now finished returning them after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619272/poly-network-attack-600-million-cryptocurrency-theft-doge-ethereum-binance-return-defi"&gt;starting the process nearly two weeks ago&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/23/poly-network-hacker-returns-remaining-cryptocurrency.html"&gt;via CNBC&lt;/a&gt;). Poly Network &lt;a href="https://medium.com/poly-network/poly-network-commences-full-asset-restoration-7f5c548423b9"&gt;says in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it’s now beginning the process of returning the stolen assets, which include Ethereum, Binance tokens, and Dogecoin, to their rightful owners. Poly Network says that there’s still work for it to do — it’s working on getting approximately &lt;a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/114045/at-least-611-million-stolen-in-massive-cross-chain-hack"&gt;$33 million worth of assets&lt;/a&gt; unfrozen and is continuing to restore the functionality of its Poly Bridge service, which lets users transfer crypto between blockchains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6mF10"&gt;After the attack, &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1fb7d1054df46c9734be76ccc14fa871b6729e33b98f9a3429670d27ec692bc0"&gt;the hacker said&lt;/a&gt; that he’d stolen the funds to keep them safe, saying that putting the coins in a “trusted account” was a way to highlight the bug without giving someone else the opportunity to make away with them. He’s had a somewhat continuous banter with Poly Network, who even took to calling him “Mr. White Hat” &lt;a href="https://medium.com/poly-network/poly-network-roadmap-for-the-next-phase-9f84c03c2e53"&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://medium.com/poly-network/poly-network-mainnet-upgrade-goes-live-d708f4fa2cf1"&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://medium.com/poly-network/latest-updates-aug-17-241398d64a40"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://medium.com/poly-network/latest-updates-aug-19-ed7ab8e5c2f0"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://medium.com/poly-network/latest-updates-aug-20-a12447c6d899"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://medium.com/poly-network/latest-updates-aug-23-7f6cca47b574"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/17/poly-network-cryptocurrency-hack-latest.html"&gt;Poly Network also invited the hacker&lt;/a&gt; to act as the company’s chief security advisor, which the hacker has (seemingly cheekily) acknowledged, &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x675d40b6f04f145c3981a062aeaee072c61db76c5d93ae2926f78ebffda5b882"&gt;signing off a message&lt;/a&gt; to the company with “your chief security advisor.” &lt;em&gt;Chainalysis&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/poly-network-hack-august-2021"&gt;points out that the transparency of blockchain tech&lt;/a&gt; can make it difficult to get away with spending stolen funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FcEbQs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Thanks to Mr. White Hat’s cooperation, Poly Network has officially entered the fourth phase of our roadmap ‘Asset Recovery.’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rRNDOx"&gt;After the hack occurred earlier this month, there was speculation about how the hacker had carried it out, with &lt;a href="https://blocksecteam.medium.com/the-initial-analysis-of-the-polynetwork-hack-270ac6072e2a"&gt;some analysts suggesting&lt;/a&gt; that he had even been able to obtain Poly Network’s private keys. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1425273168269348868?s=20"&gt;Further analysis seems to show&lt;/a&gt; that this wasn’t the case — instead, the hacker was able to exploit a security flaw in the Poly Network that allowed him to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1425233293545459712?s=20"&gt;execute transactions that he shouldn’t have been able to&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8blUwI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE! IT MUST BE ONE OF THE MOST WILD ADVENTURES IN OUR LIVES.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pxCZGJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x675d40b6f04f145c3981a062aeaee072c61db76c5d93ae2926f78ebffda5b882"&gt;Embedded in one of the final transactions&lt;/a&gt; from the hacker is a long note, in which he apologizes for the inconvenience he’s caused, calls the hack and process of returning the funds a “wild adventure,” and promises to return more money than he originally stole (which he requests be distributed to “survivors,” seemingly referring to those who had their money stolen). According to the hacker’s note, the extra funds come from &lt;a href="https://medium.com/poly-network/latest-updates-aug-19-ed7ab8e5c2f0"&gt;the $500,000 bounty&lt;/a&gt; that Poly Network paid him for finding the security flaw, as well as from &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-panhandlers-beg-poly-network-attacker-for-share-of-613m-haul"&gt;the stream of donations&lt;/a&gt; that he’s received since the hack (and is still receiving, according to his wallet’s transaction records).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dMqrR3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“DISTRIBUTING THE EXTRA ASSETS TO THE ‘SURVIVORS’ WOULD BE THE LAST REQUEST FROM THIS MAN.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="teJOKa"&gt;Poly Network &lt;a href="https://medium.com/poly-network/poly-network-mainnet-upgrade-goes-live-d708f4fa2cf1"&gt;said in another blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it would start a $500,000 bug bounty program to encourage researchers to find (and responsibly disclose) other vulnerabilities in its software. Currently, the &lt;a href="https://immunefi.com/bounty/polynetwork/"&gt;company’s bug bounty listing on Immunefi&lt;/a&gt; says that the maximum bounty is $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OX60i"&gt;As for when Poly Network’s users will actually see the returned funds hit their wallets, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/poly-network/poly-network-commences-full-asset-restoration-7f5c548423b9"&gt;the company says&lt;/a&gt; it’s working on returning them “within the shortest time frame possible.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Michigan Republicans run afoul of TikTok’s vaccine misinformation rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bbyvA0RqFVjXAkwaxbqKVvOpWvg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69765044/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g5UX6y"&gt;As the Michigan governor’s race heats up, a handful of candidates are turning to TikTok to build followings ahead of the 2022 election. Two Republicans have already found sizable audiences, but they’re also testing TikTok’s limits on misinformation, espousing possible 2020 election fraud and spreading false vaccine information on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5OY5SS"&gt;Garrett Soldano and Ryan Kelley are both running in Michigan’s Republican primary for governor, hoping to replace current Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Soldano, a chiropractor from Kalamazoo County, is one of the leading fundraisers, raising more than all other candidates combined, according to &lt;a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2021/07/garrett-soldano-out-raises-other-republican-candidates-for-governor-at-625k.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michigan Live&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8B3m6A"&gt;Both candidates have built large followings on TikTok, Soldano and Kelley boasting over 74,000 and 35,000 followers, respectively, as of publication. Both have created dozens of TikToks casting doubt on the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of masks. They have also posted videos questioning the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, calling for a “full forensic audit” of the election results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aXiC1m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Maybe that’s why flu just disappeared”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lwuaTN"&gt;Many of Soladano’s videos suggest that the COVID-19 vaccines are not as effective as advertised and that the pandemic isn’t as deadly as people proclaim. &lt;a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMR2cBoWd/"&gt;In one video&lt;/a&gt; with over 2.5 million views, Soladano falsely states that older PCR tests couldn’t detect the difference between COVID-19 and cases of influenza. “Maybe that’s why flu just disappeared,” he said. Another video denigrating Fauci and Whitmer &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@garrettformichigan/video/6971942344757087494?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowfE%2FB4XirCnv8NTdSlmLKasDzUjqfZv9LD2b%2FM8UrrKwfAWEmuIqvULIqnm67bt2dGgA%3D&amp;amp;checksum=39106e9cd892ac22e889725b3ea9ad84d833f3444d6a1b0ab46598427e42878a&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;sec_uid=MS4wLjABAAAAzMuxyfzmzCoQ_TFP-yf2zps6jDXO-5bqLT5h1DNIcHwfdsnSIgbKc6UdUV5k8kuv&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAU_NLfoQvgV1qSg48z-BuWPtzBcnGehekRWqneVCN2lgItLER_m1BUK4dO7-bdnJq&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_author_id=6859098120735802374&amp;amp;share_link_id=9B633909-1A3C-452F-9F9A-DAC032BD637E&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=5a3i73892bk7d&amp;amp;user_id=119258479655079936&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;is_copy_url=0&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;sender_device=pc&amp;amp;sender_web_id=6898175130696254982"&gt;was removed&lt;/a&gt; by TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lXm1H"&gt;“If COVID is so scary then why in the hell aren’t they closing the southern border?” Soladano &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@garrettformichigan/video/6996636404373540101?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowfE%2FB4XirCnv8NTdSlmLKasDzUjqfZv9LD2b%2FM8UrrKwfAWEmuIqvULIqnm67bt2dGgA%3D&amp;amp;checksum=39106e9cd892ac22e889725b3ea9ad84d833f3444d6a1b0ab46598427e42878a&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;sec_uid=MS4wLjABAAAAzMuxyfzmzCoQ_TFP-yf2zps6jDXO-5bqLT5h1DNIcHwfdsnSIgbKc6UdUV5k8kuv&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAU_NLfoQvgV1qSg48z-BuWPtzBcnGehekRWqneVCN2lgItLER_m1BUK4dO7-bdnJq&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_author_id=6859098120735802374&amp;amp;share_link_id=9B633909-1A3C-452F-9F9A-DAC032BD637E&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=5a3i73892bk7d&amp;amp;user_id=119258479655079936&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;is_copy_url=0&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;sender_device=pc&amp;amp;sender_web_id=6898175130696254982"&gt;asked in one video&lt;/a&gt;. “Common sense,” he continued, holding up a sign that says “mic drop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZYmd1"&gt;TikTok has always hosted political content, and the platform revamped its election and coronavirus misinformation policies over the last few months and years. On election integrity, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/election-integrity/"&gt;TikTok says it defines&lt;/a&gt; “misinformation” as “content that is inaccurate or false” and “causes harm to individuals, our community, or the larger public regardless of intent.” TikTok also bans false or misleading content about COVID-19 and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="it94FE"&gt;“In addition to removing content, we redirect searches associated with vaccine or COVID-19 disinformation to our Community Guidelines and do not autocomplete anti-vaccine hashtags in search,” TikTok said &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/covid-19/"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; outlining its policies. It’s unclear what triggers these actions outside of direct reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dF1dP"&gt;There’s reason to think Soldano may have been kicked off the platform for violating those policies — but the ban didn’t stick. In a video posted earlier this year, Soldano wrote that he would be uploading all of his old videos because his previous account “was banned for LIFE.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChSbHN"&gt;At the same time, Republican leaders who take a more reasonable line on vaccines often meet with harsh resistance from their base. Earlier this weekend, former President Donald Trump was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2021/08/22/trump-alabama-rally-vaccine-crowd-boos-sot-ip-vpx.cnn"&gt;booed at his own rally&lt;/a&gt; after encouraging supporters to take the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRlf0I"&gt;In an apparent effort to sidestep TikTok’s moderation systems, Soldano has avoided using the word “vaccine” in his videos. “I can’t use the ‘v’ word because TikTok will take me down, so I’m going to call it a ‘medical procedure,’” Soldano said in a video posted &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@garrettformichigan/video/6993387805711912197?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowfE%2FB4XirCnv8NTdSlmLKasDzUjqfZv9LD2b%2FM8UrrKwfAWEmuIqvULIqnm67bt2dGgA%3D&amp;amp;checksum=39106e9cd892ac22e889725b3ea9ad84d833f3444d6a1b0ab46598427e42878a&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;sec_uid=MS4wLjABAAAAzMuxyfzmzCoQ_TFP-yf2zps6jDXO-5bqLT5h1DNIcHwfdsnSIgbKc6UdUV5k8kuv&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAU_NLfoQvgV1qSg48z-BuWPtzBcnGehekRWqneVCN2lgItLER_m1BUK4dO7-bdnJq&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_author_id=6859098120735802374&amp;amp;share_link_id=9B633909-1A3C-452F-9F9A-DAC032BD637E&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=5a3i73892bk7d&amp;amp;user_id=119258479655079936&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. In another video, he writes &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@garrettformichigan/video/6977704699818511621?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowfE%2FB4XirCnv8NTdSlmLKasDzUjqfZv9LD2b%2FM8UrrKwfAWEmuIqvULIqnm67bt2dGgA%3D&amp;amp;checksum=39106e9cd892ac22e889725b3ea9ad84d833f3444d6a1b0ab46598427e42878a&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;sec_uid=MS4wLjABAAAAzMuxyfzmzCoQ_TFP-yf2zps6jDXO-5bqLT5h1DNIcHwfdsnSIgbKc6UdUV5k8kuv&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAU_NLfoQvgV1qSg48z-BuWPtzBcnGehekRWqneVCN2lgItLER_m1BUK4dO7-bdnJq&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_author_id=6859098120735802374&amp;amp;share_link_id=9B633909-1A3C-452F-9F9A-DAC032BD637E&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=5a3i73892bk7d&amp;amp;user_id=119258479655079936&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1"&gt;“vac…. cination.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIBH6G"&gt;Kelley, a real-estate broker and lifestyle vlogger, has previously &lt;a href="https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/garret-soldano-leading-republican-candidates-for-michigan-governor-in-fundraising"&gt;organized protests&lt;/a&gt; against Michigan’s COVID-19 orders and attended the&lt;a href="https://wwmt.com/news/local/right-wing-activist-spotted-at-capitol-insurrection-explores-run-for-mi-governor"&gt; January 6th US Capitol protest&lt;/a&gt; as well. (Kelley says he never entered the building.) Kelley’s videos also cast doubt on expert advice like that from the Centers for Disease Control. In several videos, he calls for “medical freedom” and for Michigan to outlaw mandatory vaccinations. He frequently tags his videos with #medicalfreedom which populates hundreds of videos from users protesting vaccine mandates or suggesting that they won’t receive the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHPee1"&gt;“Ryan is not anti-vax,” a spokesperson for the Kelley campaign told &lt;em&gt;The verge &lt;/em&gt;Monday. “But he is pro-medical freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TioASn"&gt;Kelley avoids using “vaccine” as well, opting for language like the “jab” when discussing masks and the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uz5bkl"&gt;Soldano did not immediately respond to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpDuL4"&gt;Over the last few years, TikTok has become a valuable platform for candidates seeking office. The platform’s For You algorithm makes it easier for candidates to create content and go viral as users don’t need to follow their accounts for their videos to show up on feeds. Democrats like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21408407/ed-markey-stans-fandom-politics-massachusetts-primary-joe-kennedy"&gt;Sens. Ed Markey&lt;/a&gt; (D-MA) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754927/jon-ossoff-tiktok-snapchat-account-influencer-marketing"&gt;Jon Ossoff&lt;/a&gt; (D-GA) have previously used the platform to organize voters and galvanize support ahead of their elections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HgTXQs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 8/23/21 at 3:08PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added a statement from the Kelley campaign.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees are organizing, now under the banner #AppleToo </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/soaXPKqSo6ORL2cvv7Cki-DsE_g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69765010/acastro_170731_1777_0006_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OZ6WX6"&gt;Apple employee organizing took another step this morning with the launch of a website called &lt;a href="https://appletoo.us/"&gt;AppleToo&lt;/a&gt;. The goal is to collect stories from workers at all levels of the organization who’ve experienced harassment or discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8X1gj"&gt;“For too long, Apple has evaded public scrutiny,” the website reads. “The truth is that for many Apple workers ... the culture of secrecy creates an opaque, intimidating fortress. When we press for accountability and redress to the persistent injustices we witness or experience in our workplace, we are faced with a pattern of isolation, degradation, and gaslighting. No more. We’ve exhausted all internal avenues. We’ve talked with our leadership. We’ve gone to the People team. We’ve escalated through Business Conduct. Nothing has changed. It’s time to Think Different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qy4bHp"&gt;Only about 15 current and former Apple employees were directly involved in the organizing effort. This morning, the organizers launched the website and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleLaborers"&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; and sent the news out on a 200-person Discord server for Apple employees and contractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pOdio"&gt;The effort has already gained support from organizers like Timnit Gebru, who worked at Apple prior to joining Google in 2018. After Gebru was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;abruptly fired from Google in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;, she went public about her experiences with racism and discrimination at the company. But she hasn’t spoken quite so publicly about her time at Apple. Now, she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “I experienced so many egregious things when I was at Apple, and always wondered how they manage to get out of the spotlight. I’m happy to see that Apple workers are organizing. It is past time for Apple to be held accountable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpDXXX"&gt;Cher Scarlett, an Apple engineer and activist who’s involved in the organizing effort, posted the website in two internal Slack channels — #allies4change and #women-in-swe — this morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KyctJm"&gt;Since launch, eight Apple employees have shared their stories through the AppleToo website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nightmare of the Wolf captures the soul of The Witcher, even without Geralt</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="witcher nightmare of the wolf" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M2ArfLGC0CcDAeaKQpup-Yo5nPI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764956/The_Witcher__Nightmare_of_the_Wolf_00_47_25_01.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TfqYjS"&gt;If there’s one thing that ties the many iterations of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; together — whether it’s the original books, the hit games, or more recently the live-action show — it’s Geralt of Rivia. The lovably miserable monster hunter is the core of the series in a way that’s rare for fantasy, which often follows stories bigger than just one person. But that’s also what makes &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt;, an anime spinoff on Netflix, so interesting. It’s a prequel that shifts back in time to focus on Geralt’s mentor Vesemir, who can feel like the polar opposite of his protege: charming, playful, and with a voracious appetite for the finer things in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UOUnn"&gt;It’s a refreshing twist that also does a good job of exploring some of the mysteries at the heart of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; universe, without getting away from the hallmarks of the series. &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; might not be the most welcoming starting point for the franchise, but it’s a whole lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JoDnv"&gt;The anime movie jumps back and forth in time, focusing on Vesemir’s life during two key points. Initially, it’s mostly about his upbringing and what led him to life as a witcher (which, for the uninitiated, are mutated monster hunters who train from a young age to kill deadly creatures for cash). Essentially, he fled a life of servitude in hopes of some respect (and money) hunting monsters, unaware of the harsh realities at Kaer Morhen, the bleak castle that serves as a training ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JO4HXs"&gt;These scenes show just how brutal the witcher training is and use that as way to explore the different ways people react to trauma. Witcher stories often talk about how few candidates actually survive this process, and in &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; you can see why: young boys are forced to fight seemingly impossible odds in a nightmare swamp and, if they manage to survive that, subjected to a painful alchemy meant to enhance their strength and senses. Those who make it through can be grim like Geralt, or hide their pain under a lust for life like Vesemir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sErr2Y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Witcher’s anime spinoff keeps the bathtub, but adds a fun-loving lead","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22602293/witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-anime-spinoff-netflix-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="63n6Ov"&gt;The other half of the story follows Vesemir at the height of his abilities. (Witchers age slowly, so even though he’s a handsome-looking young man with a square jaw and mischievous smirk, he’s actually 70 years old.) At this point he’s renowned for his ability to slay tough monsters and is able to charge a hefty price because of it; one of the earliest scenes shows Vesemir in the bath, haggling with an elf over his fee, before deciding he’s too expensive. At the same time, though, monsters seem to be few and far between, creating a conundrum for Vesemir and his compatriots. As one witcher puts it, “we’re putting ourselves out of business with every monster we kill.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="witcher nightmare of the wolf" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BqxXv5jpHxRnWlRybOfk_X_KAo0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800825/The_Witcher__Nightmare_of_the_Wolf_00_35_02_04.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HIpLJ5"&gt;As these two periods intersect, they shine light on a very pertinent relationship: namely between the witchers and the monsters they’ve sworn to kill. I won’t spoil anything, but &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; answers some questions that have been floating around on message boards for years about the origins of both hunter and hunted. And those new answers will likely change how you think about them both. Unfortunately, these revelations might be lost on newcomers, those who aren’t already immersed in the intrigue of the Continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBnznP"&gt;The good news is that, revelations aside, &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; is still a blast to watch even if you’re coming in cold. The shift to animation means that the action is more fluid than ever, particularly when it comes to Vesemir slicing his way through beasts with an inhuman grace, all while making smart-ass quips. (The slick action shouldn’t be too surprising, as &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf &lt;/em&gt;was created by Studio Mir, the same team behind shows like &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Korra&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts&lt;/em&gt;.) Whereas combat in the live-action show and games can feel heavy and laborious, in the anime things are much faster and more dynamic, befitting Vesemir as the new lead. For Geralt, fighting seems like a chore. Vesemir has fun. That doesn’t mean the battles don’t pack a punch: &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf &lt;/em&gt;is incredibly violent. It’ll only be a few minutes in before you see dismembered limbs and gushing blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1LagV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; manages to capture much of what has made &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; such a hit — a dark fantasy world, political intrigue, brutal action, buff men in the bath — but it does so without spending much time setting up the world. It assumes you already care. (This is especially true when it comes to the Big Twist, which won’t mean much if you aren’t invested in the universe.) So as fun as its gory action and plentiful one-liners can be, the movie can still feel like supplementary material — something to hold you over until season 2 finally drops in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gX4lyi"&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is streaming now on Netflix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is retiring the swipe up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G4T27qFpD0JVYlUxKJjm7sEMz44=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764905/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ap5gV0"&gt;The swipe-up will be no more. Instagram is planning to retire the feature, which allows people to visit external webpages by swiping up, starting August 30th, according to a notification viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and confirmed by Instagram. Instead of the swipe-up link, Instagram says people will be able to use link stickers, which are exactly as they sound: tappable stickers in stories that take people to external websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JR35W3"&gt;The company says it’s retiring the swipe up — a feature that’s spawned its own category of GIFs and a phrase that’s now part of the lexicon — to “streamline the stories creation experience” and offer more “creative control,” given that uses can format the look of stickers and not the swipe up. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ddln175rMedNgd6c5mC_TNG6Wsg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801363/swipeup.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instagram’s message about the change to swipe up links.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kNdf2r"&gt;This update builds on a test the company began earlier this summer. In June, Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555434/instagram-link-sticker-post-test-swipe-up"&gt;started testing&lt;/a&gt; these stickers for various users, not just people who already had swipe up privileges. (Users have to be verified or have at least 10,000 followers to gain access to swipe up.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHBqsC"&gt;At the time of the test, Vishal Shah, Instagram’s former head of product, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the stickers fit more with the way people currently use the platform. He also said the goal was to more widely roll out the stickers. The key difference between the two features, apart from the obvious gesture difference, is viewers can respond to stories that have a link sticker, but cannot respond to swipe up stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFaZ1w"&gt;Instagram says that for now, only people who had swipe up privileges will receive the sticker option, but that it’s “still evaluating” rolling it out to more users. This update will “help us determine whether it’s the right decision before expanding access to more people,” a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrmplI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 23rd, 2:50PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to include and reflect comment from Instagram.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
