    <title>Xbox boss says Microsoft’s Bethesda deal was all about exclusive games for Game Pass</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Phil Spencer Microsoft Xbox stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hnzpEiGjOyKwGYStemd93xv-p0U=/0x0:3200x2133/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68950635/philspencer2.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YqpkAT"&gt;Microsoft completed its $7.5 billion Bethesda acquisition earlier this week and initially hinted that “some new titles in the future” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;would be exclusive to Xbox and PC players&lt;/a&gt;. That &lt;em&gt;some &lt;/em&gt;language left some wiggle room for the possibility of future Bethesda titles to appear on Sony’s PlayStation 5, Nintendo’s Switch, or elsewhere. Now, Microsoft’s Xbox chief, Phil Spencer, is making it very clear why the company paid $7.5 billion for Bethesda: Xbox Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0iTHt"&gt;Speaking during a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/YJneU_qBMPM"&gt;Bethesda and Xbox roundtable&lt;/a&gt; event today, Spencer revealed that Xbox Game Pass is at the heart of this Bethesda deal. “If you’re an Xbox customer, the thing I want you to know is that this is about delivering great exclusive games for you that ship on platforms where Game Pass exists,” said Spencer. “That’s our goal, that’s why we’re doing this, that’s the root of this partnership that we’re building.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0YAlh"&gt;It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21449178/microsoft-xbox-bethesda-zenimax-media-acquisition-xbox-game-pass"&gt;not a surprising admission&lt;/a&gt;, as it has been obvious Microsoft has been gearing up for a different kind of Xbox future with its Xbox Game Pass subscription push. But hearing it directly from the head of Xbox makes it even clearer that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336892/microsoft-xbox-series-x-game-pass-event-showcase-future"&gt;Xbox Game Pass is Microsoft’s true next-gen Xbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="prYfiL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Xbox chief Phil Spencer on exclusive Bethesda games: "This is about delivering great exclusive games for you [Xbox customers] that ship on platforms where Game Pass exists." &lt;a href="https://t.co/K1U84pukdu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/K1U84pukdu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1370079409118588931?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zQQd5o"&gt;This doesn’t mean Bethesda games will suddenly disappear from other platforms. In fact, it’s the opposite. “There’s contractual obligations that we’re going to see through, as we always do in every one of these instances,” says Spencer. “We have games that exist on other platforms, and we’re gonna go support those games on the platforms they’re on. There’s communities of players and we love those communities and we’ll continue to invest in them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6IY8TT"&gt;Microsoft and Bethesda only cleared the deal recently, so it’s too early for any game announcements, but questions remain over Bethesda’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17447792/bethesda-starfield-new-series-announced-e3-2018"&gt;new and upcoming &lt;em&gt;Starfield &lt;/em&gt;title&lt;/a&gt; and even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226966/bethesda-indiana-jones-game-machinegames"&gt;recently announced Indiana Jones game&lt;/a&gt;. Will these both be exclusive to Xbox and PC? We simply don’t know yet. Spencer did mention that “even in the future there might be things that have contractual things, or legacy on different platforms that we’ll go do,” so there &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;potentially be new Bethesda games appearing on non-Microsoft platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWLVmu"&gt;What’s clear is that the long-term goal is for Bethesda to create exclusive games that will only be available on platforms where Xbox Game Pass is supported. At the moment, that’s Xbox consoles, Windows PCs, Android phones, and soon, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165280/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-launch-spring-2021-announced"&gt;iOS devices via the web&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptC6Gj"&gt;Here’s Spencer’s full statement on Bethesda exclusivity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="cyvpZP"&gt;So obviously I can’t sit here and say every Bethesda game is exclusive, because we know that’s not true. There’s contractual obligations that we’re going to see through, as we always do in every one of these instances. We have games that exist on other platforms, and we’re gonna go support those games on the platforms they’re on. There’s communities of players and we love those communities and we’ll continue to invest in them. And even in the future there might be things that have contractual things, or legacy on different platforms that we’ll go do. But if you’re an Xbox customer, the thing I want you to know is that this is about delivering great exclusive games for you that ship on platforms where Game Pass exists. That’s our goal, that’s why we’re doing this, that’s the root of this partnership that we’re building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Uber and Lyft will share information about drivers deactivated for serious offenses </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-TRANSPORT-RIDESHARE-DEMONSTRATION" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DGCr_vp9ZwO7ON4KfWR1hNDXqlY=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68950317/1227939563.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jwyVWq"&gt;Uber and Lyft announced a “first-of-its-kind” effort to share information about drivers who were deactivated for committing serious offenses, including physical and sexual assault and murder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVdi8d"&gt;Uber and Lyft will pool information under the banner of the Industry Safety Sharing Project, which will be administered by a third party. The companies will share “information about driver deactivations related to the five most critical safety issues within the &lt;a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nsvrc.org%2Fhelping-industries-classify-reports&amp;amp;esheet=52394819&amp;amp;newsitemid=20210311005782&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=National+Sexual+Violence+Resource+Center%26%238217%3Bs+%28NSVRC%29+Sexual+Misconduct+and+Sexual+Violence+Taxonomy&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=df5e155eacf5eea90fe219afc727eef0"&gt;National Sexual Violence Resource Center’s (NSVRC) Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Violence Taxonomy&lt;/a&gt;, along with physical assault fatalities,” Uber and Lyft said in a joint announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RlUnw0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ride-hailing services have long struggled to keep riders and drivers safe from one another&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKWslM"&gt;Ride-hailing services have long struggled to keep riders and drivers safe from one another. In its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997939/uber-safety-report-2018-sexual-assault-ride-hailing-platform-stats"&gt;first safety report&lt;/a&gt;, Uber disclosed that 3,045 sexual assaults occurred on Uber trips in 2018. Additionally, nine people were murdered during Uber rides, and 58 people died in auto-related crashes. Interestingly, Uber said that drivers reported being victims of assaults at roughly the same rate as riders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7poCz"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/30/technology/uber-driver-sexual-assault/index.html"&gt;2018 CNN report&lt;/a&gt; found that at least 103 Uber drivers and 18 Lyft drivers had been accused of sexual assault or abuse. Also in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/business/lyft-sexual-assault-lawsuit.html"&gt;19 women sued Lyft&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly failing to prevent sexual assault perpetrated by drivers on the platform and for doing little to investigate the complaints. A California woman who says she was raped by a Lyft driver in 2017 also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20870765/lyft-sexual-assault-lawsuit-alison-turkos-safety-complaints"&gt;sued the company in September&lt;/a&gt; over failing to keep riders safe, while 14 additional women &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/tech/lyft-sexual-assault-lawsuit/index.html"&gt;sued Lyft earlier in September&lt;/a&gt; over its handling of sexual assault complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMvGFt"&gt;Both companies conduct background checks and say passenger safety is their top priority. They also have largely attempted to tackle this issue through technology updates, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17402172/uber-911-panic-button-app-live-us"&gt;in-app “panic buttons,”&lt;/a&gt; which let riders instantly dial 911, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21143679/uber-rider-reporting-safety-issue-driver-trip"&gt;ways to report a driver for unsafe activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aENuF5"&gt;This new project is the first time the two companies have collaborated to share information about drivers who have been accused of the most serious offenses. Drivers are classified as independent contractors, not employees, meaning they can — and frequently do — drive for both companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HUi63"&gt;The companies will share information about drivers that commit a serious offense as defined by the NSVRC categories. Once that information is shared, the decision to ban a driver is up to the other company based on its policies and standards. Each company can decide to take action to deactivate that driver, a spokesperson for Uber said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbbzdJ"&gt;In addition, drivers and couriers who are being onboarded to either company will undergo a check against this database to verify if their name matches against any deactivations previously shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2VrE8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One year later</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pwOR27JjSWYsx7JEyQ7UFFn_iS8=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68950242/VRG_ILLO_4468_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;To brighter days ahead &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="94mVmU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22167586/pandemic-time-perception-2020-covid"&gt;The calendar&lt;/a&gt; tells me that it’s been a year since the world changed. It’s been more than a year, really: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075647/us-wuhan-coronavirus-case-china-deaths-virus-illness"&gt;the first COVID-19 case&lt;/a&gt; in the United States was reported on January 21st, 2020. The emergency was invisibly building in the US even before that. But a year ago today, the scale of the threat was pushed into view, and the outbreak became a pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="Xxd8jq"&gt;It’s hard to recapture the specific feelings of last March. There was a particular mixture of confusion, fear, numbness, and denial hanging in the background of everything, and most of the month was a blur. But within that miasma of badness, specific moments stand out. Those vivid signposts are the things I remember most clearly when I think back to a year ago: a de-stressing collage I made from old magazines, a miniature bottle of hand sanitizer, a specific trip to the bagel shop, the things I panic-bought on Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="lA7XEM"&gt;Everyone has their own unique markers of the days when things changed. I asked &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff to share theirs. Luckily, there are brighter days ahead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="xCj4Qt"&gt;
&lt;p id="oPNJjD"&gt;My favorite relic of the first weeks of the pandemic is the 76.5-ounce canister of lemon-lime Gatorade powder I bought on Amazon. Everything was so scary and so new, and my instinct was to get everything I might need if I (or someone I knew) got sick. Enough powder to make nine gallons of Gatorade seemed reasonable at the time. I’ve used around half of it in the past year; it was particularly useful during election week when I was too anxious for solid food. Now, the canister lives on the top of my fridge, and I’m very attached to it. It feels like the strangest-possible pandemic security blanket.  —&lt;em&gt;Nicole Wetsman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pW8jN20XU56EkGhpDS6eVNKl1fY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22362902/IMG_2771.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Gatorade powder security blanket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="mbkDJ5"&gt;
&lt;p id="WQLEz8"&gt;When masks first became a thing, disposable masks weren’t available because they were needed by first responders and hospital workers. I remember being grateful that I already had a couple of reusable face masks leftover from when we had to have some exterminators come the year before. But I didn’t know if those two would last, and you couldn’t find any to buy, so I did some research, asked some of the other Verge folks what they were doing, and hand-sewed a rather neat little mask from an old bedsheet (which I ended up never actually using). I remember several friends with sewing machines were sewing face masks to send to hospitals because the demand was so huge that medical personnel were running short, and cloth masks were better than none at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaeaD5"&gt;The other hard-to-get pandemic item was hand sanitizer. Again, it was simply not available, and I researched what you had to use to make your own, including what kind of alcohol and what strength it had to be. (I actually ended up writing an article about it.) I managed to score the aloe vera gel I needed at a local health food store but was never able to get the alcohol at the strength demanded — by the time it was available, I was able to purchase hand sanitizer at my local supermarket anyway. There must be something I can do with that aloe vera gel… &lt;em&gt;—Barbara Krasnoff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="mDNJSh"&gt;
&lt;p id="klo8LR"&gt;I made a panicked trip to the grocery store about the same time as everyone else in Seattle when we realized what was going on. It was chaos — so many confused people, none of us sure what we were supposed to be doing or buying. All of the good brands of oat milk were cleared off the shelves. I put two frozen pizzas on the bottom of my shopping cart. I remember a sense of comfort, like, “Yes, this additional frozen pizza will see us through the deadly pandemic.” When I got to the front of the massive checkout line, there was only one pizza — the other one fell off at some point. RIP that other frozen pizza, abandoned on the floor of a Safeway in March 2020. You were sorely missed.  &lt;em&gt;—Allison Johnson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ah yes, I feel confident that this *bottle of Purell zip-tied to a pole* will keep my workplace free of the coronavirus &lt;a href="https://t.co/PeDFJ75THI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PeDFJ75THI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Allison Johnson (@allisonjo1) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/allisonjo1/status/1234988405999562752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 3, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="xFQZba"&gt;
&lt;p id="SYcr5f"&gt;New York City, as everyone knows, was one of the first hotspots for COVID-19 in the US. The early stages of the pandemic were all about trying to convey our experience, and the importance of believing science and taking precautions, to family members who weren’t impacted yet in other parts of the country. It was — and continues to be — an incredibly frustrating experience trying to relay info to loved ones who still hold on to the “it couldn’t happen to me” line of thinking. I’m so glad it hasn’t happened to them, but it so easily could have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0BMww"&gt;Oh, and it was really hard to find toilet paper there for a while. Bidet all day.  &lt;em&gt;—Cameron Faulkner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Bj76M7"&gt;
&lt;p id="kWpXnZ"&gt;Two days stand out for when the pandemic became “real” to me. On February 29th, one day after the &lt;a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/ERD/Pages/Oregon-First-Presumptive-Case-Novel-Coronavirus.aspx"&gt;first reported case of COVID-19 in Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, I woke up and asked my wife if we should buy extra food at the grocery store. I wondered if that would be a weird or over-reactionary thing to do. (Who knew that I should have actually been asking about buying extra toilet paper.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlyczH"&gt;On March 11th, there was the weird double-whammy of the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/3/11/21176029/nba-coronavirus-canceled-utah-jazz-espn-brian-windhorst-recode-media"&gt;NBA cancelling its season&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B9nVasnBNF5/?hl=en"&gt;Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson announcing their COVID-19 diagnoses&lt;/a&gt;. After that day, it seemed like everyone talked about COVID-19 a little differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8aBl4"&gt;A year on, I’m glad that many are now vaccinated and that hopefully soon, many more will be. But I also wonder how we’ll all be irrevocably changed from our time in the pandemic. — &lt;em&gt;Jay Peters&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="hbbK0c"&gt;
&lt;p id="VMYbAi"&gt;By the time the WHO made the official call that we were in a pandemic, the swirling fear and unrelenting news had already started messing with our heads. Just a few weeks into living and working at home, and we started to lose track of what day of the week it was. My family would sit down for dinner, look at each other, and try to remember if we’d just finished our Thursday zoom meetings or if it was only Tuesday. Eventually, we started raising a glass to the day of the week. “Monday?” “Monday.” &amp;lt;clink&amp;gt; We still do it every night.  &lt;em&gt;—Mary Beth Griggs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="XPJQZA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;we started to lose track of what day of the week it was&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="34AlDQ"&gt;
&lt;p id="9bn3s4"&gt;On March 10th, I took a selfie with a woman who had fallen asleep on me during my commute home. I joked that “social distancing in NYC is going great!” The next day, I showed up to the office and only a handful of my colleagues were in, but all of the snacks were gone. I had a few bags of chips stowed away at my desk, and I used chopsticks to eat them because I was afraid of touching my mouth.  &lt;em&gt;—Cory Zapatka &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No snacks in the office.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Ipq3GY"&gt;
&lt;p id="i3vmUr"&gt;I distinctly remember taking the dog for an early morning walk around this time last year and being shocked that there were no cars — literally none — on what’s usually a very traffick-y road into Downtown Pittsburgh. It was eerily quiet, and it was the first time it hit home for me how huge the situation really was. Now, whenever I venture out in the car, the lack of traffic is actually really nice, if still a bit disconcerting. I’m hopeful this might make us rethink our dependence on cars, but I think it’s too early to tell whether the lack of traffic will become a permanent result of the pandemic.  &lt;em&gt;—Kim Lyons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ijCoct"&gt;
&lt;p id="jsTyMT"&gt;“Today is Thursday” was trending on Twitter on March 19th, and several &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers started musing about how an automated reminder of what day of the week it was would be nice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BTxBsf"&gt;A bit of tinkering and a few hours later, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TodaysDayToday"&gt;@TodaysDayToday&lt;/a&gt; was born: a Twitter account that, once a day, at 9AM ET, tweets what day of the week it is. Is it a useful Twitter account? Not exactly, but I do find it strangely comforting to see each morning, even a year later. And despite the timeless, WFH pandemic void, some things never changed: people still love Fridays and dread Mondays, if replies to the bot are anything to go by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qB8eOP"&gt;One year later, and time keeps on moving forward. Things might almost start looking like normal again soon. But my little Twitter bot will still keep ticking on, too. And in case you were wondering: today is Thursday. &lt;em&gt; —Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="0WkgmK"&gt;
&lt;p id="QAGJal"&gt;At the very beginning of the pandemic, our entire family had COVID and didn’t know it. My husband had gotten a false positive flu test, I spent about three weeks in bed with exhaustion and low appetite, our older son had fever and chills for two days, and our daughter had a fever for a morning that never returned after taking Motrin. But there were no tests around and nothing to do about it. And the positive flu test gave us hope. Then one day, as I was cleaning the bathroom, I wasn’t able to smell the Clorox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WGSx4I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One day, as I was cleaning the bathroom, I wasn’t able to smell the Clorox&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qaB7xz"&gt;My husband who has year-round allergies and can never smell couldn’t help me. Our housekeeper who hadn’t been there in over three weeks assured me that the bleach was not watered down. But no matter how much I sniffed, I could not smell the faintest trace of bleach. I felt like I was losing my mind. I finally decided to spray my clothes, and, alas, within seconds they were covered in bleach stains. Not long after, reports came out about COVID’s effects relating to loss of smell and taste. Antibody tests confirmed we had had it, but the memory of me frantically running around our apartment spraying myself with bleach will stay with us forever.  &lt;em&gt;—Esther Cohen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="2PnSyU"&gt;
&lt;p id="6HZ6YP"&gt;2020 was going to be my first year living on my own, and the newfound independence was exhilarating. Then March came roaring in with a pandemic that trapped me in my apartment. At the beginning of the month, when the pandemic was still mostly just an ominous cloud on the horizon, I stumbled across the most precious dog online. Her name was Trudee. I had been wanting a dog for months, so I put in an application to the local rescue. After several interviews, I was approved to adopt her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JipR7"&gt;On March 17th, I drove from Columbus to Cleveland to pick her up. The highways were unusually empty. On March 18th, Ohio’s governor began to shut down businesses across the state. It was when this call came that I realized I was facing weeks or even months of loneliness in this apartment I was once so excited to be in. I remember hanging my head and crying out of fear of the isolation inside and the deadly disease outside. Trudee, however, was my saving grace. She kept the loneliness at bay, and we’ve been inseparable since.  &lt;em&gt;—Kaitlin Hatton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trudee!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="dvKPz6"&gt;
&lt;p id="4xFj72"&gt;The pandemic’s start was actually supposed to be one of the coolest work trips of my career: a super-secret visit to Seattle, where I would play Valve’s then-upcoming &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;. Valve wisely canceled the trip and let reporters play &lt;em&gt;Alyx &lt;/em&gt;at home instead, and within a few days, I was in self-quarantine at the virus epicenter in New York City after an employee at Vox’s offices tested positive for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZ2ty4"&gt;The result is that I spent the early pandemic locked inside my apartment with a giant batch of mushy homemade enchiladas, wearing a VR headset I brought home on my very last trip from our office, trying to write something that sounded like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"&gt;normal review for a major video game franchise&lt;/a&gt; instead of a panicky dispatch from a plague exclusion zone. It’s the only time I’ve ever &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192359/valve-half-life-alyx-interview-sean-vanaman-corey-peters-dystopia-vr-hope"&gt;introduced a developer interview&lt;/a&gt; by casually mentioning the local disease death toll. (I guess it was 125 back then, which is heartbreakingly low in retrospect since, within weeks, the city would watch bodies pile up in freezers and a mass grave.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1VSsHg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Half-Life: Alyx’ is a very good VR shooter about space zombies. And 30,000 people in my city are dead.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ud1omP"&gt;I rewrote the opening paragraph to that article about 50 times, and that was the least dramatic version I came up with. Because outside VR, all I remember is grief and fury. Spending every night listening to ambulances flood the local hospital, waking up to smug pundits and politicians insisting the pandemic wasn’t real, mocking New Yorkers for being afraid of a disease nobody could cure or understand. Worrying a vicious sore throat I’d had in early March was actually COVID-19, edging around the idea I’d infected somebody else and killed them. Watching footage of people lining up for hours hoping to get tested, while the president called the whole thing a hoax. And then — where was I? Right. Video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKXaND"&gt;Long story short, &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; is a very good VR shooter about space zombies. And 30,000 people in my city are dead.  &lt;em&gt;—Adi Robertson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="bwV1rZ"&gt;
&lt;p id="2A8UHz"&gt;I was in Austin, Texas, profiling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21238529/the-chive-bro-frat-culture-founders-misogyny"&gt;the eccentric brothers behind &lt;em&gt;The Chive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when stuff started to get really weird. It was March 11th — the World Health Organization had just declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. I remember sitting in my hotel room wondering if I’d made a big mistake. Was I going to get stuck in Texas? My editor, Kevin Nguyen, had asked me before I left if I felt comfortable traveling, and I’d answered honestly when I said yes. But now I felt really vulnerable. There was so much uncertainty — rumors that had seemed quite outlandish (they’re going to shut down air travel!) were suddenly within the realm of possibility. I bought hand sanitizer since &lt;em&gt;The Chive&lt;/em&gt; guys were big on shaking hands.  &lt;em&gt;—Zoë Schiffer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="n2wUa0"&gt;
&lt;p id="e8Oil6"&gt;The last time I went to our office was on March 3rd, the day after I wrote about how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161824/coronavirus-death-life-care-washington-testing-surveillance"&gt;we had no idea how widely the virus was spreading&lt;/a&gt; because our testing was insufficient. The only reason I went was to record a &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; episode; I’d already decided at that point it was wisest to avoid public transit. As I did not own a car, that meant staying home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AU96MU"&gt;By then, I’d already panic-bought a bunch of nonperishable food items, cold medicine, and some bleach since I’d missed my Wednesday evening yoga class on February 26th to write about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21155378/coronavirus-california-us-case-unknown-source-community-spread-cdc"&gt;a possible community-acquired case&lt;/a&gt; in the Bay Area where I live; after that, stocking up only seemed natural.&lt;em&gt; If you’re going to panic&lt;/em&gt;, I figured, &lt;em&gt;better to panic before everyone else. &lt;/em&gt;At that point, I still believed the CDC was competent and any kind of shutdown would only last a month or so, the way it did in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VMVHGk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At that point, I still believed the CDC was competent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xrxkcV"&gt;March 11th was also a Wednesday. My boyfriend and I went into our yoga class, and when we came out, Tom Hanks had been diagnosed and the NBA had canceled its season. He and I then proceeded to get into a giant fight — the only thing I was still doing was studio workout classes. He insisted, correctly, that I shouldn’t go to them anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4b2j0"&gt;Also around that time, I lost faith that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21176170/coronavirus-response-donald-trump-resign-crisis-pandemic-response"&gt;the US government would do anything&lt;/a&gt; to prevent coronavirus from becoming widespread. We’d been reporting on this threat for months, along with a lot of other outlets, and no one was taking it seriously. What was the point of our work? I still wonder about that; I have wondered about it every time we’ve reached a new grim milestone of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTjeFI"&gt;The fight I had with my boyfriend turned out to be irrelevant; the Bay Area shut down on March 16th. My yoga studio, where I’d gone four or five times a week for eight years, went out of business that summer.  &lt;em&gt;—Liz Lopatto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Rj9D7q"&gt;
&lt;p id="0ucqrn"&gt;I remember a few things very clearly about the day Philly started its lockdown. I was working at a library, and I had decided to reorganize our big supply closet. I remember leaving the closet half-organized, with little piles of folders and labels on the floor that I’d “get to tomorrow.” Turns out, tomorrow wasn’t coming. I lost that job a month later, and I have no idea if anyone ever finished up tidying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gIrrt7"&gt;When our boss told us to head home, my co-workers and I decided to grab a few books and DVDs to entertain ourselves while we were stuck at home. There was a funny “kids in a candy shop” feeling: a bunch of library workers moseying around the stacks of an empty library, taking our pick of materials to hunker down with. I think we thought, naively in retrospect, that it might be a few weeks of working from home and then back to normal. A year later, I still have my pile of library books, tucked in a box that I use as a footrest at my desk. (Library friends, if you’re reading this, I swear I will return them eventually.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICIjRV"&gt;I was too terrified to take the train or a ride-share home that day, so I hitched a ride with my equally terrified partner. We stopped at a few grocery stores (no toilet paper in sight) and a liquor store on the way. There was a bottle of Corona on the shelf outfitted with the head and legs of a virus, and I stared at it for a long moment trying to decide if it was cute or horribly morbid.  &lt;em&gt;—Kait Sanchez&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="xbnOpd"&gt;
&lt;p id="jIH92D"&gt;I have bad anxiety, so I stocked up on nonperishables and hand sanitizer in late February. During my last commute home from work, I didn’t have any gloves so I placed (obviously clean and unused) dog poop bags over my hands so I could hold the pole on the train. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MK7IBt"&gt;I remember people telling me I must be so relieved that my wedding was set for August 28th, and that this would all blow over by then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="20aN73"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I had already resigned myself to having to stay home, probably forever&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5zWZ4Q"&gt;My parents and wedding caterer are both in upstate New York, and my partner and I were too scared of potentially spreading it to them to drive up. So my parents volunteered to go to the wedding tasting for us on March 14th. I FaceTimed them from my MacBook while they tried stuffed mushrooms, sweet and sour meatballs, and goat cheese puffs. I nodded along while I Googled “DIY sourdough starter” in the background. I am an eternal pessimist, so at that point, I had already resigned myself to having to stay home, probably forever. The wedding would obviously have to be postponed. I would never leave the house again! Therefore, my main concern, other than the crushing feeling of the world crumbling around me, was that all of my friends were showing off beautiful loaves of bread on Instagram — and I hadn’t picked up yeast during my grocery run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWPUAa"&gt;We decided to postpone the wedding by the end of March. My sourdough starter died a few days later. I cried when I scraped it into the trash, and then again, a week later, when I described it to my therapist over Zoom.  &lt;em&gt;—Sarah Smithers&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ezCbpd"&gt;
&lt;p id="gvJEkI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has covered too many events to count in the past decade, so we were prepared to notice them crumble when COVID began to rampage across the globe. I started a simple website to track them, called Is It Canceled Yet? (I even nabbed the isitcanceledyet.com domain. Sweet.) From E3 to the Olympics, there was plenty of material to monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sgQx0li3_XGX1ZQqa5jTsww-xK0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363153/uh_oh.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;isitcanceledyet.com&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V2XfPu"&gt;The project was mostly lighthearted and dusted lightly with humor when the cancellations were coming at a trickle and when we had some optimism that everyone would come together to shut down the spread of the virus. But then we learned our government and many of our neighbors wouldn’t take it seriously, and the trickle became a flood, and now 500,000 Americans are dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSIwVa"&gt;In the span of a day or two, the Is It Canceled Yet? site became too popular and too difficult for me to manage. People started pointing to it as a serious resource for knowledge about our decaying world; literally hundreds of people were tweeting at me and emailing me asking me to add things to the list or notifying me of changes. Unable to dedicate enough of my time to make the site useful and comprehensive, Is It Canceled Yet? became just another thing that was canceled.  &lt;em&gt;—T.C. Sottek &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vULbAa"&gt;
&lt;p id="kvrxg7"&gt;I moved into my own apartment two weeks before New York locked down. It’s the first time I’ve ever lived alone in the city — a longtime dream realized after years of meticulous saving and roommates who didn’t understand the concept of chores. I spent the days immediately after my move eating pizza on the floor and wishing I never had to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfDPmm"&gt;The weeks that followed had no real shape. I remember dodging around other New Yorkers on the street to keep six feet between us when we were being told not to wear masks. That I had a healthy supply of hand sanitizer already from years of covering gaming conventions. How being out after sundown suddenly felt illicit; how being out at all felt dangerous. Dread and dark humor held hands during my unexpected isolation. One hour, I’d be crying hysterically until my eyes were nearly swollen shut; the next, I’d be giving myself a wax in the stupidest, most optimistic pastime I’ve had all quarantine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="on6Eto"&gt;I can’t tell you much about those first weeks or even the past year. Only a few moments have left a strong impression, and they’re best saved for therapy. But to the man who sold me this monkey’s paw: you were not clear enough on the fine print. &lt;em&gt;—Megan Farokhmanesh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="onc8Tx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, March 11, 2:27 PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Updated with additional blurbs. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify lets passengers fight over your road trip playlist, disturbing natural order of universe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xhgKUiLUSn6f_YTMN-C9RiScbjM=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949996/Polestar2_US_Launch_0027.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Polestar / Beadyeye&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wrwZXN"&gt;It’s a fundamental rule of the road: driver picks the music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8WMy7"&gt;And yet, in a brazen challenge to the immutable laws of the universe, Spotify has chosen to meddle with this golden rule by expanding its Group Session beta to cars. Starting today, up to six people in the car can all control music &lt;em&gt;at the same time&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;starting with the Android Automotive-powered Polestar 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPydN5"&gt;“We all know that sometimes the driver doesn’t have the best taste in music and my family tends to agree. The addition of Group Sessions Beta from Spotify is a great way for others in the vehicle to influence the playlist and enjoy their favorite tracks,” commented Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath, a man who clearly cannot be trusted with playlist powers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1OCUa"&gt;Group Session rolled out last year as a beta and is limited to Spotify premium subscribers; once a host starts a session, up to five other users can join, giving them full (shared) control over the playlist and the power to play, pause, and skip tracks at will. And sure, it’s a useful feature when you’re hanging out with friends in the low-stakes environments of a barbecue or a dinner party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGxeQg"&gt;Fortunately, there are safeguards: the driver will still apparently have the power to revoke access at any time (because, again, &lt;em&gt;driver picks the music!&lt;/em&gt;). But when it comes the delicate balance of an hourslong road trip, Spotify is still playing with fire here. Do you &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;want to risk your friend bombarding you with Nickelback songs every other track for the entire drive to Pittsburgh? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFgkRb"&gt;That said, the potential descent into carpool chaos is limited, for now. The expanded Group Session beta is &lt;a href="https://www.polestar.com/us/press/press-release/polestar-2-now-features-spotify-group-sessions-beta"&gt;only available in the Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt; — currently the only car on the market that runs Android Automotive — but presumably, as Google’s smart car platform continues to arrive on more cars in the future, it’ll be more broadly available. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NFTs, explained</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CUwmt6PC9yCHDThvasRp_NBDs7Q=/0x70:1252x905/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68904498/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.21.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/kitty/896775" target="_blank"&gt;Cryptokitties.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m3ofto"&gt;There’s nothing like an explosion of blockchain news to leave you thinking, “Um… what’s going on here?” That’s the feeling I’ve experienced while reading about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22308075/grimes-nft-6-million-sales-nifty-gateway-warnymph"&gt;Grimes getting millions of dollars for NFTs&lt;/a&gt; or about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287956/nyan-cat-crypto-art-foundation-nft-sale-chris-torres"&gt;Nyan Cat being sold as one&lt;/a&gt;. And by the time we all thought we sort of knew what the deal was, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316320/jack-dorsey-original-tweet-nft-cent-valuables"&gt;the founder of Twitter put an autographed tweet&lt;/a&gt; up for sale as an NFT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vZyml"&gt;You might be wondering: what is an NFT, anyhow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qq4l9b"&gt;After literal hours of reading, I think I know. I also think I’m going to cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vM2Wj0"&gt;Okay, let’s start with the basics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="y3hj8i"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an NFT? What does NFT stand for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XAkRR1"&gt;Non-fungible token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lwjaI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That doesn’t make it any clearer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBCh6D"&gt;Right, sorry. “Non-fungible” more or less means that it’s unique and can’t be replaced with something else. For example, a bitcoin is fungible — trade one for another bitcoin, and you’ll have exactly the same thing. A one-of-a-kind trading card, however, is non-fungible. If you traded it for a different card, you’d have something completely different. You gave up a Squirtle, and got a 1909 T206 Honus Wagner, which &lt;em&gt;StadiumTalk&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.stadiumtalk.com/s/most-expensive-baseball-cards-985687df1bbe45c5"&gt;calls “the Mona Lisa of baseball cards.&lt;/a&gt;” (I’ll take their word for it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HudKGN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do NFTs work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MbvoGM"&gt;At a very high level, most NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, like bitcoin or dogecoin, but its blockchain also supports these NFTs, which store extra information that makes them work differently from, say, an ETH coin. It is worth noting that other blockchains can implement their own versions of NFTs. (&lt;a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/tron-introduces-nft-standard-trc-721"&gt;Some already have&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ifr4y9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s worth picking up at the NFT supermarket?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbHk7K"&gt;NFTs can really be anything digital (such as drawings, music, your brain downloaded and turned into an AI), but a lot of the current excitement is around using the tech to sell digital art. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vAcH3qsbkwApyVu4-Zl-AJ1hXFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341197/doge.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dogecoin isn’t an NFT. But this GIF of a dogecoin is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Go0IlP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mean, like, people buying my good tweets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4V58lf"&gt;I don’t think anyone can stop you, but that’s not really what I meant. A lot of the conversation is about NFTs as &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/nfts-guide-nonfungible-tokens-cryptomedia-trend-ownership-internet/"&gt;an evolution of fine art collecting&lt;/a&gt;, only with digital art. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLI5c1"&gt;(Side note, when coming up with the line “buying my good tweets,” we were trying to think of something so silly that it wouldn’t be a real thing. So &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316320/jack-dorsey-original-tweet-nft-cent-valuables"&gt;the founder of Twitter would take a shot at it&lt;/a&gt; just days after we posted the article.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qaSIX4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do people really think this will become like art collecting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ig7cLB"&gt;I’m sure some people really hope so — like whoever paid almost $390,000 for a &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x948b3515d81034a3c16d5393c6c155946c93c103/1"&gt;50-second video by Grimes&lt;/a&gt; or the person who paid $6.6 million for &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/secondary/0x12f28e2106ce8fd8464885b80ea865e98b465149/100010001"&gt;a video by Beeple&lt;/a&gt;. Actually, one of Beeple’s pieces &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;was auctioned at Christie’s&lt;/a&gt;, the famou—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q3dcQxqw8oMubtaqyVI6ZzIM37o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341206/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.31.26_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Beeple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoink!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i77Dld"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sorry, I was busy right-clicking on that Beeple video and downloading the same file the person paid millions of dollars for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNNHsj"&gt;Wow, rude. But yeah, that’s where it &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nfts-boom-collectors-shell-out-crypto/"&gt;gets a bit awkward&lt;/a&gt;. You can copy a digital file as many times as you want, including the art that’s included with an NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmQtyf"&gt;But NFTs are designed to give you something that can’t be copied: ownership of the work (though the artist can still retain the copyright and reproduction rights, just like with physical artwork). To put it in terms of physical art collecting: anyone can buy a Monet print. But only one person can own the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWoqGE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No shade to Beeple, but the video isn’t really a Monet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBUNfq"&gt;What do you think of &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/secondary/0x4140783cc1ba30653a0777126b122931e233ba14/1300010027"&gt;the $3,600 Gucci Ghost&lt;/a&gt;? Also, you didn’t let me finish earlier. That image that Beeple was auctioning off at Christie’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;ended up selling for $69 million&lt;/a&gt;, which, by the way, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-monet-painting-auction-20140626-story.html"&gt;is $15 million more than Monet’s painting &lt;em&gt;Nymphéas&lt;/em&gt; sold for&lt;/a&gt; in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zeTKAEvLmop3TJky4G1whbuRXB0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341209/GucciGhost.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Trevor Andrew&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This last sold for $3,600, but the current owner is asking for $16,300.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lGn9Ci"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whoever got that Monet can actually appreciate it as a physical object. With digital art, a copy is literally as good as the original.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WyUKa"&gt;But the &lt;em&gt;flex &lt;/em&gt;of owning an original Beeple...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juDtL1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6d92bZ"&gt;That really depends on whether you’re an artist or a buyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dt7KYi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m an artist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ1eqE"&gt;First off: I’m proud of you. Way to go. You might be interested in NFTs because it gives you a way to sell work that there otherwise might not be much of a market for. If you come up with a really cool digital sticker idea, what are you going to do? Sell it on the iMessage App Store? No way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIsq2g"&gt;Also, NFTs have a feature that you can enable that will pay you a percentage every time &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/nft-art-boom-is-the-same-concept-as-the-photography-market?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;the NFT is sold or changes hands&lt;/a&gt;, making sure that if your work gets super popular and balloons in value, you’ll see some of that benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7oBax"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m a buyer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwjNxk"&gt;One of the obvious benefits of buying art is it lets you financially support artists you like, and that’s true with NFTs (which are way trendier than, like, Telegram stickers). Buying an NFT also usually gets you some basic usage rights, like being able to post the image online or set it as your profile picture. Plus, of course, there are bragging rights that you own the art, with a blockchain entry to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVWIC6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, I meant I’m a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;collector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYjdCo"&gt;Ah, okay, yes. NFTs can work &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/nft-art-boom-is-the-same-concept-as-the-photography-market?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;like any other speculative asset&lt;/a&gt;, where you buy it and hope that the value of it goes up one day, so you can sell it for a profit. I feel kind of dirty for talking about that, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuKmlZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So every NFT is unique?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91YTgt"&gt;In the boring, technical sense that every NFT is a unique token on the blockchain. But while it could be like a van Gogh, where there’s only one definitive actual version, it could also be like a trading card, where there’s 50 or hundreds of numbered copies of the same artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09JRP3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for what basically amounts to a trading card?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQVHLe"&gt;Well, that’s part of what makes NFTs so messy. Some people treat them like they’re the future of fine art collecting (read: as a playground for the mega-rich), and some people treat them like Pokémon cards (where they’re accessible to normal people but also a playground for the mega-rich). Speaking of Pokémon cards, Logan Paul just sold some NFTs relating to a million-dollar box of the—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1JJGI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please stop. I hate where this is going.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/laUmvyGGiD-HsDas7TBDZall_n4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341219/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.39.12_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Logan Paul&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ve activated my trap card (which sold for $17,000).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Mv0A8X"&gt;Yeah, he sold NFT video clips, which are just clips from a video you can watch on YouTube anytime you want, &lt;a href="https://shopnfts.net/"&gt;for up to $20,000&lt;/a&gt;. He also sold NFTs of a Logan Paul Pokémon card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gh63Tc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who paid $20,000 for a video clip of Logan Paul?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWkQs7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Calvinn_Hobbes/status/746227239755251712?s=20"&gt;A fool and their money are soon parted&lt;/a&gt;, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8ZNFb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It would be hilarious if Logan Paul decided to sell 50 more NFTs of the exact same video.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXPBux"&gt;Linkin Park’s Mike Shinoda (who also sold some NFTs that included a song) &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/linkin-park-mike-shinoda-happy-endings-nft-interview"&gt;actually talked about that&lt;/a&gt;. It’s totally a thing someone could do if they were, in his words, “an opportunist crooked jerk.” I’m not saying that Logan Paul is that, just that you should be careful who you buy from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="611ErY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I buy this article as an NFT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cw2A6d"&gt;No, but technically anything digital could be sold as an NFT. deadmau5 has sold digital animated stickers. William Shatner has sold &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/william-shatners-nft-collectibles-sell-out-at-warp-speed"&gt;Shatner-themed trading cards&lt;/a&gt; (one of which was apparently an X-ray of his teeth).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1DjDJOZf5-4jdVe9fHSNlrMuXD0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341226/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.43.12_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This one I like. Maybe not for $700, but...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e0DpEJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gross. Actually, could I buy someone’s teeth as an NFT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2y73FL"&gt;There have been some attempts at connecting NFTs to real-world objects, often as a sort of verification method. Nike has patented a method to &lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/12/10/nike-blockchain-sneakers-cryptokick-patent/"&gt;verify sneakers’ authenticity using an NFT system, which it calls CryptoKicks&lt;/a&gt;. But so far, I haven’t found any teeth, no. I’m scared to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRUxvr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look? Where? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEbiIN"&gt;There are several marketplaces that have popped up around NFTs, which allow people to buy and sell. These include OpenSea, Rarible, and Grimes’ choice, Nifty Gateway, but there are plenty of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwUvnp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve heard there were kittens involved. Tell me about the kittens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zszcnd"&gt;NFTs really became technically possible when the Ethereum blockchain added support for them &lt;a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/"&gt;as part of a new standard&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, one of the first uses was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoKitties"&gt;a game called CryptoKitties&lt;/a&gt; that allowed users to trade and sell virtual kittens. Thank you, internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkghYZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love kittens&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgMnW6"&gt;Not as much as &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/cryptokitties-bought-a-digital-cat-for-172000/"&gt;the person who paid over $170,000 for one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uedrnj7kfMuTOKIghiRp4yUtLOk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341171/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.21.50_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/kitty/896775" target="_blank"&gt;Cryptokitties.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My face when I’m worth $170K.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yFaF1c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arrrrrggggg!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JD0ynI"&gt;Same. But in my opinion, the kittens show that one of the most interesting aspects of NFTs (for those of us not looking to create a digital dragon’s lair of art) is how they can be used in games. There are &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/26/the-deanbeat-how-non-fungible-tokens-nfts-will-change-games/"&gt;already games&lt;/a&gt; that let you have NFTs as items. One even sells virtual plots of land as NFTs. There could be opportunities for players to buy a unique in-game gun or helmet or whatever as an NFT, which would be a flex that most people could actually appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kk4a1a"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could I pull off a museum heist to steal NFTs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-wuFlpK8EGVxFIUYTKb0hFd3pBM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341161/robbery.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousers&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This image is not an NFT. Yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rBINrG"&gt;That depends. Part of the allure of blockchain is that it stores a record of each time a transaction takes place, making it harder to steal and flip than, say, a painting hanging in a museum. That said, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49177705"&gt;cryptocurrencies have been stolen before&lt;/a&gt;, so it really would depend on how the NFT is being stored and how much work a potential victim would be willing to put in to get their stuff back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAPTND"&gt;Note: Please don’t steal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnhPUz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I be worried about digital art being around in 500 years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIQPdV"&gt;Probably. Bit rot is a real thing: image quality deteriorates, file formats can’t be opened anymore, websites go down, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227535/nyt-bitcoin-millions-forgot-passwords-digital-wallet"&gt;people forget the password to their wallets&lt;/a&gt;. But physical art in museums is also &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETAcIbzOTYs"&gt;shockingly fragile&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6zH8E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to maximize my blockchain use. Can I buy NFTs with cryptocurrencies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QU56ST"&gt;Yes. Probably. A lot of the marketplaces accept Ethereum. But technically, anyone can sell an NFT, and they could ask for whatever currency they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZmGbU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will trading my Logan Paul NFTs contribute to global warming and melt Greenland?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOtuLt"&gt;It’s definitely something to look out for. Since NFTs use the same blockchain technology as cryptocurrencies, they could also end up using a lot of electricity per transaction. There are people working &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/ethereum-plans-to-cut-its-absurd-energy-consumption-by-99-percent"&gt;on mitigations for this issue&lt;/a&gt;, but so far they haven’t been implemented yet. There have been a few cases where artists have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jacksfilms/status/1369070588136845313?s=20"&gt;decided to not sell&lt;/a&gt; NFTs, or to cancel future drops &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nfts-hot-effect-earth-climate/"&gt;after hearing about the effects they could have on climate change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23nZ0d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I build an underground art cave / bunker to store my NFTs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhQ69E"&gt;Well, like cryptocurrencies, NFTs are stored in digital wallets (though it is worth noting that the wallet does specifically have to be NFT-compatible). You could always put the wallet on a computer in an underground bunker, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UXB6fZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you tired of typing “NFT”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNFTvl"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RM05sp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 5th, 8:07 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added the news that Jack Dorsey was selling one of his tweets as an NFT because I originally made a joke and cannot believe it actually happened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEpRTA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 11th, 1:42PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added the news that Beeple’s piece sold for $69 million and added more information to the climate change section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Four years later, we are all BBC Dad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="bbc-dad" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7MqC6B5cOwCis4zqXfPgpXrEaho=/0x0:771x514/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949809/personal_space_bbc_dad_kids_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WNT1VP"&gt;Four years ago yesterday, a meme was born: professor Robert Kelly, who will be forever known as “BBC Dad,” had &lt;em&gt;the gall&lt;/em&gt; to get interrupted by his kids during a live video interview &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/10/asia/bbc-interview-robert-kelly-children-trnd/"&gt;broadcast around the world&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WNrSuM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you aren’t feeling old yet, here’s the daughter in that video above &lt;a href="https://t.co/meL81Rd0fM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/meL81Rd0fM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Phil_Lewis_/status/1369628467394936832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T20iXn"&gt;I remember thinking: isn’t this just a cute video? Why would anyone drag him for working at home? But of course I’d see things that way, seeing how I’ve spent most of the past decade working from a home office myself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCOsMq"&gt;Initially, BBC Dad had to &lt;em&gt;own it&lt;/em&gt;. He had to lean into the meme, making his kids part of his public persona and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195340/bbc-dad-work-from-home-calls-south-korea"&gt;even featuring them in later interviews&lt;/a&gt;. Even today, he’s &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; trying to explain that yes, he WAS wearing pants at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qlctIs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;like this. It is genuinely the comedy of errors you see in the vid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;B. You didn't stand up to usher out your kids, bc you weren't wearing pants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have no dignity left ‍♂️. I remained seated, bc the show must go on. I'd done enough TV by then to know that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pic: James at Xmas &lt;a href="https://t.co/gUOXL04p9h"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gUOXL04p9h&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Robert E Kelly (@Robert_E_Kelly) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Robert_E_Kelly/status/1369804666771447809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="66qqfx"&gt;The kids-interrupting-the-call part, though? Not so much. Everyone understands that now. You or someone in your family or circle of friends has &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; BBC Dad, making some hilarious gaff in a work call, counting yourselves lucky &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276998/tom-emmer-coronavirus-relief-lawyer-cat-house-financial-services"&gt;your upside-down floating head&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/2/9/22274865/zoom-hearing-cat-filter-lawyer-texas-live-court-hearing"&gt;deep-seated-desire to become a cat&lt;/a&gt; didn’t get shared with the entire world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93smHy"&gt;We’ve lost an awful lot in the COVID-19 pandemic, but one incredibly tiny silver lining is that remote work is better understood now. I don’t need to explain to anyone that my desk is my office, or that kids will magically phase in and out of my video calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvqtQv"&gt;Okay, that felt a little somber. Let’s end on a brighter note! &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jul/06/can-i-have-two-biscuits-the-best-of-kids-interrupting-television-interviews"&gt;Here are more children interrupting live video interviews&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Hyundai Staria is the coolest-looking minivan in years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qLs-jPQto9v5om6r10Dr7Hm9qVo=/403x614:3775x2862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949721/_Photo_3__STARIA_Premium_EXT.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Hyundai&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IqvMus"&gt;Minivans are &lt;a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2020/02/minivan-market-share-is-now-at-2-percent-in-america-and-its-rapidly-getting-worse/"&gt;pretty much dead&lt;/a&gt; in the US, but Hyundai’s new Staria looks so slick that it makes me believe there could be a revival some day soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvUhhQ"&gt;Revealed &lt;a href="https://news.hyundaimotorgroup.com/MediaCenter/News/Press-Releases/Hyundai-Motor-Offers-First-Peek-at-STARIA-New-MPV-with-Premium-and-Futuristic-Design-#none"&gt;in teaser images on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, the Staria is easily the coolest-looking minivan since the spaceship-styled ones that prevailed in the 1980s. In fact, Hyundai describes the Staria’s exterior as “strikingly futuristic and mysterious ... resembling a spaceship” in the press release, so maybe this is just my personal preference for this style showing. But whether or not you like it, the Staria is certainly one of the most mold-breaking vans that we’ve seen in a long time — especially considering that modern minivans have basically mutated into &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2022-kia-carnival-first-look-review/"&gt;really large SUVs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zyAbdS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10386691"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fiIh1e"&gt;Hyundai hasn’t provided dimensions, but the Staria is nothing like that. Its stubby nose and exterior proportions seem to more closely resemble the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/06/the-nissan-van-taxi-that-will-rule-nycs-streets-is-actually-great/"&gt;Nissan vans that make up part of New York City’s yellow taxi fleet&lt;/a&gt; or a small delivery van.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zy7gYE"&gt;But Hyundai has taken that basic shape and given it a retro-futuristic spin that clearly tracks with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"&gt;new design language it’s been developing for cars like the forthcoming Ioniq 5 EV&lt;/a&gt;. The interior also looks pleasantly roomy, with big windows and a panoramic windshield that stretches up above the driver’s head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="font-size"&gt;Hyundai hasn’t said whether the Staria will be electric, or where it will be sold. (More details are expected “in the coming weeks.”) I wouldn’t exactly bet money on the former being true, and given the sad state of minivan sales in the US, it’s not hard to imagine Hyundai being cautious about bringing the Staria here regardless of its powertrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fsMw7"&gt;But one thing’s for sure: Hyundai Motor Group’s designers are pushing the look of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323438/kia-ev6-electric-car-hyundai-apple-platform"&gt;company’s new vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in really daring ways, and the Staria is the latest example. Now if the company could only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299121/hyundai-kona-electric-recall-battery-fire-lg"&gt;get a handle&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2021/03/09/kia-recall-optima-soul-forte-sorento/4642536001/"&gt;quality assurance&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bumble’s new Night In feature is an attempt to break the ice on virtual dates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aMPb9_kf2lvnrCdwWybYJgsQmKM=/113x0:1807x1129/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949238/Night_In_Press_w_logo.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bumble&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xWxfjD"&gt;Dating app Bumble has announced Night In, a new feature that lets you play games on a virtual date. The feature is available to users in the US and Canada, and the game available at launch is a series of trivia questions you can answer together. However, Bumble says it plans to offer more games and virtual experiences in the “near future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USOJAz"&gt;Night In is an expansion of Bumble’s existing video dates feature, which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19121374/bumble-dating-app-video-voice-chat-call-first-date"&gt;launched back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The feature has seen a marked increase in demand as a result of the pandemic; Bumble says its voice and video calling features were used 70 percent more after the pandemic started. Hopefully, being able to play a game will act as a nice icebreaker and help mitigate some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324221/tinder-bumble-video-virtual-dating-calls-feature-whyd-you-push-that-button-podcast"&gt;more awkward elements of virtual dates&lt;/a&gt;, even if they’ll never match the intimacy of being in the same room as another person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9mF730"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bumble added video dates in 2019&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j8MiuN"&gt;Bumble’s Night In can be organized using the icon in a chat message. The virtual date can be scheduled ahead of time for between 6PM and midnight on any day of the week. Once scheduled, both participants will be sent reminders and notifications by the app ahead of the date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZlxYM"&gt;Bumble’s video chat features were in place before the pandemic, but other dating apps like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21316317/tinder-face-to-face-rollout-video-calls"&gt;Tinder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21209801/hinge-video-call-chat-date-from-home-feature-launch"&gt;Hinge&lt;/a&gt; have had to rush to catch up over the past year. Although the introduction of these features was undoubtedly influenced by the pandemic, it sounds like they might live on after this current era of social distancing. In a recent survey, Bumble says almost half of respondents in the US said they preferred a first date to be virtual rather than in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqj0KM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RvQUYx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Maps will soon let you draw on a map to fix it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3m6HgJn1optvQNEvBo0G239qLD4=/349x33:2880x1720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949184/Screen_Shot_2021_03_10_at_4.14.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gFgh7D"&gt;If you’ve ever been frustrated by a road simply &lt;em&gt;not existing&lt;/em&gt; on Google Maps, the company’s now making it easier than ever to add it. Google will be updating its map editing experience to allow users to add missing roads and realign, rename or delete incorrect ones. It calls the experience “drawing,” but it’s closer to using the line tool in Microsoft Paint. The updated tool should be “rolling out over the coming months in more than 80 countries,” &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/three-new-ways-anyone-can-update-google-maps/?_ga=2.110865477.1901867856.1615485216-809046695.1615485216"&gt;according to a blog post.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYTXZ9"&gt;Currently, if you try to add a missing road, you can only drop a pin where the road should be and type in the road’s name to submit that information to Google. The new tool should make it easier to not only add missing roads, but to make corrections such as fixing a road’s name or its direction (for example, if the road is one-way but Google Maps says it isn’t).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eiqj_-8RcexSEqLoJYwumqUF1y0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361266/Google_Map_edit.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new map editor lets users visually add in missing roads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gvcz9706AtSAqAifoTJUNShJvzM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361359/Screen_Shot_2021_03_10_at_4.03.36_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The current correction screen is more rudimentary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GP5pNI"&gt;Of course, Google will still be vetting your corrections to make sure they’re accurate. After you submit a change with the new tool, you’ll see a screen where Google warns that it doesn’t want a bike path to be marked as a road, or for someone to make a road intended to hurt people, for example. That screen also says that it’ll take about seven days for the company to review your submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJfd5n"&gt;Google Maps will also be getting a feature called “photo updates” which will let you share small details about a place without having to leave a full review. In the app, you’ll be able add images of a location as well as see recent photos with text snippets others have submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vUCJ34xkgfJ6ORb1AcAYh_Rwnfs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361222/Photo_Updates_Hero_Image___Updates_Tab.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updates should help surface the most recent information about a location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
