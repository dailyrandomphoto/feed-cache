    <title>Apple patches HomeKit denial-of-service bug with new iOS update</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9h7iO0"&gt;On Wednesday, Apple released the 15.2.1 version of iOS, a minor update to the mobile operating system that fixes bugs, including a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22865145/apple-ios-vulnerability-homekit-devices-bug-crash"&gt;denial-of-service vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; previously reported by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvcEXU"&gt;The 15.2.1 patch addresses a vulnerability triggered through HomeKit, the software API for connecting smart home devices to iOS applications. If the vulnerability was exploited, HomeKit devices labeled with a very long name would cause iPhones and iPads to endlessly freeze, crash, and reboot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTLX5z"&gt;Since HomeKit device names are backed up to iCloud, signing in to the same iCloud account with a restored device would trigger the crash again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pec8D"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213043"&gt;security notification&lt;/a&gt; for the 15.2.1 update lists only one change, a fix for the HomeKit vulnerability. Details of the fix state that a “resource exhaustion issue was addressed with improved input validation,” presumably to prevent long HomeKit device names from being read into memory by iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQUHsu"&gt;Besides security updates, the patch also fixed a bug that impacted performance of third-party CarPlay apps and another that prevented the Messages app from loading certain photos sent via iCloud. Users can update iOS by opening the Settings app on a device and tapping “General,” then selecting “Software Update.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1RE9TA"&gt;The HomeKit bug was discovered by security researcher Trevor Spiniolas, who &lt;a href="https://trevorspiniolas.com/doorlock/doorlock.html"&gt;published details on his blog&lt;/a&gt; on January 1st. At the time, Spiniolas accused Apple of being slow to respond to his initial disclosure, which was made in August 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTr7iW"&gt;According to Spiniolas’ blog, the bug affects iOS versions at least as far back as 14.7 and likely before, meaning these devices are still vulnerable. Owners of iPhones or iPads should update their devices as soon as possible to benefit from the new update.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>White House to launch COVID test-ordering site ‘by this weekend,’ reports say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks On December Jobs Report" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ESXaI3ZMlyuyfKWUKsktcjkKv0=/0x0:3744x2496/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70379978/1363303992.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uFIl1L"&gt;On Wednesday, a senior White House adviser said that a government-run website to order COVID-19 rapid tests “should be online by this weekend,” according to new reporting &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffRBennett/status/1481273604729974790?s=20"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;PBS NewsHour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Tests should start arriving this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7kAcw"&gt;The promise comes weeks after President Joe Biden announced that Americans would soon be able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848887/joe-biden-google-free-covid-test-near-me"&gt;order 500 million free COVID tests directly from the government&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ll have websites where you can get them delivered to your home,” Biden said in a speech on December 21st as the Omicron variant surged across the country. In prior remarks from White House press secretary Jen Psaki, the website would go live “as soon as these tests are available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cxfLy6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The website would go live “as soon as these tests are available”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kPttlG"&gt;Still, the White House has yet to provide any additional details about the website, like its exact launch date or how many tests a person is allowed to order at one time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXg4mi"&gt;The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhnRxX"&gt;The news comes on the heels of the Biden administration announcing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878196/covid-at-home-insurance-white-house-testing"&gt;a new policy&lt;/a&gt; requiring insurance companies to reimburse up to eight over-the-counter at-home &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-cb49a8458f33a698c3a4f3b721835270"&gt;COVID-19 tests starting January 15th&lt;/a&gt;. Under this new policy, details of which were &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/01/10/biden-harris-administration-requires-insurance-companies-group-health-plans-to-cover-cost-at-home-covid-19-tests-increasing-access-free-tests.html"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; by the Department of Health and Human Services on Monday, Americans will either have to purchase tests through their insurance or submit receipts for reimbursement. A family of four would be eligible for up to eight tests per person, per month.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kH1ODp"&gt;In addition to the new government-run website and insurance reimbursement policy, the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-protect-americans-against-the-delta-and-omicron-variants-as-we-battle-covid-19-this-winter/"&gt;is planning&lt;/a&gt; to provide 50 million free, at-home tests to community health centers and rural clinics across the country and to establish over 20,000 free community-based testing sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLDvts"&gt;In his December speech, Biden also announced that the administration is working with Google to make it easier for Americans to find testing locations when they search for testing sites through the search engine. Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848887/joe-biden-google-free-covid-test-near-me"&gt;Google spokesperson Lara Levin told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the testing arrangements are part of the company’s ongoing work “to make testing (and then vaccine) info available in Search and Maps.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wordle copycat creator apologizes for ripping off the popular free word game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QI4CLuAU4fDwKZ3zDFtV_GDFWpM=/16x0:1110x729/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70379829/IMG_3664.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WB6fzi"&gt;Developer Zach Shakked — the creator of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878752/wordle-app-store-review-copies-advertisements-in-app-purchase"&gt;one of several controversial copycat versions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"&gt;Josh Wardle’s popular free word-guessing game&lt;/a&gt; — has responded to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22879295/wordle-clones-app-store-removal-online-backlash-copycats"&gt;Apple removing his app from the App Store&lt;/a&gt; after an internet backlash that followed his boasting about the money-making potential of his clone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QEfPSu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The App Store clones are here to profit off Wordle’s success","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878752/wordle-app-store-review-copies-advertisements-in-app-purchase"},{"title":"The Wordle clones have disappeared from the App Store","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22879295/wordle-clones-app-store-removal-online-backlash-copycats"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="id__wm1k9nlxcnl"&gt;“I realize I crossed a line. And I surely, surely will never do anything remotely close to this again. I fucked up,” tweeted Shakked. He goes on to explain that “Wordle” itself wasn’t trademarked and that Wardle’s game was similar to &lt;em&gt;Lingo&lt;/em&gt;, an older TV game show with a similar word-guessing mechanic. Shakked also says that he planned to expand on &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; with more functionality and change the overall design of the app to less resemble Wardle’s own game, had he been able to before Apple removed his app from the store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TYhRpw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here were my calculations: &lt;br&gt;a) Wordle is a ripoff of another game&lt;br&gt;b) Wordle the word isn't trademarked and there's a bunch of other unrelated word apps named the same thing&lt;br&gt;c) Wow, I'll hack together something on the weekend and see if I can make a buck&lt;/p&gt;— Zach (@zachshakked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zachshakked/status/1481129425706143746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AdMCXq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; has skyrocketed to popularity over the past several weeks, with its minimalist design, bite-sized daily puzzles, and the now-iconic grids of grey, yellow, and green squares. The original game is completely free and solely played through a web browser, leaving an opportunity for any number of copycats to try and make a quick buck off the concept on the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNlc1Y"&gt;Shakked’s clone (called “Wordle – The App”) was one of the more high-profile copies, thanks to the developer’s celebratory tweets about the project and the eyebrow-raising price tag — an optional $30-per-year annual subscription that would allow players to play an unlimited number of puzzles, instead of &lt;em&gt;Wordle’s&lt;/em&gt; one-per-day system. Shakked’s tweets also rubbed many the wrong way, boasting about how many downloads and subscription trials his app was getting and how it was “going to the fucking moon.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PC0egQlWYDuS8aif0492gVf8eRA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163917/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_12.49.58.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="79RPln"&gt;Shortly after reports of &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; knockoffs broke, Apple leapt into action, removing the offending apps from the App Store last night. Currently, there are only two puzzle games called “Wordle” left on Apple’s storefront, both of which offer very different types of word games than Wardle’s viral hit and which predate the web app by a number of years. (Incidentally, the other Wordles appear to be greatly benefiting from Wardle’s game’s success, with both apps rocketing up the App Store charts). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TSQLa"&gt;In a separate thread, Shakked also says that he spoke to Wardle and offered to license the idea, work together to develop an official app, or pay him a percentage of any profit, which Wardle reportedly declined. Shakked also claims that he told Wardle that he would “consider changing the name” before the app was removed entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZShMk"&gt;Wardle, for what it’s worth, has already been extremely clear about the idea of monetizing &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; (which, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html"&gt;as he explained in a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; interview&lt;/a&gt;, was originally created as a gift for his partner). “I think people kind of appreciate that there’s this thing online that’s just fun,” Wardle said. “It’s not trying to do anything shady with your data or your eyeballs. It’s just a game that’s fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpw8zj"&gt;The aftermath of the blowback seems to have soured Shakked (who had previously complained on Twitter about how “[s]hameless copy/pasting ideas/features will get you nowhere”) on the idea of copycat apps in the future. “I’ll go back to creating apps based on my completely, evergreen, original ideas and never fuck with anything remotely like this again,” Shakked’s thread concludes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6PM50"&gt;Zach Shakked did not respond to request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California is ‘revisiting’ Tesla’s Full Self-Driving beta in light of ‘dangerous’ videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BYydTxgy_G2g269Vl3XhRKO1HU4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70379791/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="17AXjg"&gt;The California Department of Motor Vehicles is “revisiting” its opinion to not regulate Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software. The news comes after numerous safety advocates and regulators have expressed concern about the company’s willingness to allow its customers to test its &lt;a href="https://www.sae.org/blog/sae-j3016-update"&gt;Level 2 driving feature&lt;/a&gt; in public. (The news was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-01-11/dmv-message-to-legislatures-ontesla-full-self-driving-safety-its-not-our-job"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7dM4B"&gt;The state’s DMV oversees the largest autonomous vehicle testing program in the country, with over 60 companies permitted to operate test vehicles on public roads. Only a handful are approved to operate fully autonomous vehicles without safety drivers at the wheel, and even fewer have been approved to deploy vehicles for commercial purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1T2aUG"&gt;Unlike other companies doing autonomous vehicle testing in the state, Tesla is using its own customers, rather than trained safety drivers, to monitor the technology. Tesla owners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/7/22872865/elon-musk-tesla-raise-price-full-self-driving-software"&gt;have to pay $12,000 for the FSD option&lt;/a&gt;, up from $10,000 as of last month. Tesla does have 32 vehicles registered with the DMV, but it routinely reports few or no miles driven in autonomous mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jEXo49"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla is using its own customers, rather than trained safety drivers, to monitor the technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jyybe6"&gt;The DMV has stated in the past that Tesla’s FSD doesn’t fall under its autonomous vehicle testing program because it still requires a human driver to monitor the vehicle. But in a letter sent to State Senator Lena Gonzalez, the agency now says it is “revisiting” that decision. (Gonzalez is not to be confused with Lorena Gonzelez, a member of the California State Assembly, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lorenasgonzalez/status/1259287879177531392"&gt;who once tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “F*ck Elon Musk.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ep3BNM"&gt;In the letter, DMV director Steve Gordon said the agency previously concluded that FSD beta “fell outside the scope of DMV autonomous vehicles regulations” but that it recently informed Tesla that it would be revisiting that decision “following recent software updates, videos showing a dangerous use of that technology, open investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and the opinions of other experts in this space.” (NHTSA is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa"&gt;investigating incidents involving Tesla cars operating with Autopilot that have crashed&lt;/a&gt; into parked emergency vehicles.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2lWcZ"&gt;“If the capabilities of the feature meet the definition of an autonomous vehicle per California’s law and regulations, DMV will take steps to make certain that Tesla operates under the appropriate autonomous vehicle permits,” Gordon writes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Mb4Wg6"&gt;Gordon goes on to note that the DMV conducted several demonstrations of FSD beta and, after consulting with experts at UC Berkeley, concluded that it was a Level 2 system. During a November 2020 demo, the DMV found that “[t]he vehicle could not safely complete the entire task of driving on its own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJkvrA"&gt;Gordon also cites a letter from Tesla, in which the company laid out a list of “limitations... including not being able to recognize or respond to ‘static objects, road debris, emergency vehicles, construction zones, large uncontrolled intersections, adverse weather, complicated vehicles in the driving path, and unmapped roads.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gfYr8Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The DMV is also “reviewing” Tesla’s use of the term “Full Self-Driving”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ax2VPR"&gt;The DMV is also “reviewing” Tesla’s use of the term “Full Self-Driving” in its branding, which has been criticized by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22682272/ntsb-official-tesla-safety-elon-musk-full-self-driving"&gt;experts and government officials as misleading to customers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9QrKT6"&gt;Depending on where the DMV lands, Tesla could find itself subject to a whole bunch of new regulatory headaches. Companies that test autonomous vehicles in California are required to report any vehicle crashes, no matter how minor, in addition to the frequency at which human drivers were forced to take control of their autonomous vehicles (called a “disengagement”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZV6pha"&gt;A spokesperson for Senator Gonzalez said she was still reviewing the letter. A spokesperson for the DMV did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did a spokesperson for Tesla, which disbanded its press department in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ItewRn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ygybcp"&gt;It has taken nearly 10 years, but Windows is finally getting a new modern volume indicator. Originally introduced in Windows 8 in 2012, the black bar that pops up when you adjust the system volume using a keyboard or other device is finally going away. Microsoft is replacing it with a volume indicator that matches the overall Windows 11 design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xWcfH"&gt;Indicators for volume, brightness, camera privacy, camera on / off, and airplane mode are all being updated soon with a more modern design. “These new flyouts will appear when you press the volume or brightness keys on your laptop and will honor light/dark mode to give you a more coherent Windows experience,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2022/01/12/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22533/"&gt;explains Microsoft’s Windows Insider chief Amanda Langowski&lt;/a&gt;. “Brightness and volume indicators continue to be interactive with the update.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The updated Windows 11 taskbar and volume indicator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kSDdjQ"&gt;Alongside this design tweak, Microsoft is also allowing testing a new call experience in the Your Phone app on Windows 11. “This update includes a new in-progress call window with updated icons, fonts, and other UI changes that align with the improved design of Windows 11,” says Langowski. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KD3Bxt"&gt;This latest Windows 11 preview build, 22533, also includes an extension of touch keyboard themes to the emoji panel and elsewhere for all Dev Channel testers. If you’ve always wanted to uninstall the Clock app in Windows 11, there’s an option to do that now, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AHyt9IBEHFEGytO_zy7BpJyM56M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163897/YP_new_calls.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New calling interface for Your Phone on Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L7LYPB"&gt;Microsoft may deliver some of these changes on a monthly basis to Windows 11, as the company has moved to delivering a larger annual update for its latest OS. The software maker has not revealed exactly when these new features will appear for all Windows 11 users, but expect to see them at some point this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Magic Leap’s new AR headset is rolling out to healthcare companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Magic Leap 2 headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sh8re6TBmhn0PkKEtBz7HXPhiLw=/504x0:2376x1248/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70379646/ML_Teaser_Desktop.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.magicleap.com/en-us/news/op-ed/my-first-year-at-magic-leap-and-the-opportunity-ahead" target="_blank"&gt;Magic Leap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E0ocSw"&gt;Augmented reality headset maker Magic Leap has announced early partners for its Magic Leap 2 headset — a signal that the once consumer-focused company is still moving ahead with its enterprise-focused business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQmIyM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magic-leap-announces-health-technology-early-access-program-participants-for-magic-leap-2-301459403.html?tc=eml_cleartime"&gt;In a press release today&lt;/a&gt;, Magic Leap named four healthcare partners that are getting access to the device: clinical data visualization company SentiAR, neurotechnology company SyncThink, diagnostics company Heru, and surgical software tool Brainlab. The Magic Leap 2 is slated for more general release in mid-2022. It’s a smaller, lighter follow-up to the Magic Leap headset that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/10/17960722/magic-leap-one-creator-edition-shipping-continuous-us"&gt;debuted in 2018&lt;/a&gt;; in an interview with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Magic Leap CEO Peggy Johnson said it would be “slightly” pricier than its predecessor, which starts at $2,295.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02Qe3D"&gt;Johnson tells &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that Magic Leap sees potential for buyers in “industries that are used to wearing something on their eyes,” a category including surgeons and manufacturing workers. Magic Leap is also interested in military customers who could use the headsets for training; the company previously pursued a US Army contract &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18116939/microsoft-army-hololens-480-million-contract-magic-leap"&gt;that eventually went&lt;/a&gt; to Microsoft’s competing HoloLens headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="scqTdj"&gt;Magic Leap raised billions of dollars as a consumer headset company, but the company downscaled its plans rapidly — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315864/magic-leap-new-ceo-microsoft-business-vp-rony-abovitz-step-down"&gt;replaced its previous CEO Rony Abovitz with Johnson&lt;/a&gt; — in 2020 amid significant layoffs. It’s reportedly considered acquisition offers from other companies, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-12-magic-leap-up-for-sale.html"&gt;allegedly including&lt;/a&gt; the major healthcare player Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, but ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721345/magic-leap-500-million-funding-ar-headset"&gt;raised $500 million&lt;/a&gt; in funding for enterprise applications last year. If Magic Leap pivoted back to the consumer market, it could find itself competing with more established brands, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22819963/snap-ar-spectacles-glasses-hands-on-pictures-design-features"&gt;including Snap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22749008/facebook-oculus-project-cambria-pro-vr-ar-headset"&gt;Meta, formerly known as Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idv6D2"&gt;However, the company is apparently “absolutely” open to returning — although Johnson says that AR technology would have to become smaller and its potential applications more compelling to be worth the shift.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 and Xbox Series X will restock on Thursday for Walmart Plus subscribers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hlNr08zeaUX12iagwr-22yVLtwI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70379557/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4C9oZp"&gt;In case you hadn’t noticed, it’s becoming ever-so-slightly less of a maddening exercise to get your hands on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. Granted, it’s still harder than it should be, but recent retailer restocks have taken longer to sell out than they used to. So, here’s hoping that you’re able to purchase whichever console you want &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fearlyaccess&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;during tomorrow’s restock at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is specifically for paid Walmart Plus subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJbH1G"&gt;Starting at 3PM ET / 12PM PT on Thursday, January 13th, Walmart will offer the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 PS5 with a disc drive&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383%3Fathbdg%3DL1100&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99 PS5 console that can only play digital titles&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X-Video-Game-Console-Black%2F443574645%3Fathbdg%3DL1100&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. These consoles will be available to non-trial Walmart Plus members, meaning you actually have to opt-in to pay Walmart for the service to get access (&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Faccount%2Fplus%2Foverview&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here’s where you can sign up for Walmart Plus&lt;/a&gt;). Though, Walmart is calling these “early access” deals, perhaps suggesting that they’ll open up to non-Plus customers after a window of time. In the past, the window of exclusivity has been three hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEO0nO"&gt;To ease the checkout process, make sure you have your shipping and payment info ready to go ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mdeeQD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10971562"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="I0pbDz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10297750"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GyhutA"&gt;Some essentials for PS5 owners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gahs20"&gt;In case you plan to get lucky with buying a console today, there are several excellent games and accessories that we recommend. Starting with games, head over to this list to see the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22825859/ps5-best-games-playstation-5-sony-2021"&gt;PS5’s best games of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OfzOFX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911764"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="MapxSt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10687661"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="4jPPkA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="potP0F"&gt;Getting an Xbox Series X? Check out these add-ons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3yJrjt"&gt;If you’re on team Xbox, you may already know about Game Pass Ultimate, which gives you discounts, access to the ever-expanding catalog of Game Pass games, along with online multiplayer. You may never need to pay full price for a game for your new console. Though, whether you do want to pay full price or you just need some ideas on what to play, check out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22825913/xbox-series-x-s-best-games-microsoft-2021"&gt;Xbox’s best games of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Nvidia Shield is getting Android 11 and other upgrades</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VuVW_PvcnT5BtEWkMIzJ_U1yHXs=/130x0:1150x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70379533/SHIELD_TV_Experience_9.0_1280x680.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MErG59"&gt;The seemingly indefatigable Nvidia Shield is getting another major Android update, with the new &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2022/01/12/shield-experience-9/"&gt;Shield Software Experience Upgrade 9.0&lt;/a&gt; that adds Android 11 and a host of other upgrades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJtuji"&gt;The new update is rolling out to all Shield set-top boxes, including the original model from 2015 — which originally ran Android 5.0 Lollipop when it first launched. The latest upgrade to Android 11 gives the popular set-top box the honor of being one of the most upgraded Android devices ever released. To put that in perspective, a comparable Android phone from 2015 would be the Galaxy S6, which never got past Android Nougat (Android 7.0). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rShSYTLzaMiFOev2WsrauwRWtn8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163718/blog_preview_image_1280x680_no_copy_1.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IaVdii"&gt;In addition to updating the OS to Android 11, the latest Shield software is also bringing some other benefits. Nvidia is switching to use Google’s Gboard keyboard by default for text entry (meaning it’ll be easier to use Google Assistant in text fields), and Bluetooth support has been updated to add support for Bluetooth aptX and to automatically disconnect Bluetooth devices when the Shield enters sleep mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZOklq"&gt;Subscribers to GeForce Now will also see some new perks. The Shield now supports 4K HDR streaming for customers who pay for GeForce Now’s RTX 3080 tier (the service’s priciest level of service at $99.99 for six months). And all GeForce Now customers are getting better Twitch integration, with simultaneous gaming and streaming now available in high quality and support for more Bluetooth mice and keyboards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7gKTO"&gt;The update marks the latest for Nvidia’s set-top box hardware, which also received major software releases last year, adding things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538142/nvidia-shield-android-tv-update-redesign-discover-tab-apps"&gt;like a modern Google TV-style UI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402819/nvidia-shield-tv-update-4k-upscaling-remote-customize"&gt;improved 4K upscaling on newer Shield hardware&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8V8TJg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony says it’s still making new PS4s, but most stores aren’t selling them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="ps4 playstation 4 stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MV4zctYkXiDZSs-8CtxVU5JpKFY=/0x0:1100x733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70379517/DSCF4074.1419980353.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;ps4 playstation 4 stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UJEKiD"&gt;While many of us fall somewhere between trying to find a new-generation gaming console like the Xbox Series X / S and PlayStation 5 or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791886/ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-consoles-games-delays-supply-shorage"&gt;trying to find worthwhile gaming experiences once we have them&lt;/a&gt;, Sony tells &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-12/sony-tackles-playstation-5-shortage-by-making-more-ps4-consoles"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it’s still manufacturing new PlayStation 4s. According to the report, an internal plan had projected an end to the production of the system in 2021, but the ongoing shortages will cause the company to build about a million PS4s in 2022, according to sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cNEMix"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you really need one, Sony will still sell you a PS4 Slim for $300&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tL2OZW"&gt;Sony confirmed that PS4 production is still ongoing, providing a quote to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; saying the system “is one of the best-selling consoles ever, and there is always crossover between generations.” That fits, since it certainly feels like the PS4 should still be around — there are still new cross-generation games coming out like &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s not like you can reliably find a PS5 just sitting on store shelves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WR9Dkw"&gt;The curious thing is that, at least online, we couldn’t find many new PlayStation 4 consoles either. A check of Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart, and Target showed all the stores either lacking a listing for PlayStation 4 consoles entirely or saying they’re out of stock on new systems. Only GameStop had even a hint of a new system but only in-store, and stores within 500 miles of my location all claimed not to have any. If you absolutely must have a PS4 Slim right now, &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/consoles/console/playstation4-1tb-console.3003348"&gt;Sony will sell you one directly&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/18/15344360/sony-ps4-slim-1tb-hard-drive-announced"&gt;the same $299.99 price it’s charged since 2017&lt;/a&gt;. But you can only get one — as its site notes, “[due] to high demand, consoles are limited to 1 per household.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2tZiC"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox One lineup is in similar shape, if not worse. Prior to the launch of the Xbox Series consoles, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327330/microsoft-xbox-one-x-s-digital-edition-discontinued"&gt;told us it would discontinue the Xbox One X and Xbox One S Digital Edition while continuing production of the standard, disc-equipped Xbox One S&lt;/a&gt;. We haven’t seen an official update since, but it appears that many months have passed since anyone in the US has reported seeing a new Xbox One console on sale anywhere. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fxbox-one-s-1tb-console-starter-bundle%2F93pzdx8q3t97%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Adealstab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A Microsoft Store page is still offering bundles&lt;/a&gt;, but we couldn’t quite click the button to put one in our digital shopping cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNGGQD"&gt;Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to a question about the manufacturing status of older systems, but for now, the Xbox Series S might be the only easily obtainable gaming system that you can get brand new. Various iterations of the Nintendo Switch seem to come and go on retail websites, so it mostly depends on which model you’re looking for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpDO3B"&gt;For the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, there are signs the situation is improving. Retail drops have lasted longer and come on a more regular basis than usual. At the same time, reseller prices on sites like &lt;a href="https://stockx.pvxt.net/c/482924/530344/9060?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstockx.com%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-series-x-console-black&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;StockX&lt;/a&gt; have continued to slip. For the PlayStation 5, the recent peak for sale prices came in early November at $811, while systems are currently moving for $638. StockX sale prices for the Xbox Series X similarly have dropped over the same period, from $797 on November 4th to the $570–$580 range recently.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mpzFb6"&gt;There is no better screen in the world of tablets (yet) than the Mini LED panel on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro of 2021. While Mini LED is not super common yet — though we did see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22871890/computer-monitors-ces-2022-lg-samsung-asus-alienware-oled-qd-mini-led-ark"&gt;more of it announced at CES 2022&lt;/a&gt; — it’s appealing as it achieves deeper black levels, a high contrast ratio, and high brightness. It’s also more expensive than a traditional LCD panel, so any dollar saved can be a worthwhile one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kcfaiz"&gt;If you want that Mini LED-equipped iPad Pro, we have a solid discount to share. Apple’s Wi-Fi-equipped base 128GB storage configuration is $100 off. This model usually runs for $1,099, but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932BKSLP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling it in the silver colorway for $999. The 2021 iPad Pro also packs Apple’s stellar M1 processor, ensuring its performance can not only push all those pixels but do so with speed and with the promise of enough performance headroom to likely stay that way for years to come. If you prefer more storage, you can get the 256GB configuration for $1,099 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F385211636&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals011222" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (also $100 off). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="aYPmhE"&gt;The PowerA Fusion Pro wireless controller for Switch is an intriguing alternative to Nintendo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/24/14699044/nintendo-switch-pro-controller-hands-on-preview"&gt;Switch Pro controller&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XXTW41G?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has the Fusion Pro in its slick white-and-black colorway for $65.99, a savings of $34 off its usual price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zjE22"&gt;The PowerA Fusion Pro may be worth considering if you want to try something that’s as close as you can get to a Switch-equivalent to the Xbox Elite controller. It has customizable analog sticks and optional rear paddle buttons. When it’s wired to your Switch dock, its 3.5mm headphone jack can pipe game audio to your headphones. It also lacks some things found in the Switch Pro controller, like rumble and Amiibo support. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22608203/powera-fusion-pro-customizable-analog-sticks-paddles-nintendo-switch-controller-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lt5ZZK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10973226"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qrvxhl"&gt;From a cute white controller to a cute white camera, the Wyze Cam v3 is an inexpensive home camera that supports 1080p recording with weather resistance for outdoor use. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095NWYQBC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has it with kitted out with a spotlight LED for just $36.60, saving about $16 and making it an excellent option for monitoring a front door, like a mini flood light for a much cheaper price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cq87FF"&gt;The Wyze Cam v3 also supports both color and black-and-white night vision, so its ability to see in the dark is quite good even when the spotlight is not in use. These little cameras are some of the most affordable ones around, offering solid video quality with motion detection, two-way audio, and support for both Alexa and Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mnpk7X"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Wyze’s security camera pay-what-you-want subscription accepts $0","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22879759/wyze-cam-plus-lite-pay-what-you-want-subscription-person-detection-cloud-recordings-12-seconds"},{"title":"Wyze’s cameras can now be a monitored home security system","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750594/wyze-cams-monitored-security-smart-switches-price-release-date-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="hVbINL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10973234"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tAKO0S"&gt;While the recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22870203/ces-2022-best-of-gadgets-concepts-tech"&gt;CES 2022&lt;/a&gt; announcements featured new innovations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865220/sony-a95k-qd-oled-qdoled-4k-tv-announced-features-explainer"&gt;coming to OLED TVs&lt;/a&gt;, the promise of even better tech will ultimately bring us even more expensive OLEDs. As for the here and now, the 48-inch LG A1 OLED is $846.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Built-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED48A1PUA/dp/B092LZNZB7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, saving $353 off MSRP. The A1 may not be the top tier in LG’s lineup, but if you don’t need a giant TV you can’t go wrong saving money on this affordable panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiTCRr"&gt;OLEDs are a great choice in general for deeper black levels and excellent contrast, but you don’t have to break the bank. We have featured the popular LG C1 OLED TVs numerous times, though today’s deal on its entry-level A1 counterpart gets us below $1,000 — not something you see every day for OLED. Unlike the C1, which features a 120Hz refresh rate and HDMI 2.1 ports, the A1 tops out at 60Hz and doesn’t support 4K at 120Hz. Still, it seems like a solid TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="tj92BW"&gt;More deals to deal with:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="L6SAZv"&gt;The Razer Nari Essential gaming headset is a bit long in the tooth, but if you don’t mind Micro-USB charging it seems like a fine wireless headset for just $41.99 ($58 off MSRP) at &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-13527013?sid=vergedailydeals011222&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Frazer-nari-essential-gaming-headset-27" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a new all-time low, though it’s also available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Nari-Essential-Wireless-Auto-Adjusting/dp/B07HZ5N8QT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $49.99.&lt;/li&gt;
