    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 website promised free DLC in early 2021 — but don’t bet on ‘soon’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQ0R0TG97dimgvD34HWo-renXuc=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68607847/Cyberpunk2077_No_Future_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mCTvcR"&gt;In my opinion, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; isn’t quite the disaster some have suggested. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia"&gt;game is fun&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;bugs are fun&lt;/a&gt;! The bugs that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22198029/cyberpunk-2077-106-update-patch-corrupted-save-file-crashes"&gt;really&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22170547/cyberpunk-2077-update-hotfix-cd-projekt-red-epilepsy-risk-braindance"&gt;&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; weren’t fun have been patched. Refunds were made widely available, and despite that refund option, the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195728/cyberpunk-2077-sales-copies-sold-launch-refunds"&gt;sold 13 million copies in just two weeks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhO6QP"&gt;But publisher CD Projekt still has &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22178913/cyberpunk-2077-launch-controversy-cd-projekt"&gt;a broken reputation to fix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/25/22199768/cdprojekt-cyberpunk-2077-lawsuit-launch"&gt;an investor lawsuit to fight&lt;/a&gt;, so I wouldn’t put too much stock in the headline you might have read today: that we’re all getting free DLC for the game in early 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mlv7V"&gt;It’s possible! And it’s totally what &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/dlc"&gt;this official website promises&lt;/a&gt;. But that promise may be out of date. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K-SkcBCgkJknCDyiLo1-m82-hPc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22208798/cyberpunk_dlc_free.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HpoQ5s"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-dlc-211442122.html"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Engadget &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine shows that this promise may have been live on the internet the same day the game launched — before the outcry began, and definitely before CD Projekt held an emergency conference call on December 15th to discuss how the company would react. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJ71WV"&gt;On that call (&lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2020/12/call-transcript_en.pdf"&gt;PDF transcript&lt;/a&gt;), CD Projekt president and co-CEO Adam Kiciński told investors that it was “too early to judge” when the company might be able to release DLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MPVBy"&gt;Specifically, he was asked: “How do you feel about your ability to release a couple of DLCs next year, and, obviously, multiplayer in 2022?” (CD Projekt had previously said &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/16/21069351/cyberpunk-2077-developer-multiplayer-release-date-2021"&gt;that multiplayer would miss 2021&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmGcW6"&gt;The full answer: “To be honest, it’s too early to judge. At the moment please let us handle the situation, and please let us make some more assessments – that’s still ahead of us; we don’t know yet, and we’re now focused on improving Cyberpunk. We’ll discuss this early next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23RGse"&gt;Currently, we’re expecting two major patches for the game in January and February respectively, like the company promised &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1338390123373801472"&gt;on December 13th in its apology post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E3vI81"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/jtF5WKCiro"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jtF5WKCiro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1338390123373801472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XLG3MT"&gt;Beyond that, some free DLC would of course be nice. Personally, I just want NPCs that know how to drive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Wing warns new drone laws ‘may have unintended consequences’ for privacy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RZYBRs_cSUw6q_Guz5iQ4c8_vB8=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68607707/10_18_Service_Launch_Walgreens_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Wing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oClRBf"&gt;This past week, the US government &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22203398/faa-remote-id-rules-location-night-over-people"&gt;made the single biggest, most impactful set of changes to drone law we’ve yet seen&lt;/a&gt; — ruling that almost every drone in US airspace will need to broadcast their locations, as well as the location of their pilots, in order to “address safety, national security, and law enforcement concerns regarding the further integration of these aircraft into the airspace of the United States”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bk53fJ"&gt;Google (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/12/5/20995520/alphabet-obsolete-sundar-pichai-ceo-page-brin"&gt;technically, Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;) isn’t too happy about those new rules, as it turns out. The company’s drone delivery subsidiary Wing &lt;a href="https://wing.com/resource-hub/articles/remote-id-rule/"&gt;wrote a somewhat fearmongering post&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-drones-faa-alphabet-idUSKBN2951T3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) titled “Broadcast-Only Remote Identification of Drones May Have Unintended Consequences for American Consumers,” which argues that the FAA’s decision to have drones broadcast their location might let observers track your movements, figuring out where you go, where you live, and where and when you receive packages, among other examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYZHgs"&gt;“American communities would not accept this type of surveillance of their deliveries or taxi trips on the road. They should not accept it in the sky,” Wing argues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxFHdv"&gt;With that kind of language, you might think Wing is arguing that drones shouldn’t broadcast their location, yes? Amusingly, no: the Alphabet subsidiary just wishes they’d send it through the internet instead of broadcasting it locally. I think my former &lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;colleague Ian Sherr’s tweet is apt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F9dj3U"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I am shocked — shocked — that a company being investigated for antitrust concerns over abusing its power on the internet would recommend the FAA ditch its newest radio-frequency ID program for internet-based tracking. &lt;a href="https://t.co/d6VNMPapth"&gt;https://t.co/d6VNMPapth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ian Sherr (@iansherr) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iansherr/status/1344795377522892801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 31, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rKr8S1"&gt;Internet-based tracking is exactly what the FAA had originally intended to do when it first proposed the Remote ID rules back in December 2019, by the way — before it received a laundry list of reasons from commenters why internet-based tracking might be problematic and decided to abandon it. Here are just a few of the ones mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vDXgO4"&gt;The cost of adding a cellular modem to a drone to begin with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="L1fB3n"&gt;The cost of paying for a monthly cellular data plan just to fly a drone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gV55WZ"&gt;The lack of reliable cellular coverage across the entirety of the US&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="loNRhS"&gt;The cost of paying a third-party data broker to track and store that data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PLAlAI"&gt;The possibility of that third-party data broker getting breached&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kAbAFm"&gt;The possibility of that data broker or network getting DDoS’d, grounding drones in the US&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="3axAsi"&gt;If you want to read the whole argument for yourself, the FAA spends 15 pages laying out and contemplating all the objections to internet-based Remote ID &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/media/attachments/RemoteID_Final_Rule.pdf"&gt;in its full rule (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; starting at page 60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhfkmt"&gt;Personally, I think it’s pretty ridiculous that the FAA felt it had to choose between “everyone has to broadcast their location to everyone within earshot” and “everyone has to pay gobs of money to private industry and trust some data broker with their location,” but the reasons why we aren’t going with internet-based tracking make some sense to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lldLM7"&gt;Most proponents of Remote ID technology, including Wing, like to explain that it’s merely a “license plate” for the skies, perhaps nothing more intrusive than you’d already have on your car. Here’s Wing on that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="iYfuif"&gt;This allows a drone to be identified as it flies over without necessarily sharing that drone’s complete flight path or flight history, and that information, which can be more sensitive, is not displayed to the public and only available to law enforcement if they have proper credentials and a reason to need that information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="aNEOAW"&gt;But the thing about license plates is, traditionally, you have to be within eyeshot to see them. You’d have to be physically following a car to track it. That’s not necessarily true of a broadcasting transmitter, and it’s potentially &lt;em&gt;far &lt;/em&gt;less true of a internet-based solution like the one Wing seems to wish the FAA had offered instead. Naturally, it depends on who owns the internet-based solution and how much you trust them and their security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrhLjd"&gt;Either way, it’s going to be a while before we find out how secure or vulnerable, how broad or narrow these Remote ID broadcasts are truly going to be. That’s because the FAA’s final rule doesn’t actually mandate what kind of broadcasting tech drones will be required to use: companies have the next year and half to figure that out, and they have to submit it to the FAA for approval. The FAA is also clear that broadcast Remote ID is just a first step, an “initial framework,” suggesting that internet-based Remote ID might still be an option in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How we exercised during quarantine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ygQnByuVRmko4B_8QWm0790mveA=/193x210:1918x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68607225/akrales_191008_3706_0141.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U1QDtx"&gt;With all the mental burdens that came with living in 2020 — including gyms closing their doors — many have found it tough to get in their normal level of exercise. Here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, we coped with this as you might expect: with tech that could enable or motivate us to get some activity in. These are the gadgets, apps, games, and services we used to work up a sweat while still staying safe, and which might prove useful if your New Year’s resolution involves exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kY3jd9"&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="UYA8e2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vL39Sg2AqWg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LxS97d"&gt;I named &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt; my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18145103/beat-saber-game-of-the-year-psvr-oculus-vive"&gt;favorite game of 2018&lt;/a&gt;, but I lapsed hard since, until Oculus released the Quest 2 in October. It’s the first VR headset I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;like wearing&lt;/a&gt;, and I used &lt;a href="https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto"&gt;SideQuest&lt;/a&gt; to add bootleg custom tracks that support my embarrassingly narrow musical taste, turning my Quest into a nearly single-purpose beat sabering machine. (I probably owe Muse and the New Pornographers royalties or something? Look, I just really like the unofficial Expert beatmap of “The Mary Martin Show.”) Pro: I remember I have a body again. Con: I get &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgmxMuW6Fsc"&gt;OK Go&lt;/a&gt; stuck in my head every morning. — &lt;em&gt;Adi Robertson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IM3jHl"&gt;Nike Training Club and Reddit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gnQ9ps"&gt;I’ve been a &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.nike.com/ntc-app" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nike Training Club&lt;/a&gt; user for a while now, but this year I needed it more than ever as my cycle commute disappeared and my step-count plummeted. Nike’s app offers a collection of workouts you can filter based on how much equipment you have available, how much time you have, whether you’re after a strength or a cardio workout, and so on. This year, my filters were “none,” “all the time in the world,” and “I’ll take what I can get,” respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YMssbp"&gt;What I like most is how simple most of the workouts are, which leaves me free to alleviate the boredom of exercise by listening to podcasts while I work out. Instead of having to listen to a personal trainer’s motivational tidbits alongside their instructions, Nike’s app mainly shows simple looping videos of each exercise and leaves my mind free to wander. (The app also includes more traditional workout videos, but they’ve never clicked with me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7IK1mD"&gt;Early in the year, I also got a lot out of working out as a group with my flatmates. Here, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine"&gt;the routine&lt;/a&gt; devised by Reddit’s &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/"&gt;Bodyweight Fitness community&lt;/a&gt; was invaluable. It includes strength exercises you can do with minimal equipment, and different variants of each to let you adjust their difficulty. While you don’t need much to get started, we found adding a pullup bar, gymnastics rings, and resistance bands was a relatively affordable way to give us a lot more exercise options. — &lt;em&gt;Jon Porter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uYMOKd"&gt;Instagram&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Oqvhzl"&gt;While I typically keep my social media habit limited to Twitter, one of my early strategies for staying active while staying home was collecting posts of at-home exercises with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/17/15325040/instagram-saved-post-collections-pinterest"&gt;Instagram’s Saved Posts feature&lt;/a&gt;. Fitness instructors have always shared some content on Instagram, but the closing of gyms and fitness studios brought a wealth of free guided workouts to the app.  It’s no Pinterest, but my collection in Saved Posts lets me keep easy exercises on hand, and eliminates one of my many excuses for not moving: I rarely know what I’m doing when it comes to working out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HsHwq"&gt;As the year has dragged on, I’ve fallen off my Instagram health kick, but I still collect and sort exercise posts. Obviously there are fewer physical benefits, but I still find it very soothing. — &lt;em&gt;Ian Campbell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wu2Ihb"&gt;The Garmin Fenix 6X&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YrHPZ_n5Vg7dfVY0Az_0WDLlvOU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19128333/fenix6_Hero_HR_4000.jpg"&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The Fenix 6 series of multi-sport GPS watches.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pxMVwm"&gt;I know I’m tempting fate by saying this, but my fitness improved dramatically during the pandemic. I was motivated by boredom and, frankly, a fear of dying, but also by a do-it-all &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fp%2F641375&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020-roundup%2F22206745%2F2020-home-exercise-tech-games-apps-vr-apple-watch-covid-quarantine-pandemic-shelter-in-place#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Garmin Fenix 6X Pro Solar watch&lt;/a&gt;. It also helped that my local government promoted safe, socially distanced outdoor fitness activities instead of issuing a strict stay-at-home order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LmPx1e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I was motivated to run faster and longer using Garmin’s PacePro feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="znuyEg"&gt;Before fitness gadgets starting selling out at Amazon and beyond, I managed to amass a set of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-resistance-bands/"&gt;adjustable resistance bands&lt;/a&gt; I had read about on &lt;em&gt;Wirecutter&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crossrope.com%2Fproducts%2Fget-lean-jump-rope-set-eu&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020-roundup%2F22206745%2F2020-home-exercise-tech-games-apps-vr-apple-watch-covid-quarantine-pandemic-shelter-in-place#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;luxurious pair of weighted jump ropes from Crossrope&lt;/a&gt;. In March and April, I worked out with these items pretty much every day while sequestered at home. The Garmin watch did a fair job of automatically tracking my pushups and bicep curls, but it was far less capable of detecting other movements, failing miserably at tracking my Crossrope sessions, for example. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crossrope.com%2Fpages%2Fmembership&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020-roundup%2F22206745%2F2020-home-exercise-tech-games-apps-vr-apple-watch-covid-quarantine-pandemic-shelter-in-place#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Crossrope makes an app&lt;/a&gt; with paid membership tiers, but I found it superfluous to my needs. While I’m not quite at the level of a pro boxer, I’ve managed to perfect several jumping skills like crossovers, doubles, and a variety of skips to keep the repetition interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A14dy9"&gt;I also took up yoga at this time to help maintain my sanity and increase flexibility. While the Fenix 6 can guide you through animated yoga sessions, as an absolute beginner I found it impractical and disruptive to keep peeking at my wrist to study pose mechanics. YouTube is a much better living room coach. I completed &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeEMs38YaBY&amp;amp;list=PLW0v0k7UCVrlLpvX-rz-mrGCoElFpj44D"&gt;Kassandra’s 30-day challenge&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene"&gt;Adriene&lt;/a&gt; is too chatty for me) and yoga is now part of my regular routine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1C445b"&gt;As spring sprung, I took to running outside through the glorious tourist-free Amsterdam city streets and parks. Here the Garmin watch excelled. I was motivated to run faster and longer using Garmin’s PacePro feature to inject my Spotify playlist, real-time coaching, and turn-by-turn navigation into my AirPods Pro earbuds. I soon became addicted to setting new personal records and lowering my fitness age in competition with my running friends who prefer Garmin watches over anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3bjWa"&gt;By summer, I was using the Garmin Fenix 6 to track my kitesurfing sessions, all-day bike rides, and open-water swims in the ocean. By fall, I took up golfing, motivated by Garmin’s super impressive ability to track each shot played on hundreds of golf courses around the world. The Fenix 6 isn’t accurate enough to track putts, but it does an amazing job of tracking each shot from the tee to the green allowing you to measure club performance, keep score, and see trends after each round. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wdtq8W"&gt;The Fenix 6 has proven to be a jack of all trades and master of some, motivating me to try new activities like mountain biking to see how it adapts. After nine months of intense and uninterrupted usage, the watch now says that my fitness age is 20. As a 53-year-old gadget-obsessed human trying to outlive a virus, that’s something I’m proud of. — &lt;em&gt;Thomas Ricker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iiZw6f"&gt;When I got an Apple Watch in November 2019, there were two things I didn’t expect: the upcoming pandemic that would make going to the gym impossible, and just how well the gamified rings system would work on me. The desire to fill every ring every day (which I have done, thank you) has made it so, at the very least, I get up and speed-walk around my apartment every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6XPzv"&gt;I also managed to find a copy of Wii Sports Resort at a local game store, so I didn’t have to pay the eBay scalper prices that started popping up around March (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;hardcore gamers weren’t the only ones dealing with those&lt;/a&gt;). It’s not really what I would call a workout, but it’s fun and it gets my wife and I off the couch. Would I rather be playing &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;? Yes, but I couldn’t get my hands on the VR rig I wanted this year. That’s on the list for 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21443901/nvidia-rtx-3080-ebay-reselling-sold-out-shortages"&gt;once we can find PC hardware again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the fitness app with a month full of closed rings" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SZbOnTVnzNkWHkPdBBSIjRwZxSE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22205254/IMG_0448.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof. There’s more where that came from.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GNZFAR"&gt;For a Nintendo game that &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; provides a workout I turned to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917908/nintendo-switch-ring-fit-adventure-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I cranked it up to the highest difficulty, and immediately regretted it… but pushing through has been rewarding, and I feel like I’ve actually gotten a workout in. It’s not the heart-pounding, sweating everywhere workout I’ve gotten from YouTube workout videos or Apple Fitness Plus, but I’m usually sore the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mLJKUu"&gt;Finally, while I wouldn’t call adjustable dumbbells “tech,” I paired mine with the app Fitbod, which tracks your exercises and builds sets based on which muscle groups are fresh. Combined with the fact I now have a full set of weights that can actually fit in a small apartment, I do more strength training now than I ever did at the gym. — &lt;em&gt;Mitchell Clark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="G2v6At"&gt;What exercise?&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LejKsBRPrpqegre7gd1Si5WTmwM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22026724/shollister_201030_42850003.0.jpg"&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Lifting &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;this monitor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; onto my desk was perhaps my most strenuous task in 2020.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QY8afI"&gt;I went into the pandemic with the best of intentions and an array of gadgetry at my disposal: a VR headset with exercise games, a motorized standing desk, a genuinely good road bicycle, a smartwatch, even an array of relatively new power tools (leaf blower, hedge trimmer, pressure washer) then I bought intending to clean up the yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNvvGw"&gt;Instead, I proceeded to become an utter couch potato for the duration of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GtdF1L"&gt;I might have used the standing desk’s standing feature... twice? I had a few intense VR sessions of &lt;em&gt;Pistol Whip&lt;/em&gt;, sure, but the staying power wasn’t there, and I’m not sure playing through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22167726/half-life-alyx-valve-vr-game-of-the-year-2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;ever saw me break a sweat. Heck, I used an automatic tire inflator the one-and-only time I hit the park with my bike to test &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/19/21522620/peak-design-mobile-phone-case-bike-car-mount-tripod-hands-on-kickstarter"&gt;an awesome new phone mount&lt;/a&gt;. I did rake all the leaves in the backyard twice, I suppose. But if I’m telling the truth, I probably burned more calories breaking down a mountain of Amazon cardboard boxes than any other activity this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UID7rR"&gt;There was one good reason I didn’t feel all that motivated, though: after years of failed diets, I finally lost some weight during shelter-in-place. Using a Wi-Fi-equipped smart scale and the MyFitnessPal app, I mentally berated myself to weigh in and log calories almost every single day for several months at a stretch, limiting myself to 1,600 a day. I lost 25 pounds, and I don’t get as hungry anymore!  Imagine if I’d exercised, too. — &lt;em&gt;Sean Hollister&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung appears to have a new Tile competitor on the way</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P2XDK832N23pOSPeB-RRePgxEJ8=/1x0:639x425/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68606651/smarttagleak.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photos: Samsung / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-smart-tag-live-images-ncc/" target="_blank"&gt;91mobiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="510avH"&gt;Samsung seems to be close to launching a new Tile-like device for tracking lost items. The tracker, likely called the &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-smart-tag-launch-soon-possible-certification/"&gt;Galaxy SmartTag&lt;/a&gt;, has been leaking out over the past month, and there’s some speculation it could be announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167208/samsung-galaxy-s21-january-14th-launch-india-plus-ultra-s-pen"&gt;alongside the Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt; later in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6hvLm"&gt;The Galaxy SmartTag would use Bluetooth to connect with nearby devices and broadcast its location, so owners could find it later if they misplace whatever it’s attached to. It’ll be powered by a replaceable button cell battery, according to a regulatory filing &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_smart_tag_bluetooth_tracker_details_surface-news-46721.php"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so you won’t have to throw it out and buy a new one when the battery dies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZnZmq"&gt;Samsung’s tracker sounds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/2/17924312/tile-mate-pro-premium-subscription-launch-battery-range-price"&gt;a lot like a Tile&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll apparently look a lot like one, too. Leaks show the SmartTag as a small square with rounded corners and a hole at one edge for slipping a keychain or lanyard through. Photos of the device filed with Taiwan’s telecom regulator were &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-smart-tag-live-images-ncc/"&gt;publicized by &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and they line up with &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-smart-tag-design-exclusive/"&gt;an illustration&lt;/a&gt; of the gadget that was leaked from Samsung’s SmartThings app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhHVmH"&gt;So far, it’s not clear that Samsung is doing anything out of the ordinary here — this seems to be a pretty standard fare item tracker. Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/10/17841570/samsung-smartthings-tracker-gps-lte-m"&gt;released a tracker&lt;/a&gt; back in 2018 that connected to cell phone networks for continual tracking. More recently, in October, Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541567/samsung-find-my-smartthings-find-service-locate-missing-smartphone-tablet-smartwatch-earbud-galaxy"&gt;launched an app&lt;/a&gt; that helps owners of its gadgets locate their existing devices using Bluetooth, which seems like groundwork for the upcoming SmartTag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqYJgD"&gt;Mostly, this seems like more bad news for Tile, since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427380/apple-airtags-tile-competitor-production"&gt;Apple is rumored&lt;/a&gt; to have an item tracker in the works, too. That could mean two major new competitors in one year, if both of these devices actually ship.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New York City subway now supports tap-to-pay at all stations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Up1VahQU-U6EpRVd36KydmBzRVs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68606406/akrales_190528_3453_0028.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hsq4TQ"&gt;You can now gain entry to any station of the New York City Subway with the tap of a phone, instead of the (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chayesmatthew/status/1081246829818363906"&gt;famously finicky&lt;/a&gt;) swipe of a MetroCard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5WED4t"&gt;The Metropolitan Transportation Authority &lt;a href="https://www.mta.info/press-release/nyc-transit/its-omny-time-everywhere"&gt;announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that it had completed the rollout of tap-to-pay scanners at all subway stations and on all of its buses throughout the city. The MTA has been installing the system, called OMNY, since May 2019 as part of a modernization effort to phase out the plastic MetroCards that have been in use since the ’90s. The new tap-to-pay system is available at 472 stations and on 5,800 buses in total, the MTA said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEEUuI"&gt;Tap-to-pay is supposed to speed up entry into buses and subways and reduce costs throughout the transit system, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/nyregion/metrocard-mta-subway-discontinued.html"&gt;officials have said&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also just meant to be simpler and more modern. Other cities have had tap-to-pay transit systems for years or decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aL7pBy"&gt;For now, you need a phone that supports NFC-based mobile payments in order to use the OMNY system. Later in 2021, the MTA will begin selling tap-to-pay cards that can be used in place of a phone — an important addition since not all riders own a smartphone. Support for reduced fares for senior riders and riders with disabilities will come at some point this year, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6tX4y"&gt;MetroCards are supposed to be “phased out entirely” by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft says hackers were able to see some of its source code</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rju3DQOwEJwbHDc9NI8XjSKZ4CI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68604189/microsoft_surface_book_3_13_5_dbohn_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n5crqX"&gt;As Microsoft continues to investigate the massive SolarWinds attack, the company says it has discovered that its systems were infiltrated “beyond just the presence of malicious SolarWinds code.” In &lt;a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/31/microsoft-internal-solorigate-investigation-update/"&gt;an update from its Security Response Center&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft says that hackers were able to “view source code in a number of source code repositories,” but that the hacked account granting such access didn’t have permission to modify any code or systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0w36QN"&gt;While Microsoft points to “a very sophisticated nation-state actor” as the culprit, the US government and cybersecurity officials have implicated Russia as the architects of the overall SolarWinds attack. The attack &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176053/solarwinds-hack-client-list-russia-orion-it-compromised"&gt;exposed an extensive list of sensitive organizations&lt;/a&gt;, and today’s disclosure from Microsoft shows we’ll still be unraveling the attack’s implications for weeks and months to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X4aUeX"&gt;Fortunately, Microsoft says that while hackers went deeper than previously known, it found “no evidence of access to production services or customer data,” and “no indications that our systems were used to attack others.” Additionally, the company says that it regularly assumes adversaries are able to view its source code, and does not rely on the secrecy of source code to keep its products secure. Microsoft did not disclose how much code was viewed or what the exposed code is used for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="854pfp"&gt;Earlier this month, Microsoft President Brad Smith &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188060/microsoft-president-solarwinds-orion-hack-breach-brad-smith"&gt;said the attack&lt;/a&gt; was a “moment of reckoning” and warned about its danger. “This is not ‘espionage as usual,’ Smith said. “In effect, this is not just an attack on specific targets, but on the trust and reliability of the world’s critical infrastructure in order to advance one nation’s intelligence agency.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe Flash rides off into the sunset</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Adobe Flash Logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rjBAkOFCA0b9huDqMyHcr2cMP5o=/0x23:600x423/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68603538/adobe-flash-logo.1419969978.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Adobe Flash Logo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UIkf8V"&gt;Adobe scheduled the end of support for its famous Flash software on December 31st, 2020, and today is the day. While Adobe won’t start blocking Flash content until January 12th, major browsers will shut it all down tomorrow and Microsoft will block it in most versions of Windows. It’s over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8XGkk"&gt;Flash enjoyed huge cultural relevance and looms large in web history, which might be why its funeral procession has lasted for years. Browsers started showing Flash the door early in the last decade, and in 2015 Adobe asked developers to move on to HTML5. Things became official in 2017, when Adobe announced it would end support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtpoFm"&gt;While Adobe is finally (mercifully) letting Flash go, it will live on in many historical artifacts. The Internet Archive is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578616/internet-archive-preservation-flash-animations-games-adobe"&gt;preserving Flash games and animations&lt;/a&gt;, including well-known hits like “Peanut Butter Jelly Time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIPuCw"&gt;I personally loved making stuff in Flash as a high school student with a totally-legitimate copy of the Adobe software on my generic HP desktop PC. Years later, any time I see some fancy words slide into a corporate presentation, I recall struggling to figure out how to animate motion tweens in the Flash editor. Ah, memories.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump’s fight to overthrow election now falls to the guy who invented the CueCat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QhxwA2gNUs5UZkH4r62ywpx2_4U=/4x0:1276x848/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68603331/1280px_Cuecat2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The CueCat barcode scanner | Tomkinsc&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LEBe5D"&gt;In a hopeless attempt to overthrow or cast suspicion on an American election, a ridiculous cast of characters has heeded outgoing President Donald Trump’s call to misadventure — including, now, the inventor of one of the worst gadgets of all time. His name is Jovan Hutton Pulitzer, and yesterday he gave a poor imitation of a TED talk &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYVzbwL0eUA&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo"&gt;before the Georgia state senate&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that he has the ability to prove whether ballots from the 2020 election were real or fake. He introduced himself to a subcommittee of state senators as an “inventor and pattern recognition expert,” just before implying that he’s a titan even bigger than Apple and Google combined.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“I’m on approximately about 12 billion devices globally,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AirDVC"&gt;We’ll definitely grant that Pulitzer &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;have some credentials in the world of technology. He’s responsible for the CueCat: a cat-shaped barcode scanner that is widely regarded as one of the worst gadgets ever made. In a 2000 &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;review, renowned technology journalist &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB971305166620370724"&gt;Walt Mossberg wrote that&lt;/a&gt; the CueCat was “unnatural and ridiculous.” Rob Beschizza of &lt;em&gt;BoingBoing &lt;/em&gt;calls it “&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/10/06/you-can-now-buy-cuecats-on-ama.html"&gt;one of the classic crap gadgets&lt;/a&gt;.” And &lt;em&gt;TIME &lt;/em&gt;named it one of “the 50 worst inventions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R15G0u"&gt;The idea of the CueCat was this: millions of the things would be shipped all over the country, and then people would use them to scan barcodes from ads in magazines... thereby opening deep links to content on their computer. We probably don’t have to explain why a giant barcode scanner that attached to a computer’s PS/2 keyboard port simply for the purpose of opening websites failed, but since its inventor is now meddling in American election integrity, we can’t take anything for granted. (It was a bad idea to manufacture millions of cat-shaped barcode scanners to compete with the functionality of typing a URL into a browser and pressing “return.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Anyway, THIS is the man who Rudy and the gang are claiming is a tech and security expert at these Georgia hearings.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fTu753"&gt;Anyway, Pulitzer now appears to be trying to cash in on Trump’s election grift before the lights go out. (Thanks to Christina Warren for putting us on the case &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/film_girl/status/1344590229852733441"&gt;with this Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;.) The day before Pulitzer testified in Georgia, he posted a video on Twitter talking about Chinese inks, paper fibers, and “fake squiggles,” making sure to tag anyone on Fox News who might bite on insinuations of foreign election interference. (While he wasn’t tagged, Fox News’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LouDobbs/status/1344494157872578561"&gt;Lou Dobbs fell for it.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e3uKd1"&gt;Trump’s election fraud campaign is making Republicans especially uncomfortable in Georgia, whose governor and secretary of state are both members of the Republican party. On Wednesday, Trump tweeted that Georgia Governor Brian Kemp should resign, adding that Georgia’s GOP leadership are “fools.” Pro-Trump conspiracy theorists have also targeted voting machine companies Smartmatic and Dominion, falsely alleging that they have ties to antifa and Venezuela. The companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174682/smartmatic-voting-fraud-disinformation-retraction-fox-news-oann-newsmax"&gt;responded aggressively&lt;/a&gt; to the attacks, forcing — you guessed it — Lou Dobbs to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2020/12/19/lou-dobbs-debunk-fact-check-smartmatic/"&gt;refute his own conspiracies with fact-checking segments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohVAgR"&gt;So, will the 2020 election be overturned by the guy who made the CueCat? It seems unlikely. Before wading into politics, Pulitzer reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/2016/04/05/dallas-inventor-of-infamous-cuecat-is-now-erm-a-full-blown-treasure-hunter/"&gt;became a  “full-blown treasure hunter”&lt;/a&gt; in an apparent quest to find fame on The History Channel. But unable to locate the biblical Ark of the Covenant, Pulitzer is back to search for something just as improbable: widespread election fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram has once again dropped the ball on a ‘top nine’ year in review feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aT093R-1SGpUQyCHIF0lMEk8cZE=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68602994/Untitled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dlWZMA"&gt;It’s New Year’s Eve, which means that your Instagram feed — if it’s anything like mine — is probably filled with people posting “&lt;a href="https://creatorkit.com/top-nine-best-of-2020/"&gt;top nine&lt;/a&gt;” grids of their most liked photos from this year. But, bafflingly, for yet another year, everyone will be turning to sketchy-looking third-party apps and sites to make them. Because once again, Instagram has failed to offer an official, automated way to curate the images within the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="En9JaQ"&gt;As someone who personally enjoys using the top nine format to look back on a year of baked good photos, I’m left utterly confused by this. Users seem to &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; putting together the collages to look back on their past year of posts. Instagram even already offered grid tools for posting photos to your story in different layouts. And it &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; has access to the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7U9mi7"&gt;Just look at the popularity of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997218/spotify-wrapped-year-end-decade-review-apple-music-streaming-audio-service"&gt;Spotify’s Wrapped year in review feature&lt;/a&gt;, which has come to dominate December with users showing off their most streamed songs, genres, and stats. Instagram has to be aware of the trend — Instagram stories are one of the most popular places users show off their taste in music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3pjJs"&gt;Plus, Instagram is owned by Facebook, the company that pioneered automated year-in-review videos. Facebook uses the power of algorithms to compile instant (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/7/16745656/facebook-year-in-review-ai-2017-terrible"&gt;albeit occasionally depressing&lt;/a&gt;) annual videos and “friendiversary” highlights. Letting users automatically create and share top nine posts seems like a no-brainer. But 2020 is rolling by without even the barest nod to the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgXqor"&gt;Instead, users are left with third-party services, dozens of which skyrocket up the app store charts each year. These services often ask users to fork over personal information like their email addresses or insist on plastering images with ugly watermarks or logos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAWnpl"&gt;It’s easy to imagine how Instagram could streamline this process and even fix some of the pain points in most third-party options, like the inability to generate top nine grids for private accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWc5f1"&gt;And yet, it seems that 2020 will end with Instagram dropping the ball on this seemingly obvious feature. I suppose there’s always 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>17 great games on Google Play Pass for your new 2020 Android phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ucv2RP21dJYCKbkD_iW9DlzufGk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68602688/wjoel_180413_1777_android_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NLYmV0"&gt;If you just got a brand-new Android phone for the holidays, you probably want to play some games on your shiny device. Luckily, that’s especially easy to do this year with Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20878843/google-play-pass-bundles-350-android-games-and-apps-for-4-99-per-month"&gt;$5-per-month Google Play Pass&lt;/a&gt; games and apps subscription service, which offers free access to hundreds of games and apps without pushing ads or demanding in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are just a few that we recommend. Since all of the games are also available individually — either free with ads and in-app purchases or for specific prices — we’ve included their Google Play links as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkjNFa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve rounded up our favorite and most-used games, apps, and entertainment.

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KfHGWK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cut the Rope&lt;/em&gt; (and its sequels &lt;em&gt;Cut the Rope 2&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Cut the Rope: Time Travel&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Cut the Rope: Magic&lt;/em&gt;) are charming physics-based puzzle games that let you feed candy to a cute little dinosaur by manipulating &lt;em&gt;Incredible Machine&lt;/em&gt;-like contraptions. The puzzles are short, but getting three stars in each level adds a nice extra challenge. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GKcr4T"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy &lt;/em&gt;is a hard-as-nails game about a man in a cauldron climbing a series of tall objects with only a large hammer. While the game isn’t easy, failing repeatedly in your attempts to climb ever higher seems to be just part of the experience of playing it. I can imagine any frustration would be worth it when you finally reach the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8D7Ii4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;","description":"Available for $4.99 from Google Play","label":"Buy now","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.gettingoverit&amp;amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;amp;gl=US"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="z14jDV"&gt;Limbo&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CunQaX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Limbo&lt;/em&gt; is a slow, spooky platformer that will only take you a couple hours to play through. If you haven’t played it before, find a cozy spot on the couch in front of the fire, grab some headphones, and get lost in its world. Honestly, I wouldn’t exactly describe &lt;em&gt;Limbo&lt;/em&gt; as fun, but it’s a one-of-a-kind experience that’s worth your time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XuQc8s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Limbo ","description":"Available for $4.99 from Google Play ","label":"Buy now ","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playdead.limbo.full"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="jSD905"&gt;Monument Valley &lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6t1ljU"&gt;Ustwo’s perspective-bending puzzlers, &lt;em&gt;Monument Valley&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Monument Valley 2&lt;/em&gt;, are somehow engaging and relaxing at the same time, and both games are absolutely beautiful. The levels are wonderfully designed, and you’ll typically only need a few minutes to get through a level, so you might be able to sneak in a puzzle or two between bites of holiday leftovers. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e3ihe5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Old Man’s Journey&lt;/em&gt; is a beautiful game about, well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/2/17797952/old-mans-journey-nintendo-switch-puzzle-short-play"&gt;an old man’s journey&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s not just a trek through his physical environment — the old man also reflects on his memories throughout the game. The story shouldn’t take more than a couple hours to play through, so if you’re looking for a game you can play through in a single sitting, &lt;em&gt;Old Man’s Journey&lt;/em&gt; might fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ftr9tz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Old Man’s Journey&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;","description":"Available for $4.99 from Google Play","label":"Buy now","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.brokenrul.oldmansjourney&amp;amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;amp;gl=US"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="xgype9"&gt;Prune&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G5YG7L"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Prune&lt;/em&gt;, you prune trees with a swipe of a finger so they can grow branches that reach the sun. That simple concept is supported by a beautiful, minimalistic art style and lush, calming music, making for an almost meditative experience. If you need something to calm your nerves during the stressful holiday season, consider plopping down on the couch with &lt;em&gt;Prune&lt;/em&gt; and a good pair of headphones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="gutY37"&gt;All three &lt;em&gt;Reigns&lt;/em&gt; games — &lt;em&gt;Reigns&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Reigns: Her Majesty&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Reigns: Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; — are available on Google Play Pass, and each offers new opportunities to rule your kingdom with an iron thumb (if you choose). Though I hope your &lt;em&gt;Reigns: Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; runs are more satisfying than &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;’ final season. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="eTOsp0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s second season might be over, but if you’re still looking to get your &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fix, you might want to consider sinking hours into &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: KOTOR&lt;/em&gt;, which remains one of the best &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; games. Will you be a hero and become a Jedi, or go full dark side and embrace your inner Sith? The force is still strong with this beloved RPG.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZtdriO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Star Wars: KOTOR ","description":"Available for $9.99 from Google Play ","label":"Buy now ","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aspyr.swkotor "}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="wRmml9"&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VktcUu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; is guaranteed to be an incredibly addicting way to get you through the holiday doldrums. I’ve lost hours to this game playing &lt;em&gt;just another day&lt;/em&gt; over and over again as I tend my crops, visit my farm animals, and make friends with every townsperson that I can. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SFG73b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terraria&lt;/em&gt;, the hit side-scrolling action-adventure sandbox game, was first released for PCs all the way back in 2011, and it’s &lt;em&gt;still &lt;/em&gt;being updated. The Android version’s touchscreen controls can be a little clunky, but don’t let them stop you from the potential hours of dungeon-crawling that await you in &lt;em&gt;Terraria&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SvGWYX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thimbleweed Park&lt;/em&gt; is an old-school adventure game in the style of Lucasfilm Games presentations like &lt;em&gt;Maniac Mansion &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Secret of Monkey Island &lt;/em&gt;but with a few updates to the formula to make it feel a bit more modern than those older classics. &lt;/p&gt;
