&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jc3f3k"&gt;It can be difficult to figure out what to do when you’re asked to provide a hard copy of a document but don’t have access to a printer at home. While it used to be a safe bet that everyone had a printer at home, that’s no longer the case — but if you don’t have one, odds are that at some point, you’ll come across someone who hasn’t gotten the memo and insists on a hard copy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0HN35"&gt;If you’ve found yourself in this situation, you’ve got options. To help, I’ve researched the various methods you can use to get a document from your computer to whoever needs it and have come up with a few tips and considerations for printing without your own printer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0mqi9"&gt;Before I get to that, though, you’ll have to...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4UiFG3"&gt;Prepare to print&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="h5BMec"&gt;Presumably, the file you want to print is on a computer, and you need some way to get it from there to another computer connected to a printer. Depending on what method you use, you may be able to upload your file to the internet and have it printed at a specific location (some services can even connect straight to cloud services like Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox). If the printer — or the organization that owns the printer — doesn’t support uploads from the internet, you may have to put your file on a flash drive, probably one with a USB-A connector. If you’re unsure whether the place you’re going to accepts online files, check ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U8zT9q"&gt;As for what kind of files you can print, different services support different file types. In my inquiries, Microsoft Word’s .docx and Adobe’s PDF formats were universally accepted, so that’s probably the way to go if you’re trying to print out text. If your Word document includes a lot of custom formatting, fonts, and / or images, you may want to export it as a PDF first to make sure it prints exactly how you want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRODW6"&gt;After you’ve got that squared away, here are some of your options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nzFICX"&gt;Print at the library or school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2mQqtE"&gt;If you’re a student or have access to a public library, you can likely print documents there for free or at a low cost per page. There will probably be instructions for how to print something out on your institution’s website, or you can always ask a librarian for help. I was able to upload my document to the internet and then print it for free at any of my local library’s branches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3F01j"&gt;It’s worth noting that you probably won’t want to print out documents with sensitive content or personal info at these sorts of places — for one, you’ll likely be printing them from an unfamiliar web portal using an unfamiliar computer. It’s possible your school will let you print straight from your own laptop, but in any case, you’ll be printing on a network you don’t control, which means there’s some level of risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jaP8h"&gt;If the printer isn’t located close to the computer, there’s also always the possibility that someone else could have access to your document after it comes out of the printer, depending on how the library is set up. If you need to print medical documents or the like, you may want to look into other methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XwVh4l"&gt;Ask a friend or family member&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PMxZPZ"&gt;If you’re only going to be printing a page or two and have family members or friends who own a printer, it’s always worth asking them if you can use it. This can help avoid the privacy concerns that can come with printing using public hardware. While it may not be the best method if you want to print off an entire novel (unless you’re willing to repay their generosity by bringing your own paper and possibly an ink cartridge, depending on how many pages you’re doing), it could work for the occasional times when you need a hard copy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h5BEpnI6syqyqOwZCyQ2j4Lkv74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22976488/2017_06_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shipping stores often also offer printing services for big and small jobs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="l402O4"&gt;Go to a business center like UPS or FedEx&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="W44t4j"&gt;Shipping centers often provide printing services, too, whether for large jobs, like making a poster or banner, or for more mundane tasks, like printing out permission slips or routine forms. Some stores are branded specifically as print or business centers, but even ones that aren’t will likely be able to print out a few pages for you. There’ll be a cost associated with it, based on how many pages you print out — I paid $0.12 for a single-sided, black-and-white page at a local UPS store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvRUoD"&gt;Again — and somewhat surprisingly, given that these stores are business-oriented — this option may not be the best for sensitive documents. At the aforementioned UPS location, the printing process involved emailing an attachment to the store, which the employee would then open and print before handing me the resulting paper. It may be different at other stores and locations, but you’ll probably want to check before you make the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dv0GXI"&gt;Ask if you can print at work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F1WJc2"&gt;If you work in an office that has printers, and there aren’t strict rules around how they’re used, it may be worth asking your boss or IT department if you can use them to print a personal document or two. The worst that can happen is that they say no, and you may be surprised with a yes. I wouldn’t, however, recommend taking the “ask forgiveness rather than permission” approach, as many workplace printers are monitored for appropriate use (and the IT department can track whose computer each print job came from). In addition, you don’t want to get scolded (or worse) over a print job when there are other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZAXEN"&gt;Privacy is also a factor here — along with potential IT monitoring, the printer will likely be in a public area, and it’s possible that someone could end up picking up your documents by accident if they’re also using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QbOGs9"&gt;Pick up a print at an office supply store&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="59SfV3"&gt;Stores like &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13048831?sid=VergeHowToPrint110221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Fservices%2Fprinting%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Staples&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.officedepot.com%2Fa%2Fbrowse%2Fdocument-printing%2FN%3D5%2B1212282%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22737500%2Fprint-document-how-to-laser-inkjet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Office Depot&lt;/a&gt; (or an independent, local print shop) often give you the option to order printed documents online, then pick them up in person. While their websites’ printing service pages may be covered with splashy brochures and posters, you can also just order &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13048831?sid=VergeHowToPrint110221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Fservices%2Fprinting%2Fcopies-documents-printing%2Fsimple-prints%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;regular printed documents as well&lt;/a&gt;. Both the stores I checked let me upload my document online and then pick it up the same day. They even offered to ship the documents to my house for an extra fee, though that wouldn’t necessarily be an economical option for printing a single document or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqQFXX"&gt;One of the benefits of using an office supply store is the range of options you get — you can print in color, for example, and choose what size and weight of paper you want to use (so you can, say, impress a prospective employer with a finely-printed hard-copy resumé). Depending on what tier of printing you are getting (some stores have “basic” and “professional” printing services), you can also pay to have your document stapled, hole-punched, laminated, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vVDf4kWiAms1RYYyZvHzmJOTa-E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960551/Screen_Shot_2021_10_27_at_12.28.55.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Office Depot offered several options for customizing my print job, many of which would’ve been over-the-top for a single page but good for mass-printing documents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ivdnzt"&gt;That flexibility may extend to how you get your prints made as well. The Staples location I went to also offered self-service printing, where you could walk in and do the printing yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOhpnR"&gt;The downside is cost — printing a single simple page at Staples was $0.19, and printing a color, stapled, 10-page document on premium “cotton resume white” paper would cost $7.42. A similar print job at Office Depot would be $7.03. Switching to black and white substantially lowered the price, down to $3.27 and $2.93, respectively, so it’s definitely worth choosing that option if color isn’t important for your document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksIQ9U"&gt;While there are discounts available if you’re printing a ton of copies, it could be worth looking around to see if you could find less expensive options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h-b8ddsuO2E5uSNVcBDhJWcuUoo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965177/6454282ld.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="G6NxSL"&gt;Buy an inexpensive printer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QkjpWm"&gt;The solutions above can be great if you only have to print occasionally or if the locations are part of your everyday routine. But if you find that you have to go out of your way to print things more often than you’d like, and your space and budget allow for it, you may want to get an inexpensive printer. That could &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHP-DeskJet-2742e-All-in-One-Wireless-Color-Inkjet-Printer-Cinnamon-6-Months-Free-Instant-Ink-with-HP%2F236589360&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHowToPrint110221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cost anywhere from $60&lt;/a&gt; (or less if you can find a sale) for a basic wireless inkjet all-in-one (meaning it can also scan and copy) to &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfU0egkQXci" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;over $100 for a black-and-white laser printer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyaUzX"&gt;Inkjet printers will be cheaper and will be able to print in color, but the ink can be shockingly expensive. Refilling my $60 example printer’s ink &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHP-67-Black-Original-Ink-3YM56AN%2F640484654&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHowToPrint110221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will cost you $30,&lt;/a&gt; and HP estimates that you’ll only get around 100 pages of printing from those cartridges. Replacing a laser printer’s toner is less expensive per page (my example’s refill &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfU0fgRPVNZ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $50&lt;/a&gt;, but HP estimates you’ll get 1,000 pages out of it), and laser printers could be a better option for infrequent printers, as their toner won’t dry out as quickly as regular ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MYoln"&gt;If you’re looking for a guide on buying a printer, we have one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21279634/best-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can check out here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ToLlfu"&gt;Do you need a hard copy at all? It’s a good idea to ask. Some people or organizations may be willing to accept an electronically signed document, or you may have the option to use a digital pass instead of a printed one. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo is bringing its autonomous vehicles to New York City for (manually driven) mapping</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IvFEQoJFutQk3ZLCDJbCkeUqpO8=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085218/IMG_0072.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8dfA5r"&gt;The latest autonomous vehicle company to tackle the mean streets of New York City will be Waymo. The Google spinoff is bringing a handful of cars to the Big Apple, where they will start mapping the city streets using manually driven vehicles with two people riding inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Qul4g"&gt;Waymo cited New York’s vibrant street life, “unusual road geometries” (which is a nice way of saying utterly confusing), and the likelihood of heavy rain and snow as being among the reasons the company is eager to test there. Presumedly the company is also curious to see how its vehicles will react when down-on-their-luck street hustlers slap their hoods and shout &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z-tCU-sULA"&gt;“I’m walking here!”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ndLN0"&gt;Waymo won’t have more than five vehicles on the street at a time to start out, a spokesperson said. They will be driving in Manhattan, primarily south of Central Park, and eventually extending down through the city to the financial district and also out to a small section of New Jersey through the Lincoln Tunnel. The fleet will consist of Chrysler Pacifica minivans, equipped with high-powered sensors and computing units, at first. Later they will include the company’s Jaguar I-Pace SUVs as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lEHfc4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not clear when the cars will begin to drive in autonomous mode&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xPJm7H"&gt;It’s not clear when the cars will begin to drive in autonomous mode. But New York City is obviously a huge, complex stage on which Waymo is eager to demonstrate the effectiveness of its technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RvD9Rm"&gt;New York City also has some of &lt;a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2021/06/30/new-york-city-worst-traffic-in-the-country/"&gt;the most dangerous, congested, and poorly managed streets&lt;/a&gt; in the world. They are also chock-full of construction workers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and double- and sometimes even triple-parked cars. In theory, this would make it very difficult for an autonomous vehicle to navigate, given that AVs typically rely on good weather, clear signage, and less aggressive driving from other road users for safe operation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XqMaTA"&gt;While other states have become hot beds for AV testing, New York has been a bit of a ghost town. Part of the reason could be the state’s strict rules, which include mandating that safety drivers keep their hands on the wheel at all times and requiring state police escort at all times to be paid for by the testing company — though the state hasn’t enforced the latter requirement in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIQnty"&gt;A spokesperson for Waymo said its operations “do not meet NY’s current definition for testing and are therefore not subject to permitting requirements.” The company has proactively reached out to “relevant lawmakers,” including Governor Kathy Hochul, about its plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLADIj"&gt;Waymo says it has been in contact with “many New York policymakers, regulators, industry leaders, and non-profit groups to get their feedback, and we’re encouraged by the responses.” The company provided a quote from Eric Adams, who was just elected mayor, declaring himself “excited” to host Waymo’s small fleet of vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3YbLr"&gt;Of course, many residents believe that New York City doesn’t need more cars — it needs fewer. Congestion in the city is arguably worse than ever, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/01/dont-walk-this-way-58-more-nyc-pedestrians-killed-in-2021/"&gt;pedestrian deaths are on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, and the city’s leaders have done little to stem the chaos. Waymo says its cars are safer, but they’re still cars that occupy the same amount of space as human-driven vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEoOvV"&gt;Waymo won’t be the first company to attempt to navigate New York City’s unique brand of vehicular chaos. In 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16488330/gm-cruise-nyc-self-driving-car-test-cuomo"&gt;GM-backed Cruise announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to test its self-driving vehicles in lower Manhattan, but &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/gms-plan-to-test-autonomous-cars-in-new-york-city-seems-1828945330"&gt;those plans were later scuttled&lt;/a&gt; with little explanation as to why. Boston-based &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20755163/new-york-city-self-driving-shuttle-service"&gt;Optimus Ride has been testing autonomous shuttles in Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, but only on private roads as part of the borough’s Navy Yard. Mobileye, a division of Intel, also recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585338/intel-mobileye-autonomous-vehicle-av-testing-nyc"&gt;began testing its vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in the city. Meanwhile, operators flocked to places with friendlier regulations (like Arizona) or ones that are more convenient to their headquarters (like California).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFi6l2"&gt;Waymo is operating a robotaxi service in Phoenix, some of which include completely driverless vehicles. It’s also testing its vehicles in San Francisco, where it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702962/cruise-waymo-california-dmv-autonomous-vehicle-permit"&gt;recently received&lt;/a&gt; permits from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to offer rides to passengers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Thaer6"&gt;But in order to give rides to paying passengers in its fully driverless vehicles, as it does in Arizona, the Google spinoff would need to apply for an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591045/california-robotaxi-paid-rides-cpuc-permits"&gt;additional permit from the California Public Utilities Commission&lt;/a&gt;. The company also has a number of vehicles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20903034/waymo-self-driving-test-la-mds-data"&gt;in Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; performing a similar task as they will in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFPiem"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel’s Eternals is big, beautiful, and empty</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nGD3QseZ9t46Bvv7wIjIOsxyDPk=/6x0:8466x5640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085295/SLH_16959_R_CROP.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sophie Mutevelian&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Marvel’s epoch-spanning epic has too many heroes but still feels empty&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="oHojHO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; is Marvel’s biggest swing in years. It’s an attempt at a prestige-style film directed by Chloé Zhao, fresh off her Oscar win, at a size and scale that none of Marvel’s previous films have tried. But despite its grand ambitions, the film gets lost in its ponderous ideas and caught in the constraining box of what an MCU film has to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4LESR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; aspires to an almost biblical scope. The opening crawl of the film (yes, there is an opening crawl) reads like an early page of the Book of Genesis, explaining who Arishem, the Prime Celestial, brought light to the universe. The film bounds across thousands of years of human history, has no less than 10 main characters, four villains, a love quadrangle, and even Marvel’s first on-screen sex scene. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K2AkKhL_wMPdNbwBlpLZqD2otbc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980788/TBB1100_comp_v044.1129.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals has a galactic scale, to mixed effect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FMaq02"&gt;The basic plot of &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; is as follows: for thousands of years, a team of immortal superheroes — the eponymous Eternals — has been living in secret amongst humanity on Earth, sent by the god-like Celestials to help nurture mankind and protect them from the villainous Deviants. The Eternals have spent centuries hidden among humanity, their epic feats mistaken for mythological gods. (But, as the film explains, the Eternals were &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; allowed to protect against Deviants, hence their absence in the many, many world- and universe-threatening crises of the previous MCU films.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1MNGuV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a lot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BOuZ2U"&gt;The core Eternals team is comprised of 10 main characters, each with their own special powers: Sersi (Gemma Chan), who can transmute objects to different elements; Ikaris (Richard Madden), who basically is a Marvel-ized Superman with flight and laser eyes; Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), who can fire energy blasts from his hands; Sprite (Lia McHugh), who can cast illusions; Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), a superhuman inventor; Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), who has super speed; Druig (Barry Keoghan), with mind control powers; Gilgamesh (Don Lee) with super strength, and Thena (Angelina Jolie), a powerful warrior who can summon weapons from thin air. Leading the bunch is Ajak (Salma Hayek), the “Prime Eternal,” who possesses healing powers and can commune with Arishem as a sort of priest/mother for the rest of the Eternals.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Hy3hB"&gt;If that feels like a lot, it’s because it is. &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; does its best to introduce the characters, along with their relationships, powers, and goals, but it’s a lot of backstory to cram into the two-and-a-half-plus-hour film. (That makes it the second-longest MCU movie to date, after the three-hour &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame.&lt;/em&gt;) By default, some of the Eternals are more “main” characters than others: Cersei and Ikaris get a lot of time to hash out their relationship, while Phastos and Makkari are effectively side characters. Nanjiani’s Kingo does the best to steal the show — his character has spent his centuries on Earth building a Bollywood dynasty — but he still gets sidelined a lot in favor of the more central characters.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ed7x9d2hU18c4LwXe2t50MgHY7Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980795/DCA3100_comp_v006_046585.1097_R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Some of the many main characters in Eternals&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JpHm2t"&gt;It’s not that Marvel movies can’t handle this many characters. The jam-packed Avengers films, or even the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, are testaments to the studio’s talent at coherently cramming dozens of heroes into a single film. But &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; has an uphill battle that starts with the fact that we’re meeting all these characters for the first time despite Marvel’s 20-plus films and shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhlKPr"&gt;All of this would be fine if the Eternals were actually doing interesting things. But the first half of the film consists largely of showing us how the Eternals drifted apart 6,500 years into their mission of hunting Deviants and a “getting the band back together” sequence of slowly reassembling the team to battle the resurgent Deviant threat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hl3ru3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; constantly bounces between not having enough and too many things going on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I2WSyt"&gt;A mid-movie lore dump helps kickstart an actual plot, but even that consists more of different combinations of Eternals standing around and arguing over a cosmic-scale trolley problem. &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; is constantly bouncing around between not having enough going on and suddenly having too much to be concerned about. One of &lt;em&gt;Eternals’&lt;/em&gt; antagonists doesn’t appear until nearly two hours in. Another persistently shows up in the movie but isn’t even given a name on-screen. A key character simply opts out of the third-act fight sequence entirely, unremarked by any other characters until returning out of thin air for the film’s conclusion. And of course, Marvel can’t help itself from hamfistedly setting up future sequels and spinoffs in Eternal’s cliffhanger ending and post-credit scenes (of which there are two, both of which feel more like moments to elicit gasps from comic book fans than any real concrete teaser).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/273pqYxESd2IAb2sI9EY8gydOao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980799/BAB1300_comp_v021_060057.1188.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Courtesy of Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ry1xhD"&gt;For all its flaws in plot and pacing, Eternals is a beautifully shot movie. A lot has already been made about &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/directors/chloe-zhao-oscars-nomadland-marvel-eternals-dracula-1234961719/"&gt;director Chloé Zhao’s insistence&lt;/a&gt; at shooting much of the film in actual, real-world locations instead of the MCU’s characteristic green screen sets, and the difference is clear. &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;’ dusty deserts, clouded beaches, and lush rainforests feel &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; in a way that the CGI landscapes often don’t, with soaring views and sunsets lending a tangibility to the more fantastical goings-on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IA3E5r"&gt;The requisite fight scenes are also great; the Eternals put together its toy box of complementary powers to fun effect, and the golden curlicues that are used as the visual shorthand for everyone’s powers are a nice change from Marvel’s typical color-coded energy blobs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5t10pG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Marvel’s most diverse film yet (although the bar is exceedingly low)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3Zn56s"&gt;Eternals is also Marvel’s most diverse film by far, a bar that, while being so low as to be easily stepped over, is still an achievement to note, belated as it is in the studio’s decade-plus-long run. It is legitimately refreshing to see a wider range of actors on screen beyond the cadre of Chrises, even if the much-hyped debut of Brian Tyree Henry’s gay hero practically feels shot in a way to make it as easy as possible to excise for overseas box office requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICx8aJ"&gt;Ultimately, though, Eternals tries to be too much — and it suffers for it. The film’s lofty goal of being a creation myth for the Marvel universe has potential, but it’s far too much to cram into the constraints of a modern superhero film. It’s no use seeing where these heroes came from if we don’t have enough time to care about who they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NSFP8e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTKSVq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Democrats’ infrastructure bills don’t go far enough on cleaning up the power grid</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US President Joe Biden during the World Leaders’ Summit of the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, on November 2, 2021." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0LwKMcJ5YoqNB5FCO04laZFdr68=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085177/1236294440.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gnx254"&gt;On a call Tuesday morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rallied Democrats to pass two ambitious bills at the heart of President Biden’s agenda, aiming for a final house vote later this week. But the climate provisions of the $1.75 trillion budget reconciliation bill that progressives want to pass alongside a bipartisan infrastructure bill are newly uncertain after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) pushed to further delay the vote during a surprise press conference on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jOOOq"&gt;It’s the latest twist in a long struggle for Congress to pass meaningful legislation in support of the ambitious climate goals President Biden set on entering office. The reconciliation framework released last week puts $555 billion into clean energy, the first major effort to meet the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-sets-2030-greenhouse-gas-pollution-reduction-target-aimed-at-creating-good-paying-union-jobs-and-securing-u-s-leadership-on-clean-energy-technologies/"&gt;Biden administration’s goal&lt;/a&gt; of a power grid running entirely on carbon-free electricity by 2035. But while this bill and the companion infrastructure bill do a lot to speed the growth of clean energy in the US, experts say these two bills won’t get Democrats all the way there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JTiPw5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A really good down payment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u6cQLQ"&gt;“Is it going to be enough? No,” says Leah Stokes, an associate professor of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “This is a really good down payment on the progress that we need.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHFB9P"&gt;The bulk of climate funds in the White House’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/28/build-back-better-framework/"&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt; for the reconciliation bill are for $320 billion in tax incentives for clean energy technologies. Existing tax incentives for wind and solar energy projects give people and utilities some relief from federal income taxes. A key change in this bill is that it would offer direct pay as an alternative. That gives utilities more incentive to build out renewable energy projects since they don’t have a lot of federal tax liability, according to Stokes. There are also new tax credits for batteries and energy storage, microgrid controllers, and other carbon-cutting technologies. The bill also gives home and building owners rebates for electrification projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXyQ4t"&gt;The reconciliation bill would also put significant funding behind supply chains and infrastructure for a future clean energy economy. That includes money to build out brand-new offshore wind infrastructure and a national network of electric vehicle charging stations. Rural communities, which often lack a big enough customer base to fund new projects that require a lot of up front investment, would get nearly $10 billion in grants and loans to transition to renewable energy. Plus there’s $20 billion allocated to incentivize governments to purchase next-generation technologies, including modular nuclear reactors, batteries, and other ways to store renewable energy for long periods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="bgSYMr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;They’ll need to close a huge gap&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NiudpQ"&gt;The reconciliation bill also includes $2.8 billion to site and build new transmission lines, which would add to another &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/us/climate-electricity-infrastructure.html"&gt;$73 billion&lt;/a&gt; investment in grid upgrades written into the separate infrastructure bill. For the grid to operate entirely on clean energy, thousands of miles of new transmission lines will need to be built to bring that energy from far-flung wind and solar farms and hydroelectric dams to the places where people live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRGE2q"&gt;Ultimately, one of the biggest challenges Democrats face with cleaning up the grid and tackling climate change is getting enough renewable energy online in the first place. They’ll need to close a huge gap between how much new clean energy is built each year and how much is needed to reach their climate targets. 2020 saw the most new wind and solar capacity installed, &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=42495"&gt;32GW&lt;/a&gt;, in a single year, according to the Energy Information Administration. But between 60 to 70GW of new clean energy capacity needs to be added each year over the next several decades, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-Long-Term-Strategy.pdf"&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt; document Biden released on November 1 on how his administration plans to meet its longer-term goal of completely slashing greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. A clean grid by 2035 is a key milestone on the path to net-zero emissions by the middle of the century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7AqzBk"&gt;It will be even harder to close that gap after Manchin effectively ended a policy that had previously been at the heart of Democrats’ clean energy strategy. The &lt;a href="https://grist.org/politics/meet-the-cepp-the-biggest-federal-climate-policy-youve-never-heard-of/"&gt;Clean Electricity Performance Program (CEPP)&lt;/a&gt; would have paid utilities to use more carbon-free energy and penalized them for sticking to dirty sources, pushing utilities to add progressively more clean energy each year. As recent as a &lt;a href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/se/date/2021-10-21/segment/01"&gt;CNN Town Hall&lt;/a&gt; on October 21st, Biden said the CEPP was still on the table — with the caveat that Manchin was opposed to it. By the time his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751099/white-house-budget-climate-electric-vehicles-ev-tax-credit-deal-manchin-sinema"&gt;framework was released&lt;/a&gt; a week later, the program was gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cd80OB"&gt;“This is one place where the loss of the CEPP really does make it harder for certain because it was going to send a really clear nationwide signal,” says Leah Rubin Shen, policy director at Advanced Energy Economy, an association of clean energy businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ThXrz"&gt;All the back-and-forth weakens the US’s credibility during the United Nations’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/30/22753391/glasgow-climate-change-summit-cop-26-covid-restrictions"&gt;climate summit&lt;/a&gt; taking place over the next couple weeks. By replacing the CEPP with more clean energy incentives, the White House still expects measures in the reconciliation bill to cut “well over” &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/01/fact-sheet-president-biden-renews-u-s-leadership-on-world-stage-at-u-n-climate-conference-cop26/?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=177665638&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz%E2%80%94MbeUJB3_hmNUMQVeXJMpQiXoqd-g-8RInqqYGD63XKyGafiYj8zPIAMpDFxBZQYwdlrX3AyGdN_yvh4H2BkC0qC7Ccv2otrYoXV3O_eJNhP_WzvU&amp;amp;utm_content=177665638&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;1 gigaton of greenhouse emissions&lt;/a&gt; annually by 2030 so that the US can fulfill commitments it made under the Paris climate agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ui9bt5"&gt;To help close the gap, Biden could direct the EPA to step in with tougher pollution regulations on power plants, as the Obama administration tried to do. States and municipalities will likely have to help make up for the federal shortfall with their own clean electricity standards, too. One in three Americans already live in a place that’s targeting 100 percent clean power, according to Stokes. That includes states like Colorado and California, and cities like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22735645/new-orleans-east-hurricane-ida-entergy-power-shift"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pvqond"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We came really close.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fKRcEH"&gt;“It’s going to continue to be incumbent on state and local governments to drive forward the power sector transformation with the passage of the 100 percent clean electricity laws,” says Sam Ricketts, co-founder and co-director of nonprofit Evergreen Action that pushed for the CEPP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35BbEq"&gt;Advocates are also keeping some hope that federal clean electricity standards could resurface in the future. But that could hinge on the long shot that midterm elections break the congressional stalemate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOWJfZ"&gt;“Look, we came really close. We were one senator away from passing a transformative electricity investment program,” Stokes says. “That’s closer than we’ve ever been.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ej7qjz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEgww9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google News to relaunch in Spain after mandatory payments to newspapers scrapped</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b5UGeanF61rutptGazygIU68AKU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70084975/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zd85vS"&gt;Who should get paid when big tech platforms aggregate news stories? This was the question that prompted Google to &lt;a href="https://digiday.com/media/google-news-spain/"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; its Google News platform in Spain in 2014, after the country decided the US tech giant should cough up a monthly fee to Spanish papers. Today, though, Google announced that Google News &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/google-news-in-spain"&gt;will return to Spain&lt;/a&gt; “early next year” after the country overhauled its online copyright laws in line with EU regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVcwQg"&gt;The big difference from Google’s point of view is that it no longer has to pay a fee to Spain’s entire media industry and can instead negotiate fees with individual publishers. Some may want to charge Google for sharing stories in Google News, and Google can pay them or exclude them, depending on its preference. Other outlets will no doubt waive these fees, judging that the traffic offered by Google News outweighs any lost advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5EdZgK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google says it will try to “reach agreements” with Spanish publishers in the coming months&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ed00mK"&gt;Google says it’ll be working in the coming months with publishers “to reach agreements which cover their rights under the new law.” But just try to guess which side of the bargaining table will have the upper hand. Will it be lone newspaper outlets, struggling against plummeting revenues and industry-wide change? Or will it be the international megacorp that’s one of the most profitable companies in the world? Anyone? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Igy77l"&gt;Really, though, the return of Google News to Spain is just a single skirmish in a long running battle between Europe’s media industry and Big Tech. The former complains that the internet has undermined its business model, and that profits from this new economy have been hoovered up by Google and its kin. The latter reply, “oh well, yeah, I guess so, sorry about that,” and throw some of their megabucks at various “sustainable journalism” initiatives. It’s not exactly been a happy solution, particularly for media companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUU7nH"&gt;To try and rebalance the playing field, many countries have passed or toyed with legislation similar to Spain’s in recent years, including Germany and Belgium. In 2019, these efforts were folded into an EU-wide reform of online copyright law known as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18280726/europe-copyright-directive"&gt;Copyright Directive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8z1N0Z"&gt;If you remember this legislation at all, it’s probably for its so-called “upload filter,” a provision which, in its worst reading, requires tech platforms to check all data uploaded to their sites against copyrighted work. (The difficulty of actually implementing this provision is helpfully illustrated by the fact that the EU Commission is currently &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/commission-starts-legal-action-against-23-eu-countries-over-copyright-rules-2021-07-26/"&gt;suing its own members&lt;/a&gt; for failing to do so.) However, the Copyright Directive also dealt with payments to media companies for use of their content, and it’s &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; part of the legislation — which Spain recently adopted into national law — that has ultimately led to the return of Google News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LXjpNa"&gt;It’s far from the only attempt by countries to give more power to their ailing but vital news industries. In 2020, Google announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302791/google-news-publishers-pay-content-australia-germany-brazil"&gt;new payments&lt;/a&gt; to publishers in Germany, Australia, and Brazil, and earlier this year &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-inks-agreement-in-france-on-paying-publishers-for-news-reuse/"&gt;signed a similar deal with French papers&lt;/a&gt; (also in response to the EU Copyright Directive). Such agreements will no doubt continue to be passed and then superseded as the news industry changes and evolves. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clearview AI ordered to delete all facial recognition data belonging to Australians</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ud0r0rpmpxeY-60SLjM0Km24ufU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70084720/acastro_210512_1777_deepfake_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RBoJJZ"&gt;Controversial facial recognition firm Clearview AI has been ordered to &lt;a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/updates/news-and-media/clearview-ai-breached-australians-privacy"&gt;destroy all images and facial templates&lt;/a&gt; belonging to individuals living in Australia by the country’s national privacy regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cr2CQz"&gt;Clearview, which claims to have scraped 10 billion images of people from social media sites in order to identify them in other photos, sells its technology to law enforcement agencies. It was &lt;a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/afp-admits-to-trialling-controversial-facial-recognition-tool-clearview-ai-546729"&gt;trialled by the Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; (AFP) between October 2019 and March 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQAnQF"&gt;Now, following an investigation, Australia privacy regulator, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), has found that the company breached citizens’ privacy. “The covert collection of this kind of sensitive information is unreasonably intrusive and unfair,” said OAIC privacy commissioner Angelene Falk in a press statement. “It carries significant risk of harm to individuals, including vulnerable groups such as children and victims of crime, whose images can be searched on Clearview AI’s database.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I3o8Pw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When Australians use social media or professional networking sites, they don’t expect their facial images to be collected without their consent”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hF4zbb"&gt;Said Falk: “When Australians use social media or professional networking sites, they don’t expect their facial images to be collected without their consent by a commercial entity to create biometric templates for completely unrelated identification purposes. The indiscriminate scraping of people’s facial images, only a fraction of whom would ever be connected with law enforcement investigations, may adversely impact the personal freedoms of all Australians who perceive themselves to be under surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emHVfC"&gt;The investigation into Clearview’s practices by the OAIC was carried out in conjunction with the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). However, the ICO has &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2021/11/clearview-statement/"&gt;yet to make a decision&lt;/a&gt; about the legality of Clearview’s work in the UK. The agency says it is “considering its next steps and any formal regulatory action that may be appropriate under the UK data protection laws.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9th3t"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/03/facial-recognition-firm-cleaview-ai-to-appeal-order-to-stop-collecting-images-of-australians"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Clearview itself intends to appeal the decision. “Clearview AI operates legitimately according to the laws of its places of business,” Mark Love, a lawyer for the firm BAL Lawyers representing Clearview, told the publication. “Not only has the commissioner’s decision missed the mark on the manner of Clearview AI’s manner of operation, the commissioner lacks jurisdiction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fVxLu"&gt;Clearview argues that the images it collected were publicly available, so no breach of privacy occurred, and that they were published in the US, so Australian law does not apply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXHtX2"&gt;Around the world, though, there is growing discontent with the spread of facial recognition systems, which threaten to eliminate anonymity in public spaces. Yesterday, Facebook parent company Meta announced it was shutting down the social platform’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759613/meta-facebook-face-recognition-automatic-tagging-feature-shutdown"&gt;facial recognition feature&lt;/a&gt; and deleting the facial templates it created for the system. The company cited “growing concerns about the use of this technology as a whole.” Meta also recently paid a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/27/22304618/judge-approves-facebook-privacy-settlement-illinois-facial-recognition"&gt;$650 million settlement&lt;/a&gt; after the tech was found to have breached privacy laws in Illinois in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Happy Halloween! Theranos showed up in a Pfizer costume</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Attends Criminal Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V9XNLHV-2QhUZjDLMi-_TKc0_XI=/0x0:3999x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70082767/1235841403.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;With a logo on a memo and a little bit of language trickery, Theranos snookered rich investors&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="SGiMTW"&gt;Today we learned more about Theranos’ kink for corporate cosplay. The company liked to dress up its own reports in pharmaceutical companies’ logos, to use the present tense when the future tense would be more appropriate, and to reiterate its favorite buzzwords in PowerPoint slide after PowerPoint slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xNLDNi"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes’ lawyers, in defending her against the wire fraud charges that the government has brought, resumed cross-examination of Lisa Peterson, who worked for the DeVos family offices and was involved in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747918/theranos-devos-due-diligence-fraud-trial"&gt;approving their investment in the company&lt;/a&gt;. (Family offices are a rich people thing — an investment arm for all that sweet, sweet money.) The defense tried to discredit Peterson’s testimony from last week about a key Pfizer memo, which she said was crucial to thinking the company was onto something big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62PsiF"&gt;The only problem? Pfizer didn’t write it. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-elizabeth-holmes-trial-former-pfizer-scientist-says-theranos-used-pharma-logo-without-permission-11634942227"&gt;A former scientist at the company testified&lt;/a&gt; that Theranos changed a report the blood-testing startup had made to include the unauthorized use of the Pfizer logo. Pfizer’s actual findings were that Theranos’ conclusions in that report were “not believable,” the former Pfizer scientist had testified. But Peterson didn’t know that, and had relied on the memo as real validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CRYdYs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We wound up talking about verb tenses&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="99DYQz"&gt;Homes’ defense attorney Lance Wade pointed out that Theranos’ physical address and website were at the bottom of that Pfizer memo, in the footer. The text of the footer was considerably smaller than the Pfizer logo at the top of the page, suggesting the relative importance of each piece of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LpRI0K"&gt;When the prosecution got a chance to talk with Peterson again, they asked her if the footer information would have convinced her the memo wasn’t from Pfizer. No, she said — the logo on the top was big. When she and her colleagues were considering an investment, “we really relied on the fact that they had been doing work for pharmaceutical companies and the government for years,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nj3Bws"&gt;This was how we wound up talking about verb tenses. After establishing that Peterson knows what the future is, the prosecution went through some Theranos slides. “Theranos proprietary technology runs comprehensive blood tests from a finger stick,” one read. “Runs” is present tense and indicates that the tests are &lt;em&gt;currently &lt;/em&gt;happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjWZNZ"&gt;In fact we ran through several slides to discuss verb tenses — all of which were present or past, not future. During the cross-examination, Wade had returned to an idea he’d floated earlier in the trial: that the investors in Theranos were sophisticated, and that they’d even signed paperwork saying that Theranos was a speculative investment. The implication seemed to be that Theranos wasn’t devious — Peterson was just sloppy, and Theranos was promising what it would do in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7n2oC"&gt;But the language in the presentation undercut that idea. Somewhere, a grammarian rejoiced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="9onVHC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“On a couple of occasions I attempted to ask questions to other Theranos staff in the meeting and the response was interrupted by Ms. Holmes.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nvwGUN"&gt;After Peterson left the stand, we were treated to more Big Pharma testimony, this time from Constance Cullen, who worked at Schering-Plough, which was then acquired by Merck. In 2009, Cullen’s boss had asked her to evaluate Theranos’ tech. In the course of doing so, Cullen met with Holmes and other people at Theranos, but it seems Holmes did all the talking.  “On a couple of occasions I attempted to ask questions to other Theranos staff in the meeting and the response was interrupted by Ms. Holmes,” Cullen testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3D06jE"&gt;During the meeting, Cullen said she found Holmes’ answers to technical questions “cagey.” Originally, there was supposed to be validation data at that meeting, but it wasn’t actually delivered by Theranos until December 2009 — and since Theranos was the party conducting the validation studies, only Theranos’ logo appeared on the report. Neither she nor anyone else at Schering-Plough said its conclusions were accurate, she testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLeA2G"&gt;Things were hectic for Cullen, since Merck had just acquired her company and she was now managing a larger team. She postponed discussing the report, and did not return to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EiiPTy"&gt;Still, Theranos approached Walgreens in 2010 with a version of that validation report. &lt;em&gt;This &lt;/em&gt;version had the Schering-Plough logo atop it. In an email accompanying the report, Holmes wrote, “As per our discussion, please find three independent due diligence reports on Theranos systems attached to this email. These reports are from GlaxoSmithKlein, Pfizer and Schering-Plough after their own technical validation and experience with Theranos Systems in the field.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="K7eU8X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Goodbye, big bad needle.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iSCQzJ"&gt;The new version of the report had a new conclusion. While the original version said that Theranos devices “give accurate and precise results,” the new logo report said that Theranos devices “give more accurate and precise results… than current ‘gold standard’ reference methods.&lt;em&gt;” &lt;/em&gt;Schering-Plough hadn’t approved the old language; it certainly hadn’t approved the new language — Theranos had written both versions of the report. Schering-Plough hadn’t responded to the original in any way, and was likely unaware of the… let’s say &lt;em&gt;enhanced &lt;/em&gt;version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvtiOF"&gt;The memos and slideshows resurfaced in the testimony of Daniel Mosley, who invested “a little under $6 million” in Theranos, after his buddy Henry Kissinger, a Theranos board member, asked him to evaluate the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="linHkc"&gt;Like Peterson, Mosley was won over by the work Theranos said it had done with the government and large pharma companies. In the memo Mosley wrote to Kissinger, he seemed very impressed by the not-Pfizer memo, even devoting an entire section of his own memo to its findings. It wasn’t just the logo that made him think Pfizer was behind the report; the conclusions read like they were from a third party, he testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Rj7L6"&gt;Mosley also thought all Theranos tests were done by fingerstick, largely because of the materials Theranos provided him with. We saw a Theranos-generated slide of a child captioned “Goodbye, big bad needle” and another that read “Our certified labs perform precise tests on a sample 1/1,000 the size of a typical blood draw. No big vials to fill. No more searching for a vein.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="K2fGe1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Rob Walton ran into one of your board members over the weekend at the Grove.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9L42C6"&gt;At times, Mosley’s testimony felt like a live reading of the social register. He had worked at a famous and fancy law firm, Cravath, where his job was counseling rich people about how to stay rich. Some of his clients invested in Theranos — the DeVos family was in for $100 million; the Walmart heirs, the Waltons, were in for $150 million; the Cox family invested $10 million of its cable wealth; and Kissinger’s trust went in for $3 million. Andreas Dracopolous of the Stavros Niarchos Foundation went in for $25 million, and John Elkann, of the family that owns Ferrari, invested $5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xScI9d"&gt;The testimony placed Mosley at the center of a group of extremely rich and influential people, but as if to drive home the point we viewed an email from him to Holmes. The day after talking with her for the first time, he offered to introduce her to the Walton family. Then, he followed up: “Rob Walton ran into one of your board members over the weekend at the Grove.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aj5tFH"&gt;I’m not sure which board member this was — the testimony didn’t specify — but by “the Grove,” Mosley meant the ultra-exclusive boys’ club &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/bohemian-grove-where-the-rich-and-powerful-go-to-misbehave/2011/06/15/AGPV1sVH_blog.html"&gt;The Bohemian Grove&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately he did not get into the weird naked rituals or anything else of interest to us plebeians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="cWKReo"&gt;With Mosley, as with Peterson, the defense seemed to be suggesting that the Theranos investors were simply dimwitted — rich, dull, and incapable of checking up on the things they poured their money into. But between the language Theranos used in its presentations, its tweaked memos that weren’t &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;from pharmaceutical companies, and its continued emphasis that its tests were faster and better than anything else, it seems obvious that Theranos &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; its investors to believe the hype. Just because someone is sloppy doesn’t make it okay to try to trick them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zillow reportedly needs to sell 7,000 houses after it bought too many</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cFRnEGEG8S8DUxEkOpI3I0tPVhY=/252x0:3252x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70076828/High_Res_Zillow_DeviceProductImage_b_01.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Zillow&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ODl9et"&gt;Zillow is trying to offload around $2.8 billion worth of houses onto investors after it bought them with the intent of selling them to hopeful homeowners and landlords, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-01/zillow-selling-7-000-homes-for-2-8-billion-after-flipping-halt?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This follows &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-18/zillow-s-flipping-snag-spotlights-risk-in-cooling-housing-market?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;another &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; that the real estate browsing website had to stop buying houses when it found itself with excess inventory after the company told investors it planned on ramping up its flipping business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAMtou"&gt;On Tuesday, Zillow announced in its earnings report that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760080/zillow-offers-home-selling-ibuyer-wind-down-excess-inventory-losses-financial-results"&gt;winding down the practice entirely&lt;/a&gt;, and estimated that it’ll lose over half a billion dollars in value on the houses it owns. It also announced that it would be laying off about a quarter of its employees, and said that it had underestimated how unpredictable the housing market is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PhdD68"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Zillow is moving out of the home-selling business ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760080/zillow-offers-home-selling-ibuyer-wind-down-excess-inventory-losses-financial-results"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oKPG4A"&gt;Some readers may be surprised that Zillow buys and sells houses, rather than just acting as a place for real estate agents to post listings — I was too when I first heard about it, but the company has actually been doing this for years through &lt;a href="https://www.zillow.com/offers/"&gt;its Zillow Offers program&lt;/a&gt;. According to its site, the idea is that Zillow will buy your house in cash, streamlining the process significantly. It’ll then deal with any repairs or quick renovations and then sell the house itself. It’s not the only one with this business model either — competing real estate site Redfin has a similar program, and there are entire companies dedicated to internet-based home-buying, like OpenDoor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PhbSLH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Zillow was in an “arms race” to scoop up houses throughout the summer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XbmscU"&gt;In August, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ymxz/zillow-other-tech-firms-are-in-an-arms-race-to-buy-up-american-homes"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; article detailed&lt;/a&gt; what it described as an “arms race” among tech companies that were trying to buy up as much real estate as possible as &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/9/16/22674410/housing-crisis-homelessness-poll"&gt;housing prices exploded across the country&lt;/a&gt;. According to the report, Zillow bet big, telling investors that it planned to buy thousands of houses throughout 2021 and turn its Homes division into a billion-dollar business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syrXK4"&gt;As the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547454/2021-heat-wave-temperature-high-heat-dome"&gt;staggeringly hot summer&lt;/a&gt; came to an end, though, it seemed like Zillow’s Offers business was also cooling down — in October, &lt;a href="https://investors.zillowgroup.com/investors/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/At-Operational-Capacity-Zillow-Offers-to-Focus-on-Signed-Customer-Contracts-and-Current-Inventory-Suspends-Signing-of-New-Contracts-Through-2021/default.aspx"&gt;the company told investors&lt;/a&gt; that it would stop buying houses, citing construction, renovation, and closing labor shortages. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, however, speculated that it &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-18/zillow-s-flipping-snag-spotlights-risk-in-cooling-housing-market?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;could also be motivated by excess inventory&lt;/a&gt; and reported that Zillow seemed to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-26/zillow-s-zeal-to-outbid-for-homes-backfires-in-flipping-fumble?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;sell a good number of houses at a loss&lt;/a&gt; instead of a profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oTwoMQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The housing market has been on a wild ride, and it’s probably not Zillow’s fault&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C180e2"&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-01/zillow-selling-7-000-homes-for-2-8-billion-after-flipping-halt"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Zillow is looking to offload around 7,000 of the homes it bought. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like individual house hunters will be able to benefit from Zillow’s troubles — &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports that the company is trying to sell the homes to “institutional investors” (read: Wall Street-like firms) to the tune of $2.8 billion. To would-be homebuyers who have been turned down due to a seemingly endless supply of cash buyers, it &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22524829/wall-street-housing-market-blackrock-bubble"&gt;may feel like a slap in the face&lt;/a&gt;. However, it doesn’t seem like the housing market’s wild ride is entirely due to investment bankers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hheedq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22524829/wall-street-housing-market-blackrock-bubble"&gt;A report from &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cites research that investors only made up about 20 percent of the home-buying market in 2020, and &lt;a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/zillow-ibuyer-report-q2-2021-30011/"&gt;Zillow says that it&lt;/a&gt; and its competitors made up around 1 percent of the housing market in Q2 2021. In some ways, those numbers are both terrifying and reassuring — a fifth of the housing market is a massive and influential chunk, but it also means that it likely wasn’t a private equity firm (or Zillow) that outbid you on your dream home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BLq9I"&gt;It’s hard to tell what will come of this sale and how it’ll affect Zillow’s home flipping plans in the future. However, it probably won’t stop &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22743258/home-buying-zillow-redfin-ibuyers-real-estate"&gt;the conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt; that Zillow is driving up prices on purpose, and if I’m any indication, it won’t make home hopefuls feel any better about their chances of scoring a place to live. Perhaps it’s just another data point for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744728/money-fandom-cryptocurrency-retail-trades-stocks"&gt;the argument that finances are a meme now&lt;/a&gt; and that betting big doesn’t mean you’re going to get what you’re hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdNt0X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 2nd, 7:15PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Zillow ending its Offers program.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are a go-to pick that’s often on sale&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HYaZ7v"&gt;Tis’ the season for AirPods discounts galore. Last week, Apple finally launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third generation of AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, introducing a new AirPods lineup and dropping the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level AirPods from $159 to $129. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; are also just around the corner, meaning many retailers are also starting to discount the AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, and even the aforementioned third-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hV5pag"&gt;Even this far ahead of the shopping holiday, there are sizable discounts to be had on the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TaIhNe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Which AirPods model should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFDHZw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10742787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ej2msf"&gt;The best entry-level &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; (second-gen) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eg29V6"&gt;Once $159, Apple recently lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — to $129. Moreover, it only sells the model with a wired charging case, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. What’s great, though, is that this version frequently gets discounted, so you can buy it for even less. Right now, for instance, you can find Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods for $120 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0lrWhTzc2xyIWSIWPUxqHXoGUkG0HdVMNz%253A%253AT00%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3D0lrWhTzc2xyIWSIWPUxqHXoGUkG0HdVMNz%253A%253AT00%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodDeals110221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747976896193620917" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;Although you can’t buy them from Apple, you can still also buy the entry-level AirPods with a wireless charging case elsewhere, which you can charge via a Qi wireless pad or a Lightning cable. Right now, you can get a pair for $150 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0lrWhTzc2xyIWSIWPUxqHXoGUkG0Hf3UNz%253A%253AT00%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3D0lrWhTzc2xyIWSIWPUxqHXoGUkG0Hf3UNz%253A%253AT00%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodDeals110221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; instead of their typical $199 list price. However, given the latest AirPods — which we’ll dive into just a minute — cost $30 extra and come with MagSafe support along with other perks, it may not be worth buying this model unless you’re truly strapped for cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d2yjBK"&gt;As previously mentioned, the newest pair of wireless earbuds support Apple’s MagSafe technology. The short stems allow for a more subtle design, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model. Deals are currently hard to come by on the third-gen model given how recently they launched, however, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling them right now for $175. It’s a small discount, but also their lowest price yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q2OXRZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="qBADDX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Iewbkw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S8o5q4"&gt;We think Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy, regardless of the price. They have better sound quality than the models above, offer active noise cancellation, and come with a wireless charging case. The earbuds also support Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; feature, which adds an immersive surround sound effect to select content, and comes with swappable silicone tips. In addition, they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713126/airpods-pro-conversation-boost-firmware-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently received a firmware&lt;/a&gt; update that added Conversation Boost, an accessibility feature for those who are hard of hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM8uVd"&gt;Additionally, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733183/apple-magsafe-charging-case-airpods-pro-qi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently launched a new version&lt;/a&gt; of the AirPods Pro with a wireless charging case that supports Apple’s MagSafe technology, just like the third-gen AirPods. These start at $249, but you can buy them right now for $190 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you prefer, you can also purchase the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZPC9QD4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;older version&lt;/a&gt; without MagSafe compatibility — which still supports Qi-compatible wireless chargers — for a discounted $175 at Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="THtgJp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, wrapped in aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max have been discounted to $449 at Amazon in the past month, there are currently no sales that deep to speak of. The Max are, however, currently available in all colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThsYtSLBr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $479, one of their better prices in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now, technically, build your own USB-C iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ldEp4WZoNnialYf5G-AJwwWJ08=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70081607/usbciphone.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rUhqOu"&gt;Robotics engineering student Ken Pillonel wowed the internet last month with a wild hack that managed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722123/first-iphone-usb-c-port-robotics-engineering-student-custom"&gt;put a working USB-C port&lt;/a&gt; inside an iPhone X for a fully functional USB-C iPhone. And now, Pillonel has published a far more detailed video showing just how he managed to pull off the hack, &lt;a href="https://github.com/kenp-io/not-for-iphone-usb-c/tree/master/ip-x"&gt;along with a Github repository&lt;/a&gt; with technical details, CNC instructions, and information on the custom PCB that he designed for anyone brave enough to try and put together a similar hack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiIyLz"&gt;The 13-minute-long video shows off the nitty-gritty of Pillonel’s mod, which is simple in theory: combining a Lightning to USB-C connection together in a daisy chain to mimic a proper USB-C port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="brDvJQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FVEQJNRmfDQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cumahx"&gt;The video shows off virtually the whole development process. It’s quite a journey, going from proof of concept prototypes, reverse engineering the Lightning connector (and eventually, reverse engineering a fake Lightning connector), ordering a custom flexible circle board, and machining the iPhone’s case to fit the physically larger USB-C connector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEhnb7"&gt;The video also shows off just how difficult it was to fit the extra circuitry, with the board bending around both sides of Apple’s Taptic Engine hardware to squeeze in all the necessary components. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOKSKv"&gt;Pillonel is also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F165161363347&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F2%2F22759704%2Fusb-c-iphone-hack-mod-open-source-github-repo-ken-pillonel-design-video" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;auctioning off his original prototype&lt;/a&gt; on eBay, where bidding has already reached $3,400 as of the time of publishing this piece, for anyone with deep pockets that’s interested in a USB-C iPhone of their own. Pillonel does note that whoever does buy the phone shouldn’t restore, update, or erase it, open it, or “use it as your daily phone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQr8ch"&gt;Lastly, Pillonel has made the whole project open source so that others can build on his existing work, whether that’s making more custom USB-C iPhone X models or porting the design to other iPhones down the line (although the full PCB design won’t be posted until after the auction finished). He also notes that he plans to continue to build on the design, with goals for improving fast-charging, waterproofing, and even enabling USB-C accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGSJs6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
