    <title>New Trailers: The Wheel of Time, The Witcher, Lightyear, House of Gucci, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cewKpItAR-wkhYlwNAx5kLx4woI=/204x0:1089x590/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70071195/wheelotime.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Rosamund Pike stars in The Wheel of Time | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZozKfRqvA&amp;amp;ab_channel=AmazonPrimeVideo" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Prime Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zfaWAk"&gt;I’m close to giving up on &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt;; the latest episode spends a lot of time building up to a twist that makes very little sense given the season so far. They only have three episodes left and a lot of plot to push forward. Luckily, &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; is getting good and juicy with the Roy siblings choosing sides, and I’m also getting caught up in &lt;em&gt;Maid&lt;/em&gt;, mainly because of Margaret Qualley’s strong performance as Alex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lj9744"&gt;So much to watch, so little time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAZ0Mi"&gt;We’re heavy into the sci-fi and fantasy realms in this week’s roundup, but there’s a little fashion and murder-mystery as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XgKrS7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/11ZozKfRqvA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="x9cdzq"&gt;The Wheel of Time &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gPYLDh"&gt;We’ve seen a few glimpses of&lt;em&gt; The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; series based on the books by Robert Jordan, but this latest trailer shows us the beginning of the story, with Moiraine Damodred of the Aes Sedai trying to figure out how to stop the Dark One. She finds five magic using people she thinks could be the key (or keys) to saving the world (whether they’re up for it or not). Rosamund Pike, Daniel Henney, Josha Stradowski, Marcus Rutherford, and Zoe Robins star in &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time,&lt;/em&gt; which drops the first episode of its eight-episode season on Amazon Prime Video November 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hk16bQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: You can watch this trailer as a “360 experience” (I didn’t think it really added a lot here, though)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QZUAXf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WX6e6ZLNmtA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tptg94"&gt;The Witcher&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nromUq"&gt;We’ve seen a few &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570627/the-witcher-season-two-teaser-trailer-netflix-henry-cavill"&gt;teasers&lt;/a&gt; and sneak &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22462967/the-witcher-season-2-trailer-netflix-geeked-week"&gt;peeks&lt;/a&gt; and first-look &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22691354/witcher-season-2-blood-origin-trailer-teaser-watch-premiere-date-netflix"&gt;clips&lt;/a&gt; from the second season of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; and now we have a full-length trailer with some juicy details about what’s next for Geralt of Rivia and company. War with the Nilfgaardian Empire is looming, along with the possible “end of days” (which Geralt scoffs at), Geralt is hunting enormous monsters, and Ciri is tapping in to her powers while Jaskier is befriending some small rodents (rats? mice? something else entirely?). Henry Cavill, Freya Allen, Anya Chalotra, Joey Batey, Anna Shaffer, and Kim Bodnia star in season 2 of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;, coming to Netflix December 17th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JOrHoq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BwPL0Md_QFQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Y3IoJ4"&gt;Lightyear&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HbroDw"&gt;At last, a Pixar movie that doesn’t immediately look like it will tear the hearts out of parents (honestly, I am still traumatized by &lt;em&gt;Inside Out&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Toy Story 3&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;em&gt;Lightyear&lt;/em&gt; is the backstory of the “real” astronaut on whom the the Buzz Lightyear action figure from &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt; is based. The teaser shows what looks like a familiar space exploration adventure, with the requisite aliens and spaceships, and Chris Evans provides the hero’s voice. &lt;em&gt;Lightyear&lt;/em&gt; will be released June 17th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yZ8vMx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eGNnpVKxV6s?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="xyMnmc"&gt;House of Gucci&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rrcHc8"&gt;We have a second trailer for the movie about the Gucci family starring Lady Gaga, and of course everyone looks fabulous and beautiful, even though the “Italian” accents from the lead actors are... a little off? Based on the book by Sara Gay Forden, &lt;em&gt;House of Gucci&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of Patrizia Reggiani’s marriage to Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver), and her plot to hire an assassin to kill him. Jared Leto, Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, and Salma Hayek also star in &lt;em&gt;House of Gucci &lt;/em&gt;which arrives in theaters November 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uFQHhE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_h6DQWE2Mk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aBfFKD"&gt;Servant &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BF1ATL"&gt;Look, you can only show me so many long, ominous, darkly-lit hallways before the trick gets old. In its first season this show had promise (and Lauren Ambrose gives a tremendous performance as Dorothy), but by season three it defies logic (and is beyond sadistic) that Dorothy’s family would continue to hide from her the truth about what happened to her baby. Maybe they’ll finally do the ethical thing. But now, apparently, the show is more interested in the cult that nanny Leanne (the servant of the show’s title) escaped from. If you’re still hoping for an M. Night Shyamalan plot twist, you can check out season three of &lt;em&gt;Servant&lt;/em&gt; on Apple Plus TV starting January 21st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldIe5z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qp16VV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hMRMN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox has been down for days and it’s not because of Chipotle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration, the Roblox app seen displayed on..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Z93R08Jhhr70ewtLc6sU5fOvY8=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70067162/1232025961.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Thiago Prudêncio/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="akdtjY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; has been down for more than two days, with the game and its related website offline for millions of players. The hugely popular game-creating platform first started having issues at around 7PM ET on October 28th. &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; initially said it was “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1454105518197280770"&gt;working hard to get things back to normal&lt;/a&gt;,” and that it had identified “the root cause as [an] internal system issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HMNFn"&gt;On Sunday, the company said in a tweet that it had identified the root cause of the issue and a solution, but didn’t elaborate on what they were, and didn’t provide an estimate for when the site would be functional again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2NWK95"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We have identified root cause and solution. We are working on getting things back online and we will keep you updated throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;— Roblox (@Roblox) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1454849220012220423?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wh8QEC"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; late Saturday, &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; confirmed its platform wasn’t down due to an “external intrusion,” and that the company is working “around the clock” to resolve the huge outage. “We believe we have identified an underlying internal cause of the outage with no evidence of an external intrusion,” says a &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;spokesperson. “We are in the process of performing the necessary engineering and maintenance work to get Roblox back up and running as soon as possible. We apologize that our community is unable to be on Roblox during this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maJP7f"&gt;Initially, some &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; players speculated the outage could be related to a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chipotle-to-open-virtual-restaurant-on-roblox-with-1-million-in-free-burritos-and-serve-up-5-digital-entree-offer-for-boorito-301408455.html"&gt;Chipotle promotion&lt;/a&gt; in the game. Chipotle is giving away $1 million worth of free burritos on &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; as part of Halloween event in the game. The experience went live at 6:30PM ET on October 28th, just before the widespread &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; outage began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58zYa4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; was quick to reveal its issues aren’t related to the Chipotle promotion, though. “We know that this outage was not related to any specific experiences or partnerships on the platform,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1454215549014069249"&gt;says the official &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5kGUP"&gt;It’s a surprisingly long outage for &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, with players still waiting to hear exactly when the game will return. The main &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; site is offline in a maintenance mode, and the &lt;a href="https://status.roblox.com/pages/incident/59db90dbcdeb2f04dadcf16d/617b33af51fec9053d6122a1"&gt;status page&lt;/a&gt; was only updated after more than 24 hours on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz5uDt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is very popular, especially with kids — &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1949710/roblox-is-getting-kids-attention-next-stop-an-ipo/"&gt;more than 50 percent&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; players are under the age of 13. More than 40 million people play it daily, and its popularity surged through 2020 during the pandemic. Millions of people have flocked to the game-creating game, app, platform, or however you want to describe it, to play games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502149/roblox-virtual-music-events-concerts-ava-max-interview"&gt;attend gigs&lt;/a&gt;, and even appear at awards shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnMw9U"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, October 30th 5:05PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with a statement from &lt;/em&gt;Roblox&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NsWHK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 31st 1:22PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Includes latest statement from Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Home app gets new Photo Frame settings and possible Weather Frog display option</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-p2m-Ma6FrWBBwn6T5F5gIAX2ZQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70070962/dseifert_190905_3634_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FdPIIq"&gt;Google Home, the companion app for Google’s smart home products, is changing the way users interact with photos on the app and on Nest Hub devices. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/31/google-home-photo-frame/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first noticed the changes, which include a revamped Photo Frame settings menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ht3VAI"&gt;Now, when you use Google Home to change the displayed album while your Nest Hub is idle, you’ll see a carousel-style UI that gives you the option to choose from curated groups of photos, categorized as “Select family &amp;amp; friends,” “Recent highlights,” and “Favorites,” &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports. Scroll past that, and you’ll be able to see all the albums that you’ve created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nlov80"&gt;A preview window appears at the bottom of the page, and you can swipe through the preview carousel to see how your pictures will look when displayed on your Nest Hub. &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; also notes that the time and weather are displayed at the bottom-left corner of the preview window on iOS, but only the photo appears on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHFoEa"&gt;In addition to the new Photo Frame settings, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/31/nest-hub-weather-frog-photos/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also reports that the Nest Hub may be getting a new clock face option that includes the beloved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22259921/google-smart-displays-froggy-weather-frog"&gt;Weather Frog&lt;/a&gt;. Also known as Froggy, the character &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/27/google-nest-hub-weather-frog/"&gt;first became available on the Nest Hub as a display option&lt;/a&gt; that shows the time, along with an animated depiction of the current weather conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlzNSF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; found that there’s a new option in the Photo Frame menu, called Google Weather Frog, and its description on the app implies you’ll be able to display Froggy alongside weather conditions and your photos. The feature appears to be unfinished, so it remains unclear just how Froggy might interact with your photos once it’s officially released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qg3ich"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google’s Nest Hubs will warn users about nearby pollution and smoke","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623397/google-nest-hubs-air-pollution-smoke-alert-feature"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Go read this story about how online orders are burning out Chipotle workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="chipotle essays" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pNjEfH-yygCiFVw-5rG6trFyIXk=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70070687/Bags_All.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;To go bags, to go bags everywhere.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IoIGEk"&gt;Chipotle is a pioneer of the fast assembly-line restaurant format, where you get in line and guide a human worker through the process to build your meal while you watch. It’s a foolproof system, or so I thought before I &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-like-being-ripped-into-two-chipotle-workers-overwhelmed-by-online-orders-and-furious-customers-11635422149"&gt;checked out this investigative story by &lt;em&gt;MarketWatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; revealing how Chipotle is handling the growth of online orders in a pandemic world. Once I read the accounts of various Chipotle employees interviewed in the MarketWatch article, I was stunned by what they really go through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mL8JV"&gt;One employee detailed the struggle with the onslaught of online orders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8HbvAN"&gt;“People would just stare at us, angry,” he said. “Orders were coming in faster than they could be made. We would frequently see orders of 75, 80, 90 items within a 15-minute time span.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BxN2Hk"&gt;The idea that a comprehensive and option-fatigued robotic ordering system can mesh with an established real-life arrangement is proven very wrong, according to &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-like-being-ripped-into-two-chipotle-workers-overwhelmed-by-online-orders-and-furious-customers-11635422149"&gt;the article&lt;/a&gt;. Anecdotes from Chipotle workers describe how the company handles these complex online orders in your physical absence. For instance, what they do to your online order when they run out of steak or beans (which apparently happens often enough) is a real dilemma with a not so satisfactory official procedure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="lYHUOw"&gt;“We’re told if we have no steak, give them chicken.” That kind of substitution has made some customers angry, and he said that at his store, “managers will step in to make sure workers don’t get yelled at.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="y3tc3W"&gt;This piece not only describes what it’s like to work on the front line at Chipotle, but includes tone-deaf corporate statements, union-sponsored walk-outs (Chipotle is not yet unionized), and even burrito business stats. &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-like-being-ripped-into-two-chipotle-workers-overwhelmed-by-online-orders-and-furious-customers-11635422149"&gt;Go read this excellent article&lt;/a&gt; that shows what your burrito really costs. As for me, I’m now thinking twice before making Chipotle workers read off my unnecessarily complicated online order of half brown and half white rice with extra romaine lettuce.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EEA47d"&gt;Apple has apparently pulled its 21.5-inch Intel-based iMac from shelves (via &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/30/apple-discontinues-intel-based-21-5-inch-imac/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Its discontinuation doesn’t come as much of a surprise, now that Apple is transitioning from using Intel processors to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;in-house M1 chip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aha88K"&gt;The 21.5-inch iMac was still available after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724306/apple-macbook-pro-event-biggest-announcements-airpods-m1-pro-max"&gt;Apple’s October 18th Unleashed event&lt;/a&gt; — it didn’t appear to go missing until sometime this week, according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;. The $1,099 21.5-inch iMac, which came with a 2.3GHz dual-core 7th-Gen Intel Core i5 and an Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, is no longer found on the list of available iMacs on &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/imac-imac"&gt;Apple’s online store&lt;/a&gt;. A “Buy” button also doesn’t appear for the 21.5-inch iMac on &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/compare/"&gt;Apple’s product comparison&lt;/a&gt; page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kq2X6M"&gt;We reached out to Apple to confirm the changes, but didn’t immediately receive a response. However, the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;that the machine is being discontinued and won’t be sold through Apple’s online store or in its retail stores.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iMac 21.5-inch no Buy button" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b9iluU0J1oDkmKKq_-1Bf_NdmA4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972383/imac_21_5_inch_apple_store.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XxhHmI"&gt;Apple hasn’t eliminated its entire lineup of Intel-based iMacs just yet — it’s still selling &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/imac-imac"&gt;the 27-inch Intel-based iMac&lt;/a&gt;, which sports up to a 3.6GHz 10-core Intel Core i9 CPU, at a starting price of $1799.99. As &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes, you can still purchase &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/30/apple-discontinues-intel-based-21-5-inch-imac/"&gt;a refurbished 21.5-inch iMac&lt;/a&gt; from Apple’s online store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arlcCG"&gt;In March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341882/apple-discontinuing-21-5-inch-imac"&gt;Apple discontinued the 512GB and 1TB configurations&lt;/a&gt; of the 21.5-inch iMac, so the company has been slowly phasing out this model for a while. And since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Apple debuted its thinner, more colorful M1-powered iMacs in April&lt;/a&gt;, it only makes sense for Apple to clear some space on its shelves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5cMcUQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mac-shaped pillow makers are back so you can cover your couch in computers</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kidsmGdfuAQnzGLmB446m_LV7xM=/0x29:680x482/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70070303/9a7f391962bd6d6325579b959c662279_original.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Throwboy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MbSbzA"&gt;A company called Throwboy is &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/throwboy/the-iconic-pillow-collection-2-by-throwboy/description"&gt;back with another Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; for a collection of pillows shaped like classic Macs, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/18/17715884/throwboy-pillow-retro-macintosh-imac-iphone-ipod-nostalgia"&gt;its 2018 line of Apple-inspired plushes&lt;/a&gt;. It’s fittingly called The Iconic Pillow Collection 2, and features pillows shaped like soft versions of Apple’s Lisa, iBook, and both the cheese grater and cube flavors of Power Mac. For Apple history buffs who want to spruce up their living or bedrooms, it may be a campaign worth investigating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xB3tvA"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/throwboy/the-iconic-pillow-collection-by-throwboy/description"&gt;its original collection&lt;/a&gt; (which featured pillows shaped like the Finder icon, original Macintosh, and iPods), Throwboy tactfully didn’t mention specific computer names, and it refrained from doing so this time around as well. The Lisa-shaped pillow is called the 1983, the iMac G4-esque one is branded the 2002, and so on. On its Kickstarter page, the company says it picked these specific computers because they were “swing for the fences” designs that people still love.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UM30jdXoFIM2OI-BVvNAt1qCRhQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968405/d6c64d48dd1df102720c22a37e137832_original.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Throwboy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pictured: a (hopefully) safe naming scheme.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TCp80r"&gt;Truly, there are some stunning designs on display in this Kickstarter. I’m pretty sure I haven’t seen a laptop-shaped pillow like the 1999, and I’m &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;sure I’ve never seen an iMac G4-shaped pillow. It’s unclear how comfortable these pillows will be on a couch, or if they’ll hold up in a pillow fight (though I already want to wield the 2002 like I’m Darth Mac), but as conversation starters they’d be hard to beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ljol61"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PNym5z"&gt;That’s not even mentioning the ports — yes, at the same time Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;adding back HDMI and MagSafe back to its real laptops&lt;/a&gt;, Throwboy has gone and added port-shaped stitching to Apple-shaped pillows. I’d say more about how much this fills me with joy, but I think I’ll let the pictures say hello for themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/461ynHXR66vvKOB5VQyACkM4x0A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968408/acb9cf6f6c229217ceae429182702802_original.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Throwboy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yeah, but does your pillow have FireWire?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8YBYUs0eBSsC2-PPtsvE13ht2ok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968409/440e63f486ee465a06bbde69888b5321_original.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Throwboy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the only time a keyboard feeling pillowy is a good thing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pUMCjw"&gt;While Throwboy’s Kickstarter campaign for the original Iconic collection appears to be successful (&lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/throwboy/the-iconic-pillow-collection-by-throwboy/comments"&gt;the comments&lt;/a&gt; are largely filled with people who received and are happy with their pillows, and you can buy them &lt;a href="https://throwboy.com/collections/throwboy-pillows"&gt;on Throwboy’s website&lt;/a&gt;), it’s always worth proceeding with caution when it comes to crowdfunding. Projects, even from successful creators, can run late, turn out different than expected, or even get cancelled for one reason or another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMwdAc"&gt;If that’s a risk you’re willing to take (and it apparently is for a lot of people; the project met its $10,000 goal in its first day), these &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/throwboy/the-iconic-pillow-collection-2-by-throwboy/description"&gt;are some extremely fun pillow designs&lt;/a&gt; if you’re in the market for some Apple-themed home decor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Listen to Device Orchestra cover the Ghostbusters theme using electric toothbrushes and a steam iron</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Ghostbusters device orchestra" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VYcjQ_aDq2-lLXhnhcRqdjFLB8Q=/90x0:2790x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70068158/device_orchestra_ghostbusters.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5DHGtI"&gt;An inspired musician can use pretty much anything as an instrument, but this just-in-time for Halloween cover of the &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt; theme song goes in an unexpected direction. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDwMh0pu1iSXeKx7qmqjIQA"&gt;Device Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; is dedicated to posting music videos recorded solely with the sounds of common household devices. It’s the work of a Finnish YouTuber who’s been creating gadget-powered covers since 2014 (via &lt;a href="https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/Device_Orchestra"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wikitubia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This time, Device Orchestra busted out 14 gadgets for its composition — including electric toothbrushes adorned with googly eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjHgYQ"&gt;One electric toothbrush with pipe cleaners for arms stands front and center, belting out the familiar chorus in a tone comparable to a musically-inclined bumblebee. It might be the star of the show, but it has plenty of backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U66302"&gt;A line of receipt machines mimics the sound of synths, while another electric toothbrush undulates beneath a white sheet. A typewriter clicks away in the background, accompanied by the buzzing of a body trimmer, a nail polishing device, and an epilator (which is a hair removal tool, in case you didn’t know). And even though the iron doesn’t contribute much to the overall composition, it provides the visual effects, pumping out puffs of steam to achieve a spooky vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IsJtNn"&gt;This cover is probably more satisfying to listen to than the actual &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt; theme. Hearing how the sounds of each device come together is interesting, yet oddly soothing. The wobbling googly eyes are just an added plus.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Nikon Z9’s new sensor could be the start of a big shift in photography</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/na8o3ezZK2iyEyZun5OTW9ohOI0=/27x0:1143x744/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70067206/nikon_z9_01.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikon’s Z9 pro mirrorless camera has no mechanical shutter, relying solely on an electronic shutter.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nikon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Manxm0"&gt;Nikon recently &lt;a href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/about-nikon/press-room/press-release/kv76k47t/THE-NIKON-Z-9%3A-UNSTOPPABLE-PERFORMANCE,-REVOLUTIONARY-INNOVATION.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its new flagship camera, the &lt;a href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/mirrorless-cameras/z-9.html#tab-ProductDetail-ProductTabs-Overview"&gt;Z9&lt;/a&gt;. This camera represents Nikon’s first mirrorless camera fully geared towards professional photographers and hybrid shooters, with &lt;a href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/mirrorless-cameras/z-9.html#tab-ProductDetail-ProductTabs-TechSpecs"&gt;a huge spec list&lt;/a&gt; designed for use in the demanding fields of photojournalism, sports, nature, birding, and any other use-cases that call for a camera that shoots incredibly fast at high resolution. The $5,500 Z9 is also Nikon’s first camera to omit a traditional mechanical shutter, allowing it to achieve new levels of speed and autofocus performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBvwh0"&gt;Faster speed is great, especially for sports photographers. But it’s interesting to think about where this technology could be used to take traditional-style cameras in the future. This might be the first step towards larger format cameras adopting the computational smarts that smartphone cameras have been embracing for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/thwisCJp5SqofODjOa32pCG3Chk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968281/Z9_24_70_2.8_tilt_monitor_H.high.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nikon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z9 features a multi-angle 3.2-inch LCD that can tilt in both orientations but cannot face forward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vx7V7P"&gt;Nikon has made no mention of things like computational photography for HDR-style photos or the cyclical buffering that smartphones do to simultaneously capture up to nine or 10 frames and combine them with each press of the shutter button. But the new 45.7-megapixel full-frame backside-illuminated stacked CMOS sensor isn’t far off from what has been in phones for years, at least in terms of the core design. This kind of construction uses a sandwiched architecture of sensor, logic board, and dedicated RAM — yielding incredibly fast readout speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cir6RM"&gt;Today, that enables the Z9 to use a full-time electronic shutter with the fastest shutter speed of 1/32,000 of a second and achieve incredibly quick burst shooting. It can capture 20 frames per second in RAW / JPG at full resolution or as fast as 120fps at 11 megapixels, all without making any audible sounds (optional fake shutter sounds can be enabled for an audible cue). The new Expeed 7 processor and dual CFexpress / XQD card slots give the Z9 a claimed 1,000-shot buffer at full resolution in a high-efficiency compressed RAW, but it’s the fast readout speed of the stacked sensor that could be the key to the computational photography enigma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWqIkv"&gt;As the first of the major camera manufacturers to ditch the mechanical shutter, it puts Nikon ahead of its competitors in the race towards computational photography. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22545402/sony-alpha-1-a1-mirrorless-camera-review-specs-price-features-test"&gt;Sony’s A1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/3/20896423/sony-a9-ii-mirrorless-camera-announced-specs-price-release-date"&gt;A9&lt;/a&gt; lines have already utilized stacked sensors for fast readout speeds, making electronic shutters viable for full-time duty, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673196/canon-eos-r3-camera-price-specs-release-date-announced"&gt;Canon’s upcoming R3&lt;/a&gt; will use the same technology. Moving to a fully electronic shutter has been the logical next evolution for cameras, though the onus will be on Nikon to prove its electronic shutter is up to the everyday tasks and demands for pro photographers right now. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q4NcXAyRngRBKYOyngxx0nMBvwE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968303/nikonZ9_dualstream.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Nikon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z9’s stacked CMOS sensor is fast enough for blackout-free shooting while writing images to the card.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JBYRqT"&gt;To date, efforts from camera manufacturers to implement computational photography have been limited to features like Olympus’s &lt;a href="https://learnandsupport.getolympus.com/learn-center/photography-tips/settings/when-to-use-the-internal-live-nd-filter"&gt;Live ND&lt;/a&gt; and Panasonic’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.panasonic.com%2Fglobal%2Fconsumer%2Flumix%2Ftechnologies%2Fpost_focus.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fphotography%2F2021%2F10%2F30%2F22751514%2Fnikon-z9-sensor-tech-full-frame-mirrorless-computational-photography-announcement-future-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;post-focus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.panasonic.com%2Fuk%2Fconsumer%2Fcameras-camcorders%2Flumix-expert-advice-learn%2Flumix-expert-advice%2Fin-camera-focus-stacking.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fphotography%2F2021%2F10%2F30%2F22751514%2Fnikon-z9-sensor-tech-full-frame-mirrorless-computational-photography-announcement-future-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in-camera focus stacking&lt;/a&gt;. Handy features, yes, but these are sideshows compared to the paradigm shift that full computational photography implemented with every press of the shutter could one day be. OM System, the newly rebranded Olympus, &lt;a href="https://www.dpreview.com/news/7896781388/olympus-is-now-om-system-and-has-a-new-micro-four-thirds-camera-on-the-way"&gt;recently promised&lt;/a&gt; to utilize computational photography technology in its next camera, but we will have to see if that’s the main focus or just another feature on the side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YoVNJg"&gt;Deep Learning, which is used in the new Z9’s object detection autofocus system, has also been used to some capacity prior by Olympus, Panasonic, and Canon. It serves to improve autofocus tracking performance, but in the end, a mirrorless camera still captures a single image that is limited by the dynamic range of the sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DyqPOg"&gt;The primary barrier most likely preventing cameras like the Z9 and other pro- or enthusiast-level mirrorless cameras with stacked sensors going fully computational might lie in the data throughput and image processing pipeline. Ten frames captured simultaneously from a 45-megapixel full-frame sensor and combined into one file will be exponentially larger than the same collection of images taken from a smartphone sensor at a fraction of the size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3liTX"&gt;Additionally, cyclical buffering is necessary to be constantly writing and rewriting images to the camera’s buffer in the background before you press the shutter. Even the Z9’s new processor might not be up to these tasks. In the smartphone space, CPUs are designed to be well-suited for this processing, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/5/16973286/google-pixel-visual-core-pixel-2-app"&gt;even sometimes using dedicated hardware&lt;/a&gt;, but cameras are not built the same way. It’s possible more innovation at the CPU level is still needed from the camera manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QqgfBzQQ8SU110tst4xIs3qZ-ak=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968322/autofocus_expeed_7.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nikon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Processing power may be the last technological hurdle to computational photography in full-size cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fhP1zK"&gt;There are some obvious advantages to using computational photography. Most any modern smartphone can create a balanced exposure with subjects nicely lit, shadows full of visible detail, and clouds visible — all in the same frame. Advancements like Night Sight and Night Modes let you do things that are much harder to achieve with a standard camera, while Google continues to bring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;new computational tricks to keep subjects sharp when in motion&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple even allows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174433/apple-ios-14-3-pro-raw-iphone-12-pro-max-update-features"&gt;RAW files with computational data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4hc8H"&gt;On the other hand, a photo taken with even the most advanced mirrorless camera today —while superior in sharpness and resolution — results in some sacrifice to be made, such as blowing out the highlights or crushing the shadow details in high-contrast daytime scenes. Achieving the same look as most smartphones requires at least a bit of post-processing and editing, ideally from a RAW file that must be exported as a JPG or other universal format. Computational photography coming to dedicated camera systems could re-energize the camera market, though it might also take camera manufacturers finally figuring out connected Wi-Fi apps that are not terrible — admittedly, another tall order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6Lx5D"&gt;Cameras like the Z9 may be the bridge to that pathway, something that might be appreciated by even professional photographers who could spend less time editing to achieve the look many of their clients seek. It might just make full-size cameras a bit more exciting again, even if it may also further blur the lines of “what is a picture?”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook puts tighter restrictions on vaccine misinformation targeted at children</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zcva3F"&gt;Just as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22734765/fda-covid-vaccine-5-11-year-old-approve"&gt;the FDA officially approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for kids&lt;/a&gt; between the ages of five and 11, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;Meta, Facebook’s brand new identity&lt;/a&gt;, announced that it’s rolling out stricter policies for vaccine misinformation targeted at children (via &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation-kids-074628334.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150425/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-misinformation-ban"&gt;previously put restrictions on COVID-19 vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt; in late 2020, but didn’t have policies specific to kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FmqQSZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/supporting-covid-19-vaccine-children/"&gt;Meta says in a new blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it’s partnering with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to take down harmful content related to children and the COVID-19 vaccine. This includes any posts that imply the COVID-19 vaccine is unsafe, untested, or ineffective for children. Additionally, Meta will provide in-feed reminders in English and Spanish that the vaccine has been approved for kids, and will also provide information about where it’s available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Facebook vaccine notification" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7w3DW4ppX7VLid6dny7cE3AU6Ys=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22969112/facebook_vaccine_for_kids.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YzCE8W"&gt;Meta notes that it’s taken down a total of 20 million pieces of COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation from both Facebook and Instagram since the beginning of the pandemic. These numbers are at odds with what we’ve seen from the leaked internal documents from Facebook — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity"&gt;the Facebook Papers made it clear just how unprepared the platform was&lt;/a&gt; for misinformation related to the COVID-19 vaccine. If Facebook were more prepared, it might’ve rolled out campaigns to combat misinformation earlier in the pandemic, both for children and adults, possibly removing more false content as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Global climate talks in Glasgow aren’t very global</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cop26 - Glasgow protest" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mj9WIlaUI3V-54MITclDhpRsvL0=/0x63:3702x2531/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70067026/1236179798.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oBMn3J"&gt;One of the most anticipated rounds of international climate negotiations this decade will go down at a United Nations summit in Glasgow over the next couple weeks. But many representatives from the frontlines of the climate crisis won’t be there: people from islands that may be lost under rising seas, representatives of indigenous tribes, and activists who typically turn high-level negotiations into boisterous events with their demonstrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4SozB"&gt;The 26th annual United Nations Conference of Parties, or COP26, is the five-year anniversary of the Paris climate accords. Signatories, which included nearly every country on Earth, agreed to limit global warming to a level that might be manageable for humanity. Those nations are not close to meeting the goals to which they agreed. In a typical year, the summit also attracts thousands of people without badges to enter the conference grounds to push for certain policies. But this year, when Paris accord signatories have been asked to come with heightened ambitions, it will be harder for these activists to make themselves heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGL6yr"&gt;They won’t be coming mostly because of the pandemic, uneven vaccine rollout, and miles of red tape. Those who were able to get over those hurdles did so at enormous costs and anticipate more challenges on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YcG5qb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How will that affect a balanced and just outcome?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u06PLt"&gt;“How much can you actually reasonably negotiate when you’re exhausted, and when you feel something is unfair … And on top of that, you’re scared of getting COVID,” says Adrián Martinez, founder and director of the NGO La Ruta Del Clima based in Costa Rica. “How will that affect a balanced and just outcome?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TR18Qi"&gt;This year, many participants from vulnerable and developing nations want money to go to places that have already suffered permanent and irreparable damage because of climate change. Some populations in low-lying islands, like the &lt;a href="https://seors.unfccc.int/applications/seors/attachments/get_attachment?code=E08A4IBVOE450Z2EQXIPM1G3R3AO0OBM"&gt;Carteret Islands&lt;/a&gt; in Papua New Guinea, for instance, have already begun to abandon their homes. The battle to acknowledge loss and damage has ensued since Paris, and now advocates are continuing that fight with one arm tied behind their backs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EM7AXT"&gt;A third of small island nations and territories in the Pacific, which are considered among the most vulnerable to rising sea levels that eat up low-lying land, won’t be sending any government officials to negotiate on their behalf, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/21/third-of-pacific-islands-unable-to-attend-cop26-sparking-fears-summit-will-be-less-ambitious"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last week. Instead, the countries will tap people from their missions in Europe or the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ja0c2t"&gt;During the Paris negotiations, those nations &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theglobeandmail.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Fsmall-island-states-make-waves-at-paris-climate-conference%2Farticle27742043%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F30%2F22753391%2Fglasgow-climate-change-summit-cop-26-covid-restrictions" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fought to keep global warming at 1.5 degrees&lt;/a&gt;, rather than a less ambitious 2 degrees that other countries preferred. That half-degree difference means &lt;a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2865/a-degree-of-concern-why-global-temperatures-matter/"&gt;40,000 fewer people&lt;/a&gt; around the world will have their land gobbled up by rising seas by 2150. In Paris, the small island nations won a sort of half-victory. The language in the agreement ended up committing countries to hold global average temperatures “well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lES5hG"&gt;UK event organizers said that they would provide vaccines to delegates who needed them but didn’t begin offering first doses until about &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/09/07/climate-glasgow-delay/"&gt;two months before the summit&lt;/a&gt;, which kicks off October 31. That didn’t leave much time to receive two-dose vaccinations or make travel plans that comply with the UK’s COVID-related restrictions. The UK required visitors from “red-listed” countries to quarantine in a hotel for up to 10 days upon arrival, a huge extra cost for many people traveling to the conference — up to $3,600 per person, according to Martinez. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTxfTv"&gt;Last-minute changes — which were usually out of attendees’ control — saddled participants with higher bills. Martinez and his colleagues booked an Airbnb near the summit six months in advance. But weeks before the conference, the host doubled the price. They rushed to find somewhere else to stay and settled on lodging in Edinburgh — more than an hour’s drive from Glasgow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="oI1FW3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This will be the first time I’m going to set foot basically out of my house.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QLcagf"&gt;Even with travel plans set, attendees are anxious. “This will be the first time I’m going to set foot basically out of my house. COVID has ravaged our country very badly. I’ve had personal losses,” says Tasneem Essop, executive director of the international Climate Action Network, who lives in South Africa. “For me, it’s a bit traumatic, you know, the thought of actually going and traveling to Glasgow and being part of this big event. But I am going.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWKSBj"&gt;All these added stressors ultimately sap energy from advocacy and negotiations at the summit, which often go around the clock. “All this disruption has, for sure, reduced a lot of the delegations from the Global South,” Martinez says. That means fewer subject matter experts to tackle certain priorities, according to Martinez, and delegates might not be able to take breaks by tapping each other in and out of lengthy negotiations. That creates an uneven playing field, he says, because wealthier nations will likely have the resources to vaccinate and fund larger delegations — which he fears might give them more influence during the talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1hZgQ"&gt;The Climate Action Network and Greenpeace actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660795/activists-cop26-united-nations-climate-change-summit-glasgow"&gt;pushed&lt;/a&gt; COP26 organizers last month to delay the summit. But after having already postponed the negotiations for a year because of the pandemic, summit organizers did not budge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="unJtpA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The structural silencing of thousands of people”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PBjU3H"&gt;A coalition of environmental groups, called the COP26 Coalition, started a program this year to help potential attendees get their visas and fulfill requirements to participate in the summit. It had over 150 open cases. Of those, two-thirds of the people they sought to help ultimately decided not to attend. That’s probably just a small fraction of everyone who ended up falling through the cracks, according to Rachael Osgood, the lead immigration and international logistics coordinator for the coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYIr0o"&gt;“This is the structural silencing of thousands of people. And those thousands speak on behalf of the most affected areas around the world,” Osgood says. “They represent millions. And for all those on the frontline of this crisis, who have little to no representation, this is a death sentence.”&lt;/p&gt;
