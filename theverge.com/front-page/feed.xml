    <title>You can play the second demo for Resident Evil Village on May 1st, or earlier on PlayStation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SNP-bpbztMheYeU1Yj60Fw0Q2vg=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69133843/re_village_jan21_screens_creature_01_1611268587718.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yr8voq"&gt;During today’s Resident Evil Showcase, Capcom announced that a second demo for its upcoming survival horror game, &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village,&lt;/em&gt; will release on May 1st. That’s six days before the game’s official release date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8iFxg"&gt;Unlike the previous “Maiden” demo, this demo will be playable on all platforms the game will releases on, including PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X and S, Windows PC (via Steam), and Stadia. The demo will allow you to play for 60 minutes and explore both the village and castle areas, regardless of the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gI1rIi"&gt;PS4 and PS5 users will have the option to preload the demo beginning today via the PlayStation Store. Additionally, players on these two platforms will receive early access to the demo on two separate weekends — April 17th at 5PM ET through April 18th at 4AM ET, and and April 24th at 5PM ET through April 25th at 4AM ET. Each demo weekend will provide up to 30 minutes of gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMDOXs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; will launch May 7th on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X / S, and Stadia. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Fyre Festival settlement reveals the true cost of schadenfreude — $7,220 a pop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xmHOcSWZM7hNt9XE516mUIIycdg=/0x11:1184x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69133701/fyre_festival_poster.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Fyre Festival LLC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fTKLcI"&gt;The organizers of Fyre Festival — think: The Hunger Games, but for influencers — have agreed to a settlement with 277 attendees for $7,220 apiece, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/15/arts/music/fyre-festival-settlement.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYK4el"&gt;Tickets for the 2017 “luxury” music festival on a remote island in the Bahamas that actually turned out to be a beach full of FEMA &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WNFIV/status/857744138019753984"&gt;tents&lt;/a&gt; and some pathetic cheese sandwiches, cost anywhere from $1,000 to as much as $12,000 — more if you bought a package deal. Yes, really, because Fyre Festival organizers, while apparently not adept enough to coordinate hotel bookings and a caterer, did enlist big-name Instagram stars to sing the praises of the inaugural event, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/4/15547734/fyre-fest-kendall-jenner-instagram-sponsored-paid"&gt;Kendall Jenner, who received $250,000&lt;/a&gt; for a post she’s since deleted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pc6bFT"&gt;Organizers also (falsely) claimed that the island was once owned by notorious Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar. Weird flex, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WYadx2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mz5kY3RsmKo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rv0szz"&gt;Jenner did not attend the event, but she too, eventually paid for it, in the form of a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/kendall-jenner-pay-90-000-settlement-promoting-fyre-festival-n1212011"&gt;$90,000 settlement&lt;/a&gt; last year. Organizer &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/arts/music/fyre-festival-organizer-sentenced-fraud.html?smtyp=cur&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimes"&gt;Billy McFarland was sentenced to six years in prison&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 after pleading guilty to wire fraud charges. He was also &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/fyre-festival-attendees-win-5-million-lawsuit-695806/"&gt;ordered to pay $5 million&lt;/a&gt; to two people who paid $13,000 each for VIP packages (did the sandwiches come with extra cheese slices?). McFarland’s business partner, rapper Ja Rule, was &lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ja-rule-cleared-of-wrongdoing-in-major-fyre-fest-lawsuit-2576105"&gt;cleared of wrongdoing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QtYThj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;hunger games, but for influencers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K3oXrn"&gt;The festival that became a go-to example of schadenfreude and (yet another) cautionary tale about believing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/28/15471112/fyre-fest-instagram-hailey-baldwin-bella-hadid-sponsored-posts"&gt;sponcon on social media&lt;/a&gt; was eventually the source of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-or-hulu-which-fyre-festival-documentary-you-should-watch/"&gt;two documentaries, for Hulu and Netflix&lt;/a&gt;. And because time is a flat circle, the tweet of the “dinner” from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373477/fyre-fest-tweet-sandwich-auction-nft-medical-expenses"&gt;Fyre Fest is being offered for auction as an NFT,&lt;/a&gt; but at least the money there should go to a good cause: original tweeter Trevor DeHaas is having a kidney transplant and says he needs to raise $80,000 for medical expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OM6Yrd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The dinner that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fyrefestival?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@fyrefestival&lt;/a&gt; promised us was catered by Steven Starr is literally bread, cheese, and salad with dressing.  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fyrefestival?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#fyrefestival&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/I8d0UlSNbd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/I8d0UlSNbd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Trevor DeHaas (@trev4president) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trev4president/status/857776562615308288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 28, 2017&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pjH74g"&gt;The $2 million class-action settlement, reached in US Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York on Tuesday, is currently awaiting final approval, with a hearing scheduled for May 13th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXfBmt"&gt;The final amount attendees receive could eventually be reduced, depending what happens with other creditors in Fyre Festival’s bankruptcy case. But at least the ticket holders have already had some practice in getting less than they were promised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cBmAv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIOi29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Please keep Anish Kapoor away from the whitest white paint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A man with sunglasses on holding up a panel with a very bright white square painted on it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gdbKYAQ4QhRaFyQ_CgWHDZHAih0=/0x0:800x533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69133636/ruan_xiulin_portraitLO.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xiulin Ruan, one of the researchers who made the whitest white paint, holding up a sample. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jared Pike / Purdue University&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RbkCOr"&gt;Researchers at Purdue University say they have created the whitest paint on record. In fact, they’ve now crafted an ultra-white paint twice: in October, &lt;a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2020/Q4/this-white-paint-could-reduce-the-need-for-air-conditioning-by-keeping-surfaces-cooler-than-surroundings.html"&gt;they announced&lt;/a&gt; a white paint that was capable of reflecting 95.5 percent of sunlight. But they decided to outdo themselves with a new formulation, &lt;a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2021/Q2/the-whitest-paint-is-here-and-its-the-coolest.-literally..html"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;, that reflects up to 98.1 percent of sunlight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QX2ttC"&gt;The thing about a very white paint is that, along with reflecting light, it also rejects heat. As any goth who has spent the day on the beach knows, black absorbs light and will heat up. The hope with an ultra-white paint is that it could be used on buildings to keep them cooler without air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="td5Lfs"&gt;The science of the paint comes down to a high concentration of barium sulfate, a compound that’s already used in paints and photographic paper. The barium sulfate particles are different sizes, allowing the paint to scatter a broader range of light than if they were all the same size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vjZTGS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I have concerns&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9OndOh"&gt;This all sounds very cool, but I have concerns. And that’s because one of the most &lt;a href="https://www.archpaper.com/2017/07/anish-kapoor-blackest-black/"&gt;well-known dramas&lt;/a&gt; in the art world has to do with the blackest black: Vantablack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1gSSI"&gt;Vantablack is a material made with nanotubes that is able to absorb up to 99.99 percent of visible light. The most accessible form of it, a sprayable paint called Vantablack S-VIS, is exclusively licensed to the studio of Anish Kapoor so that he can monopolize the ability to make such groundbreaking artworks as... &lt;a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/man-injured-falling-into-anish-kapoor-hole-1335176"&gt;a big black hole in the floor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVF7YZ"&gt;Kapoor’s hogging of Vantablack incensed other artists so much that another artist, Stuart Semple, created “the world’s pinkest pink” pigment. (It’s unclear if it actually is the pinkest pink, but I guess scientists are still busy with black and white.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLHirM"&gt;The pink is available for anyone to buy, except for Anish Kapoor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Cw6Jlg"&gt;By adding this product to your cart you confirm that you are not Anish Kapoor, you are in no way affiliated to Anish Kapoor, you are not purchasing this item on behalf of Anish Kapoor or an associate of Anish Kapoor. To the best of your knowledge, information and belief this paint will not make its way into the hands of Anish Kapoor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fLcu5n"&gt;The beef did not stop there, however, because Kapoor got his hands on the pinkest pink and posted to Instagram an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BOWz73wgj7R/"&gt;extremely classy photo&lt;/a&gt; of his middle finger coated in it, with the caption, “Up yours.” Great guy, love the attitude. Semple then went on to create &lt;a href="https://www.format.com/magazine/features/art/anish-kapoor-stuart-semple-vantablack-blackest-black"&gt;his own ultra-black pigments and paints&lt;/a&gt;, which are available to everyone except, you guessed it, Kapoor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jLB6o"&gt;So please, researchers who are bringing us ultra-white paint, do not let Anish Kapoor get anywhere near it. Ideally, anything that could be used to improve people’s lives while reducing the energy they use should be free and widely available. And my fragile psyche just can’t handle more paint-based art battles. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon tried to coerce Ecobee into collecting private user data, the WSJ reports  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pGT8ott5M-oppfKpZ1FPgu8xQkg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69133546/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HSPwvU"&gt;Amazon tried to use its power to coerce Ecobee into using its smart home products to collect user data by threatening Ecobee’s ability to sell its products on Amazon, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-strong-arms-partners-across-multiple-businesses-11618410439"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NOke6e"&gt;As of now, Ecobee’s products can still be purchased on Amazon, but the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;claims that negotiations between Ecobee and Amazon are ongoing. According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ,&lt;/em&gt; the online retail giant asked Ecobee to share data from its Alexa-enabled smart thermostats, even when the customer wasn’t actively using the voice assistant. Ecobee reportedly refused to have its devices constantly report back to Amazon about the state of the user’s home, including data on which doors were locked or unlocked and the set temperature. The reasoning being that enabling its devices to report this data to Amazon would be a violation of its customer’s trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r71g2U"&gt;Ecobee may have also been concerned that Amazon wanted the data to build competing products. The retail giant has a reputation for taking non-public sales data and using it to develop products — something that’s come up in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21349440/amazon-marketplace-third-party-sellers-antitrust-hearing-jeff-bezos"&gt;antitrust investigations in the US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;and EU&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon has also been accused of using this sales data to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311574/peak-design-video-amazon-copy-everyday-sling-bag"&gt;directly copy and compete with&lt;/a&gt; other companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233121/amazon-employees-seller-data-private-label-products"&gt;using its Amazon Basics brand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0v54t"&gt;It’s not hard to look at the web of products and services it offers and see the potential abuses: the same&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-strong-arms-partners-across-multiple-businesses-11618410439"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; also outlines how Amazon uses its position in web hosting services and TV streaming boxes (sold under the Fire TV brand) to negotiate with content providers like HBO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idTruy"&gt;The full report is well worth a read if you want an idea of all the different markets Amazon operates in that it can use to get its way when dealing with other companies. For an in-depth look into Amazon’s specific dealings with its Marketplace system, we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21349440/amazon-marketplace-third-party-sellers-antitrust-hearing-jeff-bezos"&gt;have an explainer&lt;/a&gt;, and we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233121/amazon-employees-seller-data-private-label-products"&gt;have also covered&lt;/a&gt; the news &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;as it happened&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195719/amazon-antitrust-wsj-investigation-competition-marketplace-sellers"&gt;as reports like this pile up&lt;/a&gt;, regulators may have no choice but to step in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ts0af9"&gt;Amazon declined to comment, stating that it doesn’t talk about agreements with partners.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to turn off autoplay videos on Facebook, Twitter, Firefox, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_WcNM6N2MSX0rUaCurpm8upBUJc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67357666/akrales_180614_1777_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8lG2AH"&gt;You’ve probably been caught off guard by videos that play automatically on Facebook, Twitter, or just across the internet in general. They begin playing as soon as you load a page or (if they’re more deviously implemented) when you start scrolling through a page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEO2XA"&gt;Automatic video play is a feature that, while nice to have when it’s surfacing content that’s related to your interests, can be pretty annoying. Autoplay videos can be harmful, too, exposing you to violent, offensive, or otherwise unwanted content that you shouldn’t have to see by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2y0j3a"&gt;Whether you just want to put an end to autoplay videos on social media platforms or are looking for a more comprehensive fix, we’ve got some tips. Keep in mind that you’ll need to adjust these settings for every device that you use, since your preferences on, say, your phone do not automatically push to your PC. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dz1chzzX-NIN7haE3ax0cMWBuyc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10595581/jbareham_180405_1777_facebook_0003.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o58gm4"&gt;Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gIrA8R"&gt;If you’re using Facebook on your browser, you can turn off autoplay videos this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tpH6zh"&gt;Go to the drop-down menu at the top right of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rR3w9L"&gt;Select “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy” &amp;gt; “Settings.”  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ODd3mQ"&gt;Look for the “Videos” listing on the left-hand menu. Inside of that option is a toggle where you can turn off autoplaying videos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="J84Eng"&gt;Facebook has similar options available for its iOS and Android apps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ULMfxN"&gt;Using the iOS app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="R977sA"&gt;Click the menu button on the bottom of your screen. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xSoMTh"&gt;Once you’re there, tap “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy,” then “Settings.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7Af4MO"&gt;Scroll down until you find “Media and Contacts,” then tap “Videos and Photos.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iwxDqT"&gt;Finally, once you find “Autoplay,” you can turn off the feature. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vgY1Dg"&gt;Using the Android app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oEGb9P"&gt;Click the menu button at the top right of your screen. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JcW48A"&gt;Once you’re there, scroll down and tap “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy,” then “Settings.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eIhn7b"&gt;Scroll down until you find “Media and Contacts” and tap on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7o3J7l"&gt;Tap on “Autoplay” and set it to “Never Autoplay Videos.”&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xH0GDk"&gt;Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="TC0CDS"&gt;Click on “More” in the left-hand menu, and then on “Settings and privacy.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MF20gk"&gt;Select “Accessibility, display, and languages” &amp;gt; “Data usage”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Dq3GjI"&gt;Click on the “Autoplay” setting. You can then switch off the autoplaying of videos on your feed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="C2u16D"&gt;Using the iOS and Android apps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RrUSNS"&gt;Click the profile picture at the top of your phone screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3UQZtK"&gt;Select “Settings and privacy” in the menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="11NK0Y"&gt;Navigate to “Data usage,” tap on “Video autoplay” and set it to “Never.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7OQSxm"&gt;Instagram&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dUNrI4"&gt;Instagram doesn’t allow for autoplay videos to be turned off, so you’ll have to tread carefully here. Videos won’t autoplay with sound if you use Instagram on your browser. Stopping autoplay on mobile devices is possible, but a little roundabout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lt8HsS"&gt;Using a mobile app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="XPW4FK"&gt;Go to your profile page and tap on the three lines in the upper right corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bNwWy7"&gt;Go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Account” &amp;gt; “Cellular Data Use” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MVxu9x"&gt;For Android: toggle the “Data Saver” on and tap on “High Resolution Media.” If you then select “Never,” then media such as videos won’t load in advance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vWdWJR"&gt;For iOS: toggle on “Use Less Data”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;h2 id="tXOQ6e"&gt;Reddit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SzwWxv"&gt;Reddit, like most sites that host video, autoplays videos by default. However, it’s pretty easy to turn it off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Eu0DWx"&gt;Using the newest design &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ay5Rtq"&gt;Click your username in the upper-right corner and select “User settings” in the menu. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cvJBQ6"&gt;Select the “Feed settings” tab at the top of the page, and toggle off the “Autoplay media” switch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5RlMWj"&gt;Using the legacy version&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JwvewK"&gt;Click “Preferences” next to your username in the top right of the window. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OcS1gc"&gt;Under “Media,” look for and uncheck “Autoplay Reddit videos on the desktop comments page.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="94bprV"&gt;You’ll need to hit “save options” at the bottom of the screen to put the changes through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5u20jl"&gt;Using the mobile app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rGcnzL"&gt;Tap the icon next to the search bar, then hit “Settings.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bpIbQJ"&gt;You’ll see “Autoplay” near the top of the page, and you can easily choose to turn it off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s-Ld0kwKOnVtWjNYMvxZaIG1k6U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15959696/akrales_190313_3291_0015.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h2 id="s2hC3K"&gt;Desktop browsers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2ulnnQ"&gt;There are a variety of desktop browsers out there — some of which let you turn off video autoplay and some of which don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fd8uUw"&gt;Using Google Chrome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="jUC60J"&gt;If you use Google Chrome and want to turn off video autoplay — you can’t. There used to be an experimental command-line flag that allowed you to turn them off (you can find the flags by typing &lt;em&gt;chrome://flags/ &lt;/em&gt;into Chrome’s address field), but it’s disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nduwAi"&gt;You can turn the sound off (which might help a bit):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2pi4WV"&gt;Tap on the three dots in the upper right corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PoqtKL"&gt;Select “Settings” &amp;gt; “Site settings” &amp;gt; “Sound”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O2qcvH"&gt;Toggle sound off. You can add exceptions for specific sites here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w8Y2Gv"&gt;Using Microsoft Edge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="0DLaQY"&gt;Interestingly, Microsoft’s Edge browser, which is also based on the Chromium open-source design, does let you turn off — well, at least, limit — video autoplay:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LsUVdG"&gt;Click on the three dots in the upper right corner and select “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qm9766"&gt;In the left-hand column, click on “Site Permissions,” and then scroll down to and select “Media autoplay.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="MZkweK"&gt;You can either allow audio and video to play automatically or limit it. According to the instructions, whether autoplay will work or not will depend on “how you’ve visited the page and whether you interacted with media in the past.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ORXOug"&gt;Using Firefox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ollGg5"&gt;Firefox has a similar feature that lets you turn off autoplay, for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hH6zPX"&gt;Click on the three lines in the upper right corner of the browser and select “Preferences.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ScAS4n"&gt;In the left-hand column, click on “Privacy &amp;amp; Security.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VpdtZu"&gt;Scroll down to the section headed “Permissions” and look for “Autoplay.” Click on the button marked “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="UWaPPt"&gt;A drop-down menu will let you allow audio and video, block audio, or block audio and video. You can also specify sites that you want to differ from your defaults — for example, if you block audio and video as a default, but you want to allow it for, say, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6PVRmy"&gt;Using Safari&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7V7uVV"&gt;Safari makes it simple to disable autoplay. In fact, it assumes that you want the feature disabled to begin with. However, if it hasn’t been disabled — or if you want to make some exceptions to the rule — here’s what you do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="d4voTR"&gt;While in the app, go to Safari &amp;gt; Preferences in the top menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WgE7hB"&gt;Click on “Websites” in the top menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lvET2R"&gt;Look for and select “Auto-Play” in the side menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sCiOqH"&gt;Look for the drop-down menu at the bottom right of the window and select “Never Auto-Play.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="y1GAVn"&gt;As with Firefox, you can whitelist any sites that you want to be an exception to the rule.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reuters finally decides to charge you for its online news stories with a paywall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a Reuters logo seen displayed on..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gb7sYeEeJOyQHCqDoL2ukllD-W0=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69133132/1157654467.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GQKNI8"&gt;As online publishers grapple with how to replace dwindling ad revenue and find new ways to bring in money, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, one of the largest news organizations in the world, is using a strategy that’s been around for years and putting its online content behind a paywall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBNpzP"&gt;Reuters.com draws 41 million unique visitors monthly, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/reuters-website-goes-behind-paywall-new-strategy-2021-04-15/"&gt;according to the company&lt;/a&gt;, but it has not charged for access like other news sites in its business-centric niche have done for some time. It will let users read five stories a month for free and plans to charge $34.99 a month for a subscription. That’s a bit pricier than a sub to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; ($18.42 / month) but closer to similar news organizations of its type, including &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; ($38.99 / month), which put its paywall up in 1996, and Bloomberg.com ($34.99 / month), which added a paywall in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Xwz5z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; said it generates half of its revenue from its largest client, the financial data firm Refinitiv, and also makes money from online advertising. The company says it has redesigned its website with a “professional audience” in mind and plans investment in segments like legal news and live streams of its events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuIC5A"&gt;How online news is paid for has been the topic of discussion among publishers for years; online advertising doesn’t bring in the level of revenue that print ads used to for newspapers, and publishers often have to rely on platforms like Facebook and Google to push their content to readers. Google has battled with lawmakers in Australia who want the search giant to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/19/21227263/australia-facebook-google-ad-revenue-media-coronavirus-economy"&gt;pay publishers for their content&lt;/a&gt;. And amid renewed scrutiny of social media platforms and how they siphon ad revenue from news publishers, a bill &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/bill-aid-us-publishers-google-facebook-rises-76605745"&gt;introduced last month in Congress&lt;/a&gt; aims to give more leverage to publishers when negotiating with platforms for a share of ad revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5nggI"&gt;While both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285656/facebook-news-tab-section-launch-us-local-publishers-partnership"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276544/google-news-showcase-uk-argentina-launch-license-paywall-content"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have initiatives that pay some publishers to license their content, for many news outlets online subscriptions are a major part of their revenue streams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWXdkd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arcade Fire released an epic 45-minute single — in Headspace’s meditation app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2018 Life Is Beautiful Festival - Day 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UT8NRn0mD5SlQLaPw6TWaoPBMAc=/0x39:3000x2039/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69132982/1039320710.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pdwbRQ"&gt;Arcade Fire has a new single out — sort of. The Canadian indie rock band has released a new 45-minute instrumental composition called “Memories In The Age Of Anxiety,” but the new song is actually a collaboration with meditation app Headspace, and you can only listen to it there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QCudSP"&gt;The new track was created in collaboration with John Legend and, as &lt;a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2144197/arcade-fire-release-new-45-minute-song-for-meditation-app/music/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stereogum&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the first new pieces of music from the group since its cover of “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpYOstfcQBs"&gt;Baby Mine&lt;/a&gt;” in the 2019 live-action version of &lt;em&gt;Dumbo.&lt;/em&gt; (It’s the band’s first original song since its 2017 studio album &lt;em&gt;Everything Now.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="UHZXZx"&gt;Unfortunately for frugal Arcade Fire fans, it’s &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;locked behind a paywall in Headspace as part of the app’s Headspace Plus subscription, which costs $12.99 per month or $69.99 per year. You can listen to a snippet in the group’s Instagram post announcing the collaboration, which gives a mere glimpse of the soaring synthesizers and pulsing beats that Arcade Fire&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is known for. But if you want to hear the whole thing, you’ll have to pay up. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Spring Loaded event: rumors, news, and announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RQfy_HJ-uLurWi5D4Bl4HGm8yKI=/34x0:1759x1150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69132951/Screen_Shot_2021_04_15_at_8.22.24_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The event kicks off at 1PM ET / 10AM PT on April 20th&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="imUhUH"&gt;Spring has sprung and with it, the first Apple event of the year. The company successfully brought &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21552864/apple-event-macbook-arm-air-announcements-news-rumors-one-more-thing"&gt;custom Arm chips to its Macs&lt;/a&gt; last year, and now it’s continuing its product updates with an event called “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22310826/apple-april-20th-event-date-rumors-ipad-pro-macbook-tv-airtags"&gt;Spring Loaded&lt;/a&gt;.” Outside the obvious coiled metal connotation, the name suggests another jam-packed day of announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2PTIT"&gt;And Apple does have a lot of products to address. The Apple TV was last updated in 2017 but is rumored to get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22369056/apple-tv-2021-120hz-refresh-rate-support-4k-gaming-arcade"&gt;support for 120Hz displays&lt;/a&gt;, a new processor that could make it a more capable Apple Arcade machine, and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-12-22/apple-tv-is-missing-the-moment?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;a redesigned remote&lt;/a&gt;. The iPad mini is also expected to finally receive some love after sitting idle since 2019. Reports point to a larger display and updated internals for the small tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I22HdR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336917/apple-new-ipad-pros-mini-base-april"&gt;New iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt; will reportedly get a speed boost with a new chip similar to Apple’s M1, a Thunderbolt port for faster transfers and compatibility with more devices, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21279247/apple-ipad-pro-2021-5g-qualcomm-mini-led-a14x"&gt;support for 5G&lt;/a&gt;. The larger 12.9-inch Pro may also be the first Apple device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452182/ipad-pro-mini-led-display-oled-contrast-burn-in-screen-technology"&gt;to feature a Mini LED display&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379337/new-ipad-pro-mini-led-production-issues-date-report"&gt;a display and component shortage&lt;/a&gt; could limit how many tablets Apple is able to produce and sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvkD5I"&gt;There’s plenty of other hanging threads, too: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427380/apple-airtags-tile-competitor-production"&gt;the long-rumored AirTags&lt;/a&gt; could show up, Apple may have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375738/apple-podcast-the-line-us-navy-spotify-original-shows"&gt;new podcast strategy&lt;/a&gt;, the Apple Pencil could get a redesign, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534123/apple-airpods-3-pro-2-2021-chip-design-battery-life-true-wireless-earbuds-headphones-homepod"&gt;new AirPods&lt;/a&gt; could make an appearance, the MacBook Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;might finally get its ports back&lt;/a&gt;, and there are always plenty of opportunities for surprises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlCEZQ"&gt;We’ll be watching live and keeping you updated here with everything Apple announces.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s own ads reveal: not many people are using Facebook Dating</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VddfSOh6JtkgsncqAa_gpW7USUM=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69132440/VRG_ILLO_4530_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It says 278,000 singles are on it in New York City&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="4CenqX"&gt;Dawn Hallson has tried nearly every dating app you can think of — Tinder, Bumble, eHarmony, Plenty of Fish, and Match, just to name a few. So when a friend told her about Facebook Dating, she figured, why not give it a shot? She filled out her height, whether she has kids, where she lives, and her sexual orientation, and then looked around at who might be available on the world’s largest social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYmjwn"&gt;“It was exactly the same as all the other apps,” she says. “You match with someone. They don’t contact you. If they do contact you, they just pass the time of day with you — never much with anyone that’s attractive unless they actually want just sex, basically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PURwC4"&gt;She only met up with one person from Facebook Dating, which fizzled out when he tried to hook up on the first date. After that, she quit. She lasted about six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ou4Wpg"&gt;Facebook first introduced its dating product as a test in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17871690/facebook-dating-release-colombia-test"&gt;Colombia in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and brought it Stateside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20850307/facebook-dating-united-states-launch"&gt;in September 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, the company hasn’t said much. The last time dating was talked about at length on an earnings call was right after it launched. In that call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he thought it was “already one of the top dating services, and we expect to continue growing.” In a release &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/10/facebook-dating-expands-to-europe/"&gt;announcing&lt;/a&gt; its international expansion to Europe this past October, the company said it had made over 1.5 billion matches up until that point. Tinder, meanwhile, advertises “over 55 billion matches made” &lt;a href="https://tinder.com/"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUTjv7"&gt;But a year and a half after launch, Facebook Dating is far from a hit. The company hasn’t shared overall usage numbers, and data found by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; suggests the app is smaller than competing options. The company only shares data when it wants to, and because the service lives within the broader Facebook app, there’s no way to measure download numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oM8Gfq"&gt;However, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has found multiple screenshots that suggest the actual size of Facebook’s dating product isn’t all that large but that it’s growing. The company runs in-house ads that advertise the number of users it has in specific regions. In the country’s largest city, New York, for example, the company advertised 278,000 singles “currently dating” in the city this week. In Indianapolis &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/peachlancia/status/1371617543719415810?s=20"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, it advertised 43,000 people, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sardonyc_AP/status/1379535126917492739?s=20"&gt;in Ottawa, Canada&lt;/a&gt;, earlier this month, it claimed to have 24,000. Users in smaller cities also see hyper-localized data. In Bellingham, Washington, Facebook &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/abknickel/status/1382495553318096896?s=20"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it has 2,000 single people using it. Days after its launch in Ireland, Facebook &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KateOLoughlinx/status/1321071303865126912?s=20"&gt;advertised&lt;/a&gt; having 1,000 people on the service in Dublin. The numbers appear to be dynamic and adjusting, too. Just last week, the same in-house ad in New York City advertised around 2,000 fewer people, and a month ago, it showed 9,000 fewer, suggesting these in-feed ads are successfully signing up new users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Who needs Facebook dating when you get told "God called upon me to tell me that he wants me to take you as my wife" from random LDS &amp;amp; Polygamists about 2x a month in the grocery store?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook is becoming more irrelevant everyday lmfao &lt;a href="https://t.co/dhTC07BAck"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dhTC07BAck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— denali (@degandhi_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/degandhi_/status/1372912186947817482?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xFCbi4"&gt;Census data estimates &lt;a href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/16000US3651000-new-york-ny/"&gt;from 2019&lt;/a&gt; suggest that nearly 4 million unmarried people call New York City home, meaning Facebook Dating has about 7 percent of the city’s singles on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTBhdM"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Match Group spokesperson said, “We have a number of brands with more active users than that in NYC, including Tinder and Hinge.” They wouldn’t elaborate on numbers. In its latest earnings, however, Match Group &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/279430125/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/MTCH-4Q-2020-Earnings-Release.pdf"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that the average number of &lt;em&gt;paying &lt;/em&gt;subscribers across its apps last quarter reached 10.9 million split about equally between North America and the rest of the world — let alone the number of people using its apps for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOr9RH"&gt;This advertised Facebook data poses a variety of questions, though. For one, are these users active, or just the total number who have signed up? For places like New York City, does the number only count people who live in the five boroughs, or does it include neighboring places like Westchester County, New York, and Jersey City, New Jersey? And how wide are the demographics of these users? If all users tend to be in one age group, another age group likely won’t have a good experience using it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUMb2w"&gt;In response to these questions, a Facebook spokesperson sent a statement over email saying that the platform is designed to help people find “meaningful relationships” and that they’re “excited about how it’s performing and the feedback we’ve been getting from people who have found love through the platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WQ6y37"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;i couldn’t think of anything worse than facebook dating &lt;a href="https://t.co/HuBjipPeHg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HuBjipPeHg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— liv •        (@liv_liv_liv__) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/liv_liv_liv__/status/1371176145341853707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S7PcI8"&gt;So if Facebook’s dating feature isn’t massive, why keep it around? Zuckerberg suggested during its January 2020 earnings call that Facebook Dating could eventually become a driving force for why people return to the app and engage with it. In the year and a half since its rollout in the States, Facebook Dating has now made its way to other parts of the world, including, most recently, to 32 European countries in addition to the 20 it’s already in. The company also appears to have a deeper interest in augmenting the dating experience. Just this week, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;reported on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381511/facebook-video-speed-dating-npe-team-sparked-feature"&gt;an experimental Facebook app called Sparked&lt;/a&gt;, which sets users up on four-minute video speed dates. If Facebook Dating itself isn’t the eventual successful product, maybe there will be other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSV0AY"&gt;Analysts like Daniel Salmon at BMO Capital Markets are mostly concerned with Facebook revenue, though. Because the company hasn’t built advertising into Dating or started charging for add-on functionality, the feature isn’t at a point where Salmon sees it as a meaningful part of the business. That could easily change, however, depending on how many people start forking over their data in order to meet the love of their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tS7o9H"&gt;“Any data that Facebook is getting on their audience enriches their profiles for ad targeting anywhere across their portfolios,” he says. “Any engagement is good engagement because any engagement creates data, and that can be used to improve the ad platform, even if you don’t have ads sitting there in front of people who are looking for dates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BFjdV5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Idk why but I get infuriated every time Facebook Dating tries to recruit me. Let me be lonely on my own! &lt;a href="https://t.co/3AF0yiEejg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3AF0yiEejg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NoHo Hank (@ColorblindCrocs) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ColorblindCrocs/status/1331385636885041152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 24, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pkQS5c"&gt;Although Facebook doesn’t, so far, ask specific prying questions a la OkCupid and other dating apps, it still asks for some information. It wants to know people’s heights, whether they have children, who they’re looking to date, and where they live. The app also asks for photos that can be uploaded to the profile. Plus, conversations can be pushed &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/facebook-to-launch-virtual-dating-over-messenger/"&gt;over to Messenger&lt;/a&gt;, giving Facebook &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/04/app-privacy-labels-messaging-apps/"&gt;way more data&lt;/a&gt;, including the images that are sent there, the precise location of the sender, their contacts, and their browsing history. (The company’s initial rollout to Europe was even stalled because Ireland’s Data Protection Commission “&lt;a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/dpc-statement-facebook-dating-feature"&gt;conducted an inspection&lt;/a&gt;” at Facebook’s Dublin offices and “gathered documentation” to learn more about the company’s intended data practices.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WaMcbs"&gt;Dating gives people who let their data become stagnant and might have stopped uploading photos to the app a reason to update, and Facebook gains better insight into how to target ads, which is the ultimate goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYmMI2"&gt;The company might never be forthcoming about how its dating efforts are going, but its ambitions are relatively clear. So long as it can get people to keep coming back to Facebook, whether it’s to see friends or find love, a product pays off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="PH88vA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This story initially said Daniel Salmon worked at BMO Group. The name is actually BMO Capital Markets. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Feels is a new dating app trying to ditch swiping for Stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gv7XSJ9qhB0QFGb2S21BJdWC5DY=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69132072/ezgif.com_gif_maker__10_.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You scroll through people’s profiles, similar to a TikTok feed.&lt;/em&gt; | Video: Feels&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ALfRpo"&gt;There’s a new dating app on the scene called &lt;a href="https://www.feels-app.com/"&gt;Feels&lt;/a&gt;. Its unique selling point is an interface that feels closer to a Snapchat-style story or a TikTok feed rather than the swipeable cards found in other dating apps. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/feels-is-a-new-dating-app-with-profiles-that-look-more-personal/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; Feels currently has around 100,000 users. Although the app is available globally, the company says its focus is primarily on the French market as it launches more widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKi7zV"&gt;Feels is styling itself as an “anti-dating app,” but to be clear, &lt;em&gt;this is very much still a dating app&lt;/em&gt;. You’re still reacting to profiles and having conversations, which, I’m sure, for a lot of people, will end up with them going on dates. At the same time, though, Feels’ interface, ahem, &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; different enough from the competition to make it interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qJxIct4CLj2c5Zw3a974RuhldKQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22446531/IMG_0607.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Feels&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can add captions and location tags to your photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rc1lb3"&gt;Profiles are made up of a combination of pictures, videos, and answers to prewritten questions (similar to Hinge), but each element fills up your whole screen, and you browse through a profile by tapping on the left or right sides of the screen. Like I said, it’s very Snapchat Stories. They’re the same elements that rival dating apps have used before but wrapped up in a more modern interface. It’s promising, if a little lacking in customization options beyond adding captions and locations to your photos and videos (though the company tells me stickers are being added in the near future).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPzblU"&gt;Feels is also making a big deal out of not relying on the same swiping gestures as other dating apps (a change we think is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21004916/tinder-bumble-okcupid-swipe-decade-online-dating-match-change"&gt;long overdue&lt;/a&gt;), but the distinction is a bit academic. You’re ultimately still swiping through profiles; the animation is just a little different. And you also can’t swipe back to a previous profile without paying for a premium subscription, which also adds other features like a profile visibility boost. As of this writing, this costs a somewhat expensive $9.49 / €9.99 / £8.49 a week (though there are discounts for paying monthly). &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;notes the company is still iterating on its premium plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6Z1ty"&gt;But a dating app is only as good as the people on it, and within a few minutes, I’d swiped (ahem, I’m sorry, &lt;em&gt;scrolled&lt;/em&gt;) through the mere dozen or so accounts of users registered in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OY1Nx"&gt;It’s early days for Feels, and it’s launching into a very crowded market. Established competitors like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge have added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324221/tinder-bumble-video-virtual-dating-calls-feature-whyd-you-push-that-button-podcast"&gt;pandemic-focused dating features&lt;/a&gt; to help singles date with social distancing and lockdowns, while Facebook has recently shown a renewed interest in the area with tests of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381511/facebook-video-speed-dating-npe-team-sparked-feature"&gt;new speed dating app called Sparked&lt;/a&gt;. But with more users and profile customization options, Feels could be an interesting new dating app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pXNYU"&gt;Feels is currently &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/feels-too-cool-to-match/id1455618069"&gt;live on iOS&lt;/a&gt;, and the company tells me it’s working to bring its Android app back to the Google Play Store after being kicked off yesterday. (Feels CEO Daniel Cheaib tells me the team has yet to discover why its listing was removed.) &lt;/p&gt;
