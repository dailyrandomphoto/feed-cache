    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Top Shot is playing the long game in the NFT craze&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="gEibEi"&gt;On February 22nd, Jesse Schwarz set an official NBA Top Shot record by buying the most expensive Moment on the platform. The 31-year-old paid $208,000 for a massive LeBron James dunk, in which he leaps &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt; the Sacramento Kings’ Nemanja Bjelica to authoritatively slam the ball through the hoop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuuE8k"&gt;Now, you can go onto YouTube and watch a clip of this dunk. A clip of the Moment is even included in the celebratory NBA Top Shot tweet announcing Schwarz’s acquisition. But you won’t &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXfLWJ"&gt;Top Shot is part of the world of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, the buzzy new use of blockchain tech that lets people buy and sell digital items by permanently inscribing ownership records. At a high level, you might consider &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/#Blockchain-based_non-fungible_tokens"&gt;a domain name or an event ticket a non-fungible asset&lt;/a&gt; since they’re goods that can’t be exchanged for something identical — and they can’t be divided into parts. This is in contrast to bitcoin, where any bitcoin is the same as another, and it’s even possible to own a fraction of a bitcoin if you so choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="vCAYO4"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yLP7MG"&gt;Top Shot is the best chance so far that NFTs — which are mostly the domain of cryptocurrency enthusiasts — could go mainstream. More than 800,000 Top Shot accounts are registered, leading to $500 million in sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDIYdS"&gt;There are three big things going for Top Shot: it’s easy to use (and designed with people who are unfamiliar with cryptocurrency in mind), the NBA is the second-most-popular sport in America, and purchasable Moments have a familiar real-life parallel: trading cards. Each Moment, a video clip of a specific play, comes with stats about the game it’s from and the player featured, as well as the history of sale prices. And like trading cards, you can buy them in packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rlw4Go"&gt;The investing community has taken notice. Today, the company that runs Top Shot, Dapper Labs, announced it had a new funding round of $305 million, led by Coatue. Other investors include NBA players such as Kevin Durant, JaVale McGee, and Klay Thompson, as well as a smattering of MLB players, NFL players, Ashton Kutcher, and Shawn Mendes. This round means that the company has raised more than $357 million, Dapper Labs says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exc6Lq"&gt;Andre Iguodala, of the Miami Heat, was in the NBA bubble last year when he met with Roham Gharegozlou, the 34-year-old CEO of Dapper Labs. Iguodala had a general understanding of blockchain and cryptocurrencies at the time, but NFTs were new to him. Gharegozlou brought him up to speed. “From there, it was like, the rest is history,” says Iguodala. He loved the idea of bringing the NBA to his cap table and made his first investment last August. “The site is crazy great so far. I’m looking forward to sustainability, you know, keeping this thing going for the long haul and having some fun at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKWRH2"&gt;He chose to reinvest in this round based on Top Shot’s growth since then. “This was something that’s just been having some great reception, a lot of interest,” Iguodala tells me. He has his own account, where he’s been buying packs. “I bought my own Moment just because I felt like I had to have my own freaking Moment,” he says. It’s a dunk from August 4th, 2020, &lt;a href="https://nbatopshot.com/moment/Andre3rings+c882d3b8-5668-4d3c-a9f6-4e0cff7b2240"&gt;number 490 of 1,000&lt;/a&gt;. “So I’d probably call that out my favorite moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCGqhI"&gt;The first time anyone could purchase a Moment from a pack in NBA Top Shot was June 15th, 2020, as part of a closed beta; the open beta started on October 1st, 2020. Obviously, the pandemic wasn’t on the launch plan, but it appears to have given the platform a boost. Top Shot has had another tailwind: &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/02/why-are-sports-cards-so-hot-right-now.html"&gt;the boom in sports cards&lt;/a&gt;. On March 1st, for instance, the &lt;a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/luka-doncic-rookie-card-sells-for-record-4-6-million-becomes-most-expensive-nba-card-in-history/"&gt;Luka Doncic rookie card sold for $4.6 million&lt;/a&gt;, the most anyone’s ever paid for a basketball card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sERYEL"&gt;The players who are investing in Dapper Labs aren’t the only ones interested in Top Shot. Josh Hart, who plays for the New Orleans Pelicans, says he logs on multiple times a day to check things out. “My screen time is way up because of Top Shot,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvRzbt"&gt;Although Schwarz is noticeably excited when talking about LeBron James, it’s not just about being a fan. “To invest and set that record with the $208,000 purchase on LeBron just was an awesome Moment as a fan but obviously as an investor, too,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OX8Alh"&gt;The dunk is designated as a part of a Cosmic series, which Top Shot describes as “an exclusive Series 1 set only available for presale to those lucky hoops die-hards on our fan panel.” It’s the first series minted and one of the rarest Top Shot has put out. It came out before Schwarz joined the platform, even. His Moment is one of only &lt;a href="https://nbatopshot.com/listings/pack/7bc1ead9-2d1a-498a-9b8b-acc2b7f7e925"&gt;49 copies of that play&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htZTbE"&gt;Scarcity creates value, but also, the way Schwarz figures it, the most valuable Moments will be the early ones. And if the history of social media has taught us anything, there’s a lot of money in being first — and getting the best spots early. At least, there is if Top Shot takes off.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bcYqIsbRSB1BzpYbyXsVfXpfsko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394720/TS_Marketplace.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NBA Top Shot&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="kFlX4P"&gt;You won’t see the word “blockchain” anywhere in NBA Top Shot’s onboarding material. “We did a lot of testing, and eliminating the word blockchain increased conversion by 400 percent,” says Gharegozlou. “People are scared of it.” (They’re possibly also not entirely sure what it is; there’s no &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/7/17091766/blockchain-bitcoin-ethereum-cryptocurrency-meaning"&gt;consensus definition&lt;/a&gt; for what counts as a blockchain.) But that’s okay, he says. You don’t need to know about blockchain to enjoy Top Shot. You only need to know basketball and scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4gmv5C"&gt;The process of “minting” an NBA Top Shot Moment starts with the basketball game. In any game, there is a handful of notable plays. This means deciding which Moments to mint is a time-consuming process, one that hasn’t yet been standardized, says Adrienne O’Keeffe, who leads consumer products and gaming partnerships at the NBA. Right now, it’s a stream of emails, Slack channels, and biweekly calls, she says. Once Dapper Labs and the NBA agree on a play, it goes through a review process that includes the National Basketball Players Association. Once it has signed off, the NBA and the Players Association send the Moment-to-be to Dapper Labs to go through the process of minting. In the future, O’Keeffe says, fans might help decide, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9oWYgp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was pretty clear we both saw the potential of blockchain to transform the digital collectibles industry.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PbT5BU"&gt;After that, Top Shot mints the NFT — which creates the beginning of the record. Price, ownership, and transfers will be recorded on the blockchain permanently. This is what makes each Moment unique; even if 100 Moments are made from the same play, no two will be identical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmBHhQ"&gt;The NBA was introduced to Dapper Labs in 2018, when the league was considering applications for blockchain in its business, O’Keeffe says. Dapper Labs launched CryptoKitties, a game on the Ethereum blockchain that let people trade or sell pictures of cats. Within a few days of its inception, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/03/people-have-spent-over-1m-buying-virtual-cats-on-the-ethereum-blockchain/?ncid=mobilenavtrend"&gt;more than a million dollars&lt;/a&gt; had changed hands. At the peak of the boom, one &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/cryptokitties-bought-a-digital-cat-for-172000/"&gt;sold for 600 ether, about $170,000 in 2018&lt;/a&gt;; now, most CryptoKitties are trading for a tenth of an ether or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0TgWRi"&gt;There were some problems with CryptoKitties. First, the product used the Ethereum blockchain, which is the second-most-popular after bitcoin — and CryptoKitties’ popularity meant a lot of traffic, which made it hard to process transactions. Second, CryptoKitties proved to be a short-lived fad because there was nothing else you could &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; with the kitties except make more kitties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MbSJWK"&gt;After meeting with Dapper, “it was pretty clear we both saw the potential of blockchain to transform the digital collectibles industry,” O’Keeffe says. But Ethereum didn’t just work for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="0094yx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RtnCOo"&gt;So in 2019, Dapper finalized the architecture for Flow, its &lt;a href="https://www.onflow.org/primer"&gt;own blockchain&lt;/a&gt; that’s built specifically for NFTs. Flow is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;less of an energy hog&lt;/a&gt; than Ethereum because it’s more centralized and runs on proof of stake rather than proof of work. The company spent a year building it out: a core protocol, payments, credit card and cryptocurrency integrations — and then it launched Top Shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5AtP1k"&gt;Most users of Top Shot won’t interact with the blockchain, though. Instead, they’re just likely to have a better user experience than CryptoKitties players. New players don’t have to learn what a blockchain is or learn about the infrastructure under Top Shot, Gharegozlou says. People who trust cryptocurrency already own cryptocurrency. To reach people who might be skeptical or intimidated, Top Shot had to take a different approach. “The people that don’t have crypto don’t have crypto for a reason, right?” he says. “They’re probably scared of it. They’re probably threatened by it. And they’re right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVyyB3"&gt;After all, from bitcoin to dogecoin, cryptocurrency is prone to speculative manias, viruses, and scams. That’s the other thing Flow is meant to solve — because it’s a sandbox controlled by Dapper Labs. “In the early days of the iPhone, a big part of what made the iPhone successful was the App Store, right?” Gharegozlou says. “A big part of what made the App Store successful is the fact that you could easily install iPhone apps without worrying about your data being stolen or worrying about your app crashing or your phone crashing.” So the idea is to create something like Amazon Web Services but specifically for NFTs — where it’s easy to build on top of the blockchain, and consumers are safe enough that they don’t really have to think about the blockchain at all.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Video: NBA Top Shot&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="0HDBTR"&gt;
&lt;video muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline="" poster="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/flIVmVQzSQBBNtDUSAGijCZq8Ik=/0x0:300x450/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:300x450):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22400455/VRG_ILLO_4443_TopShots_Spot_01.jpg"&gt;&lt;source type="video/mp4" src="https://volume-assets.voxmedia.com/production/81db79ae2c79ba8293a216e9b1d14eec/VRG_ILLO_4443_TopShots_Spot_01.mp4"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;div class="vrg-cite"&gt;Video: NBA Top Shot&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S7z0uK"&gt;A lot of Top Shot collectors started as sports card collectors. “I was already into sports cards,” says Libruary, who joined the community in August. He’s a moderator on both the Top Shot Discord and its subreddit. “I already had a big collection. I was already wheeling and dealing on eBay.” As soon as he saw Top Shot, he “instantly loved it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omercu"&gt;The first thing he did on the platform was &lt;a href="https://www.nbatopshot.com/moment/Libruary+97970719-ebb8-425e-858f-556c4dff76dc"&gt;buy a LeBron James dunk&lt;/a&gt; from February 6th, 2020, for $35. “This is the LeBron James Kobe tribute dunk, shortly after Kobe Bryant passed away,” he says. “So, this was a very special play and Moment. When I saw it, I knew instantly I had to get it for my collection.” Now, he’s got the ninth-most-valuable collection on Top Shot, according to &lt;a href="https://evaluate.market/accountValuation"&gt;evaluate.market&lt;/a&gt;. His portfolio was worth about $9.2 million as of March 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Be9VWz"&gt;In a sense, Libruary says, Top Shot appealed to him because it didn’t have the same problems as physical cards. “I live in Canada, and there’s a lot of logistical problems with shipping cardboard to the States,” he says. “So, part of it is maybe shipping to the buyer, hoping that they receive it, hoping that they don’t try to scam you.” This is to say nothing of cards that get damaged in transit. And the physical condition of the cards is clutch, which sometimes means sending something to one of a few companies that grade the cards, a process that’s both expensive and time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdKWQr"&gt;And as physical objects, sports cards, well, take up space. “Typically, they’re actually in my closet, so they’re not seen,” Libruary says. But on Top Shot, anyone can see his collection. He doesn’t have to go rooting through his closet to get a card, take a photo, and upload it to the internet. There’s another advantage, too: he doesn’t have to go to the post office during a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgbaNh"&gt;Not everyone was as bullish on Top Shot as Libruary; on a sports card forum where he compared Top Shot to regular sports cards, the first reply &lt;a href="https://www.blowoutforums.com/showthread.php?t=1415428"&gt;to his post&lt;/a&gt; was someone posting a GIF of a child throwing money out of a window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="NJnsCn"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xVXCDp"&gt;Which brings us to the big objection about NBA Top Shot: you don’t need to buy a Moment to watch a play. The NBA still owns the footage. So what, exactly, are you buying — and how does that ownership work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LBrVUm"&gt;Well, you’re buying the Moment! Each has a unique identity stamped in the blockchain, which means you have an &lt;em&gt;official&lt;/em&gt; version of the play, and you can sell it whenever you want. But you don’t own the copyright on the video — so no merch unless the NBA approves it in advance. You also can’t change the Moment without the NBA’s express permission, so no fancy edits allowed. The Top Shot &lt;a href="https://www.nbatopshot.com/terms"&gt;terms of service&lt;/a&gt; also forbid placing the Moment next to “images, videos, or other forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others.” If you violate the terms of service, Top Shot can, at its own discretion — and without giving you any notice — either suspend or delete your account and the Moments from the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="byh8JY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Opening a pack is often a social affair — the Pelicans’ Josh Hart, for instance, sometimes streams opening them on Twitch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LdEejJ"&gt;One way to acquire Moments is to buy a pack of Moments. (Dapper Labs, the NBA, and the NBA players split this revenue.) New packs drop sporadically. Users get an email telling them when new packs will be available. The packs range in price from $9 for a pack that contains common Moments to $230 for a pack that contains “legendary” Moments. Opening a pack is often a social affair. The Pelicans’ Josh Hart, for instance, sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jhartshow/videos"&gt;streams opening them on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s so much fun,” he says. Opening a pack of Top Shot Moments works an awful lot like physical cards: you get a wrapper that you click on to open, revealing a number of mystery Moments inside. Then, one by one, you click on your Moments to reveal them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvJvX9"&gt;The packs are often themed. For instance, a Christmas-themed “Deck the Hoops” pack was released in January. A “Rising Stars” pack, released on March 7th, contains Moments of the game’s “next generation of stars,” along with some from the players who were in the 2021 NBA All-Star Game and some base set Moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OukYmG"&gt;But if you’ve logged in to Top Shot and you don’t know when the next pack drop will be, you can buy from other people; Dapper Labs, the NBA, and the players take a 5 percent cut. The market appears to view Moments from the 2019–2020 season, known as Series 1, as being more valuable than the Series 2 packs that are currently in production. Series 1 has a total of 23 sets of Moments, for a total of 840 possible plays. (The edition size on each Moment varies from one of thousands to one of, say, 70.) No more Series 1 Moments will be made, but Series 2 is still in production. So far, there are 10 sets in Series 2. In either series, low serial numbers are more valuable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vnhOME"&gt;Other numbers matter, says Michael Levy, who has the second-most-valuable collection of Moments on Top Shot — worth $15.6 million, according to &lt;a href="https://evaluate.market/accountValuation"&gt;evaluate.market&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, his favorite Moment, value aside, is a Jamal Murray layup against the Lakers in the 2020 Western Conference Finals. To Levy, it seemed very acrobatic, kind of like a mirror image of a Michael Jordan play. So as the packs associated with the Western Conference Finals were being opened, he watched the blockchain. He wanted to buy number 23 — the Moment that was Jordan’s jersey number. “I really liked the combination there of the play itself, and the importance of the serial number, and the tie back to Michael Jordan,” he says. “So, that’s a fun one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="M8R7oR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s about understanding what’s baked into the price and what other people aren’t seeing.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VVCCSL"&gt;Many collectors view the Cosmic Series 1 set — the first “legendary” set ever minted — as the sought-after set, Levy says. Jesse Schwarz’s record-setting LeBron James dunk is from this set. “These are investments,” he says. “That LeBron that I bought for $208,000 was worth seven figures right away. And, that’s a big reason why I bought it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tTzA74"&gt;Schwarz says that investing in Top Shot Moments is a lot like investing in stocks. “There’s a lot of psychology behind it,” he says. “It’s not only about what the best company or best player is. It’s about understanding what’s baked into the price and what other people aren’t seeing.” Although, in the case of LeBron James, his greatness is part of what creates the value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H7X0itHp0gnJ4Tcn5yOiPg8yoQg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394718/TS_Challenge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NBA Top Shot&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9hYFiQ"&gt;One other way to get rare cards is to complete a challenge. For the &lt;a href="https://www.nbatopshot.com/challenges/44dab61e-60e4-4a69-b163-91930fa6da33"&gt;Rising Stars 1 Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, collectors have to get nine specific Moments. If they do this by the time the challenge ends, they’ll receive an Anthony Edwards dunk, a Moment that won’t appear in packs anywhere. How scarce it is depends on how many people manage to complete the challenge. This tends to drive certain Moments’ prices up until the challenge is completed — at which point they sink in value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y3eMD8"&gt;&lt;div id="remove"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W61X1DgQ-p5PVArFMQraskqlflA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22400456/VRG_ILLO_4443_TopShots_Spot_02.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="NYgPH3"&gt;
&lt;video muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline="" poster="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/flIVmVQzSQBBNtDUSAGijCZq8Ik=/0x0:300x450/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:300x450):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22400455/VRG_ILLO_4443_TopShots_Spot_01.jpg"&gt;&lt;source type="video/mp4" src="https://volume-assets.voxmedia.com/production/5c527e23d03cc114198847fc2be37d1e/VRG_ILLO_4443_TopShots_Spot_02.mp4"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;div class="vrg-cite"&gt;Video: NBA Top Shot&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u0A2NE"&gt;All of the investors I talked to experienced a tension between the Moments they love most and the Moments that were most valuable; they are both investors and fans. This isn’t unique to Top Shot or NFTs — it’s also true of trading cards. “These are rivalrous goods,” says &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368876/venmo-paypal-square-cash-app-social-media-payments-new-money-lana-swartz-interview"&gt;Lana Swartz&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia and the author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Money-Payment-Became-Social/dp/0300233221?ots=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21132917%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Money: How Payment Became Social Media&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “A fandom that depends on uniqueness, NFTs, and the pursuit of the holy grail object is so fundamental to the logic of this particular fandom. But it also produces value, which creates financialization and speculation, which then deprives fans of ownership of the thing they so desire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7Dk4x"&gt;As of March 29th, the market cap on Top Shot is $1.1 billion, according to &lt;a href="https://evaluate.market/"&gt;evaluate.market&lt;/a&gt;, and the platform is still in beta. But it has a tailwind: it’s easy enough to get money &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; Top Shot. Getting it out is somewhat more difficult. According to a post in the official Top Shot Discord on March 26th, just $18.7 million has been withdrawn from Top Shot. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u26P3u-gsa_7eWbEydNPKSXZ7XM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406174/Screen_Shot_2021_03_29_at_9.09.59_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XkTIGp"&gt;At first, there was no way to get money out at all. Now, it takes 30 days to get approved for withdrawals, and an average of “less than 10 days so far” to get your first withdrawal out, though things might move faster or slower depending on any individual user’s activity, Gharegozlou says. “We just doubled the team last week,” he says. “We should be getting ahead of it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5y0J3"&gt;On March 26th, &lt;a href="https://blog.nbatopshot.com/posts/an-update-on-withdrawals-3-26-21"&gt;the company posted&lt;/a&gt; about its withdrawal backlog. Over the last four weeks, the number of people with access to withdrawals has increased by 450 percent, the post says. Another 5,000 people will receive access soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFNRQH"&gt;The reason these things take so long is that Top Shot allows anyone with any kind of currency from anywhere in the world to come into the system. That means heavy compliance checks, Gharegozlou says. Any money moving out of Top Shot has to be checked to make sure there isn’t money laundering, fraud, or other nefarious activity going on. Some accounts are easier to check on — people who are just buying packs from Top Shot, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HF4O45"&gt;But if you’re gifting Moments to people or receiving them or buying from a lot of other people in the marketplace, every transaction has to be chased down. “Where did this dollar go?” Gharegozlou says. “Who is this other user? What payment method did they use? And that just takes longer. So there’s a little bit of variability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2R9RQ"&gt;This is not entirely unexpected. Top Shot is, after all, still in beta. As I was writing this, Top Shot turned off site sign-ups. Right now, Dapper Labs is focusing all of its efforts on scaling its operations to accommodate demand — which really took off in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="15EcHU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gharegozlou envisions Top Shot as a kind of fan club&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BTyS1U"&gt;But Dapper Labs has big plans: a mobile game Gharegozlou says will roll out this year. Not only will users be able to access their accounts from their phone, but the plan is to let them use their Moments to level up players in a mobile basketball game. In Gharegozlou’s vision, having a lot of good Moments means you’ll have a stronger team. “Most people in 2021 needs to try something for free before paying for it,” he says. “And so the idea is you download an app off the app store, you start playing with something, and then you realize, ‘Oh wait, having Moments would mean I look better in this game.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9AxzA"&gt;That means the Moments do double-duty: not only are they collectibles, but they also function as something akin to a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skin. And plenty of people, as video game developers will tell you, have no problem buying something that only exists online in the context of a video game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrlHFk"&gt;And maybe, sometime in the future, you might be able to watch your Moments in VR or AR — they’re 3D Unity objects, Gharegozlou says. “In the future you can beam them onto your wall, and all those things,” he says. “That won’t be this year, but we’re already set up for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPuhZr"&gt;Beyond that, Gharegozlou envisions Top Shot as a kind of fan club, ideally with perks at the real games. “The crazy thing with digital compared to physical is I can’t show up to a game with my entire card collection in my pocket, but I can show up to a game with my entire Top Shot collection in my pocket,” he says. “Then, the arena will know how big of a fan I am. They’ll know how much skin in the game I have.” And maybe the arena might do something special, like give him a free hot dog. (The ideas aren’t yet fully cooked.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6MbvCT"&gt;When it comes to connecting life online to life offline, Gharegozlou gets noticeably excited. He points out that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with&lt;em&gt; Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, people left their houses to go on walks to catch rare pokémon — with no benefit to it outside the game. Maybe Top Shot will be part of how the NBA lures Gen Z into the stands once live events open back up. “We haven’t even gotten started thinking about those kinds of things yet. So it’s going to be a lot of fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CchPOA-YdhqWrZml2n-cRa2CyGs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394721/TS_Packs.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NBA Top Shot&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ebj19G"&gt;Some of the offline interactions are already occurring. Jesse Schwarz, the collector, says that NBA players are already trading Moments for real-life experiences. “They’re saying, ‘If you give me this Moment, I’ll get you a jersey,’” he says. “Or ‘If you buy this Moment from me, I’ll get you court side seats at our next game.’ That kind of thing. I think that’s really cool because it bridges the digital world and the real.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFn2oZ"&gt;Still, in the digital world, there is a real community. The Discord is a remarkably polite, well-moderated place. There are multiple fan-built sites, such as &lt;a href="https://intangible.market/Account.php"&gt;intangible.market,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://evaluate.market/"&gt;evaluate.market&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://topshotsignals.com/"&gt;Top Shot Signals&lt;/a&gt;, that help users figure out how much their Moments are worth, who has specific Moments, and what the overall marketplace looks like. There’s a podcast, &lt;a href="https://www.thefirstmint.co/topshot101"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The First Mint&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and a YouTube channel, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/OwnTheMoment/videos"&gt;Own the Moment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZVLpI"&gt;And some people are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; excited. “I have one friend I had to give the responsible adult conversation, because he was like ‘I’m putting everything into it,” Iguodala says. “And I’m like, ‘Well, there’s risk in everything you do.’ He was just so excited about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYjzKa"&gt;The enthusiasm is important. It’s what creates demand. The market only works as long as people are enthusiastic about it — ask anyone with a &lt;a href="https://www.cardboardconnection.com/why-sports-cards-early-90s-worthless"&gt;box full of baseball cards&lt;/a&gt; from the early 1990s. To some degree, the future of Top Shot is more dependent on its community than it is on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJD9GT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://nbatopshot.com/user/@steve/showcases"&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt;, who created intangible.market, joined in August. When he first bought his packs, he immediately experienced buyer’s remorse. “I was like, &lt;em&gt;Well, what did I just buy? I bought about $30 worth of YouTube highlights&lt;/em&gt;,” Steve says. “And I sat on it for about a day and I just came to this realization that maybe there’s something more to it. So I joined the Discord as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkeep0"&gt;The Discord community was “awesome,” Steve says. He began putting together a document on how Top Shot worked. Then he started answering questions. Then he started writing tools to help people find Moments they wanted and to manage their collections. And then he wrote the initial code of conduct for how to trade Moments without getting scammed. “For a while there, I felt like I was pushing my budget for how much I should be spending on these things,” Steve says. “Because if there aren’t a lot of users joining you could be throwing money into a dead platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yBsAom"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We just try to spread the positive vibes.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cibfUE"&gt;Steve now has the eighth-most-valuable account on Top Shot, worth about $9.5 million, according to &lt;a href="https://evaluate.market/accountValuation"&gt;evaluate.market&lt;/a&gt;. He’s a moderator on the Discord, and it’s getting increasingly difficult to keep up. Now the question for him is how to grow Top Shot in a way that’s sustainable. There are roughly three communities in the Discord: people who are huge basketball fans, people who are really into NFTs, and people who just want to make a buck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmcE07"&gt;“Obviously the financial returns and the fun of finding a hobby that I really enjoy has been fantastic, but probably the best takeaway from my perspective is meeting the people and the community and kind of finding new friends,” says Michael Levy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDw1aY"&gt;Levy’s a recurring guest on a YouTube stream called Club Top Shot, where he got to talk &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-DSEXvGKoE&amp;amp;list=PLsaIqi9mL1lITsFb4sCSRrciCAvIUvFcB&amp;amp;index=7"&gt;with the Golden State Warriors’ Damion Lee&lt;/a&gt;. Chris Conley, an NFL player who most recently played for the Jacksonville Jaguars, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Uf_wpyzkFw&amp;amp;list=PLsaIqi9mL1lITsFb4sCSRrciCAvIUvFcB&amp;amp;index=3"&gt;has also dropped by&lt;/a&gt; the stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ck4IYJ"&gt;Early on, everyone in the community knew each other — it was that small, Levy says. With every trade, he knew both people involved, so it was easy to send over a message to both and congratulate them. When Libruary joined, there were only 100 active buyers a day, and the Discord only had a few active users. “Any sale that was over $500 really got attention back then,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFhaJq"&gt;As the Discord has gotten larger, different kinds of people have come in, Libruary says. Some people are trying to shill specific Moments, but that’s frowned upon. “Whenever there’s any kind of dip in any kind of market, any values of Moments, there’s a very vocal minority that get very angry if a Moment goes down,” he says. These users are spreading FUD: fear, uncertainty, and doubt, he says. His big tool for combating that is “empathy,” he says. “We just try to spread the positive vibes. And we realize there’s going to be critics out there, but we just have to roll with it. And honestly, there’s so much positivity right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDPrqB"&gt;There were some periods early in Top Shot’s lifespan where people questioned whether Dapper Labs was making good decisions with the supply of Moments and whether the website itself would hold up with a larger user base, Levy says. “It’s really exploded and become very, very mainstream,” he says. “So it feels validating to see it all play out the way a lot of us hoped it would.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOWHgq"&gt;Top Shot Moments have something the art world NFTs do not: a community of believers who are attempting to understand the value of each Moment in real time, and that may make them a better investment than some of the flashy art world auctions. In fact, Top Shot Moments may ultimately be worth more than bitcoin, Steve tells me. No one has an emotional attachment to a specific bitcoin. It’s just a number in your wallet. But when Tyrese Haliburton shouts out Top Shot — that’s special. The fact that no two tokens are identical — that’s special, too. It encourages a sense of ownership, which in some sense, is what the fans are &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="e5NVaX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What, exactly, is a &lt;em&gt;sense &lt;/em&gt;of ownership worth in dollars?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zoDF8W"&gt;Through the blockchain, the NBA is re-adding uniqueness to something that is widely reproduced. The collector community is what determines the value; after all, it wasn’t Dapper Labs that decided that low-serial-number Moments were the valuable ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4zbwT"&gt;For anyone who’s interested in how value is formed — in art, on Wall Street, or anywhere else — Top Shot’s community is worth watching. One benefit of the blockchain is that it’s possible for outside observers to track when specific Moments began to take off in value, as well as which packs the community thinks are most important. Watching the Discord, it’s possible to see people trying to decide what a sense of ownership is worth in real time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjxsZK"&gt;It’s hard not to view Top Shot as an inadvertent social experiment. Fans often &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2015/07/characters-belong-to-fans-or-creators.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; a sense of ownership&lt;/a&gt; over the things they love, even if they don’t actually own the intellectual property. Top Shot essentially monetizes this, letting hardcore fans buy a sense of ownership in their favorite plays. After a while observing the community, one gets the sense that — more than anything else — Top Shot is several sociology and economics dissertations waiting to happen. What, exactly, is a &lt;em&gt;sense &lt;/em&gt;of ownership worth in dollars?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldwUxt"&gt;Top Shot is a better system than the art NFTs for observing this because the community means there’s consensus around price. By contrast, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;Beeple’s NFT famously sold for $69 million&lt;/a&gt; — but there’s no real way to know if that valuation is accurate. Whether there’s a resale market for that Beeple NFT is an open question, one that might not be answered for some time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jPWjg"&gt;On March 22nd, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rohamg/status/1374103328095805445"&gt;Gharegozlou tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that more than 300,000 people were in line for a pack drop from the Cool Cats set. Among collectors who open at least two packs and do at least two trades on the marketplace, retention is 98 percent over a 12-week period. These are impressive numbers — but 12 weeks is a limited period of time. CryptoKitties was, after all, a short-lived fad for most participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="2O0ZVV"&gt;In the meantime, Josh Hart is collecting his own Moments, as well as those of players he thinks will be future Hall of Famers. “I have my jersey number (#3/299) Metallic Gold LE Series 1,” Hart says in an email. “I will give that to my kids one day.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Nest Hub (2nd-gen) review: sleep on it</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The new Nest Hub is just as good at being a digital photo frame as before, but it’s slow for everything else&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ANkmKy"&gt;Here’s the thing about the new $99.99 Nest Hub from Google: it is slow. Compared to almost any other touchscreen device you might own or interact with, the Nest Hub is laggy, sluggish to respond, and has stuttering animations all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IwbDI"&gt;The reason for this is because since Google first launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;original Home Hub in 2018&lt;/a&gt; (now known as the Nest Hub), it has regularly been adding more features and more capabilities to the device. While it was essentially a digital photo frame and basic smart speaker with a screen at its debut, the Nest Hub is now capable of being a smart home control center, fancy alarm clock, weather machine, media center, communications hub, and more. It’s a lot of stuff for the processor in this little screen-with-a-speaker to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X57Pzq"&gt;The latest feature that Google has added is automatic sleep tracking, which uses special sensors built into the new Nest Hub’s display bezel to track your movement and breathing at night to evaluate your sleep. Google is also using those sensors to add some basic gesture controls, and it has beefed up the speaker inside the Nest Hub to improve its audio quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0PSFy"&gt;For the 20 percent of Nest Hub owners that keep the device in their bedroom (according to Google), this new sleep tracking feature works very well — it’s by far the easiest and most comfortable way to track sleep that I’ve tested. But for the other 80 percent, I’m disappointed the new Nest Hub hasn’t meaningfully improved the experience over the prior model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frscf3"&gt;Slow might be okay when all you’re doing is looking at photos or asking for a weather report, but when a device is promising to be a true smart home hub, speed matters a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b9H3sJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10418836"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TZVL87"&gt;The design of the new Nest Hub is almost identical to the first version: it’s a 7-inch touchscreen perched atop a base with a speaker in it. The screen itself is the same as before, with a 1024 x 600 pixel resolution and Google’s automatic ambient brightness and color adjustment features that make images look great no matter the time of day or lighting in the room. Google has dropped the small lip around the bezel that was on the prior model — this makes it a little easier to wipe the screen clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhOiNk"&gt;The rest of the Nest Hub is just like the prior model, but now you can get it in a light blue color in addition to the light gray, dark gray, and light red fabric options. It still doesn’t have a camera, which is a good thing if you plan on putting this thing next to your bedside, though it now has three far-field microphones instead of the two on the last version. A physical mute switch is on the back to disable them if you wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SiLPUF"&gt;The first Home Hub had a rather lousy speaker that was easily trumped by smart speakers that cost half as much, so I’m glad that Google used a larger, 1.7-inch driver in the new model. The sound is fuller, with better bass response, and the Google Assistant’s voice sounds more pleasant when it responds back to me. The Nest Hub still won’t take the place of a Nest Audio or other well-equipped wireless speaker when you really crank it, but it no longer puts a frown on my face when playing music or podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-xu8tWIDEQTfBV5nSOzNZd_RsNc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399100/dseifert_20210323_4485_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The frame around the display of the new Nest Hub is home to the Soli radar sensors, far-field microphones, and ambient light sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="QJcjnd"&gt;The interface that Google started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522326/google-assistant-smart-displays-nest-hub-dark-mode-new-interface-multiple-accounts"&gt;rolling out to the older Nest Hub late last year&lt;/a&gt; really invites you to touch the screen and rely less on voice commands to do everything. But as I mentioned at the outset, the Nest Hub is just too slow to really make this a pleasant experience. There’s a noticeable delay whenever I touch the screen and the animations to switch between the Nest Hub’s various functions are stuttery. Google says it is using a faster processor in this new model, but wouldn’t specify how much faster, and I couldn’t tell the difference between it and the prior version when it came to swiping around the screen and tapping buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="E4XzhO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Nest Hub is just too slow to make Google’s latest interface a pleasant experience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="biy0Jh"&gt;That means that instead of using the touchscreen, I’m still using my voice to control the Nest Hub most of the time. But even there, the new model is slow to respond, with a long enough lag and delay to recognize my voice commands that I often wonder if it heard me at all. The ability to transcribe and show me what it heard right on the screen is one of the best features the Nest Hub has over Amazon’s smart displays, but watching each word slowly populate on the screen feels like I’m watching a TV show with closed captions that are three lines behind the actual dialog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAYjLR"&gt;Google claims the new model has an on-device machine-learning chip to speed up the Assistant, that will learn common commands over time to further improve responsiveness. But as with the allegedly faster processor, if the new Nest Hub is any faster than before, I didn’t notice it in my everyday use. The fastest voice assistant in my experience remains Siri on a HomePod, followed by Alexa on Amazon Echo speakers and displays, and then the Google Assistant on Nest products.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-QZftdGNUcK2uMk80wYiiBlbzLA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399113/dseifert_20210323_4485_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Nest Hub comes in a soft blue color, as well as light gray, dark gray, and light red.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SCx3Ar"&gt;All of that is a lot of criticism, which is applicable if you use the Nest Hub in a kitchen, home office, living room or somewhere else in your home. But if you do put it in your bedroom, I am happy to report that it is a very good smart alarm clock and automatic sleep tracking device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrKItJ"&gt;The sleep tracking is enabled by Soli radar sensors in the Nest Hub’s bezel. Google’s been trying to find a use case for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/30/21496318/google-soli-radar-motion-sense-rick-osterloh-pixel-5"&gt;the Soli technology&lt;/a&gt; ever since it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20908083/google-pixel-4-project-soli-radar-motion-sense-explainer"&gt;debuted in the Pixel 4 smartphone&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, and I think this might be the best application of it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lhGu3K"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sleep tracking with the Nest Hub is much more convenient than a wrist-worn fitness band or smartwatch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="diTtCL"&gt;Unlike wrist-worn fitness bands or smart watch sleep trackers, the Nest Hub doesn’t require you to wear anything to bed and doesn’t need to be recharged from time to time. You just place it on your nightstand about an arm’s length or less away from your bed, and point the screen towards where you sleep. Its radar sensors are sensitive enough to track your breathing and movement, so the Nest Hub can tell when you’re moving, when you’ve fallen asleep, and when you’ve woken up. Its microphone records how often you cough and snore during the night, which might put an end to many spousal arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRUE8o"&gt;Google claims the Nest Hub’s sleep tracking can be as accurate as much more scientific methods, though I wasn’t able to actually test that. In my experience, it works just as well as the Fitbit Inspire HR I wore to bed alongside it, often landing within 10 minutes of what the Fitbit recorded. It also claimed I snored a number of minutes each night, and is able to record the room temperature and brightness levels during the night — data points that wrist-worn trackers just don’t have. If it’s too warm, too cold, or too bright in the room for optimal sleep conditions, the Nest Hub might suggest I change the thermostat or adjust the lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXB8wz"&gt;(For the smart home aficionados, no, it is not yet possible to trigger Google Home routines using the new temperature sensor in the Nest Hub. Neither is it possible to yet do anything with the Thread radio that’s in the Hub — it’s dormant for the time being.)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Hub can measure how long you’ve spent in bed and how much of that was spent sleeping.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hub will tell you if you are hitting your schedule goals or not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Soli radar sensors are sensitive enough to read breathing rate and the Hub’s microphones record how much you cough or snore at night.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hJdNJzPSzjVxgF_YU2Aluv4GtM0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399112/dseifert_20210323_4485_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Hub uses its temperature and light sensors to monitor if the room conditions are ideal for sleeping.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="zvu98F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10419130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M0EeQ9"&gt;Each morning when I wake up and dismiss the alarm, the Nest Hub gives me a report on how well I slept the night before. It tells me what time I “went” to bed, what time I fell asleep, how long I was sleeping, how long during the night I snored or coughed, my respiratory rate, and if I adhered to my intended schedule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5AW3g"&gt;After a number of nights measuring my sleep, the Nest Hub provided suggestions on how I can improve its quality — so far, it tells me I’m doing a poor job sticking to my sleep schedule, though not for the reasons you might expect. Because I tend to lie in bed reading or watching TV before going to sleep each night, the Nest Hub claims I go to bed one to two hours before I actually fall asleep and chides me for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iB9nK8"&gt;All of this data is also available in the Google Fit app on a smartphone. Google does not yet give a numerical score for the quality of sleep, like other sleep trackers do, but I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s added in a future update. In its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22331567/google-nest-hub-new-2021-smart-display-sleep-tracking-soli-price-specs-features"&gt;announcement of the Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, Google said the sleep sensing features will be available as a free preview for all Nest Hub owners until next year, but it declined to give specifics on how much it will cost after the free preview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCtr3f"&gt;The Nest Hub’s sleep tracking is convenient, but it’s far from perfect. As mentioned, it can’t tell the difference between me lying in bed and reading or watching TV or attempting to fall asleep, activities that rarely tripped up my Fitbit, which relies on heart rate and movement measurements to evaluate sleep. I also am trusting that its microphones are picking up my coughs and snores and not my spouse’s — I really have no way to verify that data without sticking a camera in my bedroom and recording the night, which I’m not willing to do. And like every other sleep trackers you can buy, the Nest Hub is able to provide a lot of data, but it cannot diagnose sleep disorders or really provide any helpful insights other than the obvious ones of sticking to a routine and making sure the room is quiet and comfortable. This is very much a wellness device and not something to take the place of medical diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpY7CT"&gt;Still, the Nest Hub’s automatic sleep tracking is extremely easy to use and I really like how I don’t have to wear an uncomfortable bracelet to bed each night or bother with remembering to charge its battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f2s5qJY4Vfkm9oNX427BoG2eu1I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399106/dseifert_20210323_4485_0007.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Hub is a competent, if slow, smart home dashboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CVvGAX"&gt;Beyond the sleep tracking, the Nest Hub is also a very good smart alarm clock. I can easily set the alarm with my voice; there are a variety of alarm sounds to choose from in addition to music or a radio station of my choice; and I can simply wave an arm in front of the Hub to snooze the alarm (another new feature enabled by the Soli sensors) or say “stop” when I’m ready to get out of bed. There’s also the option to gradually brighten the Hub’s screen or turn on smart lights in my room before the alarm sounds to mimic a sunrise, but that was more annoying than helpful for me and I ended up turning it off after a few nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBUaAf"&gt;One thing to be aware of: the Nest Hub, like other smart displays, does not have a backup battery, so if you lose power overnight and it’s not restored by the time your alarm is supposed to go off, the Nest Hub will not wake you up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SP8ARO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new Nest Hub is a minor update over the prior model, with sleep tracking being the standout new feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O0hVlO"&gt;Overall, the new Nest Hub is a minor update over the prior model, with some handy new sleep tracking features that may or may not be important to you. The Nest Hub is still an excellent digital picture frame for images you have stored in Google Photos, and it’s a competent smart speaker and smart display. I actually prefer it over Amazon’s Echo Show devices for the purpose of being an ambient screen that automatically rotates through memories because all of my photos are in Google Photos, not Amazon’s cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="R4bHxB"&gt;But I wish Google had spent as much time optimizing the performance and experience of the Nest Hub as it has adding new features, which seem to be bogging down the device more than anything else. If you’re embedded in the Google Home platform, the Nest Hub’s price and compact size make it easy to add to your home, but otherwise, life is too short for slow computers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix lays out plans to slash its greenhouse gas emissions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Netflix Los Angeles Headquarters" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4y8LdhRAftSj8x8J8ACOD5AiL4g=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047745/1210483247.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Netflix’s headquarters located on Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood, California.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Netflix via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fkiP9x"&gt;Netflix set out goals today to limit the damage the company does to the climate. By the end of 2022, it wants to reach “net zero” greenhouse gas emissions. That means it plans to reduce some of its emissions and find ways to offset or capture the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OY0kxu"&gt;By 2030, Netflix says it plans to cut emissions from its operations and electricity use by 45 percent. That goal roughly lines up with &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/2018/10/08/summary-for-policymakers-of-ipcc-special-report-on-global-warming-of-1-5c-approved-by-governments/#:~:text=Global%20net%20human%2Dcaused%20emissions,removing%20CO2%20from%20the%20air."&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; from leading climate scientists, who have found that greenhouse gas emissions need to fall by about 45 percent globally this decade. But Netflix will eventually need to ramp up efforts to prevent pollution generated by producing and streaming its movies and TV shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PBGVHR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A strategy with a checkered history&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RXRkwJ"&gt;To meet its deadline next year, the company is primarily relying on offsetting its emissions, a strategy with a checkered history when it comes to how well it actually slows down climate change. Netflix plans to invest in programs dedicated to preserving and restoring ecosystems that naturally store planet-heating carbon dioxide. Efforts to cancel out companies’ carbon footprints by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign"&gt;planting trees&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://features.propublica.org/brazil-carbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work-deforestation-redd-acre-cambodia/"&gt;preserving forests&lt;/a&gt; have failed to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the past. Netflix, however, says that it has developed a thorough process to vet these kinds of projects, which might include visiting the sites in person or monitoring their progress via satellite. But many environmental advocates have pressured companies to do more to stop polluting in the first place, rather than relying on trees to clean up the mess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ivNqlo"&gt;Netflix disclosed its annual carbon footprint for the first time today in an environmental social governance report. That revealed that the company generated roughly 1.1 million metric tons of CO2 last year, &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator"&gt;equivalent&lt;/a&gt; to the yearly emissions from about 240,000 passenger cars. That total still doesn’t account for emissions that come from the internet infrastructure needed to stream its shows, or from the devices people use to watch its content.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpfUeG"&gt;Netflix did pollute a little less in 2020 than it did in 2019, but probably not by design. Production for a lot of Netflix content was delayed last year because of the pandemic, which the company said was the main reason for the 14 percent drop in emissions last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="VvnsYY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Before the pandemic, Netflix’s energy use skyrocketed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AJ5iz1"&gt;The year before the pandemic, Netflix’s energy use actually skyrocketed. It used &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/netflix-electricity-usage-2019-increase-megawatt-hours-1203496610/"&gt;84 percent more electricity&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 compared to the year before. (Its subscriber base grew 20 percent over the same time period.) Netflix attributed much of that rise to the company self-producing more of its own films and TV shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7620J7"&gt;The physical production of Netflix’s branded content was responsible for half of its entire carbon footprint in 2020. Corporate operations and purchased goods made up another 45 percent of emissions, while data centers made up 5 percent.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sF7a8G"&gt;To cut down its planet-heating pollution moving forward, Netflix says it will replace fossil fuels with renewable energy as much as possible. When it comes to filming around the globe, the company said it plans to hire more local crews to avoid pollution from travel. It also wants to make its operations more efficient so that it can cut down on how much energy it uses in the first place. It has the most control over that at its own studios, but the company says it will also try to influence vendors and data center providers with whom it works. One small change the company has already made is the switch from incandescent to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21024834/lightbulbs-energy-efficiency-standards-trump-climate-change"&gt;vastly more efficient LED lighting&lt;/a&gt; in many of its studios. Not only do LED lights use up less energy, but they also reduce cooling costs because they’re not as hot as traditional bulbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k6RcJP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The film industry needs a leader when it comes to climate action.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tHVQwf"&gt;“The talent loves it because it doesn’t melt their makeup in the same way that incandescent bulbs did, so it’s a win-win-win,” says Emma Stewart, who was hired last year to become Netflix’s first sustainability officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20lQGU"&gt;Even incremental changes could eventually add up to big wins for the planet. “The film industry needs a leader when it comes to climate action. Changing the world begins with one company stepping up and inspiring others to join them. I’m thrilled at how Netflix is taking on this leadership role,” Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, said in a statement on Netflix’s new sustainability goals. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Codename: Urban Legends is a taste of what Niantic thinks 5G could do for AR gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g22CO7uRg3ebCUxumkI0ShCf9kI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047739/5G_MEC_Codename_Urban_Legends_Hero_D__1___1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2X0fuI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; developer Niantic has &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/niantic-planet-scale-ar-5g-multiplayer"&gt;unveiled &lt;em&gt;Codename: Urban Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which it describes as “a multiplayer demo experience that offers a glimpse into the future of AR and 5G networks.” The game revolves around casting magic spells to kill monsters and rescue allies. It’s similar to Niantic’s previously released games, but the trailer includes a unique feature: multiple players interacting with the same augmented reality creatures from their own phones. Niantic says it’s just a demo at the moment and not for general consumer use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaDxce"&gt;It’s an exciting shift from Niantic’s previously released games like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, and the company says this is largely thanks to 5G&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Although its games have had multiplayer elements, for the most part each player exists in their own augmented reality worlds. For example, while the same pokémon appear on the map for every player in &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, each player can only view and interact with their own creatures in AR. In other words, you can’t throw a pokéball to catch someone else’s augmented reality pokémon. (&lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Go&lt;/em&gt; has a limited &lt;a href="https://niantic.helpshift.com/a/pokemon-go/?s=buddy-pokemon&amp;amp;f=shared-ar-experience-with-your-buddy&amp;amp;l=en&amp;amp;p=web"&gt;shared AR experience mode&lt;/a&gt; where you can see other players’ pokémon but not interact with them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iP56r2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A multiplayer demo experience that offers a glimpse into the future of AR and 5G networks”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BaVrf9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Codename: Urban Legend&lt;/em&gt;s isbuilt on the same platform that underpins the augmented reality games &lt;em&gt;Ingress&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Wizards Unite&lt;/em&gt;. Niantic hopes that AR gaming will be 5G’s “killer app,” benefiting from its higher speeds, lower latency, and ability to keep lots of people’s phones connected to the internet in a crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trziOF"&gt;Niantic says that carriers from its &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/niantic-planet-scale-ar-alliance-5g"&gt;Planet-Scale AR Alliance&lt;/a&gt; — an organization formed of over half a dozen carriers around the world aimed at developing augmented reality 5G experiences — have been network testing the game. These include Germany’s Deutsche Telekom, Globe Telecom in the Philippines, and Verizon in the US. Niantic &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/niantic-planet-scale-ar-alliance-5g"&gt;formed the alliance last year&lt;/a&gt; to promote and develop augmented reality experiences for 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtaV8l"&gt;Although it’s a cool demo, &lt;em&gt;Codename: Urban Legends&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reliance on 5G risks replicating some of the geographical issues that affected &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go. &lt;/em&gt;5G coverage is currently concentrated in cities, meaning players living in more rural areas risk losing out (&lt;em&gt;Codename: Urban Legends &lt;/em&gt;works on both Sub-6GHz and mmWave variants of 5G). It was a similar situation when city-dwelling &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;players benefited from having more pokéstops and gyms compared to players out in the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGG3TC"&gt;Today’s announcement doesn’t say when the demo might turn into a real game or on which phones it runs. However, Niantic tells us the game will be exclusive to its carrier partners’ customers once it releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JFiPv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Codename: Urban Legends&lt;/em&gt; is an interesting tech demo, and it has the potential to expand on &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;’s augmented reality features in some interesting ways. We just want to know when players will be able to dive in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Entercom rebrands to Audacy, plans to launch exclusive podcasts on its own app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NxiNU-rKIAY9fgx7cUSysq15TAU=/0x0:6042x4028/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047782/audacy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Audacy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qXwxcj"&gt;Entercom, a company mostly associated with its hundreds of US radio stations, is losing its old name in an effort to signify its broader interest and investments in audio — specifically, podcasts. Today, Entercom becomes Audacy. The company, which owns podcast networks Cadence13 and Pineapple Street Studios, as well as ad network Podcorn, is looking to keep expanding its work in the digital audio space. Along with the rebrand, the company is announcing a new podcast partnership with Demi Lovato; a partnership with BetMGM to create content around sports betting; and a plan to exclusively debut new, original shows on its Audacy listening app (previously the Radio.com app).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArrPEv"&gt;“We’ve come to this point where we are really fundamentally different than who we were before,” CEO David Fields tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And it was time for a new identity, a new brand that really reflected the depth and breadth of all the things that we do and the ambitions and vision that we have going forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBgkn7"&gt;The branding shift comes as more companies double down on podcasting. iHeartMedia and Cumulus both own radio stations around the US but also maintain podcast businesses. Cumulus owns Westwood One, which hosts shows from political commentators like Ben Shapiro, while iHeartMedia &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210225005986/en/iHeartMedia-Announces-New-Business-Operating-Structure"&gt;altered its operating structure&lt;/a&gt; to report its podcasting division revenue separately from its radio stations earlier this year. Audacy already makes podcasts, and Fields claims it’s the “number one creator of audio content in the United States” considering its news and local sports radio stations’ programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAgskx"&gt;“We think that deserves its own platform as opposed to being part of somebody else’s platform,” he says when asked why Audacy wants to launch shows exclusively on its app rather than looking to the biggest listening apps, like Spotify or Apple Podcasts. (Spotify has already locked in exclusives with Audacy’s Pineapple Street Studios on shows like &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Your Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15IiNY"&gt;Meanwhile, he also says with live audio apps, like Clubhouse, taking off, “there is more energy and enthusiasm around audio today than ever before.” Audacy clearly wants to make sure it stays in the conversation and its investors know it’s serious about podcasting, not just radio.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify is launching its own Clubhouse competitor</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cn1fTt"&gt;Spotify has invested heavily in prerecorded podcast content, and now, the company is looking to host live audio conversations. The platform announced today that it’s acquiring Betty Labs, the company behind the live sports audio app Locker Room. Spotify didn’t disclose how much it spent on the purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGoHX2"&gt;As a result of the acquisition, Locker Room will temporarily be removed from the App Store and will relaunch in the future on both iOS and Android under a different name and with a broader focus on music, culture, and sports content. Spotify says it sees live audio as ideal for creators who want to connect with audiences in real time, whether that’s to premiere an album, host a question and answer session, or possibly even perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roxhUQ"&gt;Gustav Söderström, chief R&amp;amp;D officer at Spotify, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Spotify will let anyone host conversations — not just approved creators — meaning its app will directly compete with all of the various live audio apps currently on the market, including Twitter Spaces, Clubhouse, and Discord. Although he says Spotify-employed creators won’t be required to go live only on Spotify’s app, he thinks it’ll be a “great complement” to their existing Spotify audiences. Still, the two apps will remain separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjrMxH"&gt;“But who knows, maybe we’ll integrate some of these features, or all of these features in the future,” Söderström says. Spotify will also experiment with different monetization features, he says. Some chats might be free to tune into, for example, while others are paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VdmF8c"&gt;Of course, live audio from the app will then become a direct funnel to Spotify’s podcasting ecosystem. Söderström says people already record their Spaces and Clubhouse chats and upload them as MP3 files to Anchor, Spotify’s podcast creation and hosting software. “We might want to make that more seamless,” he says. It’s easy to imagine the company allowing people to natively record their chats and tap a button to distribute them directly to Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGZUes"&gt;Broadly, audio content has become wildly popular in the tech space as the biggest names in the space look to invest in prerecorded podcast content as well as live audio. Amazon acquired podcast network Wondery last year, for example, while Clubhouse and Spaces launched last year, too. Facebook is even reportedly looking to build a live audio feature. Spotify, although it’s mostly focused on podcasting, is showing that companies can have access to both worlds: live audio recording can grow its podcasting catalog and simultaneously promote the streamable music that lives on its app. It doesn’t need to limit itself to just one format.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s new logo is almost unrecognizable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fOJTpR6OmjyOacN7eoScADglUcg=/160x0:2059x1266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047710/Screen_Shot_2021_03_30_at_12.51.31_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xiaomi’s new logo (left) and old logo (right). &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Xiaomi / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="05KiGt"&gt;No one in the world does corporate pomposity quite like tech firms, and Chinese mobile giant Xiaomi is no exception. The company announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;new foldable Mi Mix Fold today&lt;/a&gt;, but it also revealed a new logo, spending more than 20 minutes describing the process in which it turned its old square design into... a squircle. (Halfway between a square and a circle.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JigPOx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Xiaomi says the new logo has a new “internal spirit,” too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U3HWJE"&gt;In fairness to Xiaomi, the company is not blind to the fact its new logo is &lt;em&gt;pretty similar&lt;/em&gt; in appearance to the old one. “Are you disappointed at this logo, that we just made our original logo rounder?” asked Xiaomi’s CEO Lei Jun, somewhat rhetorically. No worry, Lei explained, as the company “didn’t just change the shape from square to round” but also changed “the internal spirit as well as the mentality of the brand.” So, that’s reassuring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEElAD"&gt;The company went on to note that the shape of the new logo can be described using mathematical equations (a property that is common to most shapes, I believe) and that it took the firm a long time to pick the right one (it started the rebranding process in 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98iYgb"&gt;You can see some of the shapes it considered and discarded below, along with the blindingly, obviously, self-evidently superior final design. N:3, could it be any other way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T8VZNL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10419708"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FtECfm"&gt;We’re having some fun at Xiaomi’s expense here, but really this is just par for the course when it comes to corporate redesigns. Indeed, this sort of long-winded, self-indulgent presentation is common to pretty much all big tech brands at this point, from Samsung to Microsoft to Apple (who started the game and remains the master of the form). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iiVBtm"&gt;As Lei explained, the new logo is part of a bigger overhaul of Xiaomi’s “brand identity” overseen by famed Japanese designer Kenya Hara. “The new logo is not a simple redesign of the shape but an encapsulation of Xiaomi’s inner spirit,” said Hara during a video segment. “The design is essentially a reflection of the concept ‘Alive.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZgAqV"&gt;So, if you feel dead inside considering the millions of dollars of work that went into circling the square of Xiaomi’s logo: don’t. That’s disrespectful to its brand identity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi announces the Mi Mix Fold, its first folding phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RCsMj-zHd0WmoMDy0CBaSsJBZks=/0x0:1688x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047687/mf1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mi Mix Fold pairs a folding screen on the inside with a smaller outer display. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Xiaomi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Px37br"&gt;Xiaomi has resurrected its Mi Mix series with the Mi Mix Fold, the company’s first commercial folding phone. Unlike previous outlandish Mix devices and concepts from the company, the Mi Mix Fold is a pretty conventional folding phone that uses a big-screen-on-the-inside / small-screen-on-the-outside design similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;Huawei’s new Mate X2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNbPcj"&gt;The inner screen is an 8.01-inch 4:3 OLED panel with 2480 x 1860 resolution, a standard display brightness of 600 nits (900 peak), and support for Dolby Vision HDR. Xiaomi says the display is able to withstand being folded 200,000 times. The outer screen is 6.52-inches with a 90Hz refresh rate. Xiaomi is making big claims about the Mi Mix Fold’s audio capabilities, with four Harman Kardon-tuned speakers and what the company describes as 3D panoramic sound.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GcyVDYwontZoiL40zB4XrIT8x8k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407567/MIX_Fold__21_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone has a camera with a liquid lens on the rear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="f5Q0Hb"&gt;The processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 paired with 12GB or 16GB of RAM and 256GB or 512GB of storage. Battery capacity is 5,020mAh, and Xiaomi says the 67W fast-charging system should get you a full charge in 37 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4Xy8k"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350245/xiaomi-mi-mix-liquid-lens-autofocus-focal-length-camera"&gt;previously teased&lt;/a&gt; last week, the new Mix is also the first phone to use liquid lens technology in its camera. Xiaomi says that it allows for a telephoto lens with a close focusing distance of 3cm and optical zoom of 3x, or 30x hybrid zoom. The rest of the camera system is comprised of a Samsung HMX 108-megapixel main sensor and a 13-megapixel ultrawide, which sounds like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;the same solid setup that’s on the Mi 11&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ejj5UQvBfcj0lHw62SyX6AsH_a8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407568/MIX_Fold__3_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The inner screen is an 8.01-inch 4:3 OLED panel with “2K+” resolution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7B1jVL"&gt;Xiaomi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/23/18194065/xiaomi-foldable-phone-tablet-device-teaser"&gt;first showed off a folding phone prototype&lt;/a&gt; more than two years ago, before Samsung shipped its first Galaxy Fold. That device had a double-folding design where a tablet-sized screen could be bent back on the left and right edges for a more phone-like experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ae1pI"&gt;Later that year, Xiaomi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/24/20881378/xiaomi-mi-mix-alpha-announced-wrap-around-screen"&gt;announced the Mi Mix Alpha&lt;/a&gt;, which had a wraparound screen that covered almost the whole phone, but it never made it to market. More recently Xiaomi unveiled its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267807/xiaomi-quad-curved-waterfall-display-concept-phone-announced"&gt;latest concept phone&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a “quad-curved waterfall display” that curved on all four sides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kyt1GQ"&gt;The Mi Mix Fold, on the other hand, is very much going on sale — people in China are able to preorder it as of today, and it’ll ship on April 16th. Prices start at 9,999 yuan (around $1,521) for a model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, going all the way up to 12,999 yuan (around $1,978) for a 16GB / 512GB ceramic special edition. There’s no word yet on a release outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 electric crossover will be Motional’s robotaxi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UTkDECddoeNKC0MHQFBhv-lolyc=/0x343:8272x5858/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047584/Large_45011_HyundaiIONIQ5RedefinesElectricMobilityLifestyle.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0tI9mp"&gt;Lyft and Motional have selected the Hyundai Ioniq 5 for their forthcoming autonomous ride-hailing service. Motional, which is a joint venture between Aptiv and Hyundai, said the Ioniq 5 was chosen because it represents a “convergence of mobility’s two most transformative technologies — electrification and autonomy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8LD1HV"&gt;Motional hasn’t said how many vehicles it would acquire, nor where it will eventually deploy them for its robotaxi service. The company is currently testing its fleet of Chrysler Pacifica minivans in Las Vegas, where it is also running an autonomous ride-hailing service with Lyft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxyfp9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"&gt;The Ioniq 5 was first unveiled by Hyundai last month&lt;/a&gt;, and won’t go on sale until later this year. Also, the vehicle won’t hit public roads as part of Motional’s fleet until after they’ve been retrofitted with the company’s hardware and sensor suite, and then put through a months-long testing regime on both public roads and a private, closed testing course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rpe58S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a convergence of mobility’s two most transformative technologies — electrification and autonomy”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="57iiSY"&gt;The Ioniq 5 is said to have nearly 300 miles of range on a single charge and a two-way charging feature that Hyundai calls “vehicle-to-load,” which can supply up to 3.6kW of power. It will also be built on Hyundai’s new Electric-Global Modular Platform (E-GMP) that the automaker says will serve as the basis for an entire family of planned EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOj8yy"&gt;Motional is the latest AV company to commit to an electric vehicle as its primary platform. Cruise, a majority owned subsidiary of General Motors, uses Chevy Bolts exclusively.  Alphabet’s Waymo uses gas-powered Chrysler Pacificas while also phasing in a next-gen fleet of electric Jaguar I-Paces. Other companies, like Zoox, Nuro, and Aurora, have said they would use electric vehicles as part of their respective commercial services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnSMyi"&gt;Motional as a joint venture was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hyundai-motor-autonomous-aptiv/hyundai-motor-group-aptiv-to-set-up-4-billion-self-driving-car-venture-idUSKBN1W80WP"&gt;first announced in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, when Hyundai said it would spend $1.6 billion to catch up to its rivals in the autonomous vehicle space. Aptiv, a technology company formerly known as Delphi, owns 50 percent of the venture. The company currently has facilities in Las Vegas, Singapore, and Seoul, and has also tested its vehicles in Boston and Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDMqaU"&gt;Motional’s engineers were responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12637822/self-driving-taxi-first-public-trial-singapore-nutonomy"&gt;the world’s first robotaxi pilot in Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the first cross-country &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/driverless-car-road-trip-san-francisco-new-york-city/568939/"&gt;New York to San Francisco autonomous trip&lt;/a&gt;. Over the last two years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17718018/lyft-aptiv-self-driving-cars-las-vegas-5000-trips"&gt;Aptiv’s fleet of safety driver-monitored autonomous taxis in Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; (in partnership with Lyft) have completed over 100,000 trips. And the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22291682/motional-fully-driverless-autonomous-cars-las-vegas"&gt;recently tested its vehicles&lt;/a&gt; with a monitor in the passenger seat but without one behind the steering wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FhqcD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bang &amp; Olufsen’s luxurious gaming headset costs as much as an Xbox Series X</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bang &amp;amp;amp; Olufsen Beoplay Portal" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/acgpSV4m_zULPDxrXQXbu6mVG48=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047505/beoplayportallede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QAR3My"&gt;Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen has announced Beoplay Portal, its first wireless gaming headset. The product maintains the company’s signature sophisticated look, and it has more features than your average headset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3JDVa"&gt;These were created with the Xbox ecosystem in mind, and with a push of its pairing button, they can connect to the Series X, Series S, Xbox One, or to a PC that has the Xbox Wireless adapter plugged into it. Additionally, they support a concurrent connection via Bluetooth 5.1 for other devices (including other consoles if you supply the Bluetooth adapter). This way, you can take calls without totally detaching from game audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORMeYt"&gt;Similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439699/bose-quiet-comfort-35-ii-noise-canceling-gaming-headset-pc-bluetooth-price"&gt;Bose QC35 gaming headset&lt;/a&gt; that released last year, the Beoplay Portal look like high-end wireless headphones (and in many ways, act like them, too), and come with a high-end price. These cost $499 and are available now in the black colorway at Best Buy, the Microsoft Store, and through Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen’s site. Two other colors, gray and navy, will be available starting April 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bang &amp;amp;amp; Olufsen Beoplay Portal" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qR429XcvqlDxfxzG3BG5dhcmdB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22405333/beoplayportal2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Made for the contemplative gamer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n1P1U7"&gt;This model has adaptive active noise cancellation (ANC) and a gaming audio mode that automatically activates when connected wirelessly to a console or when wired via USB-C to a PC (the port through which the headset also gets its charge). These also have a 3.5mm headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yswrXO"&gt;The Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen app for iOS and Android has some new features that the Beoplay Portal benefits from, like microphone optimization and a game / chat audio balance. The company reports that its “Own Voice” feature allows for voice monitoring while keeping out extraneous noises thanks to its adaptive ANC. These have 40mm drivers with Dolby Atmos support for virtualized surround sound.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bang &amp;amp;amp; Olufsen app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ls5aLalLmWjg0sJOoAryrVnwOoA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22405509/beoplayportalapp.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A peek at the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen app’s controls for the Beoplay Portal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fcjrzL"&gt;Build quality is another area where Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen is trying to distinguish itself from other gaming headsets. The memory foam ear pads are wrapped in lambskin leather, and it uses bamboo fiber textile to cover the headband padding. Elsewhere, there are a few anodized aluminum details on the Portal, like the touch-sensitive discs on the outside of each ear cup that are used to control them. Impressively, the company says the headphones weigh 282 grams, which is lighter than the mostly plastic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;Xbox Wireless Headset&lt;/a&gt; that, until now, I considered to be lightweight at 312g. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDAUDA"&gt;This gaming headset can last up to 12 hours per charge when you’re connected through both Bluetooth and Xbox Wireless protocol, and using the active noise cancellation feature. If you’re just using Bluetooth and noise cancellation, Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen says you can expect up to 24 hours of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofcZ0D"&gt;Given the high asking price, I’m skeptical that these will be worth the cost for most people — especially those who intend to use them exclusively for gaming. It seems like a better value if you want to use them as your everyday headphones, too. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The gray colorway shown here won’t release until late April.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="b99dtL"&gt;I’m also skeptical about the “virtual boom arm” the Beoplay Portal employs instead of a traditional articulating boom mic. It says its beamforming microphones allow for “crystal clear” conversations, and help to amplify your voice while filtering out sounds in the background. This is something I’ll need to test to see if it’s as good as Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8bPjG"&gt;Do you need a $500 gaming headset? Probably not. While there are plenty of differences in terms of features and build quality, most people should be suited well by Microsoft’s $100 Xbox Wireless headset. But I’ll be reviewing these to see for myself what five times that amount can get you in a gaming peripheral.&lt;/p&gt;
