    <title>SpaceX wins approval for lower Starlink orbits, overcoming rival objections</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SxXhB5"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday granted SpaceX approval to operate 2,814 Starlink satellites in lower orbits than originally planned, handing a win to Elon Musk’s satellite internet project. The decision delivered a partial defeat over its competitors, like Amazon and OneWeb, which sought to thwart the tweak over concerns it would create harmful frequency interference and ramp up risks of satellite collisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RHbN2g"&gt;The FCC found that allowing lower orbits for Starlink satellites “does not create significant interference problems.” Lowering the orbits, it said, allows SpaceX to make “safety-focused” changes to the constellation, like being able to more quickly discard any dead or broken satellites by steering them toward a fiery end in Earth’s atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SGtiUM"&gt;The approval came with some conditions: SpaceX must coordinate with other operators to ensure signals from Starlink satellites don’t interfere with others. The company will need to provide semiannual reports to the FCC on Starlink failures. Those reports will also list any “conjunction events” or any maneuvers or close calls with other satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2jy9B"&gt;SpaceX’s Starlink network so far has over 1,300 satellites in orbit. The company plans to launch thousands more to provide global broadband internet to rural parts of the world, for governments and consumers alike. Amazon and OneWeb are also developing their own satellite internet networks. OneWeb has launched 182 of its planned 648 satellites. Amazon’s Kuiper network hasn’t launched any yet, but it won &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348768/fcc-amazon-kuiper-satellite-constellation-approval"&gt;FCC approval in 2020&lt;/a&gt; to launch 3,236 satellites, half of which must be in space by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9k101I"&gt;SpaceX &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/27/18519778/spacex-starlink-fcc-approval-satellite-internet-constellation-lower-orbit"&gt;won approval&lt;/a&gt; to operate its first group of 1,584 satellites in a lower-than-planned orbit in 2019. Almost all of those satellites are already in space, making the FCC’s decision on Tuesday timely for SpaceX’s next tranche of satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7DB0q"&gt;The FCC’s approval means that SpaceX can lower the altitude of its next 2,814 satellites from a previously planned altitude of around 1,150 km to around 550 km, the same orbital neighborhood as Amazon’s proposed constellation. The FCC said SpaceX’s modification application attracted “nearly 200 pleadings” from other organizations and “a significant number” presentations and additional letters, most of which pushed back SpaceX’s change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOgHMH"&gt;Those organizations included rivals Amazon and OneWeb, which sought to convince the FCC that SpaceX’s proposed altitude change would create signal interference with nearby satellites and increase risks of orbital collisions — especially as SpaceX’s autonomous collision avoidance system doesn’t tell other orbital operators which way a Starlink satellite will move to avoid a crash. Rivals also claimed the several proposed modifications to SpaceX’s original license, granted in 2018, should be treated as an entirely new constellation with a more rigorous approval process, an idea the FCC rejected in Tuesday’s ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ab3cG9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SpaceX’s rival, Amazon, says the decision “is a positive outcome”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jZ4AJC"&gt;In a statement, Amazon cast the FCC decision as a win, pointing to one of the FCC conditions of the modification that says SpaceX must “accept” any interference from Amazon’s Kuiper constellation in the future. The condition suggests SpaceX’s 2,814 satellites must work around Amazon’s constellation, instead of Amazon having to adjust its network to SpaceX’s modification — a prospect the company fought against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ck5iCz"&gt;“This is a positive outcome that places clear conditions on SpaceX, including requirements that it remain below 580 km and accept additional interference resulting from its redesign,” a company spokesman said. “These conditions address our primary concerns regarding space safety and interference, and we appreciate the Commission’s work to maintain a safe and competitive environment in low earth orbit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Jm3we"&gt;Amazon’s fight against the SpaceX modification &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251127/elon-musk-bezos-amazon-billionaires-satellites-space"&gt;tumbled out of the obscure FCC meetings and into the open&lt;/a&gt; in January, when Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354018055014260738?s=20"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; Bezos’ company of trying to “hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is at best several years away from operation.” Amazon shot back in a company statement, saying “it is SpaceX’s proposed changes that would hamstring competition among satellite systems” and that Musk’s company is trying “to smother competition in the cradle if they can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncv1M8"&gt;On SpaceX’s autonomous collision avoidance system, which the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374262/oneweb-spacex-satellites-dodged-potential-collision-orbit-space-force"&gt;temporarily disabled this month to coordinate a collision-avoidance maneuver&lt;/a&gt; with a OneWeb satellite, the FCC said none of the companies “raise specific or particularized concerns that warrant additional inquiry at this time.” Questions about SpaceX’s automated system, the FCC said, “could be addressed through good faith coordination among the operators”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4b7DJ"&gt;Moving Starlink satellites to lower altitudes is a plus for astronomers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/29/18642577/spacex-starlink-satellite-constellation-astronomy-light-pollution"&gt;who for years have complained that SpaceX’s satellites reflect sunlight&lt;/a&gt; during ground-based nighttime observations and stain images of the cosmos with obtrusive streaks of light as they pass by in orbit. Lowering the satellites’ altitude puts them further into Earth’s shadow from the Sun. And combined with other efforts to reduce their reflectivity, operating the satellites in lower altitudes helps mitigate their impacts on visual astronomy, the American Astronomical Society was cited as saying in the FCC filing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Go Fest is back this July as a global event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KNf92PjhiT2Bf076B3GdZyXX_4Q=/128x0:896x512/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194356/Ez_vg5sWEAQ5F9D.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y8aulW"&gt;The annual &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; Fest is back again this summer, scheduled for July 17th and 18th. Last year’s event was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272334/pokemon-go-fest-2020-online-niantic"&gt;held online&lt;/a&gt; due to the COVID-19 pandemic, instead of taking place in person in select cities around the globe. It sounds like this year’s fest will once again happen virtually; developer Niantic describes the event as a “global event.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6Rc4S"&gt;Niantic didn’t share many other details, though it did tease that this year’s event could be particularly noteworthy. “2021 marks both the twenty-fifth anniversary of Pokémon and the fifth anniversary of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, so trust us when we say you won’t want to miss &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; Fest 2021!” &lt;a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/pokemongofest2021-save-the-date"&gt;Niantic said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qxExJA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Time to mark your calendars, Trainers!  ️ &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonGOFest2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PokemonGOFest2021&lt;/a&gt; will be a two-day global event from July 17 to July 18!   We can’t wait to show you what’s in store. &lt;a href="https://t.co/L0fcETooMj"&gt;https://t.co/L0fcETooMj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/jljTUQBE1h"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jljTUQBE1h&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Pokémon GO (@PokemonGoApp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonGoApp/status/1387090560637456384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fF0EfE"&gt;Last year’s online-only &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; Fest was a huge success, with “a record number of millions of trainers” in 124 countries and regions catching nearly a billion pokémon in total, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344717/pokemon-go-fest-2020-stats-numbers-niantic"&gt;Niantic said&lt;/a&gt; after the 2020 fest. Niantic also said that players walked nearly 15 kilometers each on average.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer is slapping its logo on SSDs and RAM made by a company called Biwin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="ACER SSDs" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f8rPvxmrruF3QfW1nJ6rvC5lr00=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194328/acerbiwinssd.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starting with SSDs, but soon RAM sticks will be launched.&lt;/em&gt; | Acer / Biwin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HnsUTp"&gt;Acer announced &lt;a href="https://www.acerstorage.com/news-detail/biwin-to-offer-acer-branded-memory-and-personal-storage-products.html"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it’s getting into the flash storage and memory business with help from a Chinese manufacturer called Biwin. Acer’s brand will be slapped onto each of these SSDs, but it’ll be another company that’s responsible for building them. Even though you’ll see an Acer logo on this storage, &lt;a href="https://www.acerstorage.com/support/warranty-policy/"&gt;it’s Biwin that’ll handle the warranty&lt;/a&gt; for these products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFiBfR"&gt;Acer isn’t the only major company utilizing Biwin’s hardware. This storage and memory manufacturer also &lt;a href="https://hp.biwintech.com/products/"&gt;puts out HP-branded products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Portable-External-1F5P4AA-ABC/dp/B08DDJZP3N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;portable SSDs&lt;/a&gt;, NVMe SSDs, 2.5-inch SATA SSDs, and RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pa6eMw"&gt;The latest partnership aims to release Acer-branded products first in the US, China, Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and in the UK. Release dates and prices weren’t shared, but &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; contacted Biwin for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FX1SMw"&gt;Acer and Biwin are kicking things off with a 2.5-inch SATA SSD called the SA100 with up to a 1.92TB version available, which has up to a 560MB/s read speed. Its RE100 comes in a 2.5-inch form factor, or as an M.2 SATA SSD, and either will have configurations of up to 4TB, and its read and write speeds top out at 560MB/s and 520MB/s, respectively. Lastly, a much faster M.2 PCIe 3.0 NVMe SSD called the FA100 will come in capacities up to 2TB, with read and write speeds of up to 3,300MB/s and 2,700MB/s, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VghxzB"&gt;The partnership will also yield an assortment of laptop and desktop RAM, ranging in capacities from 4GB to 32GB per stick, with up to 3,600MHz in speed. All of these RAM products &lt;a href="https://www.acerstorage.com/products/i-3/"&gt;are listed as “coming soon” on Acer’s storage site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZTE is selling a $200 phone with wireless charging through Visible and Yahoo Mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sjp5VRooId_eTJ7urb12esvpm5Y=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194294/Blade_11_Prime_Front_Left.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZTE Blade 11 Prime features a 6.5-inch display and also supports wired reverse charging.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: ZTE&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cR9ydL"&gt;ZTE is offering a feature rarely seen in the budget class of phones: wireless charging. The Blade 11 Prime is on sale now in the US for $192 through Visible and Yahoo Mobile, two MVNOs that use Verizon’s network. It’s an otherwise fairly unremarkable budget device, with a 6.5-inch 720p display shipping with Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdOn9x"&gt;In addition to wireless charging, the Blade 11 Prime supports reverse wired charging to provide some power to other devices in a pinch. However, the phone’s 4,000mAh battery is on the smaller side, so the feature is probably best reserved for emergencies. The 11 Prime uses a MediaTek 6762 chipset with 4GB of RAM and offers 64GB of built-in storage. It features 16-megapixel standard and 8-megapixel wide rear-facing cameras, plus an 8-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t200QA9ZovjDyprLI6twl9ojvXY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22473490/Blade_11_Prime_Back.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: ZTE&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 11 Prime includes a 16-megapixel main camera in its rear triple-cam array.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DUlctz"&gt;There’s not a lot to get excited about here outside of wireless charging, but it is a nice feature to have available as an option in the budget class. More than a few phones around $200, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"&gt;OnePlus Nord N100&lt;/a&gt;, offer huge battery capacity as a differentiating feature, but the option to use a wireless charger that’s likely compatible with other gadgets you already own is another handy proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Congress is way behind on algorithmic misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Judiciary Committee Holds Hearing Examining Voting Rights" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q6-nMN9tpoLgAAxOKT_-rWTmT3g=/0x96:7675x5213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69194232/1232421321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Evelyn Hockstein-Pool / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HwVi0T"&gt;One of the scariest concerns about social media is the idea of algorithmic misinformation — that the recommendation systems built into platforms like Facebook and YouTube could be quietly elevating the most harmful and disruptive content on the network. But at a Senate hearing Tuesday titled “Algorithms and Amplification: How Social Media Platforms’ Design Choices Shape our Discourse and Our Minds,’’ lawmakers didn’t appear any closer to finding a solution for the violence platforms like Facebook have &lt;a href="https://t.co/6tvhkqG8hA?amp=1"&gt;internally recognized&lt;/a&gt; they cause in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTx8iL"&gt;At the top, Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) said “there’s nothing inherently wrong” with how the testifying companies, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, leverage algorithms to keep users engaged on their platforms. He said the committee wasn’t weighing any actual legislation and that the hearing was set to serve as a listening session between the lawmakers and the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Aksd9s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The biggest problem facing our nation is misinformation-at-scale.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k7ZkH2"&gt;It’s a major contrast from more focused issues like Facebook’s acquisition practices or Apple’s App Store fees, which have seen immediate action from courts and regulators often set off by congressional fact-findings. But the algorithm issue is thornier and harder to address — and increasingly, there doesn’t seem to be much appetite from lawmakers to take it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mdpog"&gt;Congress’ slow walk was particularly notable compared with the expert panelists, who presented algorithmic disinformation as an existential threat to our system of government. “The biggest problem facing our nation is misinformation-at-scale,” Joan Donovan, research director at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, said Tuesday. “The cost of doing nothing is democracy’s end.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdgpWt"&gt;Donovan expressed frustration about the hearing on Twitter afterward, saying lawmakers should have pressed the platforms for more information about the specific mechanisms used to rank content. “The companies should have been answering questions about how they determine what content to distribute and what criteria is used to moderate,” Donovan said. “We could have also gone deeper into the role that political advertising and source hacking plays on our democracy, or the need for curatorial models for information integrity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbvJHc"&gt;Still, the overall impression was that the federal government’s approach to algorithms hasn’t developed much since 2016, and it doesn’t seem likely to move faster anytime soon. “We are still talking about conversations that we’ve had four years ago about spread of misinformation,” said Tristan Harris, co-founder and president of the Center for Humane Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="179cdJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IT MEANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pOoJJp"&gt;Congress first started hearing these arguments on how algorithms amplify extremist content following the 2016 presidential election and the rise of the Trump-wing of the Republican Party. Over the last few years, lawmakers have held hearings. They’ve sent letters. But unlike the testy exchanges and deluge of bills we’ve seen around antitrust and content moderation, they’ve steered clear of regulating algorithms, broadly opting to politely nudge these companies in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTwGLy"&gt;It’s something the lawmaker chairing Tuesday’s hearing, Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), acknowledged &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2021/03/19/one-on-one-with-biden-ally-and-tech-leader-chris-coons-794105"&gt;in an interview with &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;last month. Coons said, “Congress regulates the internet and social media rarely, and when it does, whatever it puts in statute often has ended up being stuck or set in place for years.” He continued, “And in an area where technology is moving fairly quickly, sometimes oversight hearings, letters [and] conversations with the leaders of major social media companies can result in those companies demonstrably changing their practices faster than we can legislate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="phSdv2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Congress regulates the internet and social media rarely”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j5SPEv"&gt;This theme was apparent throughout Tuesday’s hearing, and it’s unclear exactly how the committee may move forward on regulating social media algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PswbKI"&gt;The closest Congress has come in recent weeks is a bill introduced in the House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7MYX8"&gt;In March, Reps. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) and Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) reintroduced the “&lt;a href="https://malinowski.house.gov/media/press-releases/reps-malinowski-and-eshoo-reintroduce-bill-hold-tech-platforms-accountable"&gt;Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act&lt;/a&gt;.” The bill would amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in a way that would remove liability immunity for a platform if its algorithm amplified content related to a civil rights violation. (&lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201026/16090345592/another-section-230-reform-bill-dangerous-algorithms-bill-threatens-speech.shtml"&gt;Critics argue it may do more harm than good&lt;/a&gt;.) While the bill has garnered some partisan support in the House following the Capitol riot, the Senate hasn’t taken it up or offered its own solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x0G1vr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT’S NEXT? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MMIpiJ"&gt;Most likely, more talking. “I’m encouraged to see that these are topics that are broadly of interest and where I believe there could be a broadly bipartisan solution,” Coons said at Tuesday’s hearing. “But I also am conscious of the fact that we don’t want to needlessly constrain some of the most innovative, fastest growing businesses in the West. Striking that balance is going to require more conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft brings Office and OneNote apps to Amazon’s Fire tablets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6n8zy-ESVBoKF8qJawYR251G694=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69193974/Fire_HD_10_Plus_Lifestyle_Productivity_Bundle.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ddn8mz"&gt;Microsoft is launching its Office and OneNote apps on Amazon’s Fire tablets today. Both apps are available in Amazon’s Appstore, with the Office app combining Word, Excel, and PowerPoint into a single tablet app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46lUFG"&gt;Microsoft is no stranger to Amazon’s Appstore, having previously published apps like Outlook, Xbox, and Xbox Game Pass for Fire tablets. This is the first time Office has appeared on Amazon’s tablets, though. Microsoft has essentially taken its Android Office app that’s already available on the Google Play Store and modified it to work on Amazon’s Fire OS — a forked version of Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1zK1qU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s new Fire HD 10 tablet has slimmer bezels and better specs ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405230/amazon-fire-hd-10-2021-announced-kids-pro"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FPmAeY"&gt;Both the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08WC1B9D2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Office&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VVX1QLD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OneNote&lt;/a&gt; apps will be available on Amazon’s Appstore in regions where Fire tablets are currently sold. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F27%2Fmicrosoft-365-apps-now-available-for-amazon-fire-tablets%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft says&lt;/a&gt; it has timed the release of these apps to coincide with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405230/amazon-fire-hd-10-2021-announced-kids-pro"&gt;Amazon’s new Fire HD 10 tablet&lt;/a&gt;. The $149.99 Fire HD 10 has a thinner design, slimmed-down bezels, and better specs, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XMBMW3H?ref=ods_tab_dpcc_rvws_trnaprd_rc_nd_ucc&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is also offering a $219 b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/firetablets"&gt;undle&lt;/a&gt; with a 12-month subscription to Microsoft 365 in the US, Canada, UK, Germany, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People who are vaccinated don’t need to wear masks during many outdoor activities, CDC says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="People pose for a photo after being vaccinated at the FEMA-..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qiabB8gW3P02u-lenhI_E82aAPs=/0x190:4200x2990/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69193810/1232533336.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eDZKag"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/participate-in-activities.html"&gt;new guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for people who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, outlining the situations where vaccinated people can stop wearing masks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfHs43"&gt;People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after the second dose of the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, and two weeks after the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8VAK2"&gt;The guidelines, announced today by CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, give fully vaccinated people more leeway to return to normal activities — recognizing how effective the vaccines are at preventing disease. But they’re complicated, and they ask people to keep track of different mask guidelines for a wide range of situations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5C1Mt"&gt;“I am optimistic that people will use this information to take personal responsibility to protect themselves and to protect others,” Walensky said during a press briefing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CpgDZk"&gt;The CDC says that people who are fully vaccinated can stop wearing masks when they’re indoors with other vaccinated people, or with unvaccinated people they don’t live with who are low risk for a severe case of COVID-19. They don’t need masks when exercising alone outside, or when gathering outside with both vaccinated and unvaccinated people. But they should keep wearing masks at crowded, outdoor events like a sports game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RFmeUWWB_q9Utflps7iCzoQC0JE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22473357/Screen_Shot_2021_04_27_at_12.50.39_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dVWOE7"&gt;People who are fully vaccinated should still wear masks during most &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22384169/face-masks-covid-19-vaccine-outdoors-mandates-indoors-kids"&gt;indoor activities&lt;/a&gt;, like shopping or getting a haircut. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319514/vaccinated-people-vaccines-cdc-mask-coronavirus-social-guidelines"&gt;Early guidance&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC cleared people who are fully vaccinated to spend time indoors, unmasked, with other vaccinated people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXUBix"&gt;“This is complicated, but complexity is the price for allowing people to go without masks early,” said epidemiologist George Rutherford of the University of California, San Francisco, told &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News&lt;/em&gt;. “If you want simple rules, then we just wear masks until every last one of us is vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmum7z"&gt;Nearly 40 percent of adults in the United States are fully vaccinated. More and more data shows that the vaccines are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358085/covid-vaccines-effective-real-world-infection-protection-cdc"&gt;overwhelmingly effective&lt;/a&gt; at protecting people from COVID-19, and that people who are vaccinated are very unlikely to catch the virus and pass it to someone else. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Secretlab’s first PC desk keeps your cables under control with the help of magnets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lp4-uBdWiftQr8dyULGTVQLe9Vg=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69193704/Secretlab_MAGNUS_main.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secretlab’s Magnus Metal Desk.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Secretlab&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MUSxhG"&gt;Secretlab, which you may know for its gaming chairs, is announcing its first-ever PC desk — the Magnus Metal Desk — and the company has a smart solution to help you manage your cables: you’ll be able to attach magnetic cable-management accessories right onto the desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvzHF5"&gt;The company will offer proprietary accessories like magnetic cable holders to keep your phone’s charging cable from slipping off your desk and a magnetic cable sheath that can be attached to one of the desk’s legs. The desk has a cable tray in the back you can use to store cables as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkoYz6"&gt;The Magnus desk doesn’t just use magnets to help hide cables, though — Secretlab is also making a desk mat that attaches magnetically so it will stay in place while you’re gaming or working. The company calls it the Magpad Desk Mat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V7a8uEWaOJjzI3HkINcDpDP0tbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22473287/Secretlab_MAGNUS_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Secretlab&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Magnus’ magnetic cable holders and the cable tray.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOoUuS"&gt;And if you want to add a little color to your desk space, Secretlab is also offering a magnetic RGB lighting strip that connects near the back of the desk. You can see it reflecting off the back of the desk in the photo above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGyiwr"&gt;The Magnus desk is 29 inches tall, but you can also manually raise the desk up as much as 0.8 inches higher to help make it the right height for you. But that still means this won’t offer as much height flexibility as a desk that can swap between sitting and standing positions. The desk will also be offered in two lengths: 59 inches, which is available now, and a smaller 47-inch model, which will be available “later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hzz9ys"&gt;The desk itself starts at $449, and it will be available in the US, EU, and Singapore at launch. The magnetic accessories will cost extra.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford takes its first step toward producing its own electric car batteries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ee_7gQMUaXLUBt6ePSpJtfX501s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69193185/acastro_200406_1777_ford_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j4ZMtl"&gt;Ford announced the launch of a new battery development center in Michigan, the first step toward taking on some of the burden of building its own battery cells for electric cars in-house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqM5m0"&gt;The new “global battery center of excellence” will be called Ford Ion Park and will be based in Southeast Michigan. Ford said the purpose is to conduct research on how to go about making its own electric vehicle batteries. A team of 150 experts will work on ways to build EV batteries that are long lasting, quick to charge, and sustainable for the environment. They will also develop a process for making batteries quickly, cheaply, and at scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4j1Xvb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There will be “lab scale and pilot scale” battery assembly at the new center&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1SS5od"&gt;But Ford Ion Park, which will open late next year, will not house any actual battery manufacturing at scale. There will be “lab scale and pilot scale” battery assembly at the new center, said Anand Sankaran, the center’s new director, but the automaker will have to build a new factory to build EV batteries at scale. Ford would not provide a timeline as to when it anticipates launching its own battery cell production line, nor whether it would build a new factory to house battery manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LqTCbcG9mC93TUGC_1mOwExamN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22473107/BatteryFacility_AllenPark_11.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eSG66O"&gt;“It’s really for us to develop that expertise and competency in house and give us that flexibility in the future,” said Hau Thai-Tang, Ford’s chief platform and operations officer. “So stay tuned.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="di2vGB"&gt;Ford, which is still in the early stages of its transition to electric vehicles, has said it plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22267195/ford-electric-autonomous-investment-29-billion"&gt;spend $22 billion on the shift&lt;/a&gt;, including $7 billion on autonomous vehicles, through 2025. The majority of vehicles it plans on producing will be battery-electric vehicles, but the company also has hybrid and plug-in hybrid models with traditional internal combustion engines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8gFQl"&gt;Ford just started delivering its first long-range EV, the Mustang Mach-E, despite some initial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373903/mustang-mach-e-deep-sleep-12v-battery-jump-start"&gt;hiccups with software updates&lt;/a&gt;. It also introduced an all-electric Transit van last year and plans on unveiling an electric version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21288000/ford-electric-f-150-2022-sale-launch-jim-farley"&gt;bestselling F-150 pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2YYddn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a more financially risky move with potentially lucrative rewards&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bCUbE1"&gt;It’s a more financially risky move with potentially lucrative rewards in the future if Ford can successfully supplement production from its own suppliers. Ford currently sources its batteries from South Korea’s SK Innovation, which recently lost a trade secret dispute with rival LG Chem that could hinder its imports to the US. (The companies &lt;a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/ford-vw-battery-supplier-sk-innovation-said-to-reach-deal-to-avoid-import-ban-11618073730550.html"&gt;recently reached an agreement&lt;/a&gt; that could to avert a possible import ban.) By making its own batteries, Ford can avoid some of the conflicts that arise from sourcing batteries overseas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZVUl0"&gt;Despite these plans, Ford will have to move more aggressively if it hopes to catch up to its competitors like Tesla, Volkswagen, and General Motors. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387129/gm-lg-tennessee-ultium-battery-factory-spring-hill"&gt;GM is building two battery factories&lt;/a&gt; in the US with its partner LG Chem, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;VW recently unveiled its own plan&lt;/a&gt; to have six “gigafactories” in Europe by 2030. Tesla, meanwhile, is in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451469/tesla-battery-day-news-announcement-elon-musk-updates-highlights"&gt;early stages of making its own “tabless” battery cells in-house&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="065gE9"&gt;As recently as last July, then-CEO Jim Hackett said there was “no advantage” to Ford making its own battery cells. But Jim Farley, who replaced Hackett in October, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN27T26B"&gt;took the opposite stance&lt;/a&gt;, describing the manufacturing of batteries in-house as a “natural” step as EV volumes grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQV3B5"&gt;According to Thai-Tang, the new center is a signal of how serious Ford is about building its business around the manufacturing and selling of electric vehicles. “We’re much more bullish and aggressive on how fast we think this transition is going to play out,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrtkS5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
