    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJnRvD"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. Both the AirPods and AirPods Pro are compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which isn’t always the case with even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best true wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;. The AirPods Max, the latest pair of headphones to join the AirPods lineup, are just as dependable, albeit at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Luckily, many of the most popular models routinely undergo a price cut. There are often sizable discounts on the base model as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best AirPods deals available, including those on the AirPods AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. We’ll also include options for the AirPods model with the wireless charging case, if that’s something you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2RS0YX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;The AirPods are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. They usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted. Right now, for instance, you can find Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods for $119 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746200082884103876" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with a wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature, but, thankfully, chargers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-PowerWave-Upgraded-Fast-Charging/dp/B07THHQMHM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt; are now relatively cheap. If you have no use for wireless charging, however, we recommend opting for the base AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but be on the lookout for deals that bring the price down to $150 or below. Right now, you can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1081859/9383?subId1=VergeAppleAirPodsDeals061021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021%3Firgwc%3D1&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the models above, offer noise cancellation, and support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, a feature Apple recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rolled out to Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;. We think they’re the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy, regardless of the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ci8unb"&gt;Thankfully, the AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their asking price of $249, and sometimes drop to $200 or lower. The lowest price you can grab a pair for right now is $179 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1081859/9383?subId1=VergeAppleAirPodDeals061021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Other retailers, specifically &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/oendKE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, are currently selling the AirPods Pro for just shy of $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdTSzD"&gt;If you want to get an Apple Care Plus protection plan for your wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1570785-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is also selling a bundle that includes both for $278&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, wrapped in aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max haven’t historically seen large price drops — they only made their debut in December, after all — their price has been steadily falling in recent weeks, leaving them at an all-time low. Currently, all colorways of the AirPods Max are available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746203302394629120#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $473 and $480, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Loki: the latest news and reviews for the Marvel show on Disney Plus</title>

  &lt;p&gt;Stay up to date with the trickster god&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="1EeiuH"&gt;Disney Plus is quickly becoming an integral part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Through shows like &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;, the streaming service has been able to tell longer-form stories outside of the blockbuster superhero movies. The latest such show is &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;, which sees Tom Hiddleston reprise his role as the trickster god in a time-traveling sci-fi whodunnit. Here you’ll find the latest news about the show as well as analyses, cast interviews, and even the occasional gadget review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Loki’s first season is the best of Marvel without the baggage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Loki" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iynj59QotFzx1NoARqoYTErCU84=/714x0:3126x1608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581989/1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The most standalone MCU series yet&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="AooWlt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fen-gb%2Fseries%2Floki%2F6pARMvILBGzF&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;did something remarkable: it made me forget about the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzgBhh"&gt;That’s not how it’s supposed to work. The entire conceit of the MCU is that every story, whether it’s a blockbuster movie or a streaming television show, is in service to the greater narrative arc. You’re not just watching what’s happening to the characters on-screen, but also hints of what comes next. &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t get away from that entirely, particularly with its conclusion that sets up the universe’s next big villain. But like the variants who inhabit &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;’s world outside of time, the six-episode first season carves out its own timeline — a few of them, in fact — making it perhaps the most standalone part of the MCU to date. You can enjoy it as part of the all-encompassing cinematic universe or as what it truly is: an excellent piece of science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="386OYP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s first season ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XTYBa"&gt;The show doesn’t seem that standalone at first. It opens with a scene from &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt; when Loki (Tom Hiddleston) makes off with a powerful device known as the Tesseract. From here, the story diverges from what we’ve seen in the MCU. Loki is apprehended by the Time Variance Authority (TVA), which is sort of like a time-traveling FBI with one specific purpose: to protect the “sacred timeline.” From the TVA, Loki learns that he’s a variant, which is a fancy word for someone who deviates from the timeline set out by a mysterious trio called the Time Keepers, who control the flow of time and created the TVA in order to maintain its purity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="loki" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i-Q9PtGFeK-yWGlBUEAgDZd1lLo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717364/2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CI45uj"&gt;Typically, variants are pruned, a nice way of saying they’re killed in order to protect that timeline from diverging from the plan. But the TVA has other ideas for Loki. Another variant has been terrorizing the TVA, appearing at multiple periods throughout time and space in order to kill their agents. This variant also happens to be another Loki — making our Loki the perfect man to track them down. It’s a lot to keep track of. There are parallel worlds and multiple timelines, not to mention the fact that this is a show starring the least-reliable narrator in the Marvel universe. The mystery of the TVA steadily grows over the course of the show; it seems like everyone knows either a lot less or a lot more than they’re letting on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LhRhNv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"TVA TemPad review: who needs TikTok when you can control time and space?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22576224/tva-tempad-review-loki-season-1-review-marvel-timedoor"},{"title":"How Loki built a different reality with retro hardware","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574400/loki-retro-hardware-tempad-kasra-farahani-interview-marvel-disney-plus"},{"title":"Loki director Kate Herron says the show is a ‘big love letter to sci-fi’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22525909/loki-director-kate-herron-interview"},{"title":"We spoke to Tom Hiddleston about Loki, PowerPoint presentations, and the nature of free will","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22524176/tom-hiddleston-interview-loki-disney-plus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RIDWMn"&gt;Within this framework, the show jumps across genres, starting out a bit like a buddy cop series. After Loki is processed through the TVA’s charmingly banal bureaucracy, he forms an uneasy alliance with agent Mobius (Owen Wilson) in order to track down the killer variant. From there, &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; heads into more explicit sci-fi territory; one episode takes place on a dying moon that’s about to be crushed by a planet, while another is set in a void at the end of time that seems to be populated entirely by alternate versions of Loki. Things move with an incredible sense of momentum. Hiddleston’s Loki is constantly on the run, eventually switching allegiances to work with the variant he was meant to capture — who calls herself Sylvie (Sophia Di Martino) — as the two decide to take down the TVA together. Once the TVA and its many confusing rules are established, this relationship between two Lokis, which starts out antagonistic before becoming more intimate, forms the thrust of the show. There are a few pacing issues, like a third episode that ends on a frustrating cliffhanger and a monologue-filled finale, but for the most part, &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;moves along at a satisfyingly brisk rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzTEL3"&gt;The show touches on a lot of lofty themes, like the idea of parallel worlds and whether free will can even exist in a multiverse. But grounding it all is Hiddleston’s take on Loki. This is the deepest, most intimate look we’ve had at the character so far, despite six film cameos spanning a decade. Here, he’s given a chance to grow across nearly six hours of screen time. Growth isn’t something typically associated with Loki. He’s a compulsive liar and a narcissist, someone so single-mindedly focused on himself that nothing else seems to matter. But in the show, that changes — in the most Loki way possible. He literally falls in love with himself. It sounds strange, but one of the most important arcs in the show is the budding romance between Loki and Sylvie, two versions of the same being. But &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; Loki would finally find love in a variant of himself. But &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; someone with such a violently self-hating streak would only find real self-actualization in a romance... with himself. He grows over the course of the show, but he’s still Loki after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="loki" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rXTWGjttyCKc2uvfxKChU8GNdCM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717368/3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tTmXKM"&gt;The story of love, betrayal, and self-determination is buoyed by an excellent cast. Hiddleston adds a depth to Loki that we haven’t seen yet — he slowly peels back the trickster persona to reveal who he is when not causing trouble — and he has a magnetic chemistry with both Wilson and Di Martino; the former is full of playful banter, the latter a mix of tender moments and fierce battles. There’s also an alarmingly straightforward bureaucrat (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), an off-kilter man behind the curtain who makes eating an apple look menacing (Jonathan Majors), a tough-but-conflicted TVA hunter (Wunmi Mosaku), and even a suspiciously friendly Siri-like character called Miss Minutes (Tara Strong) to round things out. Everyone just seems like they’re having a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aza6nv"&gt;It’s also incredibly charming — not only the excellent cast, but the universe and aesthetic, from the 1970s-style retro-futurism to gorgeous alien worlds that look like a Roger Dean painting come to life. Things get pretty weird, like when you meet a whole gang of Lokis, including an alligator and a Loki who actually managed to survive to old age (played by a Richard E. Grant who looks like he’s having the time of his life). &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;is a mashup of sci-fi influences — you can see everything from &lt;em&gt;Brazil&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; — that, while not entirely unique, at least feels distinct from the rest of the MCU. It’s playful and heartfelt in equal measure, and it all looks really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQSTIe"&gt;This idea of isolating from the rest of the Marvel universe isn’t completely new. It’s part of what made &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;so appealing — at least at first. The otherness of the show’s sitcom-inspired world was refreshing. But steadily, more MCU-like elements crept into Wanda’s fantasy, until the show felt like what it truly was: a continuation of the Avengers storyline. &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; is much more of its own thing. There are references to characters and plots, of course, but they feel secondary. And even when the show does reveal its bigger purpose within the machinations of the MCU (it introduces Majors’ character, Kang the Conqueror, who is set to appear in &lt;em&gt;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&lt;/em&gt; a few years from now), it doesn’t pull you out of the story. If you’re not up on Marvel lore, you probably won’t even realize what’s happening. Rather it feels like a natural setup for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576741/loki-season-2-confirmed"&gt;the now-confirmed season 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Xw2sWp"&gt;In fact, if you’re somehow new to this whole Marvel thing, I’d recommend &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; as the place to start. It’s the best of what the superhero genre has to offer without all of the homework.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is shutting down Fleets, its expiring tweets feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l6YRRBMwlBs1F50JZksldDXUiYw=/61x5:985x621/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581782/fleet_blog_1.jpg.twimg.1920.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter just rolled out Fleets to everyone in November. | Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XZ5Fv8"&gt;Say goodbye to Fleets, the row of fullscreen tweets at the top of the Twitter timeline that expire after 24 hours. The ephemeral tweet format is shutting down due to low usage after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570368/twitter-fleets-disapeating-tweets-stories-launch-available-now"&gt;launching widely just eight months ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQE7QK"&gt;Starting on August 3rd, users will instead just see active Spaces — Twitter’s live audio chat rooms — at the top of their timelines. And the composer for traditional tweets will be updated with more camera editing features from Fleets, like text-formatting and GIF stickers over photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yimr8Q"&gt;Twitter’s decision to axe Fleets is not just an admission that the feature didn’t work, but that the company still hasn’t figured out how to get people tweeting more. For years, Twitter has struggled to get new users to post regularly and not just consume other people’s tweets. Fleets was its shot at using Stories, the popular social media format invented by Snapchat and further popularized by Instagram, to lower the pressure around tweeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUiu6Y"&gt;“We hoped Fleets would help more people feel comfortable joining the conversation on Twitter,” Ilya Brown, Twitter’s vice president of product, said in a statement. “But, in the time since we introduced Fleets to everyone, we haven’t seen an increase in the number of new people joining the conversation with Fleets like we hoped.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYqk9Z"&gt;Killing the feature now is especially sudden since Twitter just rolled it out to everyone in November and started testing ads between fleets last month. At the time, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22461070/twitter-fleets-stories-ads-monetize-instagram-snap"&gt;called the ads an “experiment”&lt;/a&gt; with a handful of advertisers. It’s unclear if those fullscreen ads will show up in other parts of the app in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qfCzKS"&gt;“If we’re not evolving our approach and winding down features every once in a while – we’re not taking big enough chances,” Brown said. “We’ll continue to build new ways to participate in conversations, listening to feedback and changing direction when there may be a better way to serve people using Twitter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qt7gPC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mamzyT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will pay $1 billion to creators through 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZXy_7yGeouhYRdwEpv7HNsLdm9E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581698/acasto_180123_1777_0003_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vLKxvE"&gt;Facebook plans to pay out &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/investing-1-billion-dollars-in-creators/"&gt;$1 billion to creators&lt;/a&gt; over the next year and a half as part of an effort to court content makers to its many services. The money will be awarded to creators who use Facebook products in different ways: on Facebook, creators can get a cash bonus for running ads on their videos or reaching certain tipping milestones during livestreams; on Instagram, creators can get paid for enabling ads on their IGTV videos, getting tipped in livestreams, or creating popular videos on Reels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6woKzB"&gt;The money is available to creators on an invitation-only basis for now, and new options for making money will be announced later. Facebook indicated it would expand availability to more creators later in the year, launching a “dedicated place for bonuses within the Instagram app this summer and in the Facebook app this autumn.” The initiative is meant to make Facebook “the best platforms for millions of creators to make a living,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote today. The money will be disbursed by the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lsAcGDNDj1x0f_NEV6WmOdGSAoI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717442/Stars_Assets_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook displays a “Stars Challenge” offering a cash bonus for receiving paid virtual tips during a livestream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gilZyV"&gt;It’s an aggressive move from Facebook after years of other companies &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/12/technology/facebook-creators-tiktok-youtube.html"&gt;building more compelling locations&lt;/a&gt; for creators to build a platform and a business. More recently, apps like TikTok and Snapchat have offered to pay creators outright for posting successful videos to their platform. Snapchat paid out $1 million per day for a period of time to bolster its TikTok competitor, Spotlight. Facebook already offers some ways for creators to get paid, but the options differ across services. And some features, like Reels, may not pay out to creators at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOskXN"&gt;Facebook’s approach is more confusing than other companies, framing the money as a “bonus” for completing various activities and goals, rather than focusing on a single product. But the intention seems to be investing cash to juice the company’s many different services all at once, helping them stand out as the apps start to see new competition from companies like TikTok and Clubhouse. Last month, Facebook announced that it wouldn’t take a cut from creators making money with a number of its services until 2023, in another attempt to make the network more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dmky5K"&gt;The company appears to be serious about turning creators into a new source of revenue. With ad issues elsewhere on the platform, direct tipping and payments can offer the company a backup if they grow to a big enough scale — though there’s certainly a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 Beta 3 has a wild new way to handle auto-rotation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Android 12 " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e9G7mUHvR5zLXrFDfxtok0cbrYo=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581623/VRG_1777_Android_12_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yjww9f"&gt;Google is releasing the latest beta for Android 12 right on schedule. Beta 3 for Android 12 continues adding features, including scrolling screenshots, faster on-device universal search for apps, improved auto-rotate, and more. Google says this version of Android 12 has the “Android 12 APIs and the official SDK,” which means there shouldn’t be major feature changes in the upcoming betas. That should mean Android 12 is still on track for a fall release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQ2qkg"&gt;The most interesting new feature in Android 12 Beta 3 is “better, faster auto-rotate.” Google is now using the front-facing camera and face detection to determine what orientation you’re trying to hold the phone (instead of just depending on the accelerometer). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHffI1"&gt;“This is especially helpful for people who are using their devices while lying down on a couch or in bed,” writes Dave Burke, VP of engineering for Android. That means you could be lying on your side in bed with the phone in a horizontal position but because the camera can see your face is also horizontal, it will stay in portrait mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="94AWrq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Android will be the best OS for people who don’t want to get out of bed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2BM6XQ"&gt;Burke is quick to emphasize that this face detection happens locally in Android 12’s “&lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/our-work-keep-you-safe/"&gt;Private Compute Core&lt;/a&gt;, so images are never stored or sent off the device.” When I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;first previewed Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, I had to spend a bit of time explaining what the Android Private Compute Core (APCC) is: a special and secure area of the operating system for running algorithms that might contain sensitive data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIXpf0"&gt;The APCC’s prominence in the original announcement was a clear hint that Google intended to create more Android features that might potentially raise privacy concerns — and here we are, seeing that hint become reality. As I wrote then, “an easier way to think of it is if there’s an AI function you might think is creepy, Google is running it inside the APCC so its powers are limited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1gueX"&gt;Burke says Google has also “optimized the animation and redrawing and added an ML-driven gesture-detection algorithm.” He claims that will reduce auto-rotate latency by 25 percent. Auto-rotate on Android has historically been fairly janky — and wildly inconsistent across different manufacturers — so hopefully these claims will be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvI8oU"&gt;The auto-rotate wizardry is cool, but the feature that will probably elicit the most cheers from Android users is a consistent, system-level way to create scrolling screenshots — aka screenshots that let you grab more than one screen in a single image like on a webpage. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="How scrolling screenshots work in Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eLUIP0pmt056-IAaYj0BQ1kmgyU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22715942/scrolling_screenshots.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How scrolling screenshots work in Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JDmM9E"&gt;Android 12 has new toggles that let you turn off the camera or microphone at a system level. With Beta 3, now the enterprise administrator in charge of your business (or government) phone will be able to control those toggles, locking you out of access to them if that’s appropriate for your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6kXiA"&gt;Google is also pushing developers to use &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/appsearch/package-summary"&gt;a new AppSearch on-device search engine&lt;/a&gt; both within their apps and across the entire phone. Developers will be able to pick and choose what parts of their apps get indexed for universal search across the device or within other apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MjWcQL"&gt;Google also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573033/google-android-12-games-download-dashboard-developer-summit"&gt;recently announced that Android 12&lt;/a&gt; will allow users to begin playing games before they’ve finished downloading. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525023/android-12-beta-2-wifi-privacy-location-microphone-camera"&gt;as with Beta 2&lt;/a&gt;, there may be some smaller, unannounced tweaks yet to be uncovered. Beta 3 should be rolling out to Pixel phones today, alongside a &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/devices"&gt;small handful of devices&lt;/a&gt; from Oppo, Realme, Sharp, OnePlus, and others (but not Samsung, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ueW2oE"&gt;As for the final release of Android 12, it will arrive on Pixel phones first but may also hit some of those manufacturers early on. Google has been improving its release cadence for Android updates — but it is still never going to match the speed you see on iOS. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse launches its DM feature Backchannel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cicv7c0XMBuxRGTkPL8GOpkbo6k=/1x0:4516x3010/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581629/clubhousebackchannel.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Backchannel, Clubhouse’s messaging feature | Image: Clubhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BwU93z"&gt;Now, you can slide into people’s Clubhouse DMs. The social audio company is launching its direct messaging feature, Backchannel, today for all users on both iOS and Android. For now, users can chat one-on-one, in groups, and send links. They cannot yet send images or videos, but a spokesperson says that functionality is coming, along with a “few other features.” There will also be an optional secondary inbox where message requests will live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JTLTqh"&gt;The functionality is designed to help moderators chat among themselves during an active room; let people connect after an event; and broadly, foster text conversations that otherwise would have to take place in a separate app. We can’t say this development is much of a surprise, though: Clubhouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543877/clubhouse-backchannel-text-chat-private-leaked-feature"&gt;accidentally leaked&lt;/a&gt; the feature in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0BUvv"&gt;Still, this is a critical development for the app, which the company now says has been downloaded over 8 million times on Android devices with more than 500,000 rooms created daily. Its competitors, notably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455799/twitter-spaces-web-browser-clubhouse-social-audio-room"&gt;Twitter Spaces&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22540508/facebook-live-audio-rooms-clubhouse-rival-spaces-greenhouse"&gt;Facebook Live Audio Rooms&lt;/a&gt;, both allow people to text chat while also running or participating in an audio conversation, so Backchannel brings Clubhouse more up to par and ensures users keep their conversations, and more of their social life, on the app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome will soon let you turn on an HTTPS-first mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_r8KrZizCVMCHbvjI9ve77AW2hY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581624/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fr25r3"&gt;Google is working to make browsing more secure by soon offering an HTTPS-first option, which will try to upgrade page loads to HTTPS, the company announced on Wednesday. If you flip this option on, the browser will also show a full-page warning when you try to load up a site that doesn’t support HTTPS. The company is also announcing that it’s “re-examining” the lock icon in the URL bar and plans to experiment with a change to how that looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3cJEO"&gt;HTTPS is a &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-https/"&gt;more secure version of HTTP&lt;/a&gt; (yes, the “S” stands for “secure”), and many of the websites you visit every day likely already support it. Since HTTPS encrypts your traffic, it’s a helpful privacy tool for when you’re using public Wi-Fi or to keep your ISP from snooping on the contents of your browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLt1DC"&gt;Google has been encouraging HTTPS adoption with moves like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17365362/google-chrome-secure-indicator-https"&gt;marking insecure sites with a “Not secure” label in the URL bar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/03/a-safer-default-for-navigation-https.html"&gt;using https:// in the address bar by default&lt;/a&gt; when you’re typing in a URL. For now, this HTTPS-First Mode will be just an option, but the company says it will “explore” making the mode the default in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0a8MY4"&gt;The HTTPS-First Mode will be available starting with Chrome 94, according to Google. Currently, &lt;a href="https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule"&gt;that release is set for September 21st&lt;/a&gt;. And HTTP connections will still be supported, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgEEHK"&gt;As for the experiment with the lock icon, I’ll let Google explain what the potential issue with the icon is, &lt;a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/07/increasing-https-adoption.html"&gt;from a blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pnPDPg"&gt;As we approach an HTTPS-first future, we’re also re-examining the lock icon that browsers typically show when a site loads over HTTPS. In particular, &lt;a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub45366/"&gt;our research&lt;/a&gt; indicates that users often associate this icon with a &lt;em&gt;site&lt;/em&gt; being trustworthy, when in fact it’s only the &lt;em&gt;connection&lt;/em&gt; that’s secure. In a recent study, we found that only 11% of participants could correctly identify the meaning of the lock icon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6kjBhH"&gt;So starting with Chrome 93, the company plans to swap the lock icon with a downward-facing arrow as part of an experiment. To me, an arrow feels like something you might feel more encouraged to click on than a lock to learn more information about your connection, so I can see the reason behind the change. Here’s a GIF of what you can expect to see:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gk9vNWwnT6x_VQSqAhDHJmIYbuY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717298/pasted_image_0.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u4XKx7"&gt;Even though the lock is changing to an arrow, Google will still show the “Not Secure” label for sites that aren’t secure, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An AI model shows health centers in California aren’t prepared for power outages  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sylmar Converter Station, a piece of power grid infrastructure operated by LADWP, for a story about how an Oregon wildfire almost caused the lights to go out in California on Friday night. Sylmar Converter Station is the terminus of the Pacific DC Intertie" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wwynCGxiwSa8a-fu_1uvIT0Pb-c=/42x0:3959x2611/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581619/1233958488.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wildfires in the West can lead to power outages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f1lvuv"&gt;There are around 20 federally qualified health centers in the areas touched by the Lava, Tennant, and Salt fires, which started in Northern California at the end of June. The centers are part of the state’s healthcare safety net and offer &lt;a href="https://www.chcf.org/publication/californias-federally-qualified-health-centers/#related-links-and-downloads"&gt;primary care&lt;/a&gt; to low-income patients in the area. Despite the fire risk to the facilities, none of those 20 centers had backup generators, says Andrew Schroeder, who runs analytics programs at the humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJc5Zw"&gt;That’s key information for officials and aid groups: if the power went out because of the fires, those centers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20932780/california-blackout-healthcare-electricity-fires"&gt;might not be able&lt;/a&gt; to keep medications and vaccines refrigerated or turn on computer systems with patient medical records. But before May, that’s not information Schroeder or anyone else working on response efforts would be able to look up. Despite the threat of outages and shutoffs during extreme heat and fire season, states and industry associations often don’t know which facilities have backups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5pumI"&gt;“We had a lack of information about where health centers have generators, where they have solar panels, have people installed battery backups for refrigerators, and things like that,” Schroeder says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWvjjA"&gt;Now, thanks to a new AI model finished at the end of May, they have a better picture of the backup plans at these health centers just in time for what’s projected to be a devastating fire season. It shows a sparse landscape: only around 30 percent of facilities have backup power and access to refrigeration for medical supplies, says Jeni Stockman, senior program manager at artificial intelligence company Macro-Eyes, which built the tool. “It suggests there’s a huge gap in the resiliency of sites,” she says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PiBQFO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a huge gap in the resiliency of sites”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qO57FN"&gt;The information is acutely important for the response to the COVID-19 pandemic because the vaccines for the disease have to be stored at cold and ultracold temperatures. Sending shots to a place that couldn’t keep them cold during a power disruption &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/science/2021/2/16/22285394/covid-vaccine-power-outage-freezer"&gt;risked losing the doses&lt;/a&gt;. So Macro-Eyes worked with the California Primary Care Association (CPCA) on a project funded by Direct Relief to build a tool that would map out the resources at each center. The groups soon realized it could have other applications outside of COVID-19, like where to direct aid in other emergencies, says CPCA Acting President Robert Beaudry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mD36bZ"&gt;“Because of the fires, and because of [power company] PG&amp;amp;E’s ongoing problems, we have power outages in California. We wanted to know which of our health centers could continue to operate,” Beaudry says. “The more information that we had around these types of issues, the more we could inform emergency preparedness in California.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RXozT"&gt;The project was modeled off of work Macro-Eyes did in Sierra Leone mapping out what resources health facilities had at any given time. The government didn’t have good information about which health centers had access to electricity and which didn’t, says Benjamin Fels, the founder and CEO of Macro-Eyes. “In the context of COVID-19, when you get these really scarce vaccines, you don’t want to send them to a point on the map where they cannot be kept cold — because that basically means you’re throwing them away,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DfUQSD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When you get these really scarce vaccines, you don’t want to send them to a point on the map where they cannot be kept cold”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yeNln4"&gt;In conversations with Schroeder and Direct Relief, the company realized people in California didn’t have that information, either. Hospitals in the US that get federal funding are required to have backup generators. But outpatient and community care clinics, including federally qualified health centers, often don’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WaUF6R"&gt;The facilities can charge Medicare and Medicaid for services, so they have to report certain information to the federal government — demographic information about the patients they serve, insurance status of those patients, and so on. It’s a very extensive form, Schroeder says. “What it doesn’t contain is much of any information about the actual infrastructure of the places,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="py9avA"&gt;The CPCA has surveyed centers to find out what resources and power sources they had available, but those haven’t dredged up much information. Beaudry says the association had a sense of the power resources for around 8 percent of the sites in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeZ4zT"&gt;Macro-Eyes’ model helped fill in the rest of the picture. It pulls in data from a range of publicly available sources — like lists of places that had permits for generators and satellite images for solar panels. From there, it’s able to infer which similar types of health sites might have the same features. If, for example, the model already has information from survey data on three health centers out of 10 that have similar locations and serve a similar number of people, it could project that the remaining seven would have the same resources as the first three. Health centers can then confirm whether the model got it right, which helps the AI continue to learn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Goz5Hd"&gt;Mapping out the data helped CPCA see where there are limitations in access to power. Officials and aid groups could use that information to decide where they should send supplies. That could include anything from COVID-19 vaccines (which need to be frozen) to insulin, which has to stay refrigerated, Schroeder says. “We often support needs for insulin after disasters,” he says. “We need to know where we’d feel confident sending things that require cold storage, without also sending some kind of ability to back up their refrigeration capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="61xhz3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We need to know where we’d feel confident sending things that require cold storage”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="62n3G9"&gt;The data could also help organizations figure out which places in the state could use extra generators. “We can see where there’d be islands of rural health populations that would be potentially disconnected,” says DeeAnne McCallin, the director of health information technology at CPCA. She says the California Department of Public Health recently told CPCA that they may have extra freezers or refrigerators available and asked if there were any health centers that could use them. That’s the kind of inquiry the data could help answer.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGnAN4"&gt;It’s also valuable for the health centers themselves because they’re able to see during an emergency if there’s a nearby facility with access to a generator or a refrigerator that they could direct patients to or use to store supplies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNw0Gc"&gt;The Macro-Eyes modeling tool can be used in places other than just California. The company and Direct Relief think that the Gulf Coast, which has been battered by increasingly devastating hurricanes, could be a good next target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8u3Q1"&gt;Major disasters — like those Gulf Coast storms, Hurricane Maria, and the California fires — have made it clear that having a backup power plan is a key piece of preparedness. That’s especially true for healthcare, which is vital during disaster response. “We’ve designed a health care system which is really in some ways very sophisticated, and very unequal, but really fragile when it comes to access to power,” Schroeder says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x31Zze"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BV4E2E"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9aYM4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcVRLH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>European Union proposes roadmap for slashing greenhouse gas emissions</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aR3LPZ"&gt;The European Union put out a sweeping set of proposals today that could drastically cut its greenhouse gas emissions if the plan ultimately becomes law. Internal combustion vehicles would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576994/european-union-gas-vehicle-ice-ban-2035-electric-cars"&gt;phased out by 2035&lt;/a&gt;, and it would rope industries like aviation and shipping, which were previously exempt from some EU climate policies, into compliance. The bloc also intends to influence polluters outside its borders by potentially making importers pay for their pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPPqKd"&gt;All in all, it’s a roadmap to achieving a goal that Europeans have been hashing out for years. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21019624/europes-green-deal-on-climate-change-failed-its-first-test"&gt;In 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, put forward a “Green Deal” to get the continent to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Reaching that target requires incremental progress. So last year, the EU said it would cut its greenhouse gas pollution by 55 percent by 2030, compared to pollution in 1990. (That’s why the EU is calling its new set of proposals “Fit for 55,” a name that’s elicited some &lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/horny-for-40-fit-for-55-eus-climate-plan-branding-raises-eyebrows/"&gt;teasing&lt;/a&gt; online.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="cp75sc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is the ultimate now or never moment.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BxlyqV"&gt;While that’s ambitious, it’s the kind of action that’s needed to meet the scale of the climate crisis. Planet-heating emissions globally need to drop in half this decade and ultimately reach close to zero by the middle of the century, &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;climate scientists have found&lt;/a&gt;. That would spare us some of the worst effects of climate change by meeting one of the targets of the landmark Paris agreement, which is to limit global warming to roughly 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Humans have already pushed global average temperatures to 1.1 degrees of warming, triggering more extreme weather, coastal flooding, and species loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lsl5aX"&gt;“This is the ultimate now or never moment,” European Commissioner for Economy, Paolo Gentiloni Silveri, said in a &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3541"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “With every passing year the terrible reality of climate change becomes more apparent: today we confirm our determination to act before it is really too late.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTd5SN"&gt;Perhaps the biggest change that EU residents will feel is in transportation, which accounts for 22 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in the bloc. The commission proposed ratcheting up emissions standards for new cars and vans. Under the existing proposal, they would need to slash their pollution by 55 percent in 2030 and 100 percent in 2035. That will ultimately take new gas-powered cars off the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ryA1Hv"&gt;Fuel used for shipping, aviation, and heating buildings would also change under the plan. One of the biggest tools the EU has for regulating pollution is its Emissions Trading System (ETS). That places a cap on how much pollution certain industries are allowed to produce and sets a price on carbon. Aviation used to get free emissions allowances, but the commission now wants them to fully pay for their carbon like other industries. Shipping would be regulated under the Emissions Trading System under the new plan, and a similar but separate system would be created for road transport and buildings. That would incentivize each sector to increase energy efficiency and more hastily turn to cleaner fuels.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T59iN6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tougher environmental standards for industries globally&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9PnHzE"&gt;The EU doesn’t want its carbon price to disadvantage European businesses or encourage more polluting abroad. So it also proposed putting a carbon price or tax on imports for products like steel and cement that have large carbon footprints. This provision could cause a kerfuffle with the World Trade Organization, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/world/europe/climate-change-carbon-green-new-deal.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. But the measure aims to encourage tougher environmental standards for industries globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zuJPMI"&gt;Renewable energy will need to replace most fossil fuels if the EU is to reach its climate ambitions. The commission now envisions that renewables will make up 40 percent of the bloc’s overall energy production by 2030. Renewable energy, including solar and wind, made up just over 15 percent of the EU’s &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/infographs/energy/bloc-2a.html"&gt;energy mix&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXX7Ve"&gt;Beyond slashing greenhouse gas emissions generated by people, the EU also wants to get better at drawing them down through natural carbon sinks like forests. It wants to plant 3 billion trees across the continent by 2030. Conserving forests and other ecosystems is important for plants, people, and animals. But repairing the climate by planting new trees has been a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign"&gt;tricky, controversial enterprise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0dC53"&gt;That makes the EU’s other proposed schemes for reducing pollution the most important priorities for the roadmap. But the plan won’t materialize right away. It could take a couple of years just for the proposals to be approved by the European Parliament and member states.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcMF2w"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bFCXc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
