    <title>Go read this NYT story about losing $220 million in bitcoin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="bitcoin strength in numbers 1020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bm1P_8jADe9zYCrvuv7ATOvifL0=/1x0:1020x679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658418/20130520-07511828--btc.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZYsYyB"&gt;There aren’t many good ways to lose $220 million, but &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html"&gt;this &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; highlights a particularly egregious one — losing millions of dollars in bitcoin because you forgot the password to your digital wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZMyTe"&gt;Stefan Thomas’ 7,002 bitcoin (worth roughly $220 million) are locked away in an IronKey hard drive, according to &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;’s Nathaniel Popper. The problem is he can’t remember the password, and he’s just two failed password attempts closer to losing them forever due to IronKey’s strict security protocols. There is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1348999856111591424"&gt;the possibility of paying someone to crack the drive&lt;/a&gt;, but Thomas would have to have the time and money to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFzWFX"&gt;It’s a darkly comedic scenario, and Popper’s story hits all of the cryptocurrency classics to help explain it. There’s mention of the volatile nature of bitcoin’s value and the currency’s mysterious creator, but what the article makes staggeringly clear is how common losing bitcoin actually is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5sn9X"&gt;Two other people get singled out in Thomas’ story of woe, but it’s a surprisingly common tale. Of the 18.5 million bitcoin currently in existence, roughly 20 percent (around $140 billion) are lost in inaccessible wallets, Popper writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmPE0y"&gt;There have been other high-value wallets locked out in the past, with contents ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/i-forgot-my-pin-an-epic-tale-of-losing-dollar30000-in-bitcoin/"&gt;$30,000&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/quest-to-liberate-bitcoin-from-old-zip-file/"&gt;$300,000&lt;/a&gt;, but Thomas’ story is a reminder of how persistent this problem is among bitcoin users and how expensive it has become. The secure and decentralized nature of bitcoin is great — until it collides with simple human forgetfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xgGmb"&gt;You can read the whole story &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and appreciate just how much &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude"&gt;schadenfreude&lt;/a&gt; bitcoin continues to generate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD will let consumers buy the Threadripper Pro directly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ewUyXFbhAjVTw85ZzpCkdPSZAEo=/173x0:1073x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658343/489185_threadripper_pro_chip_1920x600.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: AMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JmM3g8"&gt;If you’ve yearned for the power of the Threadripper Pro, but &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/first-tests-amds-ryzen-threadripper-pro-new-muscle-in-workstation-cpus"&gt;haven’t wanted to buy a ThinkStation&lt;/a&gt;, you’re in luck: starting in March, AMD will begin selling the CPUs directly to consumers, ending Lenovo’s exclusive access to the processor line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5DRq7"&gt;While the vanilla Threadripper seems like the peak of computing power to many (myself included), &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16396/the-amd-wrx80-chipset-a-few-boards-for-3rd-gen-threadripper-pro"&gt;there are certain benefits the Pro line offers&lt;/a&gt; that would be seriously beneficial to those who need them: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rulfnL"&gt;Memory channels are doubled, from four to eight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5drrJ9"&gt;PCI-E lanes are doubled, from 64 to 128&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QRsVtF"&gt;Memory capacity is expanded from 256GB to 2TB (!!!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="GE6WXD"&gt;To sum up those massive numbers into a more real-world picture, the Threadripper Pro allows users to work with larger datasets due to its expanded memory capacity. It also allows double the expansion for users who need tons of graphics or networking cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VpGknQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO processors will now be directly available to consumers starting in March 2021!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boasting up to 64 cores, 128 PCIe 4.0 lanes, and 8 channels of memory, Threadripper PRO is the world’s fastest workstation processor: &lt;a href="https://t.co/MKtJBTJT0A"&gt;https://t.co/MKtJBTJT0A&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/cj1SorEKUY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cj1SorEKUY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— AMD Ryzen (@AMDRyzen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AMDRyzen/status/1349093643840323584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="on5bVD"&gt;Of course, all of these features mean nothing without motherboards that can support them — after all, what would be the point of 128 PCI-E lanes if the motherboard only had 4 PCI-E 16x slots? &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16396/the-amd-wrx80-chipset-a-few-boards-for-3rd-gen-threadripper-pro"&gt;This &lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; points out three motherboards that should be coming to support the CPUs, but it’s not likely that we’ll see the same amount of variety and choice that we do with consumer motherboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6jEIc"&gt;There’s no word yet on pricing, but regular Threadripper CPUs aren’t exactly cheap. Still, if you need the capabilities of this kind of CPU, you’re probably making some money using it (hence the “pro” moniker), and these chips offer some features, like 64 threads and PCI-E gen 4, to workstation users that Intel simply doesn’t provide outside its server products.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US to require negative test from international travelers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Entertainment &amp;amp;amp; Tourism Industries In New York City Struggle Under Pandemic Restrictions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VrsSENZYpn3CQQRGRsrV2pnwyZk=/0x160:5087x3551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658201/1284450539.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G4q1cQ"&gt;Anyone traveling to the United States on an international flight will have to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test within three days before&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the trip, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0112-negative-covid-19-air-passengers.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday. The order will go into effect on January 26th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pb16i5"&gt;The sweeping requirement comes a few weeks after the CDC mandated that anyone flying in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/25/22199682/covid-test-uk-travelers-us-cdc-virus-mutation"&gt;from the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; must receive a negative test result within the 72 hours prior to their flight. That order was based on concerns about a more contagious coronavirus variant spreading through the UK. That variant is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206522/coronavirus-test-variant-contagious-uk-gene"&gt;already present&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e64LzS"&gt;Testing “can make travel safer, healthier, and more responsible by reducing spread on planes, in airports, and at destinations,” even though it doesn’t eliminate all risk of COVID-19 spread, CDC Director Robert Redfield said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0112-negative-covid-19-air-passengers.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsJ911"&gt;US airlines &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-transportation-officials-airlines-spar-with-cdc-over-testing-vs-quarantines-for-international-flights-11603996361?mod=article_inline"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; that this type of program should replace travel bans and other restrictions that are now in place. People who are not citizens or permanent residents are currently &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/from-other-countries.html"&gt;not allowed to travel&lt;/a&gt; into the US if they’ve been in countries including China and the UK in the 14 days before their trip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMEbDM"&gt;“We believe a well-planned program focused on increasing testing of travelers to the United States will further these objectives in a much more effective way than the blanket travel restrictions currently in place,” Nick Calio, chief executive of Airlines for America, a trade group, said &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2021/01/05/airlines-testing-international-covid-flights/"&gt;in a letter&lt;/a&gt; to Vice President Mike Pence earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRtrJa"&gt;Testing might catch some travelers infected with the coronavirus, but it’s not a perfect system: someone might test negative the day before a trip, and then develop symptoms or contract the virus on their way to the airport. COVID-19 is also already spreading at record levels within the US. An average of around 250,000 cases are reported each day. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Exclusive: Apple held talks with EV startup Canoo in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zbwGAeCNL-Dc9hiPI5oafigJnsA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658125/canoo_Design_Exterior_09.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Canoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tOxNU7"&gt;Apple held meetings with California EV startup Canoo in the first half of 2020 as part of the Silicon Valley giant’s secretive effort to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163939/apple-self-driving-car-john-giannandrea-ai-siri"&gt;advance its own electric vehicle project&lt;/a&gt;, three people familiar with the talks have told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The two companies discussed options ranging from investment to an acquisition, according to two of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qcBkxi"&gt;Canoo’s scalable electric vehicle platform, or “skateboard,” is largely what drew Apple’s interest, the people said. The platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car’s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9bfWU"&gt;Canoo was more interested in taking on an investment from Apple, two of the people said. Ultimately, the talks fell apart. Canoo has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;since become a publicly traded company&lt;/a&gt; after merging with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;blank check fund&lt;/a&gt; that was listed on the NASDAQ in late 2020. Apple has made at least one other acquisition in the mobility space in recent years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18758820/drive-ai-self-driving-startup-shutting-down-apple"&gt;buying Drive.ai in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oq1mYL"&gt;“Canoo doesn’t openly comment on strategic discussions, relationships or partnerships unless deemed appropriate,” Tony Aquila, Canoo’s executive chairman, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Apple declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7rcEe2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The talks happened at a crucial financial moment for Canoo&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U7BVy8"&gt;News of Apple’s interest in Canoo comes as &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports that the tech company is &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-hyundai-motor-apple/apple-hyundai-set-to-agree-electric-car-tie-up-says-korea-it-news-idUSKBN29F0C1"&gt;negotiating with Hyundai to make a self-driving electric vehicle as early as 2024&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s vehicle project, codenamed “Project Titan,” has shapeshifted multiple times over the years. But the company has now &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/apple-s-aapl-tesla-tsla-killer-won-t-ship-for-at-least-half-a-decade?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reportedly refocused on making an autonomous electric vehicle&lt;/a&gt; and has been holding meetings with automakers as small as Canoo and as big as Hyundai as it looks to outsource things like technical design and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ostxcV"&gt;Hyundai and Canoo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia"&gt;previously announced a plan to co-develop electric vehicles in February 2020&lt;/a&gt;, though that project appears to be unrelated to the startup’s talks with Apple. Canoo refers to its partnership with Hyundai in recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an “engineering services agreement” that will see the companies co-develop a platform to power a “small segment electric vehicle.” But Canoo has not disclosed whether it has been paid for the Hyundai deal, or whether any work has begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1sE4y"&gt;Canoo was founded in late 2017 by a small group that split out from struggling EV startup Faraday Future, including multiple former BMW executives. As &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;first reported, the effort was funded by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20899436/discrimination-lawsuit-canoo-foreign-backers-ev-startup-british-chinese-government"&gt;a Chinese investor who is the son-in-law of a former CCP leader&lt;/a&gt;, and the family in charge of Taiwanese tech company TPK, which supplies touchscreen technology to Apple. Canoo plans to make commercial electric vehicles, like delivery vans or food trucks, as well as a consumer-focused van that will be sold on a subscription basis. All of Canoo’s vehicles are powered by that same scalable skateboard technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THdRzC"&gt;The talks with Apple came at a crucial time for Canoo, which lost $182.3 million in 2019 while working on its first prototype vehicle and entered 2020 with just $29 million in the bank, according to &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001750153/000121390020041124/f424b31220_hennessycapacq4.htm#TOC001"&gt;a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="tB6p7P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Canoo met with companies and investors across Silicon Valley and China before going public&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QCWDDY"&gt;Canoo took meetings with a variety of companies from Silicon Valley, China, and elsewhere in 2019 and 2020, the people said. But as deals failed to materialize, the startup needed short-term money. It took a $7 million loan from the government’s pandemic Paycheck Protection Program and, as talks with Apple dragged on, another $15 million total from Pak Tam Li (the Chinese investor) and the Chiang family (the owners of TPK) in March 2020, according to the SEC filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwAYXs"&gt;Canoo eventually started negotiations with the blank check fund, Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV, later in the year. It was one of the first startups to jump on this trend of using a so-called “special purpose acquisition company” to shortcut the traditional path to becoming publicly traded. As that deal was worked out, the Chiang family put another $80 million into the startup, and the soon-to-be executive chairman invested $35 million, according to the SEC filing. Canoo raised some $600 million when the deal closed near the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUb0V0"&gt;While Canoo now has the money it sought at the beginning of 2020, that hasn’t softened its ambitions to work with big companies like Apple. The startup said in that same SEC filing that it is “currently in discussions with multiple other blue-chip industry participants interested in leveraging Canoo’s technologies and engineering expertise for their own commercial products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KugtI1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Origin updates EVO15-S and EVO17-S with new RTX 3000 series GPUs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Origin EVO15-S angled to the left, open, on a red and black background. The screen displays the Origin logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lDrowTpiE4GeqHf4ZNJM0jgBmWY=/0x267:1600x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658070/evo15_s_right_wide_angle_open_keyboard.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Origin EVO15-S, now available with RTX 3000 graphics.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Origin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5XxNcR"&gt;Origin has upgraded its EVO15-S and EVO17-S gaming notebooks and its NT-15 and NT-17 workstations to include Nvidia’s latest GeForce RTX 3000 mobile graphics cards (up to an RTX 3080 with Max-Q design). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VkXFG"&gt;You can configure both lines with 10th Gen Core i7 Intel processors, up to 64GB of RAM, and up to 2 x 2TB of storage. You can select a 300Hz 1080p display (a new option for the 2021 models), a 144Hz 1080p display, or a 60Hz UHD display (which is an OLED on the 15-inch models). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mslkbw"&gt;All models have a useful selection of connections, including three USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports, one Thunderbolt 3 port, one microSD Push-Push card reader, one Mini DisplayPort 1.3, one HDMI output, and one RJ-45 Ethernet jack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Origin NT-17 angled to the right on an orange and black background. The screen displays the Origin logo on a red background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lm9rp3x13UJM1Ro6PRepokrm6wg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22231109/nt_17_2.jpg"&gt;

    <title>GitHub reportedly fired a Jewish employee who warned co-workers to stay safe from Nazis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Acquires GitHub : Illustration" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HZmoUgT5Zif1ggIMSV7pvAooa8k=/0x48:4675x3165/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657931/967199986.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7gUmJe"&gt;GitHub reportedly fired a Jewish employee after he posted a message in Slack that said “stay safe homies, Nazis are about” the day of the attack on the US Capitol, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-github-backlash-jewish-employee-termination-2021-1"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="duOMMw"&gt;The message sparked controversy inside the company, with one colleague criticizing him for using divisive language. GitHub’s HR team chastised the employee for using the word “Nazi” in a company Slack channel. Two days later, GitHub allegedly fired him, citing vague patterns of behavior. The employee asked &lt;em&gt;Business Insider &lt;/em&gt;to remain anonymous for fear of online harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFGQdP"&gt;The move shows a lack of understanding on the part of GitHub management, both about the gravity of the attack on the US Capitol and the contextual use of the word Nazi. After &lt;em&gt;Business Insider &lt;/em&gt;published its report, the company was widely criticized on Twitter for trying to “both sides” the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oivAJ1"&gt;Now, roughly 200 of GitHub’s 1,700 employees have signed a letter asking executives to take a stronger stance against anti-Semitism and white supremacy. They also want to know why the employee was fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhdsGZ"&gt;GitHub CEO Nat Friedman told workers that “the company is actively looking into the circumstances surrounding the separation of an employee last week and will take any and all appropriate action following a thorough investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugllTz"&gt;The employee said he posted the message because he was concerned for his relatives and co-workers living in Washington, DC. He had family who died in the Holocaust and saw that some of the rioters were associated with neo-Nazi organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaBDSw"&gt;GitHub, a developer platform, was acquired by Microsoft in 2018. The day of the attack on the US Capitol, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-capitol-siege-business-leaders-react-jamie-dimon-alexis-ohanian-2021-1"&gt;Microsoft President Brad Smith retweeted a statement&lt;/a&gt; calling on President Trump to “put an end to the chaos and to facilitate the peaceful transition of power.” &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/11/facebook-halts-political-donations-after-capitol-riot.html"&gt;Microsoft also said it would pause political contributions&lt;/a&gt;, much like Facebook and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gnBVpU"&gt;Before his Slack account was deactivated, the employee expressed bewilderment at the blowback he’d received from his message. “I did not know that, as a Jew, it would be so polarizing to say this word,” he said in a Slack channel for Jewish employees. “We grew up saying [Nazi]. It was a story we told because we had to— the decimation of whole lines of ancestry were at the hands of people who went by that title.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkhWhx"&gt;This is the second time GitHub has faced significant criticism from employees in recent years. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/10/9/20906605/github-ice-contract-immigration-ice-dan-friedman"&gt;more than 150 workers signed a letter asking the company to cancel a  $200,000 contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement&lt;/a&gt;. It also comes on the heels of recent employee activism at companies like Twitter and Google. In December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;Google fired AI ethicist Timnit Gebru&lt;/a&gt;, prompting a wave of condemnation from tech workers across Silicon Valley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SaqB4i"&gt;GitHub did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arlo has a touchless doorbell, too — can’t we just update existing ones to do this?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QOKhTBaBqKm9cJ-9Ktf4_pCalsU=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657905/5H1A7164.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, not like this. (This is Arlo’s previous doorbell.)&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Arlo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="or9KUW"&gt;“Finally, a doorbell for the pandemic era,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224537/alarm-touchless-video-doorbell-doormat"&gt;we remarked&lt;/a&gt;, as Alarm.com introduced its sub-$200 Touchless Video Doorbell yesterday. But what was once a curiosity has now become a trend: Netgear spinoff Arlo now has its own Touchless Video Doorbell too, right down to the same product name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WrlUIO"&gt;Arlo doesn’t have a price, release date, or even a picture of the new doorbell, which got me to thinking: why does it need to be any different than the doorbells that Arlo (and Google’s Nest and Amazon’s Ring, etc.) already offer today? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="438GtT"&gt;Here’s how Arlo &lt;a href="https://www.arlo.com/en-us/about/press-releases/2021/arlo-earns-two-2021-ces-innovation-award-honoree-distinctions-highlighted-by-recognition-for-the-arlo-essential-indoor-camera-with-built-in-privacy-shield.aspx"&gt;describes the idea&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="EbAVZj"&gt;Leveraging precise Proximity Sensing Technology to gauge a visitor’s distance, the Arlo Touchless Video Doorbell zeros in on a visitor’s approach. Once detected, the guest hears an audible chime and sees a visible light, signaling the doorbell has been “pressed” and the homeowner has been alerted – all before they come into physical contact with the device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2KkdI4"&gt;Most smart doorbells already have cameras with some form of motion detection. Some even let you fine-tune motion detection zones, and many already have lights and sounds that let a visitor know when they’ve pressed the button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1ZCP4"&gt;Why not just fire off a software update to existing doorbells, ones that automatically ring the doorbell when the camera detects a visitor? It could play an audio message like “We’re ringing the doorbell for you, please wait a moment,” too. Arlo’s video doorbells &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/17/20918750/arlo-video-doorbell-price-date"&gt;already support sending pre-recorded audio messages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDTPKM"&gt;The humble webcam &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22173744/webcam-gadget-of-the-year-2020"&gt;became 2020’s most important gadget&lt;/a&gt; when the pandemic hit, and most DSLR and mirrorless camera makers responded to the webcam shortage by releasing software &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21523161/phone-camera-webcam-how-to-iphone-android-dslr"&gt;to let you turn them into webcams, too&lt;/a&gt;. Do doorbell makers think they can entice enough people to buy a brand-new doorbell just for this, at a time when people aren’t supposed to be visiting each other’s houses? If I’m right and existing cams can do this, it might be more effective to try to sell more of those existing models by building some goodwill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QodQFi"&gt;Arlo introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437592/arlo-essential-wire-free-video-doorbell-price-release-date-battery-powered-security-camera"&gt;its first battery-powered doorbell&lt;/a&gt; late last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s Model Y is the company’s latest five-star safety rated car</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JBI8kbvDM5A42EPHj3M7O3RXH9c=/48x0:663x410/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657805/v11292P148.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0zT58T"&gt;Tesla’s vehicles have been acing the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) crash tests for years, and the Model Y is now the latest to join those ranks, with the midsize &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2020/TESLA/MODEL%252520Y/SUV/AWD"&gt;SUV scoring five stars in every category&lt;/a&gt; that the group tests for crash safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERgFCT"&gt;NHTSA grades cars on a variety of crash test metrics, including frontal crashes (with subcategories for both the driver and passenger seats), side crashes (for crashes into both a barrier and a pole), and rollover scenarios. The Model Y scores five-star results across the board — although, as with the NHTSA’s previous tests, these results are only for regular, human-piloted scenarios, not Tesla’s self-driving Autopilot mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gYB8js"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z212QloYwnw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H8t6B5"&gt;Of course, pictures and star ratings are all well and good, but if you’re more of a visual learner, you can enjoy the video footage of the Tesla SUV smashing into things in soothing slow motion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjizej"&gt;The new results mean that the Model Y joins the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882634/tesla-model-3-nhtsa-five-star-safety-rating"&gt;Model 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15791740/tesla-model-x-crash-test-nhtsa-5-star-rating"&gt;Model X SUV&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/20/4639082/teslas-model-s-nabs-top-us-safety-rating"&gt;Model S&lt;/a&gt; in perfect crash test scores. (The Model S was originally granted a 5.4-star rating, before the NHTSA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/23/5135258/nhtsa-tesla-star-safety-advertising-guidelines"&gt;revised its guidelines&lt;/a&gt; to get rid of “impossible” scores.) &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FBI received over 100,000 pieces of digital evidence after Capitol attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-JUSTICE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x53KaMaBzxfJNtedwYQczJjR40Q=/0x0:3936x2624/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657797/1230553222.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P4gzoW"&gt;The Justice Department has received over 100,000 pieces of digital evidence following last week’s deadly attack on the US Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQX2Wl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221669/what-just-happened-this-week-trump-social-media-capitol-twitter-facebook-parler"&gt;Shortly after a pro-Trump mob&lt;/a&gt; stormed the Capitol last Wednesday, the FBI posted a tweet requesting any information that could help identify people who participated in the riot. As of Tuesday, the FBI said it received more than 100,000 pieces of digital evidence in the wake of that request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8n0WJ7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The FBI is seeking to identify individuals instigating violence in Washington, D.C. We are accepting tips and digital media depicting rioting or violence in and around the U.S. Capitol on January 6. If you have information, visit &lt;a href="https://t.co/buMd8vYXzH"&gt;https://t.co/buMd8vYXzH&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;— FBI (@FBI) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FBI/status/1347175086432907272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VBCqZT"&gt;It’s not clear how much of this evidence is unique, but FBI officials said Tuesday that the bureau had opened around 170 cases into individual rioters. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/who-has-been-charged-us-capitol-riot-4523babc6d058229c789b4a9e1f6787c"&gt;Of those 170 cases&lt;/a&gt;, the US Attorney for the District of Columbia has brought federal charges against 20 people. Forty others have been charged in DC’s Superior Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHQHrO"&gt;“You will be found,” an FBI official said at Tuesday’s press conference. “The FBI has a long memory and broad reach. Even if you’ve left DC, agents from our local field offices will be knocking on your door.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="53S1Bn"&gt;In the days following the Capitol attack, tech companies and social media platforms have removed thousands of conspiratorial accounts and individuals. Over the weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; removed the right’s favored social media app, Parler, from their app stores. Shortly after, Parler’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;domain registrars&lt;/a&gt; pulled the plug on the site as well, forcing it offline &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/parler-moves-to-epik-domain-known-for-hosting-far-right-2021-1"&gt;until it found new hosting&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPed7Z"&gt;Twitter banned over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226503/twitter-qanon-account-suspension-70000-capitol-riots"&gt;70,000 accounts&lt;/a&gt; for pushing QAnon-fueled conspiracies on its platform. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/11/trump-twitter-ban/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that a large amount of QAnon followers took part in last week’s pro-Trump riot at the Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3zMD7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmYJ32"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Weber buys smart oven company June</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r0zey_43pLM_VcPu7eH3xBgBhkw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657683/akrales_190131_3100_0071.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CWtppj"&gt;Weber has acquired June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/7/17660618/june-countertop-smart-oven-version-two"&gt;a smart oven startup&lt;/a&gt; that sells countertop ovens with a camera and temperature sensor built in so that they can automatically bake, roast, and otherwise cook foods in a variety of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLAvzr"&gt;June, founded in 2013, has introduced three generations of its smart oven, with &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/junes-third-get-smart-goes-up-for-pre-order-starting-at-599/"&gt;the latest&lt;/a&gt; being announced in October 2020. You can’t actually buy one currently — June’s website says they’re only available on a waitlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pcbs6k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Weber wants to offer digital products that “make grilling more dynamic and exciting”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qlebxP"&gt;Development of the June Oven and other June products will continue after the acquisition, Weber says. June will operate as a distinct business unit within Weber, led by Matt Van Horn, a June co-founder and the current CEO. Weber says that the acquisition will let June broaden its product roadmap and help to scale its business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QaTNE"&gt;June and Weber previously collaborated on the &lt;a href="https://www.weber.com/US/en/accessories/cooking/igrill-and-thermometers/3201.html"&gt;Weber Connect&lt;/a&gt;, a grilling gadget that uses temperature sensors and a smartphone connection to help owners precisely grill meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaHqEO"&gt;The acquisition is supposed to help Weber jump ahead when it comes to smart grilling tech. Weber says it plans to launch “digital products, services, and experiences that make grilling more dynamic and exciting.” June’s other co-founder, Nikhil Bhogal, will join Weber as the leader of its technology and connected devices division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrrBm8"&gt;Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
