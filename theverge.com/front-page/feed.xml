    <title>Microsoft president sounds alarm on ‘ongoing’ SolarWinds hack, identifies 40 more precise targets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vL8jO8jazxh3fs78mZokAREuV3k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68545709/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rg6lXB"&gt;Microsoft president Brad Smith &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/"&gt;warned that the wide-ranging hack&lt;/a&gt; of the SolarWinds’ Orion IT software is “ongoing,” and that investigations reveal “an attack that is remarkable for its scope, sophistication and impact.” The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/13/22173035/hackers-russia-breached-us-government-agencies-email-cozy-bear"&gt;breach targeted&lt;/a&gt; several US government agencies and is believed to have been carried out by Russian nation-state hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOZGRX"&gt;Smith characterized the hack as “a moment of reckoning” and laid out in no uncertain terms just how large and how dangerous Microsoft believes the hack to be. It “represents an act of recklessness that created a serious technological vulnerability for the United States and the world,” Smith argues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLt89f"&gt;He believes that it “is not just an attack on specific targets, but on the trust and reliability of the world’s critical infrastructure in order to advance one nation’s intelligence agency.” Though the post stops short of explicitly accusing Russia, the implication is very clear. “The weeks ahead will provide mounting and we believe indisputable evidence about the source of these recent attacks,” according to Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07z580"&gt;To illustrate just how far-reaching the hack was, Smith included a map that used telemetry taken from Microsoft’s Defender Anti-Virus software to show people who had installed versions of the Orion software that contained malware from the hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wAx_-uEt75RSC1ao7lwi-BiBq3M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22181335/cyber1_960x540.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A map showing customers affected by the malware in SolarWinds’ Orion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N4ROso"&gt;Microsoft has also been working this week to notify “more than 40 customers that the attackers targeted more precisely and compromised through additional and sophisticated measures,” according to Smith. Approximately 80 percent of those customers are located in the US, but Microsoft also identified victims in Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Spain, the UK, Israel, and the UAE. “It’s certain that the number and location of victims will keep growing,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3aPw6G"&gt;Investigations into the hack are ongoing. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) issued a joint statement &lt;a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/item/2175-joint-statement-by-the-federal-bureau-of-investigation-fbi-the-cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-cisa-and-the-office-of-the-director-of-national-intelligence-odni"&gt;on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; to say that they were coordinating a “whole-of-government response to this significant cyber incident.” And Smith warned that “we should all be prepared for stories about additional victims in the public sector and other enterprises and organizations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="reM7qu"&gt;Earlier on Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-breach/suspected-russian-hacking-spree-used-another-major-tech-supplier-sources-idUSKBN28R2ZJ?il=0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft had been hacked as part of the breach and that “it also had its own products leveraged to further the attacks on others.” But Microsoft denied that claim in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6Sl1Ap"&gt;Like other SolarWinds customers, we have been actively looking for indicators of this actor and can confirm that we detected malicious Solar Winds binaries in our environment, which we isolated and removed. We have not found evidence of access to production services or customer data. Our investigations, which are ongoing, have found absolutely no indications that our systems were used to attack others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gvdKJw"&gt;Microsoft has been responding to the hack &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/13/customers-protect-nation-state-cyberattacks/"&gt;since December 13th&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2020%2F12%2F15%2Fensuring-customers-are-protected-from-solorigate%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;blocking versions of SolarWinds Orion&lt;/a&gt; that contained the malware. Microsoft and a coalition of tech companies also seized control a domain that played a key role in the SolarWinds breach, &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-and-industry-partners-seize-key-domain-used-in-solarwinds-hack/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2jWXS"&gt;SolarWinds has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176053/solarwinds-hack-client-list-russia-orion-it-compromised"&gt;taken the step&lt;/a&gt; of hiding a list of high-profile clients from its website, perhaps to protect them from negative publicity. The list included more than 425 of the companies on the Fortune 500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgoSHr"&gt;As for Microsoft, Smith used his post to call for a more organized, communal response against cyberattacks, both at a government level and amongst private institutions. “We need a more effective national and global strategy to protect against cyberattacks,” he writes. Microsoft is also looking for “stronger steps to hold nation-states accountable for cyberattacks.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is pulling Cyberpunk 2077 from the PlayStation Store and offering full refunds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ePtprMvGPMEkK9hkDQVsQEf2lZs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68545499/pu15d4e891d784977cacbfcbb00c48f133_1603729915_6192392_screenshot_original.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Iv2O1"&gt;Sony is pulling &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; from the PlayStation Store and offering full refunds for anyone who bought the game from the digital storefront, &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/AskPlayStation/status/1339737360184078336"&gt;the company said on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to start the refund process now, Sony says to &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/cyberpunk-2077-refunds/"&gt;visit this site&lt;/a&gt; and sign into your PlayStation account to submit a request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2YMi7"&gt;However, later on Thursday evening, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AskPlayStation/status/1339762162609209346"&gt;Sony said&lt;/a&gt; it is “aware some users are experiencing issues” accessing the refund form. If you’re seeing issues, you may want to try again later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcM2qE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; has already been removed from the PlayStation Store for a few &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers on their PS5s, and the game doesn’t come up in a search for “&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;” on the web version of the store. Following older, online listing links to the game will show its store page, but with the option to wish list it only. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wXXfU4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;SIE strives to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction, and we will begin to offer a full refund for all gamers who have purchased Cyberpunk 2077 via PlayStation Store and want a refund. Please visit the following link to initiate the refund: &lt;a href="https://t.co/DEZlC0LmUG"&gt;https://t.co/DEZlC0LmUG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;— Ask PlayStation (@AskPlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AskPlayStation/status/1339737360184078336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Twi8At"&gt;Players have found that &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, which has only been out for a little more than one week, has been riddled with bugs. And while game looks and performs well in backwards compatibility mode on the PS5, it is prone to routine crashes and a number of distracting visual glitches. On PS4, however, the game fares a lot worse — &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-12-10-cyberpunk-2077-is-super-rough-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-and-the-memes-have-already-begun"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; poor performance, low framerate, and texture pop-in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bP58eS"&gt;Sony’s move comes just days after &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; developer CD Projekt Red said people unsatisfied with their purchase on the PS4 or Xbox One should request a refund. Yet due to Sony’s stringent refund policy, many who bought digital versions of the game from the PlayStation Store were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178872/cyberpunk-2077-refund-sony-ps4-ps5-playstation-issue"&gt;unable to get refunds&lt;/a&gt;. (Players who bought the Xbox One version of the game have reported better luck with Microsoft’s more generous refund policy.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebRFiJ"&gt;CD Projekt Red posted a note &lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/inwestorzy/raporty-gieldowe/raport-biezacy-nr-66-2020/"&gt;to its investor website&lt;/a&gt; disclosing Sony’s decision, saying (&lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2020/12/rb_66-2020-czasowe-wstrzymanie-dostepnosci-gry-cyberpunk-2077-w-playstation-store.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="D6oxP0"&gt;The decision [to disclose Sony’s decision] was undertaken following our discussion with SIE [Sony Interactive Entertainment] regarding a full refund for all gamers who had purchased Cyberpunk 2077 via PlayStation Store and want a refund at this time. All copies of the game previously purchased digitally on PlayStation Store remain available for use by their respective buyers. Gamers can still buy physical versions of the game in retail and mail order stores. All copies, whether digital or physical, will continue to receive support and updates from the Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vaalcH"&gt;It’s unclear when Sony plans to return &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; to the PlayStation Store; the company’s note says the game will be unavailable in its digital format “until further notice.” It’s also not clear if Microsoft plans to similarly yank the game from its digital storefront or offer full refunds. Microsoft didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q09E74"&gt;CD Projekt Red has committed to releasing patches to improve &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. The company has already released one post-launch update, and in a December 13th statement, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1338390123373801472"&gt;the studio said&lt;/a&gt; another update is “coming within the next 7 days.” More significant patches are planned for January and February. “Together these should fix the most prominent problems gamers are facing on last-gen consoles,” the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGxES0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 17th, 11:07PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added investor note from CD Projekt Red.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Baby Yoda can live on your desk thanks to AR and Google Search</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GRuxApynhIjazjHMc5VEatlHNic=/862x0:3277x1610/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68545371/HUC2_FF_001688.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grogu’s face upon realizing he lives with me.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RMzqiL"&gt;Google has added Grogu (formerly Baby Yoda) to its &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/16/google-3d-animal-grogu/"&gt;augmented reality search results&lt;/a&gt;, so some quick typing can drop an AR version of the little guy straight into your bedroom or home office, no spaceship required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTJJDf"&gt;Searching “Grogu”, “The Child”, “The Mandalorian”, or “Baby Yoda” on mobile or in the Google app will return the usual Knowledge Panel with a Wikipedia summary of the character. But now you can click “View in 3D” to check out a model, and if you’re really feeling like noted &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/werner-herzog-baby-yoda"&gt;Baby Yoda fan Werner Herzog&lt;/a&gt;, “View in your space” to get up close and personal in AR. Interactions are limited to zooming in and out, but he’s a really cute alien. Maybe that’s enough for you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iqwFbZoqijbZDTW2lR5z7M-DVt8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22180855/EB24D9A8_1B24_4966_A52E_56B274FC784A.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conveniently, Grogu is only slightly bigger than my water bottle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m4PDqW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/12/22171601/google-adds-augmented-reality-ar-animals-search-3d"&gt;Google last added 50 new animals&lt;/a&gt; to its AR search results, including hippos, zebras, and giraffes. The company has grown its digital menagerie over time, but Grogu is by far the most exotic and far flung inclusion since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21400577/google-arts-and-culture-augmented-reality-prehistoric-creatures-museum-exhibits"&gt;dinosaurs&lt;/a&gt;. Grogu isn’t the first time Google has feature &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; content prominently in its products. The company partnered with Disney for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21595320/google-disney-mandalorian-ar-lucasfilm-android-arcore-baby-yoda"&gt;The Mandalorian AR Experience&lt;/a&gt; app built to use Google’s ARCore, and before that, offered exclusive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/11/16762638/pixel-augmented-reality-stickers-google-launch"&gt;AR stickers on the Pixel 2&lt;/a&gt; in its now-discontinued Playground feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yjTdSH"&gt;You can can catch up with Grogu’s TV exploits with our handy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/star-wars/2020/10/30/21517931/the-mandalorian-news-reviews-disney-plus-star-wars-baby-yoda"&gt;Guide to &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Or, if you’re like me, you can calmly wait for Google to add voice recognition so AR Grogu can react every time you say his name.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hot Wheels is giving the real Tesla experience by delaying their model Cybertruck </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H5taxEjThbRT13hH2DRbC2G86KU=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68545181/3___GXG31_W_20_Cybertruck_Large_476.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cq9ON8"&gt;If you’ve been waiting anxiously for your radio-controlled Cybertruck, you’re going to have to wait a little longer: Mattel has had to delay it until May 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-17/cybertruck-toy-release-delayed-five-months-but-don-t-blame-tesla?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a1Jge1"&gt;The RC cars, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21147004/hot-wheels-tesla-cybertruck-rc-car-remote-controlled-toy"&gt;announced in February&lt;/a&gt;, were supposed to ship this month, but have been delayed because of “unforseen production issues.” Mattel appears to be experiencing “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/13/17234296/tesla-model-3-robots-production-hell-elon-musk"&gt;manufacturing hell,&lt;/a&gt;” though the company did not release details on the delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QUnGh2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Just another way that the model imitates reality&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tZjZHO"&gt;These toys are scaled-down versions of the real Cybertruck, and come in two models: an 1:64 scale model, which costs $20, and an 1:10 scale model that costs $400. Both models went out of stock after pre-orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUlDI5"&gt;Tesla’s Cybertruck, unveiled in November 2019, is a futuristic, electric spin on a pickup truck. The angular, stainless steel truck has armored glass windows, though, embarrassingly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20981489/tesla-cybertruck-glass-window-fail-elon-musk-explanation"&gt;they shattered during a public test&lt;/a&gt;. Still, CEO Elon Musk has said it’s the “truck you want in the apocalypse.” The $69,900 tri-motor Cybertruck is expected to hit the road in late 2021, with the $39,900 rear-wheel drive version coming in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzGTxG"&gt;The $400 toy version of the truck is supposed to be hobbyist grade and off-roadable. And while it may not have the armored glass windows of the real thing, it does come with a sticker that makes its window look shattered, just like in the demo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXoWCL"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/26/17505744/elon-musk-fans-tesla-spacex-fandom"&gt;any hardcore Tesla fans&lt;/a&gt; who reserved the car may be disappointed, this is just another way that the model imitates reality. Tesla is infamous for its delays. The Model X shipped &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2015/09/03/elon-musk-confirms-september-29-delivery-first-model-x/"&gt;a year after was promised&lt;/a&gt;, the cheapest Model 3 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282810/tesla-model-3-standard-range-35000-delays"&gt;went past its delivery timeframe&lt;/a&gt;, and the Roadster’s release was supposed to be this year — &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/05/07/tesla-roadster-delay-2022-elon-musk/"&gt;but wasn’t&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cj0149"&gt;So in a sense, Hot Wheels is just trying to give you the experience of buying one of Tesla’s actual cars, just at a 1:100 scale cost.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Diablo Immortal plays like, well, Diablo on your phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E693NuxzSTxKyV68KfCZFo_gV0k=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68544832/DIM_AlphaAnnounce_DemonHunter_Female_CharacterSelectCinematic.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a9cddE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/em&gt; didn’t make a great first impression. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18056370/diablo-immortal-mobile-blizzard-blizzcon-2018"&gt;announced at Blizzcon in 2018&lt;/a&gt; when most fans were expecting the next mainline &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; title, not a free-to-play spinoff for smartphones. Since then, Blizzard has been very quiet about &lt;em&gt;Immortal &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942565/diablo-4-announced-release-date-blizzcon-2019"&gt;though &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt; was eventually announced&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCvR7y"&gt;That’s starting to change. Ahead of a technical alpha that’s set to kick off soon, I was able to play through the early stages of the game. And while I can’t speak to every aspect, one thing was immediately clear: this feels like a proper &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uULlQr"&gt;A mobile version of &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; makes a lot of sense. There are already countless clones and &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;-inspired titles on smartphones, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18055352/diablo-3-dark-souls-nintendo-switch-blizzard-from-software"&gt;the Nintendo Switch version of &lt;em&gt;Diablo III&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;proved just how fun the series is to play on the go. There’s just something about the hack and slash gameplay that makes it a great fit for a handheld experience. It’s the kind of game that can suck you in for hours and yet, paradoxically, is also something that doesn’t always require your full attention. I spent part of my time previewing &lt;em&gt;Immortal &lt;/em&gt;while I was also in a Zoom meeting. (Don’t tell Nilay.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQmBnR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Immortal&lt;/em&gt; takes place between the events of the last two &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; games, and it’s surprisingly story-heavy for a mobile title. There are brief cutscenes and lots of voice acting, though the actual narrative is typical &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; fare: you’re dropped into a small village overrun with the undead and cultists, while Deckard Cain tells you to collect magical shards that can stop some world-ending calamity — you know, regular &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fDaUV7ykamLAIyZSmuzX-R8YZVg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22179513/DIM_AlphaAnnounce_Barbarian_OnMadKingsBreach_SkeletonKingBossFight.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gxLMa3"&gt;More important is how the game plays. &lt;em&gt;Immortal&lt;/em&gt; features entirely touch-based controls (there’s no gamepad support right now) and they work surprisingly well. The left side of the screen is a virtual joystick so you can move around, while the right features all of your powers. It works just like a regular &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; title for the most part. You have a main attack and will quickly unlock special abilities, each with their own cooldowns. You just tap on the abilities to use them, and some require you to actually aim. The only big addition is a new class-specific “ultimate” ability, which is reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;; it’s an incredibly powerful attack, but one that builds up slowly, forcing you to use it sparingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1HCJG"&gt;The early-game dungeons I played through were all relatively small, which made them great for mobile, as I could squeeze them in when I just had 20 minutes or so to play. They were also relatively straightforward: I didn’t find myself doing much exploration in search of loot or other secrets. That said, I really enjoyed the boss fights and raids, which do a good job of increasing the scale with massive monsters and big waves of enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaeNov"&gt;Really, the fact that the game feels so familiar is arguably the best-case scenario. Blizzard seems to have done an admirable job of transporting the spirit of its loot-heavy roleplaying game to a smartphone. But there are also a few elements of the experience — ones that will likely be key to its longevity — that I couldn’t test out in this preview. For one thing, &lt;em&gt;Immortal&lt;/em&gt; is billed as a massively multiplayer game, one where tens of thousands of players exist simultaneously on one server. I saw a few players running around dungeons and graveyards while I played, but I couldn’t test out any of the actual social features.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qUL2poVYgGmWfr2Y8N9-MyUdCUY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22179551/DIM_AlphaAnnounce_PaperDoll_Monk.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dFpRSq"&gt;Perhaps the biggest question mark, though, is how Blizzard will monetize the game. The developer says all character classes and story content will be entirely free, and that gear isn’t something you can buy. Instead, you have to collect it out in the world by defeating monsters or completing quests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMQFn2"&gt;But there’s still plenty to buy, including stones that let you reforge an item, “crests” that add better rewards when you complete a randomized dungeon, and a battle pass that Blizzard says will refresh monthly. There’s even a player-to-player marketplace — though the developer is quick to say it’s nothing like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/17/4742120/blizzard-shutting-down-diablo-iii-auction-houses"&gt;the infamous auction house from&lt;em&gt; Diablo III&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZZhov"&gt;Here’s how Blizzard explains it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="z1qsZC"&gt;Before we get into the details let’s be clear — this is not the &lt;em&gt;Diablo III&lt;/em&gt; real-money auction house. Player exchange has been a part of &lt;em&gt;Diablo’&lt;/em&gt;s history, and we’ve learned many lessons–both good and bad–along the way. In &lt;em&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/em&gt; we want players to have the ability to participate in a fair, healthy, player-driven economy that doesn’t circumvent gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9dxP2R"&gt;The market connects anonymous buyers and sellers, with no ability to cash-out. There are limits to what can and cannot be put on the market. While it will be a possible source of certain materials, supplementary items, and legendary gems, it is not a place to acquire gear. It’s also a way for players who wish to remain free-to-play to exchange items they find for additional in-game currency, beyond what they’re able to earn through play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rLw58F"&gt;Those are some important question marks, though it’s likely it’ll still be a while before we have a complete picture of what &lt;em&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/em&gt; is. Blizzard is opening the game up to a small amount of Android users in Australia as part of this alpha, but there’s no word on when it will be available more broadly, as the game still doesn’t have a release date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moderna vaccine gets sign-off from independent FDA committee </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration, vials seen displayed in front of..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RxsHyOTSVxx6n9ZywHq9HWL9-eg=/0x0:4302x2868/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68544570/1230147325.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EdgcqK"&gt;An independent committee of experts recommended that the Food and Drug Administration authorize the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for people 18 and older. This is the second COVID-19 vaccine to go before the committee — the first, made by Pfizer and BioNTech, was authorized last week. The agency is expected to issue an authorization for Moderna’s vaccine within a day or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AzuIhK"&gt;“This is a really opportune time for us to move science forward,” said Hayley Gans, a committee member and professor of pediatrics at Stanford University Medical Center, during the committee’s deliberations. The evidence available for benefits of the vaccine outweighs any issues, she said. “That really supports us being able to, with the pandemic in the background, really move forward, and finally provide a safe and effective way to get to herd immunity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPQdxL"&gt;The FDA’s review of the vaccine ahead of the meeting confirmed that it’s safe and 94 percent effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19, all but guaranteeing a vote of confidence. The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), which met to discuss the data, spent the day discussing the additional questions remaining around the vaccine and how Moderna should handle vaccinations in the placebo group of its clinical trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CN9nRu"&gt;To test how well the vaccine works, during the clinical trial some people received a placebo, or an inactive shot instead of the vaccine. Moderna said during its presentation that the company plans to offer active vaccines to people who got the placebo quickly. Pfizer and BioNTech, on the other hand, plan to wait for participants in the placebo group to become eligible under their vaccine prioritization plans before telling them of their placebo status. Moderna would vaccinate this group with doses set aside for the clinical trial, which the company argues means study participants aren’t cutting in line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Vfhve"&gt;Telling the placebo group that they did, in fact, receive a placebo limits the ability to study the vaccine. If people &lt;em&gt;know &lt;/em&gt;they didn’t get a vaccine, their behavior might change, and once they actually get a vaccine, researchers will no longer have a control to compare with the vaccinated group. That worries the VRBPAC, which would like to collect data for as long as possible. The pharmaceutical companies, though, both said they think they have a responsibility to offer vaccines to the placebo group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Zm1sJ"&gt;The committee also pointed to a handful of issues the clinical trials still haven’t addressed. Moderna still doesn’t know, for example, if the vaccine can protect against asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 — stopping infection with the coronavirus entirely — or if it just prevents symptoms. Early data from Moderna hints that it could block asymptomatic infection. Trial participants who didn’t have symptoms were tested for the coronavirus between their first and second dose. People who took the vaccine were less likely to test positive than people in the placebo group. More answers on that question are coming in January, Moderna said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dil9kx"&gt;Moderna is still analyzing data collected after it submitted the vaccine for authorization. There were 450 more cases of disease reported in the trial after that submission, and that will add to the understanding of the vaccine’s efficacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GELek"&gt;As this vaccine and the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine are distributed throughout the country, the pharmaceutical companies and federal agencies will track how well they work and how safe they are in the real world. Already, regulators are finding effects that weren’t seen in clinical trials — a handful of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/16/health/covid-pfizer-vaccine-allergic-reaction.html"&gt;allergic reactions&lt;/a&gt; and cases of anaphylaxis were reported in the US and United Kingdom in people vaccinated with the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine, for example. The FDA is investigating the US incidents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3mS4K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0JZZh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pbswyc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSeAwh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAhwtn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is now testing its Clubhouse-like voice chat rooms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot showing the interface for joining a Space" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cBlhvPFHEjfvsexzxbCcEXGiitA=/0x6:1123x755/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68544274/IMG_0335.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iJZnx6"&gt;Twitter has begun testing its Spaces feature, the voice-based chat rooms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570150/twitter-spaces-clubhouse-voice-rooms-testing"&gt;it first announced last month&lt;/a&gt;. In the thread announcing the test, the company said a very small group of users would be given the ability to create Spaces, but that in theory anyone could join them — though who would be allowed into any given space depends on the user who created it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P91Gwb"&gt;Twitter outlined last month how the first people to be given access to Spaces would be women and people from other marginalized communities, groups who are more likely than others to be subjected to abuse and harassment when trying to engage in conversations in regular, comment-based discussions on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pDeiSP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;aye we’re live! what up y’all, we're the team behind Spaces––a small experiment focused on the intimacy of the human voice &lt;/p&gt;— Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1339639767089238019?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EnVdaw"&gt;Moderation seems to be a big focus of Spaces. Creators can control who can or cannot speak in the Space, and there are reporting and blocking features included in the first version. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the Spaces interface for a listener" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yfz8xwggONqUcWtcPp7JaspAgmc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22180498/IMG_0337.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Spaces interface for a listener.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vN08Ux"&gt;Other features that are being tested include emoji reactions, being able to share tweets in a Space, and a “very early version” of live voice transcription. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the reaction feature in a Space" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6N2kZDedYz7abWhcXG3YsFEjjh0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22180483/IMG_0339.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users in a space can react with certain emojis, which will show over their profile picture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xqXPlx"&gt;At the moment, it seems like joining a Space only works from the Twitter mobile app — trying to join from the web just takes you to a “page not found” error. Strangely enough, joining one requires having Periscope integration enabled. That’s the live-streaming service that Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176842/twitter-periscope-shut-down-live-video-streaming-apps-2021"&gt;just announced it was shutting down&lt;/a&gt;, so it remains to be seen how Twitter plans to handle the technical backend of its voice chats once Periscope does disappear. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this LA Times report about how toxic jet fumes can seep into the air on planes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Airplane landing (SHUTTERSTOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yu-y5fmVUd5JFaMIu5xf9ekryaY=/1x0:1000x666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68544244/shutterstock_1236434.1419979666.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lry8Oa"&gt;A stunning new &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/toxic-chemicals-planes-covid-19-travel-woes/"&gt;report from the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; details how toxic jet engine fumes can leak into airplanes’ air supplies, sickening passengers and crew — and the airline industry has known this was a problem for several decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2JtCP"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reports that one pilot told colleagues the situation was “the tobacco and asbestos of aviation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Gp9Wpz"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; analysis of NASA safety reports from January 2018 to December 2019 identified 362 fume events that airline crew members reported to the agency, with nearly 400 pilots, flight attendants and passengers receiving medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="06Q8vP"&gt;“Fume events” occur when heated jet engine oil leaks into the air supply, causing toxic gases inside the plane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLmGOt"&gt;Airlines and airplane makers are aware that fume events have potentially serious problems. People can get quite sick when breathing in these fumes, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; report, but they haven’t taken measures to prevent the problem even though the technology exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="57X0jE"&gt;Airlines have been asking Boeing to install air sensors for years. But the company decided against developing the technology. Senior Boeing engineers worried that data from sensors would prove damaging in lawsuits by sick passengers and crew members, according to internal emails and sworn depositions obtained by The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcx1Ou"&gt;An internal Boeing memo described it as a “risk” to give air sensors to even one airline, according to a deposition of a Boeing executive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nyiOIn"&gt;The fumes tend to smell like dirty socks or a gym locker, according to people who have experienced it. And while not everyone gets sick, the fumes can give people flu-like symptoms, including vomiting and chills, and they have been linked in some cases to more serious neurological problems. Airlines aren’t required to report fume events, the article notes, and the Federal Aviation Administration “has no plans” to require air filters or air sensors in planes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OGakln"&gt;A lot of us aren’t flying due to the pandemic and may be feeling a bit wistful about eventually being able to travel again. But before you book those tickets, go read &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/toxic-chemicals-planes-covid-19-travel-woes/"&gt;Kiera Feldman’s incredible investigation&lt;/a&gt; into jet fuel fumes aboard airplanes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnQ05Z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHnW7p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google to shut down Android Things, a smart home OS that never took off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dhQPG1EqqFKmtrGbK0mQzOkpTas=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68544194/acastro_180413_1777_android_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cmh3tA"&gt;Google plans to &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/things/faq"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; Android Things, a stripped-down version of Android designed for smart home devices. The OS never really got off the ground, so this isn’t all that much of a loss, but it is yet another entry in Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning"&gt;expansive graveyard&lt;/a&gt; of shut-down projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdf0Rk"&gt;The smart home project got its start in 2015 under the name Brillo, which was meant to provide the “underlying operating system for the internet of things.” In 2016, Google revamped Brillo and relaunched the initiative as Android Things, which was likewise meant to run on products like connected speakers, security cameras, and routers. By relying on Android, the OS was supposed to be familiar to developers and easy to get started with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k7BGWl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The system will shut down in January 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sRWWuT"&gt;Then nothing happened. In 2018, some initial smart speakers and smart displays came out using the underlying OS. It seems no other companies were interested, because in February 2019, Google announced it was “refocusing” Android Things to cater specifically to smart speakers and smart displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vnQFsa"&gt;Nearly two years later, and Android Things is now on track to be shut down. The Android Things Console, which lets developers push updates to their devices, will stop accepting new non-commercial projects starting January 5th, 2021. A year later, on January 5th, 2022, “the console will be turned down completely and all project data will be permanently deleted.” That essentially means developers have a year to wind down any Android Things projects they already have set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orgTmT"&gt;It’s an inglorious ending for a project that, over five years, barely made a dent in the landscape, particularly as smart home devices began to boom in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8lPNq"&gt;In case you’re interested, here’s the story of Android Things, told across all four headlines it made on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 vaccine monitoring program limited to English speakers  </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zbDbSD"&gt;A text message program designed to track side effects in COVID-19 vaccine recipients is currently only available in English, which could limit the data it is able to collect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8o8ex"&gt;The program, called v-safe, is one way the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will follow up with people who take the vaccine. It was rolled out with the first wave of vaccinations last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huipgA"&gt;“When you’re talking about technology, literacy and language are usually second tier,” says Jorge Rodriguez, a health technology equity researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “Version one is English-speaking, and the Spanish version will come later, the Mandarin version will come later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6kwK6"&gt;The CDC plans to roll out a Spanish version of v-safe “fairly shortly,” Tom Shimabukuro, a member of the Vaccine Safety Team on the COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The agency also plans to offer v-safe in simplified Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese, but Shimabukuro did not have a timeline for when that might be available. “They’re all in the process of undergoing a translation from English to these other languages,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_t8fsHha7kcg1FeYMTn5wDtKmlE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22180421/v_safe_how_to_01_get_started__2x.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CDC&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The CDC’s v-safe program is currently only available in English.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7xDb6B"&gt;The agency’s information toolkit around the COVID-19 vaccines, which includes fact sheets for the health care workers who are part of the first wave of vaccinations, is also still only available in English. Translations of the kit into other languages are in progress — Spanish first, and then other languages, the CDC says. The lag is a concern for the approximately &lt;a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/limited-english-proficient-population-united-states-2011#13"&gt;25 million people&lt;/a&gt; in the United States who speak limited English. Information about vaccines must be available for people with low literacy and broadly translated, said David Curry, executive director of the New York University and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia-affiliated Center for Vaccine Ethics and Policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqZGlc"&gt;“We energetically urge and are confident that CDC will extend a special effort to enhance these materials,” he said in a public comment made during the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting, held on December 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdKDfe"&gt;Until those translations are complete, the agency’s vaccination information and the v-safe program may not be easily accessible for non-English speakers. Even after translation, people who speak languages other than those that v-safe plans to include may not be able to participate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPEtxs"&gt;The portion of vaccine recipients not covered by these languages might not be enormous, but it overlaps with groups that tend to already be underserved by the health care system. Non-English speakers tend to have worse health outcomes overall, and they’ve had worse &lt;a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200331.77927/full/"&gt;outcomes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/hospitals-have-left-many-covid19-patients-who-dont-speak-english-alone-confused-and-without-proper-care"&gt;from&lt;/a&gt; COVID-19 as well. “Given the disparities that we’ve seen in terms of outcomes in the pandemic, for this specific vaccination campaign, it’s even more critical to really get the information out in various languages,” Rodriguez says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="OFqkX0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Non-English speakers tend to have worse health outcomes overall&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JxA3lt"&gt;Pharmaceutical companies and federal agencies made a notable effort to enroll diverse populations in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials. Dropping some of that focus during vaccine follow-ups like v-safe could stall that work. “You do wonder how much you will lose on the progress made in those trials by having this be one of your primary ways to collect data on symptoms and follow up after the vaccine,” Rodriguez says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YihTE8"&gt;V-safe is only one of a number of ways the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will monitor the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines. Other systems include the two-decade-old Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), where doctors and individuals can report any reactions that they think could be linked to a vaccine. It’s a spontaneous surveillance system — the federal agencies depend on people sending in reports, Shimabukuro says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4cfX1"&gt;V-safe, in contrast, is the agency’s active surveillance program and the way the CDC is reaching out to people and asking them about their experience with a vaccine. It’ll capture a different set of information than VAERS, including information from people who had no or minimal side effects. By starting with English, and only including a handful of other languages later on, that data could be limited, Rodriguez says. “You’re setting yourself up for disparities in vaccination tracking,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BAMZwg"&gt;The CDC’s information page on v-safe is already available in multiple languages, which is a good start, Rodriguez says. Translating the page &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html"&gt;only changes&lt;/a&gt; the text on the page, not the information in the images of the app in action. “It’s going to exclude a good chunk of the population, and that’s the same underserved group that may have low literacy, which is often essential workers, who may have had worse health outcomes during the pandemic,” Rodriguez says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwZZBS"&gt;That’s why it’s important to have multiple ways to collect data on vaccination outcomes. “I’m a big fan of technology,” he says. “But we have to acknowledge its limitations and capture some of this information in other ways to make sure the sample you’re getting is really representative of the population.”&lt;/p&gt;
