  &lt;p id="LLcFd2"&gt;If you’ve been waiting on a good deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;for the latest Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, today might be delivering that for you — if you really wanted the all-red version. The 40mm-sized Apple Watch Series 6 with a red sport band and red aluminum case costs $299 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5RBMRN?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F478251261&amp;amp;subid1=TheVergeDeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739048946150992341#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, down from its original $399 price. At $299, it’s just a $20 jump from the $279 Apple Watch SE to get a better smartwatch with slightly faster specs. The big differences in the Series 6 include its always-on display, its ability to take blood oxygen readings, and it has the U1 ultra wideband chip.&lt;/p&gt;

These recharge by sliding onto the sides of your Switch, just like Joy-Con. As for the Switch Lite, they’ll work wirelessly, but you’ll need to find another way to charge them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s new ‘Play Something’ shuffle feature is here to solve your movie night indecision</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CSdThDUexJrZdoRWn3mHHY-ITgI=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198544/US_NETFLIX_TV_Comp_00003.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c60Dqd"&gt;Netflix is officially rolling out its new “Play Something” feature today to all its users, adding a button across the streaming service’s UI to automatically suggest new shows and movies that you’ve never watched before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoLYTA"&gt;The Play Something button will appear in several places on Netflix’s app, including underneath your profile when you log in, the left-side navigation bar, and in the tenth row of Netflix’s homepage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40sARm"&gt;The company has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240550/netflix-shuffle-play-movies-shows-viewing-history"&gt;testing the feature for months&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21374543/netflix-shuffle-play-test-random-tv-movies"&gt;under a variety of names&lt;/a&gt; (including “Shuffle Play”), but today marks its official worldwide debut for all Netflix users. To start, the company is rolling out the Play Something button on TV-based versions of the Netflix app, but it has plans to start testing it on Android devices, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LnIBmphCdWpmm10Xdq-zixdMDcA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475253/US_NETFLIX_TV_Comp_00004.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CSuifY"&gt;Netflix is stressing that the Play Something button isn’t just a “random” button that throws you to the metaphorical wolves of the streaming service’s nearly endless well of content. Rather, the feature uses your existing profile and taste in shows and movies to surface similar titles based on what kinds of things you already watch. The button will show a variety of algorithmically curated content, including entirely new shows and movies, series or films you’ve already started, or something on your watchlist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWSGZE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDh7yO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES will return to Las Vegas as an in-person event in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CES-2016-stock-verge-11" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/osKvpWnTtdE4faur1z1ksYssQno=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198458/CES-2016-stock-verge-11.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9KQEWb"&gt;The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is officially returning to an in-person format in Las Vegas in 2022, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) announced today, marking the return of the largest tech conference in the world next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOPS2R"&gt;“We’re thrilled to return to Las Vegas – home to CES for more than 40 years – and look forward to seeing many new and returning faces,” said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the CTA, in an announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2oAGe"&gt;For what it’s worth, the CTA had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344977/ces-2021-online-cta-las-vegas-conference-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;always intended to return to an in-person CES in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. The group had already announced plans to do so in July 2020, when it announced that CES 2021 would be shifting to an all-digital format due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Other major tech conferences, like IFA 2021 in the fall, are also returning to in-person events this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bbda2"&gt;CES 2022 will be held from January 5th through the 8th, with the usual media days preceding the conference itself on January 3rd and 4th. According to the announcement, the upcoming conference will be a hybrid of sorts, with events set to take place both physically and digitally. Confirmed attendees will include major tech companies like Amazon, AMD, AT&amp;amp;T, Dell, Google, Hyundai, IBM, Intel, Lenovo, LG, Panasonic, Qualcomm, Samsung, and Sony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0HHLlP"&gt;The CTA says that CES 2022 will be following the CDC’s coronavirus safety guidelines, along with state and local guidelines for Nevada and the city of Las Vegas to ensure a safe event for attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is adding COVID-19-related information to searches for travel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/elWecdlROtbuM826mojKXtoAuQw=/165x0:1635x980/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198250/Explore_Map.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gQD7M8"&gt;Google has unveiled new tools to help people planning their first post-vaccination vacations, as COVID-19 restrictions and requirements still vary widely among domestic and international travel destinations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjReuL"&gt;A Google search for flights, hotels, or things to do will now also bring up results for any COVID-19-related travel advisories or restrictions at the searcher’s destination. Google has added additional travel restriction details, including whether quarantine is required or if you have to show proof of immunization or a negative COVID-19 test. Users can choose to receive updates about when restrictions are lifted or added for a given destination. The updates are country-specific and state-specific within the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yd7rQq"&gt;Under the “explore” &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/travel/"&gt;tab on Google’s travel page&lt;/a&gt;, people can browse not just for flights but filter destinations by interests, like beaches or skiing. When you choose a destination, you’ll get the updated information on any travel advisories or restrictions as well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VOews-4-4OYcM82ow8tjXSa7n94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471671/COVID_19_Advisory_on_Search.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="r2pChl"&gt;After pandemic lockdowns and travel restrictions kept many people at home much of last year, Google isn’t the only company preparing for the return of travel. Expedia Group — which includes online travel agent (OTA) websites Expedia, Vrbo, Travelocity, Hotels.com, and others — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373546/expedia-travel-restriction-tool-destination"&gt;created its Travel Advisor tool&lt;/a&gt; to help customers plan trips and follow any COVID-19 restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iW82TU"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still recommends Americans delay travel until they’ve been fully vaccinated, after which they can travel safely within the US. The agency &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/map-and-travel-notices.html"&gt;has a map&lt;/a&gt; showing where travel may be especially risky due to the coronavirus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ab1ejf"&gt;And while Americans are still barred from traveling to many international destinations, a European Union official &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/25/world/europe/american-travel-to-europe.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;over the weekend that Americans fully vaccinated against the coronavirus should be able to visit the EU this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UmzHpE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICtYpf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Pokémon Snap is a supremely chill safari on the Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QDobB0yjcLc0e8_eGrKg48HYORU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198235/Switch_NewPokemonSnap_Screenshots_Feb26__35_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="18FDCh"&gt;Virtual worlds have long been a place to escape. That was true before the pandemic, but lockdowns and stay-at-home orders across the world certainly accelerated the phenomenon. I spent an embarrassing amount of time last year gardening in &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; and going to concerts in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. They were great distractions, but never really gave that vacation-like escape I was truly searching for — turns out what I needed was a safari full of Squirtles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uVf2m"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt; launches this week as the long-awaited sequel to a fan-favorite Nintendo 64 game from 1999. The premise remains the same: you, a budding wildlife photographer, traverse beautiful landscapes while snapping photos of every critter you can find. At its core the concept is incredibly simple, but — much like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; — it’s a form of wish fulfillment. It takes out the battling and complex roleplaying elements that drive the main &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; games and instead just lets you be a part of this world, at your own pace, and without the threat of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XN8nO"&gt;There is a story, but it’s pretty simple. At the outset, you join a research expedition exploring the new Lental region, and naturally they need some help documenting the wildlife. The Lental region is actually a string of islands with a surprising amount of biodiversity. You start out in a fairly run-of-the-mill wildlife preserve, but eventually you’ll be riding a sort of futuristic, enclosed hovercraft through deserts, beaches, volcanic trails, and even underwater. In many cases, you’ll be able to see the areas during both day and night, giving you a better understanding of how the animals behave.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fbv5CRzk3UBEgLe8Ovtk40xeCX8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22473300/Switch_NewPokemonSnap_Screenshots_Feb26__22_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jO9C1E"&gt;You move through these environments on rails, as if you were on a ride at a particularly cool amusement park, and view the world through the lens of your camera. The main goal is to take pictures. Each area is teeming with creatures: birds soaring through the air, bugs digging through the sand, Machamps flexing for anyone who happens to be looking. The most impressive part might just be the density. There are pokémon seemingly everywhere, just waiting for the right moment to pop out and reveal themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPvUYx"&gt;The goal is to catalog as many creatures as you can. Just like in the main games, you have a pokédex of sorts, only this time you fill it out by photographing monsters. You’re supposed to capture them in different poses, and at the end of each level a professor will rate each photo based on things like framing, pose, and whether there are any other creatures in the shot. Outside of your camera, you have a few ways to interact with the world. You can toss out berries to feed pokémon (or annoy sleeping ones), play a lullaby to get their attention, or scan your surroundings to center on points of interest. There are also bonus quests that ask you to capture very specific images — like a sleeping Arbok falling out of a tree, or a yawning Torterra — for extra points. As your overall score increases, you’ll unlock new areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0UCmN"&gt;But your most important tool is careful observation. And that’s because &lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt; is a game largely built on repetition. You’ll be traveling through the same areas many, many times in search of new things. There are twists — you may get a new tool, and some levels have multiple pathways — but actually getting good photos requires a lot of time, patience, and experimentation. You might have to keep your camera trained on a soaring Wingull in hopes it does a loop-de-loop, or try multiple tactics to get a Magikarp to do, well, anything. Sometimes I would toss berries at everything just to see what happened. (Mostly it resulted in some adorably angry pokémon faces.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7L6BCi"&gt;Initially this process felt tedious, particularly early on, when there were only two spaces for me to explore. It was almost boring, like riding the same slow rollercoaster over and over. But this feeling changed when I started looking closer. It was amazing how many creatures I missed the first (or tenth) time I went through a level. But when I looked closely, there they were, hiding in shrubs or in undersea caves. Sometimes if I watched for long enough, I could see pokémon fighting or cuddling together for warmth. The more time I spent in these places the more I started to notice the fine details — and the more I wanted to search out even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6zGWf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snap&lt;/em&gt; also does a great job of creating spectacle. Those quiet moments are punctuated by the shock of a giant Wailord rising out of the sea in front of you, or the joy of spotting a flock of cute Squirtles just hanging out on a beach. It’s enough to make me long for a &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game in VR.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dgrf8A_ZwKgWdomtH96S-f_-GlE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22473305/Switch_NewPokemonSnap_Screenshots_Feb26__9_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c72o0A"&gt;This is helped by the fact that &lt;em&gt;Snap&lt;/em&gt; moves at a leisurely place. There are some photos where you have to react quickly, but if you miss the shot, you can always try again. There’s no penalty for failure; bad photos are simply discarded. The emphasis is on celebrating your triumphs. When I couldn’t figure out how to capture the photo I needed to progress, I did run into a few roadblocks, which were frustrating. But generally &lt;em&gt;Snap&lt;/em&gt; is a game that rewards curiosity and does little to punish players for not following the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTHzV9"&gt;(It should also be noted that one of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;’s most intriguing features wasn’t available to test ahead of launch. The game includes an Instagram-like photo sharing mode, where you can add filters, stickers, and borders to your images and then share them online with others. It’s a feature that could add a new social element to the series, but I haven’t been able to test it yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yMn1M"&gt;Really, &lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt; is a game that forced me to change the way I think about virtual spaces. Decades of playing games have conditioned me to race through levels, checking off a to-do list of accomplishments as efficiently as possible. But that doesn’t work here. I had to slow down and watch carefully, focusing on the small details as well as the big moments. I had to relax to enjoy the view — and it’s exactly what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrKytl"&gt;&lt;small&gt;New Pokémon Snap &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is available on the Nintendo Switch on April 30th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft has commissioned five new fonts for Office.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IuPePR"&gt;Microsoft is changing its default Office font next year and wants everyone to help pick the new default. While there are more than 700 font options in Word, Microsoft has commissioned five new custom fonts for Office, in a move away from the Calibri font that has been the default in Microsoft Office for nearly 15 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCdzJY"&gt;The five new sans-serif fonts feature a variety of styles, including traditional, modern, and even one inspired by German road and railway signs. Microsoft is starting to gather feedback on these five new fonts today, and it plans to set one as the new Office default font in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e_3xNhV1vd98gjufcrFZ3Qo-uyA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475056/next.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new Office fonts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dYo2RA"&gt;Tenorite, created by Erin McLaughlin and Wei Huang, is the more traditional style out of the five. It almost looks like a more modern version of the default Times New Roman font from decades ago, with wide characters, accents, and clear punctuation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9Arw6"&gt;Skeena, created by John Hudson and Paul Hanslow, feels inspired by various periods of font design. It has big variations in the thick and thin parts of its letters, along with very distinct curves on letters like S, A, and J.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7xow-zd2KI2oE1vIr7HSUAw160=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475057/Skeena_104.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Skeena font.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Cjmj6F"&gt;Bierstadt by Steve Mattison is inspired by mid-20th-century Swiss typography. The stroke endings are very clearly cut off, but there’s some subtle softening to avoid the rigid grid-based typography you typically find with a font like this. Helvetica is the most famous example of this type of “grotesque san serif” font, and Mattison has attempted to contrast Microsoft’s Arial font here, too. Mattison named the font after a rocky mountain in Colorado that reminds him of the Swiss Alps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFhVvX"&gt;Seaford by Tobias Frere-Jones, Nina Stössinger, and Fred Shallcrass, feels the most immediately familiar out of the bunch, invoking the classic old-style serif text typefaces. The designers took inspiration from old armchairs to find a practical way to bring a classic, valued font back to life without the serifs. I’ve been testing all the new fonts in Word, and this one in particular feels the most comfortable for reading long documents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PQon-UBC0tq0ZdeoMBiOSF3e13w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475059/Grandview_108.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grandview draws inspiration from classic German railway signage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VxcFiK"&gt;Grandview is the most striking of all five new fonts. Created by Aaron Bell, it draws inspiration from classic German road and railway signage. Much like the signs, this font is designed to be highly legible, with some tweaks to make it more comfortable for long-form reading. Based on the spirit of the German industrial standard, Grandview looks like it would work well in PowerPoint slides in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBDbNG"&gt;Microsoft is now &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fblog%2F2021%2F04%2F28%2Fbeyond-calibri-finding-microsofts-next-default-font%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;releasing these five new fonts&lt;/a&gt; in Microsoft 365 so everyone can try them out before a new default is chosen. Polls and feedback will be considered as part of how Microsoft picks a winner, and the company is going to spend the next few months evaluating these new fonts and seeing which ones are proving popular. Once a decision has been made, the new default font will appear in Microsoft Office apps in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Messages gets One UI-inspired redesign on recent Samsung flagships</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ch1vt6_NLoK8sH3bBnc2aqFebW0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198083/vpavic_210118_4377_0119.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2dXjib"&gt;Google’s Messages app is getting a redesign on Samsung’s Galaxy S21 devices, bringing its appearance into line with Samsung’s other One UI software, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-messages-galaxy-s21-one-ui-design/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Screenshots posted by &lt;em&gt;XDA &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS21/comments/mwav0k/google_messages_adopting_a_oneui_design_anyone/"&gt;users on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; show the app’s home screen has been divided into two sections: an upper information area with an unread messages counter and a lower section with links to each conversation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXN2Db"&gt;The redesign follows Samsung’s decision to use Google’s messaging app as the default for its S21 lineup in select markets. With the redesign the Messages app now looks like it belongs as a default, with a look that’s similar to other Samsung software like its Notes or Settings apps. However, in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s21-makes-google-messages-app-native/"&gt;Samsung Messages is still the default&lt;/a&gt; messaging app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/adJl93OB6F_tPCxPBjY-x8XS1IY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475098/Google_Messages_One_UI_Design_461x1024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-messages-galaxy-s21-one-ui-design/" target="_blank"&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The home screen now features a large title area in the top half.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KKzb6F"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/27/google-messages-one-ui-galaxy-s21/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that Google has been testing the redesign previously, but that it’s now getting a widespread rollout on S21 devices outside of the US. With the app’s appearance now more in line with Samsung’s design style, it will be interesting to see whether Samsung is tempted to make Google’s app its default within the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2021 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2iIPOLTeVnmDapM8oGy4aW1GZ30=/0x1:1100x734/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198042/DSC_4935.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JKEk79"&gt;If you’re a Samsung fan — or just curious about what the manufacturer means when it announces that “the most powerful Galaxy is coming” — then you may want to drop in on today’s Galaxy Unpacked event 10AM ET / 7AM PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9DezX"&gt;There isn’t a lot of info out there about what’s in store. But those who have been following Samsung can made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382512/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-april-28th-event-most-powerful-device-book-pro"&gt;a few educated guesses&lt;/a&gt;. These include the possibility of a new line of Galaxy Book laptops — a line that is certainly due for a refresh, since the last models were first announced in 2019. Other rumors include new Galaxy Book Pro laptops with 13.3-inch and 15.6-inch OLED panels, and S-Pen support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Dnz5s"&gt;Want to be the first to find out for sure? We’ll stream it above, so feel free to stick around, but there are other ways to watch it as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="l4kc6b"&gt;You can tune into the live stream, which starts at 10AM ET / 7AM PT today, Wednesday, April 28th. The event will likely be available to watch again after it concludes, so you’re not stuck if you miss out on the debut stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gAIWaj"&gt;WHERE CAN I WATCH THE SAMSUNG EVENT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XbxczI"&gt;You can watch it at the top of this article; in addition, Samsung is &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hosting the stream on its site&lt;/a&gt; and it’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/PUtk3ryShOo"&gt;streaming on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify premium subscriber count increases 21 percent to 158 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sNG6o8OSqmmBmnydStQKewVpj6w=/208x0:1162x636/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69197577/image__7_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify’s subscriber growth.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zksf6g"&gt;Spotify now boasts 158 million premium subscribers and 356 million monthly active users, according to its &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-28/spotify-reports-first-quarter-2021-earnings/"&gt;latest earnings report&lt;/a&gt; released today. That’s a 21 percent and 24 percent year-over-year increase, respectively. It’s up from 155 million premium subscribers and 345 million monthly active users last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ittJB7"&gt;The streaming service has continued to focus on podcasts both as a way to convert free listeners to premium subscribers, and as a way to generate ad revenue. Spotify said that ad-supported revenue outperformed its forecast thanks in part to its podcasting efforts. In particular, the company said the Joe Rogan Experience, which it now exclusively licenses, “performed above expectations.” Spotify says it’s seen a “strong increase” in the amount of hours of podcast listening on the platform, though the actual proportion of users listening to podcasts was “consistent” with the previous quarter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCjvAJ"&gt;Just yesterday Spotify announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404273/spotify-podcast-subscriptions-monetize-subscriber-shows"&gt;launch of podcast subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s only rolling them out for select partners at the moment and has said podcasters won’t have to pay it for the service for the first two years, meaning we’re unlikely to see it generating any extra revenue for Spotify until 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VKavasvO_RvpN1Ai36dBUUF0XAY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475049/Spotify_Q1_2021_Earnings_Infographic_Motion_20210428.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hrQccw"&gt;It’s a similar story with the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22380014/spotify-car-thing-release-voice-control-data-interactive-ads"&gt;Car Thing music player&lt;/a&gt; which is only getting a limited launch for now, and which the company is currently giving away rather than selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQqQuB"&gt;Today’s release follows Spotify’s announcement that it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403813/spotify-price-increase-subscriptions-2021"&gt;soon be increasing prices&lt;/a&gt; for its family plan in the US and Duo, Student, and Family plans in the UK and some European countries. Today’s numbers give a possible reason for the increases: Spotify’s falling average revenue per subscriber. Spotify says it earned an average of €4.12 (around $4.97) per premium subscriber. That’s a decrease of 7 percent compared to the same period the previous year. Within Spotify’s premium business, average revenue per user has declined for five out of the six previous quarters due to Spotify using discounted plans to attract subscribers in new markets like Russia and India, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-adds-subscribers-as-covid-19-boosts-at-home-streaming-11619604000"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mna6li"&gt;Spotify consistently cites “product mix” as the reason for this decline, suggesting that more of its users are opting for cheaper subscription bundles. Increasing the price of these bundles could help slow the trend. Today’s earnings release only covers the period up until the end of March, so we won’t see any impact of this week’s price increases until next quarter, if that. But Spotify reports that the increases have shown no “material impacts” on cancellation rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUKBhy"&gt;Amidst these price increases, Spotify is also attempting to push back against criticism that it doesn’t pay artists enough to stream their music. Last month it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336087/spotify-loud-clear-website-launch-pay-artists-streaming-royalities"&gt;launched a new website&lt;/a&gt; called Loud &amp;amp; Clear where it attempted to offer more transparency about its payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WkfcE"&gt;Overall, Spotify made a profit of €23 million, up from €1 million a year before, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-adds-subscribers-as-covid-19-boosts-at-home-streaming-11619604000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3Ym6N"&gt;Perhaps the biggest change to Spotify’s core music streaming business is due to arrive later this year when it launches its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;HiFi lossless streaming tier&lt;/a&gt;. The service promises it “will deliver music in CD-quality, lossless audio format to your device and Spotify Connect-enabled speakers” in the “select markets” where it’s launching. Pricing for the new subscription tier is yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
