  &lt;p&gt;TikTok tour guides will show you their city — and the places hooking them up&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="VcwdZC"&gt;One of Jack Gillespie’s most popular TikToks is a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@visualsbyjack/video/6957145581487787269?source=h5_m&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1"&gt;speedy tour&lt;/a&gt; through Selfie Wrld, a photo studio in Chicago where visitors can take pictures of themselves on a golden throne, in a bathtub-shaped ball pit, or in a bright yellow jail cell. Scroll through Gillespie’s TikTok page, and you can find plenty of other novelties to check out around Chicago — &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@visualsbyjack/video/6987591190812118277?source=h5_m&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1"&gt;salt therapy caves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@visualsbyjack/video/6984175491997519109?source=h5_m&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1"&gt;axe throwing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@visualsbyjack/video/6983883032524606725?source=h5_m&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1"&gt;transit-themed ice cream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@visualsbyjack/video/6975729684361350406?source=h5_m&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1"&gt;Hot Cheetos burgers&lt;/a&gt; — without having to read a single Yelp review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWdMQA"&gt;TikTok tour guides like Gillespie now seem to exist in every major city, introducing viewers to trendy new shops and restaurants, often in a minute or less. You can get recommendations for soju margaritas in Manhattan, crystal shops in Los Angeles, or burgers in Boston. These accounts can be great ways to learn about new locations and a boon for local businesses that suddenly see lines out the door. But they also come with hidden limitations, with influencers gravitating toward newer, hipper businesses — and often ones that are willing to compensate them for the chance to go viral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lHlzjA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I want people to see the city the way I see it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wIML2I"&gt;“I want people to see the city the way I see it,” says Gillespie, whose TikTok account &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@visualsbyjack?lang=en"&gt;@visualsbyjack&lt;/a&gt; has collected more than 300,000 followers. “There’s something really special about our city, and you’ve really got to just look around and experience it for yourself to see that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4UNta9"&gt;A viral video from a TikToker can have an almost immediate impact on the business it features. A TikTok Gillespie posted from the Museum of Illusions in Chicago got over 2 million views, and, within the next week, guests who said they heard about the museum through TikTok rose by 21 percent, according to Stacy Stec, the museum’s communications director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="jtDgAV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@danielles_eats/video/6974583392507661574" data-video-id="6974583392507661574" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@danielles_eats" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@danielles_eats"&gt;@danielles_eats&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Boston’s first quick service charcuterie store!!!   &lt;a title="bostonfoodies" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bostonfoodies"&gt;#bostonfoodies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="boston" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/boston"&gt;#boston&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="beaconhill" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/beaconhill"&gt;#beaconhill&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="charcuterie" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/charcuterie"&gt;#charcuterie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ A-Punk - Vampire Weekend" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/A-Punk-6751217497875171330"&gt;♬ A-Punk - Vampire Weekend&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WxF1NL"&gt;“The fact that with TikTok, you’re able to have influencers come in for free and get that kind of reach, is incredible,” Stec says. Stec arranged for Gillespie and his friends to visit in February, after he initially reached out. “And we got that without really spending a dime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtxREe"&gt;Influencers like Gillespie can often arrange to have their food or ticket compensated by agreeing to post a TikTok to their account. These exchanges are informal — no one signs a contract, and usually, businesses or influencers themselves arrange this over Instagram DMs. When Gillespie first moved to Chicago, he and his roommates didn’t pay for a meal for two weeks because Gillespie was always able to find a restaurant that would cover the cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If a video of mine goes viral, I’ll have several hundred DMs the next day from businesses and restaurants,” Gillespie says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The process of finding new businesses to feature can be expensive and tedious for influencers, so some choose to only feature businesses that compensate them through free meals or services. “People will say, ‘Go to a family-owned restaurant,’ and honestly the reason I don’t is that those aren’t the restaurants reaching out to me and I do have a pretty busy schedule,” says &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@danielles_eats?lang=en"&gt;Danielle Heath&lt;/a&gt;, a Boston-based TikToker with over 25,000 followers. “So I’m going to prioritize the restaurants that show interest in me.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBzslS"&gt;Creators also choose to show specific parts of their city in order to cater to a specific audience. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarhodgson?lang=en&amp;amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1"&gt;Sarah Hodgson&lt;/a&gt;, a New York City-based TikToker, says she’s specifically trying to curate experiences for people who are visiting the city or just moved to the city. “I’m not trying to pretend to know about the bodega in an obscure place in New York,” Hodgson says. “I’m not pretending to be that person, and I’m definitely not that person because I’m not a native and I make that very clear.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="8oXL3Y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@lostwithlucy/video/6984423787722706182" data-video-id="6984423787722706182" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@lostwithlucy" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lostwithlucy"&gt;@lostwithlucy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;walk ins are now welcome, but you can also reserve tickets online in advance! &lt;a title="nycdateideas" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nycdateideas"&gt;#nycdateideas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="thingstodoinnyc" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/thingstodoinnyc"&gt;#thingstodoinnyc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - lucy | nyc living" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6984423660908186373"&gt;♬ original sound - lucy | nyc living&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YviO7P"&gt;The guides with the largest followings on TikTok are usually young and white, and their videos tend to focus on businesses that fit their tastes. This means that trendier businesses like Catbird in New York City, a jewelry store where you can get a bracelet permanently attached to your wrist, are more likely to be highlighted on these accounts and have a greater chance of going viral. Businesses that cater to ethnic groups, or don’t have the money for marketing teams, are unlikely to be featured on these pages. For Hodgson, this is an intentional move — her videos are supposed to show off parts of New York that people who are visiting can easily recognize from shows like &lt;em&gt;Gossip Girl&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sex in the City&lt;/em&gt;, which is why she sticks to Manhattan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I cater it specifically towards people who are either tourists traveling here or who just moved here,‘’ Hodgson says. “So if you’re not part of my target audience, you’re definitely going to have some things to say about my videos.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes, businesses aren’t aware that a creator like Hodgson has visited until a customer shows them that a TikTok featuring their business has gained millions of views. These views, and the increased customers they bring, don’t always translate into profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FHpSq"&gt;Robby Gordon, the founder of the Hollywood Sculpture Garden, saw that more young people were coming to his outdoor garden, which is free to the public, when he reopened earlier this year. For Gordon, who relies on sculpture sales and donations to fund his business, the increase in visitors didn’t help him sell anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="aqy2C3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“None of them were potential buyers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wUX0k4"&gt;“TikTok brought a lot of very enthusiastic young people to the garden because during COVID there was no other place to go,” Gordon says. “I was happy that they had a place to go, but none of them were potential buyers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYnqDx"&gt;Even if a viral TikTok doesn’t contribute much to the business side of things, Gordon is happy to help creators make content at his business, though he highly doubts he would pay a creator to feature the Hollywood Sculpture Garden on their page. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lostwithlucy?lang=en"&gt;Lucy Wong&lt;/a&gt;, a New York City-based TikToker with over 35,000 followers, believes featuring these businesses will always be a mutually beneficial experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="CbekYZ"&gt;“If it helps a small business owner who’s been struggling, why would you not post about it?” Wong says. “You’re not going to gain anything and they’re just gonna lose.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 review: nearly normal</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;As good as foldables get, but is that good enough?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="xQB9CN"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is the best possible case Samsung can make for a phone that unfolds into a small tablet. It’s the fourth iteration of the same basic idea, refined and repaired over the course of years following an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18498904/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-screen-broken-issue-durability-foldable-phone-video-performance-price"&gt;embarrassing false-start failure&lt;/a&gt; on the first attempt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZNUhk"&gt;Because this is a story of refinement, the changes since the last model are minor. But added together, they make this the model that crosses that hard-to-define boundary between experimental and normal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNu5wD"&gt;Although the Z Fold 3 feels like a refined, established product, it’s still not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; normal. It’s a marvel of material science that’s by turns wonderful and awkward. And its price is also still far from normal, too — even after a price drop, it starts a $1,799.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RcEeL"&gt;If you like the basic idea of the Z Fold but have been waiting for Samsung to fix its biggest issues, the steady and relentless refinement on display here is worth a look. If you think the whole idea is an extravagant and silly technical flex, none of these changes will change your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mc8Pwg"&gt;Even though those two opinions are almost diametrically opposed, I can’t really argue with either one. The Z Fold 3 is great &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YeDdPp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10715493"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="RRb1pC"&gt;When closed, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is still an extremely tall, narrow, and thick slab of a device that’s more akin to a remote control than a traditional phone. It’s awkward to fit into a pocket both because of its shape and its weight — although it’s slightly lighter than last year, fundamentally it’s still the size of two phones and it has the weight to match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EvLSb"&gt;Samsung’s big addition to the hardware is IPX8 water resistance. I’ve dunked it in a vase and held it under a fountain without issue. I won’t speak to whether the durability improvements Samsung made this year will be enough to keep the phone intact long term, but at least initially it seems solid. I don’t feel like I need to baby this device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hVp6H0sYuZFLx34hLpwM1Vyynb4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801025/dbohn_210820_4722_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There is still a gap between the two sides when closed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x_SOyXM4kUAnemSG1_v1jplj080=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801028/dbohn_210820_4722_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is still a gap between the two sides when closed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Rzq5s"&gt;There’s still a gap at the hinge when it’s closed, but otherwise all the tolerances between the parts are tight. Samsung is still using tiny brushes inside the hinge to keep dust and debris out, but I’d still recommend keeping it away from any serious amount of grit or sand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRRJOd"&gt;The outer screen fills out the entire front of the display, and though it’s 6.2 inches diagonally, it feels much smaller because it’s so narrow. Samsung increased the refresh rate on the exterior display to 120Hz, so everything on it feels smooth; the main compromise when using it is that it’s just really hard to type on. Swipe-typing helps, but Samsung’s built-in keyboard still isn’t as good as Gboard at accuracy, and you’ll want to stick with Samsung’s keyboard since it has better options when in tablet mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtczAF"&gt;Open the phone up and you’re treated to the 7.6-inch display, which is bright, sharp, and has the same 120Hz refresh rate for smooth scrolling with less of the “jelly effect” that plagued the earlier versions. It’s a great screen with one glaring problem: the interior selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5i0qPO"&gt;Samsung opted for an under-display camera, one of the first to ship in the US. The camera itself is terrible, only 4 megapixels, and even those few are compromised by taking in light through a screen. Camera quality isn’t the problem, though — if I want to take a selfie, there are literally four other cameras I can use that are better. Think of it as a webcam for video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The under display selfie camera is more distracting and annoying than a hole punch." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jpVMUPRs-KkHsfU8l84P89IXTbU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801091/dbohn_210820_4722_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The under-display selfie camera is more distracting and annoying than a hole punch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="btt3K1"&gt;Instead, the problem is how the screen looks when the camera is off. When there’s a brighter background over it — or text — it has a screen-door look that is both ugly and distracting. If I shift my head or the phone even a little, there’s a moire effect that instantly draws my eye — even after a week of use it’s still happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ehtMo"&gt;Samsung wants the Z Fold 3 to be a showcase of its technical prowess, but that desire has led it into putting a too-experimental feature on a premium device. The under-display camera literally mars the experience. Samsung needs to put a setting in to turn the screen over the camera off entirely and just revert this thing back to a hole punch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWYJuY"&gt;Surprisingly, that is my only real complaint about the interior screen. Which is saying something since it’s a giant, 7.6-inch display that folds in half. Samsung put a lot of emphasis on how it has made this screen stronger, thanks to how it re-layered the different internal components from the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The crease is still visible at an angle but not bothersome at all when you look straight on." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aUwlAY86Tg80SJk418z7sH0zdOc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801031/dbohn_210820_4722_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The crease is still visible at an angle but not bothersome at all when you look straight on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The S Pen won’t work on the outer screen, but works fine on the main interior screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nVm5rOXMbsDkIDPjcicXaK2GEAc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801032/dbohn_210820_4722_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S Pen won’t work on the outer screen but works fine on the main interior screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T1mpI0"&gt;It still uses Samsung’s so-called “Ultra Thin Glass,” but that glass is still covered with layers of plastic. The top layer is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate"&gt;PET&lt;/a&gt; screen protector which feels much more like any other screen protector you’ve used on a phone. It radically changes the experience of the Z Fold 3 as it’s a lot more resistant to smudges and indentations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sz1Nxq"&gt;There is still a crease between the two halves, and I still am not too bothered by it. It’s mostly visible at an angle and largely goes away when you’re looking at the phone straight on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPPaLU"&gt;The other new layer on this screen is made up of a couple of Wacom digitizers so you can use a new kind of Samsung S Pen stylus with it. The Fold-specific S Pen is sold separately, and there’s no place to store it without a special case, which means you’ll be spending upward of $50 or even $80 more if you want to use stylus input. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6Mkc0"&gt;Drawing and sketching with the S Pen on the large screen is nice — there’s not much lag, it seems accurate even across the crease (where algorithms detect position), and it glides cleanly across that new PET layer. Unfortunately, the Fold wobbles when you draw on a table, even with one of Samsung’s own cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcVgl6"&gt;You also can’t use the stylus on the outer display, which means it’s not as good at taking quick notes as the Galaxy Note. Hopefully Samsung won’t discontinue that line for people who really do depend on having quick and easy access to a stylus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Flex mode on the Galaxy Z Flip 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6EAbQ9OfiFbggbG3dJGiF8tNPks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801034/dbohn_210820_4722_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flex mode on the Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="A8ga7P"&gt;Samsung has also refined the software that runs the Z Fold 3. Shockingly, One UI 3 has made the Android tablet experience halfway decent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch474o"&gt;That is a strange thing to type as I (and every reviewer I know) have been ragging on Android tablets for nearly a decade. But the subtle improvements Samsung made this year wrangle Android’s biggest tablet problems into flexible, usable little windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SN3N5i"&gt;Too many Android apps don’t re-form themselves to work better on tablet-size screens; they’re just stretched-out phone apps. That’s still the case this year, but some basics like getting multiple columns in Gmail or tabs in a browser work. Others, like Twitter or Slack, still look a little dopey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mbpn3W"&gt;However, Samsung’s multitasking system for windowing and managing apps has become adept at putting those recalcitrant apps in their place. You can drag and drop icons from a sidebar to put things into split screen or into a three-up layout. You can even pin that sidebar to be permanently visible for an even more tablet-like experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="SKr6Zb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Against all reason, Android on a tablet is good&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The multitasking software on the Z Fold 3 is much more flexible than before." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S79WEKoUZ0TCUgJpSBFyqUC_56g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801132/Screenshot_20210823_123216_Twitter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The multitasking software on the Z Fold 3 is much more flexible than before.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JDRRO3"&gt;Critically, you can more easily adjust the width and height of those various layouts now by simply dragging the dividers around. You can also tap those dividers to easily rearrange the various windows if you don’t want to deal with dragging them around. Saving those custom layouts to the sidebar is simple, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3aQ9C"&gt;Finally, there’s a “labs” feature that lets you strong-arm apps into playing nice with this new system if they haven’t been updated to resize properly on a modern Android device. You can set Instagram to fill the entire screen, for example, or resize TikTok into a little distracting-as-hell side rail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ht1jhh"&gt;Let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves, though. The iPadOS ecosystem of apps is still light-years ahead of Android when it comes to tablet options. But Samsung and Google have finally managed to push the Android tablet experience to the point where I am comfortable doing more advanced things than I can on a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXBhPn"&gt;But really, the thing about the big screen on the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is that it is a &lt;em&gt;big screen&lt;/em&gt;. Big screens are great. They’re nicer for watching movies, playing games, reading books, and everything else. All the things that people like about outsized slabs like Samsung’s Ultra line or Apple’s Max phones are even better on this big screen. Hell: I can actually read and annotate PDFs on this device without having to tediously pan, pinch, and scroll around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zGMPW"&gt;It helps that the Z Fold 3 is excellent from a performance perspective. The Snapdragon 888 processor and 12GB of RAM keep up with multiple active windows at once. The 4,400mAh battery, however, isn’t quite what I would hope for in terms of longevity. I can get through a full day with four-ish hours of screentime, but getting more than that would require changing my usage in a way I wouldn’t want to. We’re used to tablets lasting forever, but this folding tablet is more akin to your average phone when it comes to battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f5OtsQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10715575"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fPBXJ4"&gt;The cameras are also more akin to what you’ll get on an average phone, not a flagship. The main selfie camera on the outside is 10MP and it’s perfectly serviceable. On the rear, you’ve got three 12-megapixel sensors for wide, ultrawide, and 2X telephoto. The only real change Samsung made since last year was adding optical image stabilization to the telephoto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zvu9kF"&gt;The results are classic Samsung: punchy, bright, sharp, and vivid — too often to a fault. Samsung tunes its camera to look great on Samsung screens, not to be true to what your eye might see in the moment. It’s a choice I don’t love, but at least on a technical level the images are good enough to work with. Similarly, the Z Fold 3 does a passable job with night photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JND4qs"&gt;For $1,800 I’d like something better, but that money is going toward the screen, the waterproofing, and all the rest. If camera quality is your top priority, this isn’t the phone for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 under a waterfall." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JbHY3hS0iqsnM6nfPEqyNoYIOUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801024/dbohn_210819_4722_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 under a waterfall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="21V3bb"&gt;Samsung’s big goal for its folding phones this year is to make them “mainstream.” For the Z Flip 3, Samsung hopes it can become a premium alternative for people who would otherwise buy a “normal” phone. For the Z Fold 3, the goal is to creating an entirely new class of flagship that its competitors can’t match. In both cases, Samsung’s putting all this effort in because its more traditional flagship phones are plummeting in popularity as Xiaomi and others undercut it on price while matching quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JKNd6"&gt;Samsung’s goals aren’t our problem, but they do lead to a benefit: folding phones that we can simply judge on their merits instead of simply gawking at tech demos. They’re still too spendy in my opinion, but I wouldn’t second-guess anybody who decides to spring for one of them. You know how you’ll be using your phone and at some point you have to walk over to your laptop to actually get something done? With the Z Fold 3, it takes me longer to get to that point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5K2FRk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As good as it gets, but that might not be good enough&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3pxu3"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is as good as it gets when it comes to a phone that unfolds into a tablet. Until there’s another technological breakthrough that can change the flexibility of glass or the size of batteries, I don’t see anything fundamentally better than this coming along for some time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="4gd00n"&gt;However, it’s still an awkward thing to carry around and use one-handed, and it’s still super expensive. The tradeoffs just don’t seem worth it. Then again, once upon a time we all said the same thing about the tradeoffs for big-screened phones like the Note. For a small sliver of tech-savvy people who know what they’re getting into, I could actually recommend the Z Fold 3. But for most people, as good as it gets is still not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Check your permissions: default settings in Microsoft tool exposes 38 million user records online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aa0vMFJ1mwm_2P_lJ48h6T_zgQ4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69767509/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PUl8OJ"&gt;Default permissions settings in an app-building tool from Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.upguard.com/breaches/power-apps"&gt;have been blamed&lt;/a&gt; for exposing the data of 38 million people online. Information including names, email addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, and COVID-19 vaccination appointments was inadvertently made publicly accessible by 47 different companies and government entities using Microsoft’s Power Apps platform. There’s no evidence of the data being exploited, though, and the underlying issue has now been fixed by Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCZGow"&gt;The problem was originally discovered in May by security research team UpGuard. In a recent &lt;a href="https://www.upguard.com/breaches/power-apps"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from UpGuard and &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-power-apps-data-exposed/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company explains how organizations using Power Apps created apps with improper data permissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFy8Gt"&gt;“We found one of these [apps] that was misconfigured to expose data and we thought, we’ve never heard of this, is this a one-off thing or is this a systemic issue?” UpGuard’s vice president of cyber research Greg Pollock told &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;. “Because of the way the Power Apps portals product works, it’s very easy to quickly do a survey. And we discovered there are tons of these exposed. It was wild.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FwHn8G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we discovered there are tons of these exposed. It was wild.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YMedsv"&gt;Power Apps allows companies to build simple apps and websites without formal coding experience. Organizations implicated in the breach — including Ford, American Airlines, J.B. Hunt, and state agencies in Maryland, New York City, and Indiana — were using the site to collect data for various purposes, including organizing vaccination efforts. Power Apps offers tools for quickly collating the sort of data needed in these projects, but, by default, leaves this information publicly accessible. This is the exposure UpGuard discovered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m79riC"&gt;The mechanism of this particular ‘breach’ is interesting, as it blurs the line between what is a software vulnerability and what is merely poor choice in user interface design. UpGuard says Microsoft’s position is that this was not a vulnerability as it was users’ fault for not properly configuring the apps’ permissions. But, arguably, if you are making an app designed to be used by people with little coding experience, then making things as safe as possible by default would seem to be the smart move. As &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-power-apps-data-exposed/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft has now changed the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/important-changes-deprecations#table-permission-changes-for-forms-and-lists-on-new-portals"&gt;default permissions settings&lt;/a&gt; responsible for the exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok follows Snap and Facebook by testing new augmented reality developer tools</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LUC0q5dUTG9yDtcyQGGR1bzxOqM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69767399/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IY55bH"&gt;TikTok is testing an experimental set of developer tools that might one day let creators build augmented reality effects for the popular app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RzInwX"&gt;The platform is called TikTok Effect Studio and is currently in private beta, according to a &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/tiktok-is-building-its-own-ar-development-platform-tiktok-effect-studio/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. TikTok told the publication that Effect Studio is simply an “experiment” at this stage and may not make it to a full launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pS2cgv"&gt;It would, though, be a sensible product for TikTok to build. Both &lt;a href="https://ar.snap.com/"&gt;Snap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/05/01/ar-studio-create-distribute/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; have their own AR developer initiatives, which encourage people to build new camera effects for their respective platforms. It seems like a streamlined way to keep your audience engaged, outsourcing the development of new effects to users who know best what they want to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="amLcq2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;TikTok is launching an Effects Studio in beta &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;h/t &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sam_Schmir?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Sam_Schmir&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/K3LS5S2Yoq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/K3LS5S2Yoq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1426639697829322762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QeL2aC"&gt;The Effects Studio was first spotted by social media consultant &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1426639697829322762"&gt;Matt Navarra&lt;/a&gt; (with a tip from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sam_Schmir"&gt;Sam Schmir&lt;/a&gt;). You can view the sign-up page &lt;a href="https://effecthouse.tiktok.com/"&gt;here on the web&lt;/a&gt; (where it’s confusingly named TikTok Effect &lt;em&gt;House&lt;/em&gt;), but it doesn’t give anything away about what tools may actually be available in future. It will ask for your name, email, TikTok username, years of experience developing AR tools, and whether you plan to create effects for personal or business use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIEoEP"&gt;The site apparently launched earlier this month, but seems it’s still very much in the early stages of development. Speaking to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, a TikTok spokesperson gave an impressively bland and vague statement. “We’re always thinking about new ways to bring value to our community and enrich the TikTok experience,” said the spokesperson. “Currently, we’re experimenting with ways to give creators additional tools to bring their creative ideas to life for the TikTok community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZeMcp"&gt;Watch this space, basically.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi moves away from its ‘Mi’ product branding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-h5HloF3s93W4qA5aaP7l2tgOTE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69767365/DSCF5652.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A Mi Home store in Beijing. | Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c1gMiZ"&gt;Xiaomi is phasing out its “Mi” product branding, a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; Products including flagship smartphones like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;this year’s Mi 11&lt;/a&gt; will instead simply carry the Xiaomi name. The news was first reported &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-ditches-mi-branding/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XH8Z8C"&gt;“Starting in 2021 Q3, Xiaomi’s product series ‘Mi’ will be renamed to ‘Xiaomi,’” says the spokesperson. “This change will unify our global brand presence and close the perception gap between the brand and its products. This change may take some time to take effect in all regions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35KsqH"&gt;Xiaomi says that it’ll still keep the Redmi brand around, meaning that the higher-end Xiaomi products will form a distinct line alongside Redmi products. Xiaomi products “represent the pinnacle of technology and offer a premium experience,” according to the company, while Redmi products “bring big innovation at a more accessible price point and are aimed at a younger audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pRTAA1pDRtWYVHJNG5B6nOYjEtM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802188/WechatIMG118.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7Bog7E"&gt;This naming convention “will also be applied to our ecosystem and IoT products over time,” says the spokesperson, though the Mi brand logo will continue to be used in Xiaomi’s Mi Home stores for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlkLvs"&gt;This month’s announcement of the latest phone in the Mi Mix series served as a harbinger of the shift, since Xiaomi referred to it as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617979/xiaomi-mi-mix-4-announced-under-display-camera-cup-specs-price"&gt;Xiaomi Mix 4&lt;/a&gt;. The previous phones were called the Mi Mix, the Mi Mix 2, and the Mi Mix 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzmv7b"&gt;The Mi brand was largely used in Western markets, presumably for readability and pronunciation reasons — phones like the Mi 11 are already called the Xiaomi 11 in China, for example. But Xiaomi evidently believes its company name is now recognizable enough and better represents its products.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google dismantles Health unit in favor of tried-and-tested ‘throw everything at the wall’ strategy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NdBXyvY-NMM-kmFIQqVaeoWZ-yU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69767359/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9MjWah"&gt;Once again, Google is headed back to the drawing board to rethink its healthcare strategy. &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-health-shutting-down-david-feinberg-leaves-2021-8"&gt;As first reported by &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the tech giant is dissolving its single, unified Google Health division, founded in 2018, in favor of a distributed approach to building health products. The head of the division, David Feinberg, is &lt;a href="https://www.cerner.com/newsroom/cerner-announces-appointment-of-david-feinberg-md-as-president-and-chief-executive-officer"&gt;leaving the company&lt;/a&gt;, while an unknown proportion of Google Health employees will be sent to other teams at Google (like Search and Fitbit) to work on specific services, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JeffDean/status/1429899635791843328"&gt;according to Google’s AI head Jeff Dean&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJlIUe"&gt;It’s a messy change for what was already a messy initiative. Tech giants like Google and Apple have become increasingly interested in the healthcare industry in recent years, but have failed to make in-roads in such a fractured ecosystem. Google’s efforts in health have at least been fittingly disparate, covering everything from Android &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/fit/"&gt;fitness apps&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17670156/deepmind-ai-eye-disease-doctor-moorfields"&gt;AI-powered eye-disease detectors&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/16/14932764/deepmind-google-uk-nhs-health-data-analysis"&gt;bungled data deals&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165465/google-health-research-app-covid-flu-apple"&gt;medical study apps&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22331567/google-nest-hub-new-2021-smart-display-sleep-tracking-soli-price-specs-features"&gt;sleep-tracking features&lt;/a&gt; in the Nest Hub, to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440754/google-health-ai-skin-condition-model-dermatology"&gt;machine learning tools&lt;/a&gt; for clinicians. And &lt;em&gt;so on&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MpuTjx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleHealth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GoogleHealth&lt;/a&gt; is no longer just a single team, but a significant company-wide effort that touches many of our products. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moving forward the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleHealth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GoogleHealth&lt;/a&gt; name will encompass all our health initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;— Jeff Dean (@ ) (@JeffDean) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JeffDean/status/1429899911978373126?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hVlqQV"&gt;Google Health was supposed to unify these efforts, giving some sense of purpose and direction to the company’s sprawling ambitions. The brand dates back to 2006, but Google seemed to be embarking on a more serious path in 2018 when it hired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/9/18079420/google-health-care-strategy-fit-home-nest-deepmind-verily-ceo-geisinger"&gt;respected healthcare exec Feinberg&lt;/a&gt;. As this recent news suggests, that hasn’t worked out, though the Google Health brand will live on. As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JeffDean/status/1429899911978373126"&gt;tweeted by Dean&lt;/a&gt;: “@GoogleHealth is no longer just a single team, but a significant company-wide effort that touches many of our products. Moving forward the @GoogleHealth name will encompass all our health initiatives.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9ZEME"&gt;What does that mean for you, the avid Google Health consumer? Diddly squat, really. If you enjoy using any of the company’s current health products — whether that’s wearing a Fitbit or Googling “why am I tired all the time” at 3AM in the morning — then these core experiences will likely continue exactly as before. Whether or not Google can offer anything more meaningful from its healthcare strategy, though, remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="a4jmRQ"&gt;Google Meet will soon tell you when it thinks you’re creating an echo in calls, &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/08/helping-users-prevent-echo-in-google.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+GoogleAppsUpdates+%28Google+Workspace+Updates+Blog%29"&gt;Google announced in a blog posting Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, it’s hard to know if you’re creating an irritating echo for meeting participants unless they interrupt the meeting to tell you. Google’s new proactive warnings should therefore help minimize everyone’s suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pUVeND"&gt;Google says that Meet already controls audio to remove echo. But it can’t account for all remote desktop speaker and mic configurations that result in audio being fed back into the call. The new echo warning appears as both a red dot on the Meet interface as well as a notification and a text alert. Clicking the notification provides steps to fix the echo, which include muting your mic, lowering your speaker volume, or switching to headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSy6E9"&gt;Google says that the new echo warnings are rolling out now to Google Workspace and G Suite Basic and Business customers. The rollout will take up to 15 days to complete. The warnings are on by default and don’t require any admin intervention to enable. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA is opening the patents for some of its accessibility tech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshot of Apex Legends, showing a dessert landscape and a hand holding a knife, with text in the upper right corner that says “you pinged shield battery.”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pirQy0r_WzxfAEQ88WgRFV6sKss=/96x0:1607x1007/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69767263/Shield_Battery_Ping.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A player uses the Ping System in &lt;/em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;em&gt; to alert their team of the presence of a “Shield Battery”.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Electronic Arts&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SbuZYk"&gt;Electronic Arts is pledging to open the patents for some of its accessibility-related tech, including the much-celebrated &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; ping system, the company announced today. EA says it won’t file infringement lawsuits against people or companies for using tech that falls under patents listed in the pledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYcajp"&gt;The ping system in Apex Legends, which allows people to play the team-based game without hearing or speaking, has been praised both as an impressive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213537/apex-legend-voice-chat-solo-play-xbox-ps4-pc"&gt;alternative to voice chat&lt;/a&gt; and as a great &lt;a href="https://www.cbr.com/apex-legends-ping-system-is-still-its-best-feature-and-its-most-accessible/"&gt;accessibility feature&lt;/a&gt; for players with a variety of disabilities. A patent that covers the system (&lt;a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&amp;amp;docid=11097189"&gt;US 11,097,189&lt;/a&gt;) was issued the same day as EA’s announcement of the pledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iesF0h"&gt;Along with the ping system patent, EA is opening patents for the tech it uses in &lt;em&gt;Madden&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt; to make them more accessible for people with colorblindness and low vision. The tech includes automated systems for improving visibility by detecting and modifying colors (&lt;a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&amp;amp;docid=10118097"&gt;US 10,118,097&lt;/a&gt;) and contrast ratios (&lt;a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&amp;amp;docid=10878540"&gt;US 10,878,540&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot from Madden 21, showing different options of plays, with color contrast adjusted for color blindness." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Czz5ZQ8J2PsH6I-EFtctXo8OMbk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801446/Ex._1___Deuteranopia_On__as_seen_with_deuteranopia_.png"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HGymNb"&gt;The pledge also includes a patent for a “personalized sound technology” (&lt;a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&amp;amp;docid=10878540"&gt;US 10,878,540&lt;/a&gt;) that will modify or create music for people based on their listening preferences and level of hearing, though EA says this tech hasn’t been developed yet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1Y5cu"&gt;In addition to opening some of its patents, EA is open-sourcing code that helps address issues with brightness, contrast, and colorblindness in digital content. Developers can find the code &lt;a href="https://github.com/electronicarts"&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and adapt or build on it for their own games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQeNK5"&gt;“We hope developers will make the most of these patents and encourage those who have the resources, innovation and creativity to do as we have by making their own pledges that put accessibility first,” says Chris Bruzzo, EVP of Positive Play, Commercial and Marketing at EA. “We welcome collaboration with others on how we move the industry forward together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRdQVg"&gt;EA says it plans to add patents for future accessibility-related tech to the pledge, as well as open-sourcing more of its tech. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the first trailer for Spider-Man: No Way Home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A50RyE9AHqutRolA_sbnFnuQsoE=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69766839/nwh.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w9tptL"&gt;After it &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/sony-block-alleged-spider-man-no-way-home-trailer-leak-1235001375/"&gt;leaked&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend, Sony Pictures has released the first official teaser trailer for the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt;, the third Spider-Man movie to be part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8fP5e"&gt;I will just say up front that if you consider the basic premise of &lt;em&gt;No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; to be a spoiler, you probably shouldn’t watch this trailer. There are already reveals in it that big Spider-Man and Marvel fans might want to save for the theater, though I’m not sure how practical that’ll be in the lead-up to release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZMr0sq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;shout-out to the real ones who are watching the trailer for the first time right now&lt;/p&gt;— Spider-Man: No Way Home (@SpiderManMovie) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpiderManMovie/status/1429982989228810249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yoq9p1"&gt;Suffice it to say for now that &lt;em&gt;No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; follows on directly from the mid-credits scene in the last movie, &lt;em&gt;Far From Home&lt;/em&gt;, which was released in 2019. Peter Parker is dealing with the fallout of being exposed as Spider-Man and, well, there is just a whole lot going on with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTXezy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; is set to be released on December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden reportedly hosting cybersecurity meeting with Tim Cook, Satya Nadella, and Andy Jassy attending</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At 2019 Dreamforce Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q_ns6qHpSM2ZQEkHxNJqcg898cE=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69766544/1183490754.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p03RW0"&gt;President Joe Biden plans to host a meeting on Wednesday to discuss how companies are improving cybersecurity after the waves of recent security breaches and ransomware attacks, and Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy will be attending, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-23/apple-s-cook-microsoft-s-nadella-plan-to-visit-white-house?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Google, IBM, JPMorgan Chase, and the energy firm Southern Company have also been invited, and Southern Company CEO Tom Fanning is also set to attend, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYxElX"&gt;While it’s not clear exactly what the president and any attendees plan to discuss, there will surely be a lot to talk about given incidents like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288961/solarwinds-hack-100-companies-9-federal-agencies"&gt;massive Solarwinds hack&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22564054/ransomware-revil-kaseya-coop"&gt;Kaseya ransomware attack&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;the Colonial Pipeline shutdown&lt;/a&gt; resulting from a cyberattack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isr1jL"&gt;Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, IBM, JPMorgan, and Southern Company all declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg,&lt;/em&gt; and a Southern Company spokesperson declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The other companies and the White House have not replied to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
