    <title>iOS 14.5 is out now with new Face ID mask features and Apple’s App Tracking Transparency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uxHyIL_pFeBvJfzxv_5DCN6eO0A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187801/akrales_201017_4238_0054.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5wYbbJ"&gt;Apple has begun rolling out iOS and iPadOS 14.5. The latest software update includes the new App Tracking Transparency feature, which lets users decide whether to allow apps to track their activity “across other companies’ apps and websites” for advertising purposes. A pop-up will now appear whenever apps are designed to share your activity in this way. Facebook has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;heavily criticized&lt;/a&gt; Apple over App Tracking Transparency, claiming that it presents “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;a false tradeoff&lt;/a&gt; between personalized ads and privacy.” The new option could have a detrimental impact on Facebook’s ad business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0iFEZ"&gt;Perhaps more important to day-to-day iPhone usage, iOS 14.5 also includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260639/apple-watch-iphone-unlocked-ios-14-5-app-tracking"&gt;a very helpful and timely new trick&lt;/a&gt;: if you own an Apple Watch, you can set your iPhone to automatically unlock without requiring a Face ID match or passcode as long as Apple’s smartwatch is on your wrist. This is designed to make getting into your phone that much quicker while we’re all still wearing face masks so frequently throughout the day. Installing watchOS 7.4 is necessary for this feature to work; that update is also available as of today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kZiE8D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22403523/ios-14-5-tracking-consent-app-transparency-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JJNXDH"&gt;iOS and iPadOS 14.5 include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285963/apple-emoji-ios-14-5-smiley-faces-hearts-more-skin-tones"&gt;a ton of new emoji&lt;/a&gt; with a focus on inclusivity. The update adds the ability to watch Apple Fitness Plus workouts on a TV with AirPlay 2. Apple’s Podcasts app is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;getting a new design&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396042/apple-podcast-subscriptions-launch-price"&gt;optional subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;. The latest video game controllers for the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S are now supported on the iPhone and iPad as of this update. And all iPhone 12 models will allow for 5G connectivity in dual-SIM mode in more countries. Starting with the 14.5 update, Apple will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360502/apple-siri-female-voice-default-new-voices-ios-14-5"&gt;no longer default to a female-sounding voice&lt;/a&gt; for its Siri assistant. Instead, you’ll be prompted to choose your preferred voice during device setup. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fios-14-5-offers-unlock-iphone-with-apple-watch-diverse-siri-voices-and-more%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F26%2F22403554%2Fapple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple has a post up&lt;/a&gt; with all of the miscellaneous improvements and additions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hl8z9p"&gt;iOS and iPadOS 14.5 is rolling out to iPhone and iPad users now; you can check the “software update” section in settings to begin the update process right away.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30, which is what it is going for now at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fpreselect%3D80770243%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. There is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; to show the time, weather, and other information that is available for $60, its usual price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHsulr"&gt;Amazon is also selling some bundles, including a $50 one that features &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4FDPHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one Sengled Bluetooth bulb&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Amazon-Smart-Charcoal/dp/B08GTWC9ZB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot and Amazon Smart Plug bundle&lt;/a&gt; available for $60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;We have seen this product go down to $40, which is what it is currently available for now at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is also selling a bundle for $55 which includes an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B08GV4SF3W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition plus an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3GbSWO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;Currently, the fourth generation Echo available for $100 (usual price) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733330369536034962#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770246%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiNGuc"&gt;If you are looking for a pair of Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $180&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $20 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XqDD6Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the Echo Studio is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D411Fi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is the one to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90 and we have seen it go down as low as $45. At the moment, the Echo Show 5 is on sale for $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the Echo Show 5 on Amazon, you can also receive a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZD7VZG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year subscription to Food Network Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; at no extra cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJmJw1"&gt;Amazon also has a few bundles available; you can get an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089Q2RJH9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and three months of Amazon Kids Plus&lt;/a&gt; for $81, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086P992GD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $90, and an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SW188FP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 plus an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVFAcO"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling a bundle with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730445461281046110#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $85.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wwkfpq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the Show 8 go down as low as $65. The Echo Show 8 is currently on sale for $105 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="x04s5v"&gt;There are also a few bundles available for a few dollars more. For $115 you can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an Echo Show 8 and a 1080 Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt;; or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $135. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YdQbrX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QJ2PFl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation Echo Show 10. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen.

    <title>Ford’s GT version of the Mustang Mach-E starts at $59,900</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YaC-iV8tBQfqEjSiaGpD1oz-qeU=/0x0:4193x2795/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187598/2021_Mustang_Mach_E_GT_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Ford&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zfTCn1"&gt;Ford will start taking orders for the GT and GT Performance variants of its first electric Mustang on Wednesday, and it has finally revealed how much they’ll cost. The GT version starts at $59,900, while the Mustang Mach-E GT Performance has a starting price of $64,900 (before tax, title, registration, and delivery fees).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dwcd2M"&gt;Both new versions of the Mustang Mach-E pack a more powerful wallop than the more affordable variants, and they come standard in an all-wheel drive configuration. In the Mustang Mach-E GT, that means a peak output of 480 horsepower and 600 pound-feet of torque and the ability to go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 3.8 seconds. The GT Performance has the same peak of 480 horsepower but 634 pound-feet of torque, which helps it get to 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nKP5Nw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Higher price tag, but it packs more of a wallop&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iiFyMf"&gt;That puts the GT versions of the Mustang Mach-E in contention with Tesla’s Model Y performance variant, which starts at $60,990, has around 450 horsepower, and can go from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds. On paper, though, the Model Y still outclasses the electric GT Mustangs when it comes to range. The Environmental Protection Agency rates the Model Y Performance at 303 miles on a full charge, while Ford says it’s targeting 250 miles for the Mustang Mach-E GT and 235 miles for the GT Performance. (More affordable versions of the Mustang Mach-E get anywhere from 211 miles to 305 miles, depending on the configuration.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0fiUEl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10466590"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NCzNmR"&gt;Of course, Ford doesn’t just want to be compared to Tesla, and in the press release it issued Monday, the company points out that the new GT variants of the Mach-E boast the same amount of horsepower as the gas-powered V8 Mustang Mach 1 but with more torque. The only more powerful Mustang Ford sells is the Shelby GT500, which has a supercharged V8 that packs nearly 800 horsepower. The Mach 1 starts at around $53,000, while the Shelby starts at nearly $73,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOYlRH"&gt;The GT versions of the electric SUV also have a track mode (in addition to the three standard driving modes that already exist on the Mustang Mach-E), which “provides more performance-oriented traction and stability control tuned specifically for track use,” according to Ford. And to really hammer home the performance aspect, the new track mode increases the volume of &lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/08/28/a-new-breed-of-sound-mustang-mach-e-sci-fi-drive-tones.html"&gt;the interior motor noise Ford designed for the Mustang Mach-E&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WoYUHO"&gt;There are a few other touches that separate these electric Mustangs. The pony logo on the front grille lights up, and there is a big GT badge at the rear. Ford’s GT logo is also stitched into the center console. Both come with red brake calipers and have Ford Performance seats in the front row. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="m1RNT1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The arrival of the GT variants marks the end of the Mustang Mach-E’s first chapter&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P9cgMs"&gt;Buying a GT variant is also the only way to get a Mustang Mach-E in Ford’s “cyber orange” paint color option. It comes in the similarly bright “grabber blue,” too, which was previously only available on the limited-run “First Edition” Mustang Mach-E. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkEbF0"&gt;The arrival of the Mustang Mach-E GT and GT Performance is the end of a chapter of sorts for Ford, as it has now debuted all of the variants of the first electric Mustang, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/11/17/20967565/ford-mustang-mach-e-electric-suv-specs-price-la-auto-show-2019"&gt;announced back in November 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Early sales of the electric SUV &lt;a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131783_ford-mustang-mach-e-moving-quickly-off-dealer-lots-sales-on-pace-with-early-estimates"&gt;are meeting Ford’s expectations&lt;/a&gt;, despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373903/mustang-mach-e-deep-sleep-12v-battery-jump-start"&gt;a number of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316055/ford-mustang-mach-e-recall-loose-bolt-delivery-delays"&gt;relatively isolated issues&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311594/ford-mustang-mach-e-delays-quality-free-charging-cash-back"&gt;some of the first&lt;/a&gt; Mustang Mach-Es that made it to customers. The GT variants should add to that momentum while boosting profits. As they start hitting the road, heads will inevitably turn to what Ford has waiting in the wings: &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/03/12/ford-f150-electric-truck-spy-photos/"&gt;an all-electric F-150&lt;/a&gt; and, perhaps one day, an electric Mustang sedan.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify is raising prices for lots of its plans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-zQjd6yLy3iTn15cr2fY5CbB1VY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187535/acastro_180213_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="05K0T1"&gt;Spotify is increasing the price of many of its subscriptions this week across the UK and parts of Europe, with the US seeing a hike to Family plans. Subscribers have started to receive emails informing them of the changes, and they will affect Student, Duo, and Family plans across parts of Europe and the UK, and Family subscriptions in the US from April 30th. Single Spotify Premium subscriptions are unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1KQnk"&gt;Spotify family is increasing from $14.99 to $15.99 per month in the US. Fortunately, Duo, Premium, and Student pricing will remain the same... for now. The bigger hits to pricing will affect users in the UK and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7S1AWv"&gt;In the UK, Spotify Student is increasing from £4.99 to £5.99 per month, with a Duo subscription (for two people) moving from £12.99 to £13.99 a month . Family users will also be hit with price increases, with the Spotify Family plan (up to six accounts) jumping from £14.99 to £16.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jPHcga"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Spotify’s miniplayer for Facebook launches today","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22399965/spotify-facebook-integration-mini-player-music-podcasts"},{"title":"Spotify reportedly won’t take a cut from podcasters who sell in-app subscriptions ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399123/spotify-podcaster-subscription-fees-revenue"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0DIet6"&gt;Similar price increases will affect Spotify users in some European countries, too. Ireland and a handful of other European countries will see both Student and Duo increasing by a euro each per month, to €5.99 and €12.99 per month respectively. The Family plan in Europe is also increasing from €14.99 to €17.99 per month. Some countries in Asia and South America will also see similar price increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFVY0h"&gt;All existing Spotify subscribers in the US, Europe, and UK users of Spotify will have a one-month grace period before prices are automatically increased, so existing subscribers will see an increase during the June period of billing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCOnVb"&gt;Spotify confirmed the increases in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s likely we’ll see US pricing changes shortly, too. “We offer a variety of subscription plans tailored to our users’ needs, and we occasionally update our prices to reflect local macroeconomic factors and meet market demands while offering an unparalleled service,” says a Spotify spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5b4Jxv"&gt;Spotify’s price increases come just months after the company revealed it now has more than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22262508/spotify-q4-2020-earnings-subscriber-numbers-users-podcasts-audiobooks"&gt;150 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, Spotify still made a loss of €125 million in the recent quarter, and average revenue per user also fell by 8 percent. Spotify is due to post its latest earnings on Thursday, which will provide even more insight into why prices are increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bJUEX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, April 26th 12:50PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with additional details on markets affected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China censored social media posts about Chloé Zhao’s Oscar win </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="93rd Annual Academy Awards - Show" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fFB8A6emya_0gZRI60fcafRyRqQ=/0x61:5000x3394/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187267/1314443349.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Chloé Zhao accepts the Directing award for ‘Nomadland’ | Photo by Todd Wawrychuk/A.M.P.A.S. via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d4pHVL"&gt;The news of Chloé Zhao’s Oscar win for Best Director has been censored on social media and search engines in China at the direction of the country’s propaganda ministry, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-censors-nomadland-director-chloe-zhaos-oscar-win-11619440550?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Zhao, who was born in Beijing, is the first Chinese woman and first woman of color to take home the Academy Award for directing. &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22403117/oscars-2021-winners-losers-nomadland-anthony-hopkins-chadwick-boseman-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt; also won Best Picture&lt;/a&gt; at Sunday night’s awards ceremony, and the movie’s star, Frances McDormand, won Best Actress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWIC4J"&gt;But according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, early messages congratulating Zhao had been scrubbed from Chinese social media sites by midday Monday, and searches on Chinese search engines Baidu and Sogou had few links to the Oscar news. There was no news about Zhao’s win on China Central Television, the &lt;em&gt;Xinhua News Agency&lt;/em&gt;, or the Chinese Communist Party’s &lt;em&gt;People’s Daily&lt;/em&gt; on Monday, the &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported; according to a state media reporter, the country’s propaganda ministry told the outlets not to report the win due to “previous public opinion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vaaSu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Global Times&lt;/em&gt;, a news site owned by &lt;em&gt;People’s Daily&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202104/1222108.shtml"&gt;posted an op-ed late Monday&lt;/a&gt; acknowledging Zhao’s win but criticizing &lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt; as “typically American and far from the real life of the Chinese people.” Of Zhao, the &lt;em&gt;Global Times&lt;/em&gt; wrote: “We hope she can become more and more mature. In an era when the China-US confrontation is intensifying, she can play a mediating role in the two societies and avoid being a friction point. She cannot escape her special label, and she should actively use it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T009IK"&gt;Another of the few news stories that did surface in China about Zhao’s win came from small news site 163.com, which called Zhao the “second Chinese filmmaker to win the best director Oscar, after Ang Lee,” &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chloe-zhaos-oscars-glory-met-with-media-silence-in-china"&gt;according to&lt;em&gt; The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Lee, who won Best Director twice, for &lt;em&gt;Brokeback Mountain&lt;/em&gt; in 2006 and for&lt;em&gt; Life of Pi&lt;/em&gt; in 2013, was born in Taiwan. China considers Taiwan to be part of China, a matter of &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34729538"&gt;some contention internationally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8qtiX"&gt;It’s not the first time &lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt; and its director have been hidden by Chinese media; last month, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/beijing-media-social-media-asia-chloe-zhao-c7aa576fd66d66204ec37371196ea569"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that social media posts and other publicity about the movie were removed by China’s censors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJZTT4"&gt;The reason for China’s erasure of Zhao’s win likely stems from her comments in Western media outlets. She said in a 2013 interview with &lt;em&gt;Filmmaker&lt;/em&gt; magazine that China was a “place where there are lies everywhere,” a comment that was later removed from that article, according to the &lt;em&gt;AP, &lt;/em&gt;but not before it drew considerable backlash in China. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku could lose YouTube TV in standoff with Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Roku 4" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n9R174f6TvqgPwTqou31dtHyPU4=/0x0:2560x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187150/20151026-roku-4-tv-4k-14.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="csNCoI"&gt;The YouTube TV app could disappear from Roku devices in the coming days, according to an email sent to subscribers on Monday. In a last-ditch effort, Roku is calling on subscribers to reach out to Google to “urge them” to reach an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cc4U7"&gt;In a statement issued Monday, Roku accused Google of attempting to control the platform’s user experience in a way that favors its own products as the two companies negotiate a contract renewal for YouTube TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3aPSr"&gt;“Google is attempting to use its YouTube monopoly position to force Roku into accepting predatory, anti-competitive and discriminatory terms that will directly harm Roku and our users,” a Roku spokesperson said in a statement Monday. “It should come as no surprise that Google is now demanding unfair and anti-competitive terms that harm Roku’s users.”​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CwJrNp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It should come as no surprise that Google is now demanding unfair and anti-competitive terms”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GePG1N"&gt;According to Roku, Google’s demands condition Roku’s access to host the YouTube TV app on providing preferential treatment for Google’s separate YouTube app. These demands include providing Google with special access to consumer data and for Roku to build a dedicated search result row for YouTube in the platform’s interface. In addition, Google has called for Roku to meet specific hardware specs, Roku said. Google has its own Chromecast device that competes directly with Roku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjxXiU"&gt;While smaller than Google as a company, Roku currently controls nearly 45 percent of set-top box viewing time and has significant leverage over apps as a result. When HBO Max failed to secure a deal with the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280279/roku-hbo-max-dispute-streaming-connected-tvs-amazon-fire-apple-channels-warnermedia"&gt;for its launch last summer&lt;/a&gt;, the gap was seen as a significant hurdle for the new service — and a minor inconvenience for Roku itself. Still, Roku insists it is not seeking any additional money from the YouTube TV partnership and that its only goal is avoiding terms that favor Chromecast hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXDnGw"&gt;“We have been working with Roku in good faith to reach an agreement that benefits our viewers and their customers. Unfortunately, Roku often engages in these types of tactics in their negotiations. We’re disappointed that they chose to make baseless claims while we continue our ongoing negotiations,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Monday. “All of our work with them has been focused on ensuring a high quality and consistent experience for our viewers. We have made no requests to access user data or interfere with search results. We hope we can resolve this for the sake of our mutual users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v66pyC"&gt;Roku’s blistering allegations come amid a series of massive antitrust investigations into Google by the Justice Department, state attorneys general, and Congress. Last week, Google testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel regarding the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396544/apple-app-store-google-play-monopoly-antitrust-bill-hearings"&gt;Play Store and the fees it charges&lt;/a&gt; to app developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="scHXFP"&gt;“Google is already under fire from governments around the world for manipulating search results,” the Roku spokesperson said. “It is outrageous that Google would now try to insist on manipulating Roku’s search results as well.”​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sa0EhF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated April 26, 2021 at 12:25 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added a statement from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A first look at playing Steam PC games on Xbox with mouse and keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m74zKArdUICtsmKR6cxjh_0QuJY=/1x0:2058x1371/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187147/steamxboxgames.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TMug4E"&gt;Microsoft’s new Chromium-based Edge browser is coming to Xbox soon, and the company has now added all-important mouse and keyboard support that will pave the way to stream PC games to Xbox consoles. Xbox testers in the Alpha Skip-Ahead ring are now able to access this new version of Edge and try out a mouse in the console version of the browser for the first time. I’ve been testing this new support over the weekend, and I’ve even managed to play some Steam PC games on my Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9mLTv"&gt;Despite a few obvious bugs here and there — as this is very much an early beta browser — it works as expected. I’ve been able to write documents using Word online, type messages into Discord chats, and even play some &lt;a href="https://krunker.io/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Krunker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.quakejs.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quake JS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; through the browser with a mouse and keyboard. Basic mouse navigation, scrolling, and right-click all work here just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Uk2WaR"&gt;Where things really get interesting is when you consider what this will mean for the future of streaming games to an Xbox through a browser. Currently, I can stream Google Stadia games and use mouse and keyboard on the Xbox, but I’ve also been able to successfully stream PC games from Steam to an Xbox through the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWWVTV"&gt;I’ve played &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;DOTA 2&lt;/em&gt;, and a bunch of other PC games that simply aren’t available on Xbox right now. I’ve been able to do this using &lt;a href="https://parsec.app/"&gt;Parsec&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially a remote desktop app that lets you stream what’s on your PC to a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXqwQC"&gt;It’s not the most ideal experience on the Xbox right now, as the virtual keyboard appears when you click, and latency / connectivity isn’t always the best, but it’s a good example of what’s possible with this new mouse and keyboard support. Microsoft’s head of Xbox, Phil Spencer, has already &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/1384154390630592521"&gt;recently committed&lt;/a&gt; to bringing full PC games to the Xbox through the company’s Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0WkIRmjt26mGzNnkM8_AqBvvmW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470553/F6JN32q.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can remote-control a PC using Microsoft Edge on Xbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wryiPu"&gt;We don’t know exactly when those PC games will arrive on xCloud, as right now, Microsoft is only currently publicly testing Xbox games via the browser using either a controller or touch controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFIaPd"&gt;This new Edge browser with full mouse and keyboard support simply opens up a lot of opportunities for the Xbox to access games that aren’t typically available on the console. That even includes accessing Sony’s PC ports like &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Days Gone&lt;/em&gt;, and more if you stream them to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMrI7p"&gt;For now, we’re waiting on Microsoft to finalize this Edge browser and make it available to all Xbox owners, and for services like Nvidia’s GeForce Now to stop blocking Edge so the dream of playing PC games on Xbox consoles is a step closer to reality.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8CApHo89l_6-U02FA26oLjLlBo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187117/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5AV4O6"&gt;Privacy is on everyone’s mind these days, and in iOS 14.5, which is starting to roll out to the public today, there are new privacy features that may make you feel happier but are not endearing Apple to some other companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;specifically Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLqII1"&gt;The new feature is aptly called App Tracking Transparency. Many apps don’t just track your movements inside the app, but they track your movements outside of the app — in other words, where you go after you’ve left the app. This is why you see ads in Facebook and other apps for products you were just looking at on Amazon or other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJui93"&gt;Before 14.5, you could turn tracking off for all of your apps by going to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking and turning off “Allow Apps to Request to Track.” The new version of iOS allows you to be more specific. To begin, when you install a new app, you won’t have to do anything; you’ll be automatically asked whether you want the new app to track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_sNA9207Ij6MSzf2Kv2v5aQKVoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470537/Image_from_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you or not." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFVoiRqzCT28pCAurjfCEcl0yRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470540/Image_from_iOS__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P6sRHd"&gt;If you want to see which apps have asked for permission to track, and possibly change their tracking settings, you can just go to that same Tracking page. There, you will be able to give or revoke that permission. So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="amnEHD"&gt;Go to your iPhone’s settings and select Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FMi304"&gt;Beneath “Allow Apps to Request to Track,” you’ll now see a list of specific apps that have asked for that permission. You can permit or revoke that permission for each specific app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Privacy &amp;amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6w_zBXKYJsJ68-QaTDaA_HPCgU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470579/Image_from_iOS__3_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sqNFgl"&gt;And you can still use “Allow Apps to Request to Track” to turn off permission for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of your current (and future) apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qdw2bJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3q8mGj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hA5RTE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get the Microsoft Surface Headphones new for just $82 at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FmVo6lpvWKyH_cxTZtxfiBUnU-U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69186658/jbareham_181114_3083_0085.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bqu74z"&gt;Microsoft’s first-gen Surface Headphones might not be the latest set of noise-canceling headphones, but they’re still a stellar value — especially today. They have good sound quality, USB-C charging, a comfy fit, and they can block out a considerable amount of noise. Today at Woot, you can get them new for just over $80. To get this price, you’ll need to download the Woot app (&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/woot/id571457538"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.woot.android.main&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;), then find the deal there. Doing that alone will save 15 percent on the price it’ll cost everyone else, &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13142085?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fmicrosoft-surface-headphones-10" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which is $96&lt;/a&gt;. These headphones used to cost $250 (and most competitors cost more than that), so you’re getting a good deal either way. If you have Amazon Prime, you’ll get free shipping on this order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N5Nl0g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10373885"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qXakuu"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra with 256GB of internal storage in the phantom black colorway is steeply discounted at Amazon. Normally $1,250, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P54F6HB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $1,000 right now&lt;/a&gt;. The best part of this deal is that this model comes with upgraded storage, yet it’s no more expensive than the base configuration that has 128GB of storage. Most Samsung phones before this have had a microSD card slot to make adding space possible, but this generation of Galaxy phones doesn’t have one. So, you’re stuck with the amount of storage your S21 has, for better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fn8rAw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326077"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tcdJsZYVwcnrPjY_HZu2WoF6GH4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989891/dseifert_201025_4263_0009.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sCXhYQ"&gt;Amazon’s latest Echo Dot smart speaker that’s more spherical than previous models (and better-sounding, too) is 40 percent off through Amazon, Target, and Best Buy. Normally $50, you can snag one for $30 in blue, white, or black. My colleague Dan Seifert noted in his review that these have “surprisingly good sound quality” and that it’s just as capable as other Alexa-powered smart speakers, but for a cheaper price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YrKvdp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="clNmTB"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522700/beats-flex-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;Beats Flex&lt;/a&gt; wireless earbuds are even easier to recommend when they’re $10 off, as they are now at Amazon. Normally $50, you can get either the all-black or the neon yellow colorways &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08L6ZYW21?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $40&lt;/a&gt;. These are Beats’ first headphones that charge via USB-C, which makes them a great set of earbuds for Android users. Though, if you’re on an iPhone, these can quickly pair to your device with its W1 wireless chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GbLGhz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591203"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="r9drzl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Facebook is building its own in-app podcast player</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X0sdRSYQLTpGioM_yK4VYPUHHfQ=/0x0:1224x816/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69186904/fbpodcasts.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QoKttN"&gt;Facebook is building its own in-app podcast player, the company confirmed today. This will be separate from its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22399965/spotify-facebook-integration-mini-player-music-podcasts"&gt;in-app Spotify player&lt;/a&gt;. Podcasters will be able to distribute their shows through their Facebook page and will opt into doing so. The exact product details are still unclear. It’s possible this will operate through RSS or that creators will have a backend way to upload their content to Facebook. This functionality is expected to roll out within the next “few months,” according to &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/bringing-social-audio-experiences-to-facebook/"&gt;a Facebook blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2pgkO"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg described the Spotify partnership as being primarily about “music” during a chat with &lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt; writer Casey Newton last week. But Spotify’s release about its Facebook miniplayer today &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-26/share-explore-and-discover-music-and-podcasts-via-spotify-in-the-facebook-app/"&gt;specifically calls out&lt;/a&gt; its use case for podcasts. People can share episodes and listen to them from within the Facebook app without actually navigating to Spotify. But Facebook apparently has other plans to be more ingrained in the podcasting ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ENfjQG"&gt;The company’s interest in podcasts makes sense. It says more than 170 million people connect to podcast pages, and more than 35 million people are members of fan groups around shows. Plus, podcasts are still primarily an ad-based product, meaning Facebook could gather data about shows and listeners and target its own ads against them, possibly giving creators a cut. It could also offer creators a way to put them behind a subscription paywall, similarly to Apple’s forthcoming Apple Podcasts Subscriptions, which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;announced last week&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook’s formal entry into the podcast player space would mean nearly all the tech giants run their own podcast products, including Apple, Google, and Amazon, on top of Spotify and other smaller apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZ20rj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
