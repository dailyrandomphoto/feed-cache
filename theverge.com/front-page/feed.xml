    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Slack gets new features born out of the pandemic&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="379y7b"&gt;Slack is launching its new Huddles feature today, lightweight audio calls that you and your colleagues can jump in and out of while working. Born out of the pandemic, Slack Huddles are designed to replace those informal conversations you used to have with colleagues across desks. If you’ve ever used Discord, Slack Huddles is very similar, offering the ability to join or leave a persistent call freely at all hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ew9YcG"&gt;Slack is focusing on audio with Huddles rather than video, but there will be a screen-sharing feature to make it easy for teams of people to hold spontaneous meetings that may have happened huddled around a monitor in the pre-pandemic days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYOQRj"&gt;“It allows for two- or three-minute conversations,” explains Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If you have to schedule a call… you talk for the full 30 minutes instead of the two or three minutes you needed right in that moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m7w-ujaMKIIFaRao3pxpXXYYyg4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22690719/SlackHuddles.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slack Huddles are audio-only for now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JqcFKi"&gt;That time-saving and spontaneity is a key part of Slack Huddles. These audio calls can be created in any channel or DM, including shared communications across companies. The audio experience is designed to mimic people walking by your desk, so there’s no need to send people invites, links, or dial-in numbers — anyone in a channel or a DM group can join freely. Powered by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280829/slack-amazon-aws-partnership-amazon-chime-voice-video-calls"&gt;Slack’s partnership with Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, Huddles also includes impressively fast and accurate live captioning through AWS — something I was able to test during my conversation with Butterfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7lyvFT"&gt;Slack Huddles is clearly a response to the growing number of video calls that workers are participating in. While Butterfield concedes “we probably will allow video sharing at some point,” the focus of Huddles is to allow people to not have to worry about how they look on a video call, where they’re located, or even what they’re doing during a call. “On an audio call, you can be doing many other things and maintain the illusion that your counterpart is paying complete attention to everything you’re saying,” says Butterfield. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWvIIW"&gt;Huddles is also part of a broader effort at Slack to address some of the pain points of collaboration just as people start to filter back to offices, while others continue working from home or some other remote location. The hybrid workplace, as many are calling it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nT67AgC_D_VcHBF7pqNj7H4cue0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22690720/WvI714W.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slack Huddles feels very similar to Discord.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pgrxu6"&gt;“We’ve been living in a world where if all you have is a hammer, everything appears as a nail,” says Butterfield. “It doesn’t mean the classic meetings go away, but I think we’ll stop using that hammer on a bunch of things that aren’t really nails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmCB5C"&gt;Slack is also introducing voice, video, and screen recordings in the coming months. Instead of a morning standup, the idea is that people could record their ideas on their own time and send them in a channel. That could be ideal for large teams that work across multiple time zones or just where a daily meeting really isn’t necessary. These recordings that people share will also include a transcript that is searchable in Slack and tools to speed up or slow down playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tE5JCN"&gt;Alongside an influx of video calls during the pandemic, it’s also been easy to get overwhelmed by the number of notifications and messages you have to respond to. “We need to do a better job at teaching people how to use Slack effectively,” admits Butterfield. “Billions of people know what it’s like to tag people on Facebook… mentioning someone in Slack works in the same way, but it has a much greater importance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAxlPT"&gt;Butterfield sees Huddles and these new video and screen recordings as alternate modes of communication that could help reduce the anxiety of feeling like you have to instantly respond to a Slack message. It’s not an easy challenge to solve, though, as bringing in new features can also create a whole new set of challenges for attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9oZGT3Fq3uWNxU77KFXndYLq4QI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22690718/videorecordings.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slack’s new video recordings feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PNT8N3"&gt;These new features in Slack do hint at where digital tools are heading and a bigger effort to re-create the workplace in an era where many will be working remotely. “What people need in a digital-first world, is something that acts as a virtual HQ and plays the same role for how productivity and collaboration happen just like the building did,” explains Butterfield. “People don’t design their virtual HQ in the same way they do their physical buildings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4rn0s"&gt;Butterfield thinks that might be about to change, as businesses spend more time prioritizing digital tools as effort spent finding the perfect office location, interior design, and favorable lease terms. “Nobody would choose having an office location over having software today,” claims Butterfield. “If you had to choose one or the other, 100 percent of people would choose software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwBuE2"&gt;And he’s probably right. We’ve certainly long crossed the line where in-person communication is now a supplement to the digital ways we connect every day. Slack’s idea of a virtual HQ sounds a lot like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22265954/microsoft-viva-platform-features-remote-work"&gt;Microsoft’s approach to the future of work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Bsa5FtfDDLQ17RyhdydzC6Cyx8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22690722/ZQj89CR.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft is also trying to a build a virtual hub with Teams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pYtm3q"&gt;Microsoft has been trying to build a digital hub where work takes place in its own Slack competitor, Microsoft Teams. Shortly after the pandemic began last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333989/slack-microsoft-eu-competition-complaint-teams-office"&gt;Slack filed a competition complaint with the EU&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that Microsoft is “abusing its market dominance” and has “illegally tied” its Microsoft Teams product to Office and is “force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YTglA"&gt;Microsoft just announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548738/microsoft-teams-windows-11-integration-announcement-features"&gt;Teams will now be bundled into Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;, with some tight integration for consumers. Butterfield had only just seen the announcement, so he didn’t have an immediate response. But the company’s communications chief, Jonathan Prince, sent us this statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="n59lBV"&gt;Microsoft announced that it is going to bundle Teams with Windows as well as Office. Our reaction is simple: choice is better than lock-in, open is better than closed, and fair competition is best of all. Unfortunately, Microsoft has never seen it that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="M1TdP7"&gt;It’s clear that Slack isn’t impressed. But at the same time, Butterfield doesn’t seem to think Teams bundling on Windows will affect Slack too much. I pushed Butterfield on Microsoft chairman and CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22549825/microsoft-satya-nadella-apple-google-app-store-rules-conflated-decoder"&gt;Satya Nadella’s comments that Slack can be first-class&lt;/a&gt; on Windows. “Unlike how IE is preinstalled and you have to go download Netscape, using a communications platform is not something each individual user makes a decision about unilaterally,” says Butterfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvJrXI"&gt;“There’s no one that would switch off Slack to Teams just because laptops have it preinstalled, or if we went to Dell and said, ‘Hey, we’ll pay you a bunch of money if you put Slack on it and take Teams out.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDWN0z"&gt;Outside of just Microsoft bundling Teams into Windows, Slack also faces competition from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325966/google-gmail-g-suite-chat-rooms-meet-integration-redesign"&gt;Google integrating Chat, Rooms, and Meet into Gmail&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to take on Microsoft and Slack. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21719666/salesforce-slack-acquisition-purchase-announced"&gt;Salesforce announced its acquisition of Slack&lt;/a&gt; more than six months ago, but the deal hasn’t closed yet so we don’t know exactly how a combination of Salesforce and Slack will compete against Microsoft, Google, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alDWmN"&gt;“I think Salesforce obviously has an enormous number of salespeople, and that will be helpful for the business,” admits Butterfield. “I think the thing that will be more helpful is the depth of integration with Salesforce’s existing suite of products, and the impact that has on mutual customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="HQkYA3"&gt;Slack’s focus has always been about making its product loved by the millions who rely on it daily, rather than Microsoft and Google’s approach to bundling services together. Huddles is a great example of Slack’s approach, but the company will need many more Huddle-like features and some deep integration with Salesforce to fend off Microsoft and Google’s attempts to win the digital workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 is a new and refreshing approach to an old and familiar home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wc-_RUvhyS-JNhtvaSV9_FBxIIM=/8x0:2552x1696/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69523643/twarren__windows11main_1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s first Windows 11 preview looks promising&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="NwPCi1"&gt;Microsoft’s first version of Windows appeared more than 35 years ago, marking what would become the most used operating system for personal computers. Windows has dominated my life and career for those past three decades, and yet it hasn’t changed dramatically since the Start menu interface was introduced in Windows 95 (let’s just pretend Windows 8 never happened).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEF3pa"&gt;Windows 11 isn’t a massive change either, but then it’s not supposed to be. Windows chief Panos Panay compared Windows to his family home last week, a place that has been renovated and changed over the years, but still manages to stay familiar and feel just like... home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUljbl"&gt;That’s really what Windows 11 feels like. Microsoft has a new design, a new Start menu, and a new app store, but underneath it all, it’s still the Windows you’ve been used to using for years. Windows 11 is a new and refreshing approach to an old and familiar home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9FoHOSM4_rjIUK5ZZ2qw74koRss=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22690959/twarren__windows11main_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Start menu in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rff9vf"&gt;The biggest changes you’ll find in Windows 11 will be immediately obvious. A new Start menu appears alongside a taskbar that’s centered. It’s clear Microsoft has taken cues from macOS, Chrome OS, and even Android and iOS here. Gone are the Live Tiles with their widget-like information, replaced instead with a launcher and your recent documents and files. I’m a big fan of this new Start menu, and I think it acts as the front door that invites you to explore a refreshed and simplified version of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKFr5e"&gt;Where that simplification really starts to become obvious is in the Settings interface in Windows 11. Microsoft has been trying to move away from its traditional Control Panel ever since Windows 8, and nearly 10 years later we finally have a settings area that feels very easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdj53E"&gt;It took me a few hours to get used to the new Windows 11 settings, but I do like the way Microsoft has carefully refreshed this to make it easy to find the settings you need. There’s a panel on the left that also lets you quickly navigate between sections, something you couldn’t do on Windows 10 without jumping in and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ySmLzQszWj0Eyge6puxLtk8yKS0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22690989/settings.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Settings in Windows 11 looks great.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H0bsOC8LDp3yqMpHcReB7fh5Nrw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22690998/filexplorer.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new File Explorer in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zp4EjwbwBFlfuwp2VzOgrgJvo90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22690999/xbox.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox app in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bYuznJ4ng1Bvsd-A7a23A4JTxnc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691001/startleft.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not everything has to be centered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k1yEMc"&gt;Settings, like many parts of Windows 11, isn’t perfect, though. If you’re used to searching for things like “add / remove apps,” then you’ll notice that setting doesn’t appear to exist anymore. There’s a dedicated apps section instead, with options to uninstall apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSzFIP"&gt;Settings also still throws me into areas of Windows I don’t want to see. Instead of building additional mouse settings into the main devices section, Microsoft will teleport you to a control panel applet that looks like it hasn’t been touched since the Windows XP days. It’s a far cry from the beautifully simple settings interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7z47T"&gt;It’s also a reminder that this is a preview version of Windows 11, and that things are a little inconsistent at times and  bound to change between now and release. There’s clearly more UI to be done, as the dialog box that you’re thrown into in the additional mouse settings doesn’t even have a dark mode if you’ve enabled it system-wide. That’s the same across the Task Manager, the Run prompt, and many other sections of Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sIWrrK"&gt;If you’re not a huge fan of this centered interface for Windows 11, it’s easy to move the Start menu to appear on the left-hand side and keep that familiarity you’re used to. Speaking of familiarity, File Explorer looks similar but different at the same time. Microsoft has overhauled the icons in Windows 11 and removed the ribbon interface in favor of a command bar. I prefer this personally, as it leaves more room for the files I want to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8DPzy"&gt;I still think Microsoft could go much further with File Explorer to simplify things, and add tabs for power users, but there are some subtle changes here that will take some time to get used to. A new context menu is present across File Explorer, which means you now need to search for a rename icon rather than scan the context menu for the rename option. It’s a tiny change, but it alters the way you use Windows 11 daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QC3B8ZMzGBBZTcT06GLbidzz7do=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22690992/widgets.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Widgets in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QtYeGL"&gt;Another obvious change to Windows 11 is the new Widgets section. While Microsoft added a weather widget to the taskbar in Windows 10, it has now been shifted into a dedicated section that flies out from the left-hand side of the screen. This reminds me a lot of Windows Vista, but these widgets can’t be dragged and dropped onto your desktop and pinned elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdB1Nf"&gt;I think widgets will be useful for some people, but they’re certainly not for me. I also greatly dislike that Microsoft forces you into its Edge browser if you click on links in widgets, instead of respecting your default browser in the OS. The search interface in Windows 11, which remains largely unchanged, also still forces you into Edge. This a gross part of Windows 11, and I hope this changes between now and release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0GUh8"&gt;As part of Microsoft’s simplification effort in Windows 11, the volume fly outs, network controls, and notification center also get some subtle improvements here. I think Microsoft could still go further to simplify controlling app volumes and switching between devices, but for most people who just use a pair of headphones or a speaker the changes should be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ticgAkmAfz2110AqQrXO6VWXu7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22690993/snaplayouts2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snap Layouts is a clever way to use multitasking in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WgYn11"&gt;Where I really appreciate Windows 11’s changes is in multitasking. Windows has long had many different ways to arrange and snap Windows, accessible through the UI, keyboard shortcuts, or context menus. Microsoft has collected these all together and now presents them in the form of Snap Layouts, a button that appears when you hover over the maximize button on most apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRCr4R"&gt;I love this approach to surfacing something that’s a power user feature and allowing anyone to discover it. Coupled with Snap Groups, it should also mean that when you plug a laptop into a monitor with Windows 11, your apps don’t go flying around and Windows will intelligently remember where you place them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIf3Pt"&gt;The last significant change to Windows 11 that we’re able to test right now is the new Microsoft Store. To put it simply, Microsoft’s app store for Windows has sucked since it first appeared nearly 10 years ago. Microsoft is finally allowing developers to submit any win32 traditional desktop app, and Microsoft Store has already become far more useful during a beta than it ever was before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xNdcomXi_a9HPtsWLh3hiRPZtWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22690995/store.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Microsoft Store in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2FnihM"&gt;Apps like Zoom, OBS Studio, and Canva have already appeared in the store, just hours after Microsoft launched its Windows 11 preview. That’s an encouraging start, and Microsoft has promised Adobe Creative Suite and others will also be available soon. The Store feels a lot more lightweight now, and basic things like search don’t appear to break as they did often in Windows 10. I’m hoping that, coupled with Microsoft’s store revenue changes, developers will list their apps here and we’ll finally have a location to download Windows apps that doesn’t involve people searching from .exe files across the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFtf42"&gt;Outside of what’s visible in Windows 11, Microsoft is also making some changes that will improve PC gaming thanks to the company’s Xbox work. The new Xbox app will be integrated into Windows 11, offering a much better way to download and install games from Xbox Game Pass, and eventually xCloud game streaming, too. There’s also the Auto HDR feature from Xbox, automatically improving compatible games where developers haven’t added HDR support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcpfV3"&gt;DirectStorage, the same system used on Xbox, will also appear in Windows 11 to boost load times in compatible games. And there’s also Dynamic Refresh Rate, which will dynamically change refresh rates on laptops with 120Hz displays to save battery life. Microsoft is even adding in haptic feedback for stylus support in Windows 11, which means we’re about to see new hardware that will make inking an even better experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DgkvxRqPu9L-0CXuOOSBPsJ8ycg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22690997/inconsistent.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 still needs some work, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wJlx9L"&gt;Some of the other big changes in Windows 11 aren’t quite ready to be tested yet. Microsoft Teams integration in Windows 11 isn’t here yet, nor is the universal mute for microphones, or the Android apps in Windows. All of those are big changes to Windows 11 that will undoubtedly make the OS feel like an even bigger step forward beyond Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvK42B"&gt;But underneath Windows 11, it’s still fundamentally Windows. Microsoft has done some impressive surface-level work here to make Windows 11 feel new, fresh, and still familiar. This is only a preview, but it’s clear this OS isn’t quite finished. There are some inconsistencies across built-in apps and areas of the OS where you can feel that Microsoft is still mashing together Windows from a decade ago with this modern UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="TnygN1"&gt;I truly hope those inconsistencies will be cleared up in the coming months, because Windows 11 feels like a really solid foundation. Much like Panos Panay said about Windows being a home, the Windows 11 preview is a home renovation phase where Microsoft is letting us get an early look at what the builders are crafting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The sound of neurons firing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bRuvJEA4ZWvOUDog2xV2Jijz34w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69523490/CONTAINER_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aXIAdc"&gt;Looking through a microscope, doctoral candidate Simón(e) Sun takes a tiny glass pipette and gently attaches it to a neuron in a petri dish. She’s taking recordings of synaptic activity, the electrochemical signals neurons use to communicate with each other. The data Sun gathers will be used to understand microprocesses in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onvraj"&gt;It will also be turned into music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irlddi"&gt;Bridging science and art, Sun wrote a computer program that takes her data and &lt;a href="https://www.simonesun.com/music"&gt;converts it into song&lt;/a&gt;. And the ethereal MIDI sounds aren’t just nice to listen to — they can actually teach us a lot about how the brain works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkiZ3b"&gt;Sun is studying something called “&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5984303/"&gt;homeostatic plasticity&lt;/a&gt;,” which is how neurons regulate their activity. Her research has broad implications for the field of neuroscience. It might eventually help researchers better understand neuropsychiatric conditions like autism or help build better brain-computer interfaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhurn4"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;Science&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;video team joined Sun in the Tsien Lab at NYU Langone Health’s Neuroscience Institute to record some neurons and create an original song. Check out our latest video to see what we learned and experience the sounds of synapses. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Virgin Orbit launch its first commercial mission</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-AEROSPACE-VIRGIN-ORBIT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZQt0RbVPrzMMsL-YDCSbrUWCtRk=/0x0:4916x3277/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69523441/1230643749.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WZZHEp"&gt;Virgin Orbit is gearing up for its debut commercial mission from Southern California, five months after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22221212/virgin-orbit-rocket-test-launch-satellites-nasa-branson"&gt;first reached orbit during a January test flight&lt;/a&gt;. Seven satellites from three different countries are loaded onto a rocket that will blast off in midair from Virgin Orbit’s modified Boeing 747 less than an hour after the plane departs the Mojave Air and Space Port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFYdK3"&gt;Take off of the carrier aircraft, the modified Boeing plane named Cosmic Girl, is expected for 9:50AM ET. About an hour later, a 70-foot-long two-stage rocket called LauncherOne will ignite its single engine and take off from under the plane’s left wing over the Pacific ocean, zooming out of Earth’s atmosphere. The Netherlands’ first military satellite, three tiny satellites from a Defense Department test program, and the first two of 14 imaging satellites for SatRevolution’s constellation will soar toward orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rf9viz"&gt;This is the first mission Virgin Orbit decided to livestream publicly. You can watch the video stream &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgL5pMDktxA&amp;amp;ab_channel=VirginOrbit"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube. The company also plans to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VirginOrbit"&gt;tweet out updates&lt;/a&gt; during the mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7jEpP"&gt;Virgin Orbit calls the mission “Tubular Bells: Part One,” marking its third flight since May 2020 and the debut of its commercial satellite service. That first flight attempt &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/25/21265057/virgin-orbit-launcherone-rocket-test-launch-747-airplane-cosmic-girl"&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt; to reach orbit when an interrupted fuel line caused the rocket to shut down shortly after detaching from Cosmic Girl. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22221212/virgin-orbit-rocket-test-launch-satellites-nasa-branson"&gt;next attempt in January&lt;/a&gt;, carrying satellite payloads for the first time, was a success and capped Virgin Orbit’s test program. Wednesday’s Tubular Bells mission will be followed by at least one more mission this year, CEO Dan Hart told reporters on a Tuesday call (without providing a specific date for that mission). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AwZG2Z"&gt;The missions will precede a much busier launch schedule in 2022. “Now it’s a matter of just continuing to ramp up and moving rockets through integration,” Hart said, expecting six launches in 2022. He added Virgin Orbit signed “quite a few” launch deals after its January test flight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DAZN will stream UEFA Women’s Champions League free on YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Barcelona v Paris Saint-Germain - UEFA Women’s Champions League Semi Final: Leg Two" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hHx7j7BSA4c2Xh6Fbl-9Uuh5dbg=/0x0:4590x3060/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69523411/1232664409.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Urbanandsport/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nvyUiI"&gt;Sports streaming service DAZN announced today that it has acquired exclusive rights to stream the UEFA Women’s Champions League. As part of the deal, an overwhelming majority of the matches it streams over the next four seasons will be available for free on its YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oByNYZ"&gt;DAZN — best known in the US as a hub for boxing events — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21162594/dazn-international-expansion-200-countries-canelo-nfl-nhl"&gt;expanded to over 200 countries&lt;/a&gt; in December. It’s backed by billionaire Len Blavatnik who aspires to make DAZN the “Netflix of sport.” Former Disney exec Kevin Mayer &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/kevin-mayer-on-leaving-disney-and-tiktok-joining-dazn-pay-tv-decline.html"&gt;joined DAZN as chairman in March&lt;/a&gt; to help make that happen, after Mayer abruptly quit TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403698/tiktok-ceo-kevin-mayer-resigns-trump-administration-ban-microsoft-disney"&gt;due to Trump’s meddling&lt;/a&gt;. While at Disney, Mayer led the development of the wildly successful Disney Plus service and was widely believed to be Bob Iger’s successor, only to be overlooked when Iger stepped down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DKnAf5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first two seasons for free&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jW6BFl"&gt;In the deal announced Wednesday, DAZN says that it secured global streaming rights as well as broadcaster responsibilities through 2025. As part of its partnership with YouTube, DAZN said it will livestream the first two seasons for free on the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3MFxm"&gt;The agreement makes 61 matches viewable in real time on the DAZN YouTube channel. During the 2023-2025 season, 19 of the 61 matches will be streamable on Google’s video service, while all 61 will be available through DAZN itself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SpRR0a"&gt;“DAZN is thrilled to be the new global broadcaster for UEFA Women’s Champions League and cannot wait to work with YouTube and Google to bring fans closer to the game and shine a brighter light on its stars than ever before,” DAZN Group co-CEO James Rushton said in a statement. “Overnight, this will make the best women’s football easier to watch around the world than ever before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEAONO"&gt;The deal for exclusive global streaming rights does exclude several key markets, including the Middle East and North Africa as well as China. After a free trial period, the service normally costs $20 per month or $100 per year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s WH-1000XM3 are a great deal at $190</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sony WH-1000XM3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_QFRjkI3-Qwy846tlcGJf-_DEjc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69523337/jbareham_180823_2895_0075.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vdkYWH"&gt;There’s a fantastic discount happening on the previous generation Sony WH-1000XM3 wireless, noise-canceling headphones at Best Buy. Originally $350 (but usually around $250 or so these days), &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743780474724360893#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get them for $190 new&lt;/a&gt;. While these lack some niceties found in the newer XM4 model (concurrent Bluetooth connections, auto play / pause when you remove them or put them on), the package is overall similar in terms of nailing the fundamentals. These have great battery life, USB-C charging, among the best noise cancellation effect around, and sound quality that’s tough to beat at this price. In addition, these come with a zip-up case that makes them easy to stow. I bought these in 2018 and am still patting myself on the back for that decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="dLWHsU"&gt;Nintendo’s limited-edition Game &amp;amp; Watch handheld is $10 off at B&amp;amp;H Photo, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594162-REG%2Fnintendo_hxasraaaa_game_watch_super.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F6%2F30%2F22557070%2Fsony-wh1000xm3-headphones-nintendo-game-watch-jbl-charge-4-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costing $40 instead of $50&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth picking up if you want easy access to classic games like the original &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Super Mario Bros. 2&lt;/em&gt;, and a Mario-themed version of &lt;em&gt;Ball&lt;/em&gt;. The handheld itself is more technologically impressive than original Game &amp;amp; Watch consoles, with a color LCD screen and USB-C charging.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tIxHDb"&gt;If you love both retro Neogeo games and modern fighting games, Neogeo’s Arcade Stick Pro seems like it was made just for you. Normally $150 on Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fneogeo-arcade-stick-pro-controller-pack%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_3_7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get it on Woot for $120&lt;/a&gt;. You can connect it to a TV via HDMI to play 20 built-in games, or simply use the device as a gamepad for any game that supports that kind of input. It works while connected to a Nintendo Switch, and it includes a USB adapter to work on PlayStation consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xxy7hB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10630903"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="dGdhbL"&gt;
&lt;p id="c1tJOY"&gt;Summer is here, and if you’re in need of a Bluetooth speaker that sports long battery life and a waterproof design for the beach or a poolside party, check out JBL’s Charge 4. It can last up to 20 hours on a charge (and can charge a device with its USB-C port), and it has IPX7 water and dust resistance. Originally $180, you can get the red-colored speaker for $110 at B&amp;amp;H Photo.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to block and report text spam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4L-IfKtQ76K7Il4nXctrhDAQtl4=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69520154/texting_lumia.0.1437583471.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xS9Cl4"&gt;Spam texts can be incredibly irritating — you get a notification and stop what you’re doing to check your phone, only to find somebody is trying to sell you something you don’t want. How can you prevent it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cz3VXk"&gt;Unfortunately, there are no absolutes in preventing text spam. But there are some ways you can at least minimize the number of spam texts that get through. Here are some strategies to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kZBYfb"&gt;Do not answer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6jYMm1"&gt;Top of the list is — as you probably already know — never reply to a spam text, and never &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; click on a link within a spam text. If you’re not sure whether a text is spam or legitimate, hold off on replying until you’ve done a bit of research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6qez8i"&gt;Use the spam filter on your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rIeftn"&gt;Android phones and iPhones have spam-filtering features that you can enable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NuvT8Q"&gt;If you have an Android phone:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aZycxQ"&gt;Open the Messages app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Aitn1H"&gt;Click on the three dots in the upper-right corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AcwIN3"&gt;Select “Settings” &amp;gt; “Spam protection”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Qw3pYw"&gt;Make sure “Enable spam protection” is toggled on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="LIp4DO"&gt;If you want to see what numbers you’ve marked as spam, you can go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Spam &amp;amp; blocked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To set up spam blocking, go to “Settings” &amp;amp;gt; “Spam protection.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FXwdP2ahVxd3OAOhvklYwpyG92s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688826/Screenshot_20210629_115526.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Spam protection.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle on “Enable spam protection.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N95yPCbJSuhETaseeQ-cGaSctgw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688921/Screenshot_20210629_115223.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle on “Enable spam protection.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Bhbi4Z"&gt;If you have an iPhone:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lVIqKL"&gt;Apple’s spam blocking is a little more basic than Android’s: it blocks phone numbers that you &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099"&gt;don’t have saved in your contacts list&lt;/a&gt; and haven’t been in contact with before, which could be an issue (say, if you’re expecting a call from a car service). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mT9Wfz"&gt;Open the Settings app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cON9RE"&gt;Scroll down to and select “Messages” &amp;gt; “Unknown &amp;amp; Spam”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9DWUaL"&gt;Toggle on “Filter Unknown Senders”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Scroll down to “Unknown &amp;amp;amp; Spam.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQ5MN3_pe8P_1cEcmcKEuXpe4ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688833/IMG_DE165A8C72D3_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scroll down to “Unknown &amp;amp; Spam.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle on “Filter Unknown Senders.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/54lBOdOA3HP0fjky5doQXJanBug=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688834/ios_spam_filter.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle on “Filter Unknown Senders.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OAOftX"&gt;Block specific texts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CPlAZi"&gt;When you get a spam text, you can block that individual number from contacting you again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CHYvJs"&gt;If you have an Android phone: &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="y9iZCr"&gt;When you tap on a message that Android tags as suspicious, the OS will often give you the opportunity to report it as spam (or verify that it’s not spam). But if you get a spam text that wasn’t flagged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YMRXxv"&gt;Tap the three dots in the upper-right corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gj3lEy"&gt;Select “Details” &amp;gt; “Block &amp;amp; report spam”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wNHf6y"&gt;You can just block that number if you want, or you can check “Report spam” to send the number to Google and possibly your carrier as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="JC7myw"&gt;Note that this process can differ depending on which Android phone you’re using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="EdU9wB"&gt;If you have an iPhone:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9x3Rtt"&gt;Open the spam text and select the user icon on top of the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BjzvjY"&gt;Tap on the “info” icon and then on the “info” button&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H2JCJ1"&gt;If you want to report an iMessage that you received as spam, then look for the “Report Junk” link under the message, tap it, tap “Delete,” and then “Report Junk.” Note that this doesn’t automatically block that phone number; you’ll have to do that separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AEFlot"&gt;Forward the text to 7726&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F8kP0O"&gt;If you’re using one of the major carriers (Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, or T-Mobile), you can report a spam text by forwarding it to 7726. (Note that this spells “SPAM” on your phone keyboard.) This may also work with other carriers; to find out if it’s possible, check with your carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hHZUy1"&gt;This isn’t just a US thing, by the way. Ofcom, which regulates the UK’s communications services, &lt;a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/problems/tackling-nuisance-calls-and-messages/spam-texts"&gt;also accepts reports of spam texts&lt;/a&gt; forwarded to 7726.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rxUjrU"&gt;Block spam using your carrier’s services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4EbKlM"&gt;Most major carriers these days offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327304/spam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android"&gt;spam-blocking services for phone calls&lt;/a&gt;, and these can carry over to texts. Carrier sites will offer details about free and for-pay security services offered by &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/security/security-apps/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fplans-features%2Fblock-unwanted-calls&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22555521%2Fspam-text-block-security-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/call-filter/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;; if you use a different carrier, check its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AbbBTq"&gt;Use a third-party spam-blocking service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cz49nD"&gt;If you’re really frustrated and the above strategies aren’t working for you, you can try using a third-party anti-spam service. These are not free. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.robokiller.com/"&gt;RoboKiller&lt;/a&gt; costs $4.99 a month or $39.99 a year after a seven-day trial, while &lt;a href="https://nomorobo.com/"&gt;Nomorobo&lt;/a&gt; costs $1.99 per month per device after a 14-day trial. If you do decide you need a third-party service, you can use the trial to see if it works for you before committing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s Mini LED TVs to release in the US starting in July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kqTZTekFcsJkJVlsFbhVgsF5iRM=/0x108:1863x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69522668/LG_8K_QNED_Mini_LED_03.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s Mini LED use an array of thousands of tiny LEDs as a backlight.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="98Wumc"&gt;LG’s new range of Mini LED TVs, which it’s branding “QNED,” are releasing worldwide starting next month, the &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/06/now-rolling-out-worldwide-lg-qned-mini-led-tv-sets-new-standard-for-lcd-picture-quality/"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The lineup consists of three sets, the 8K QNED99 and QNED95, and the 4K QNED90, ranging in size from 65- to 86-inches. LG says the TVs will launch first in North America, with additional regions following “in the weeks ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xyb1U3"&gt;Mini LED is a relatively new kind of display technology which uses an array of thousands of tiny LEDs as a screen’s backlight. Because there are so many (up to 30,000 in the case of the 86-inch QNED99), they can create a sharper contrast between light and dark areas of an image. LG says the technology, which has previously been used on some TVs from TCL as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;Apple’s latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, allows for “10 times better contrast ratio” than normal LCD TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DvSRJb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not to be confused with MicroLED&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FFUqy9"&gt;LG is marketing Mini LED as a “giant leap forward in LCD TV picture quality,” but it’s not quite at the level of an OLED TV, where its the individual pixels themselves that are illuminating to create an image (with Mini LED, the LEDs are still shining through an LCD layer). Mini LED should not be confused with Samsung’s outrageously expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18168793/samsungs-75-inch-microled-4k-tv-pitcure-quality-ces-2019"&gt;MicroLED&lt;/a&gt; technology, which also uses an array of tiny LEDs but without the need for an LCD layer at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpaZpo"&gt;We’ve reached out to LG to clarify pricing for its full lineup of QNED TVs (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fqned-mini-led-tv&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F30%2F22556962%2Flg-mini-led-qned-tvs-release-date-usa-july" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s US site&lt;/a&gt; still lists them as “coming soon”) but based on a previous report &lt;a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1612506923"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;FlatPanelsHD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; they’re unlikely to come cheap. The 8K QNED99 will reportedly start at $5,000 for the 75-inch model, rising to $8,000 for the 86-inch version, while the 4K QNED90 will reportedly cost up to $4,000 for the 86-inch model. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple isn’t backing down from its hybrid work model, according to internal note</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jc9msMcOm5mdjtNGvste1f9dXpM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521850/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UfXTiO"&gt;Apple isn’t backing down from its hybrid work model that will require most employees to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Fully remote positions will be extremely limited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fST2ny"&gt;“We believe that in-person collaboration is essential to our culture and our future,” said Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of retail and people, in a video recording viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If we take a moment to reflect on our unbelievable product launches this past year, the products and the launch execution were built upon the base of years of work that we did when we were all together in-person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiBoeB"&gt;The news comes nearly a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook sent out an email&lt;/a&gt; telling employees the company was rolling out a new work model that would require them to return to in-office work on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays starting in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLC88B"&gt;In the wake of that announcement, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;Apple employees wrote a letter&lt;/a&gt; saying some employees had been forced to quit because of the policy, and asking Cook to change his stance. They asked that all teams be given the option to work remotely, noting “without the inclusivity that flexibility brings, many of us feel we have to choose between either a combination of our families, our well-being, and being empowered to do our best work, or being a part of Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agQ9e0"&gt;Now, Apple is essentially denying that request, saying any remote work decisions will be made “on a case-by-case basis with any new remote positions requiring executive approval.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iiEsmz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom acquires an AI company building real-time translation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G7QRoJkPxYdYcfhbcmvgqkEVUSg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69521666/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KwQpF0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-to-acquire-kites-gmbh/"&gt;Zoom has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s acquiring a company known as Kites (short for Karlsruhe Information Technology Solutions), which has worked on creating real-time translation and transcription software. Zoom says the acquisition is a move to help it make communicating with people who speak different languages easier, and that it’s looking to add translation capabilities to its video conferencing app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCEVrd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kites.ai/"&gt;According to its site&lt;/a&gt;, Kites began at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and its technology was originally developed to &lt;a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2020-10-ai-outperforms-humans-speech-recognition.html"&gt;act as in-classroom translation&lt;/a&gt; for students who needed help understanding the English or German their professors were lecturing in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a1LvAY"&gt;Zoom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300740/zoom-live-transcription-closed-captions-accessibility-free-accounts"&gt;already has real-time transcriptions&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s limited to people who are talking in English. &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207279736-Closed-captioning-and-live-transcription"&gt;On a support page&lt;/a&gt;, Zoom also makes it clear that its current live transcription feature may not meet certain accuracy requirements. The company says it’s considering opening a research center in Germany, where the Kites team will be staying.&lt;/p&gt;
