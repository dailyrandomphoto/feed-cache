    <title>25 years later, Space Jam has a new website — and the first trailer for the sequel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JlDArEwX8Wm6K6j2OjeKcChXMpo=/13x0:720x471/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69071395/space_jam.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtSOu5"&gt;Since 1996, &lt;a href="http://spacejam.com"&gt;spacejam.com&lt;/a&gt; has been an internet time capsule &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/20/4245466/how-space-jam-proves-the-internet-is-a-time-capsule"&gt;like few others still in existence&lt;/a&gt; — a largely pristine sample of the early World Wide Web and all the most advanced multimedia offerings available at the time, such as animated GIFs and Windows 95 screensavers. But 25 years later, it’s finally been supplanted; the new sequel &lt;em&gt;Space Jam: A New Legacy, &lt;/em&gt;starring LeBron James, has taken over the URL to showcase the new movie’s very first trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Coh2aJ"&gt;Here’s what spacejam.com looks like today:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j6i-awVduqBS3IyD9gQLyPUM-r0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22418492/chrome_j0GOqtMX2b.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CAFEXX"&gt;But before you go boycotting the sequel, you should probably know that the original &lt;em&gt;Space Jam&lt;/em&gt; website isn’t dead yet. In fact, it’s just one click away at &lt;a href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996"&gt;spacejam.com/1996&lt;/a&gt;, and the new website lets you that original Space Jam logo (in the upper-right-hand corner) to go back in time again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OftbiL"&gt;Here’s that new trailer for the LeBron James version — featuring both a cartoon LeBron James, and upscaled CGI versions of the Looney Toons crew as well. Looks like they’ll be breaking into the real world once again! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R9CcaH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/olXYZOsXw_o?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HmNH5y"&gt;Will LeBron go Googling for the original &lt;em&gt;Space Jam&lt;/em&gt; website in the film (or, perhaps, will Daffy or Bugs remark that it’s still there?) I think it’s a safe bet. It’ll arrive on July 16th in theaters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;and HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We’re on the knife’s edge of the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vaccination Site Opens At Elementary School In Louisville As Kentucky Sees Rise In COVID-19 Cases" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BZ_kTq730j-toLs0T5slnnqjb0o=/0x0:6063x4042/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69070824/1232071704.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zvCgJ0"&gt;This is a surreal moment in the pandemic, brimming with hope and fear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ShPTWJ"&gt;Here in the US we’re at the last leg in a marathon — vaccines are here, and appointments to get those shots are becoming more plentiful. People are planning for the moments they’ve put off for a year or more. The finish line is in sight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdCSYW"&gt;At the exact same time, our will to power through to the end just slammed into a wall. Restrictions are lifting while cases are still high, sending case counts through the roof. Hospitals are getting crowded again. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/us/coronavirus-testing-declines.html"&gt;Testing has dropped&lt;/a&gt;, leaving us with incomplete information as new variants take hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="TAkG13"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fmD3yy"&gt;“We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are and so much reason for hope,” &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cdc-director-has-feeling-of-impending-doom-amid-new-spike/2021/03/29/c6fe0458-90ab-11eb-aadc-af78701a30ca_story.html"&gt;said Rochelle Walensky&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a press conference this week. “But right now, I’m scared.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEmeD5"&gt;It’s the juxtaposition of pandemic weariness and vaccine euphoria that may make the next few months the most heartbreaking as many people keep getting sick, and some tragically die. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hna5Yb"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/03/31/with-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-loved-ones-feel-the-anguish-of-covid-19-deaths-particularly-hard/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;STAT &lt;/em&gt;this week&lt;/a&gt;, reporter Andrew Joseph writes about the particular agony families are going through as some members get vaccinated at the same time their loved ones pass away from COVID-19. “[A]s the weeks go by,” Joseph writes, “some deaths will increasingly feel like they might not have happened if vaccine campaigns were moving a bit faster, if we could hold off bumps in spread for a bit longer, if we could drive down transmission a bit more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j329zl"&gt;The past year has been riddled with deaths that didn’t need to happen. Earlier this week, Deborah Birx, former coronavirus coordinator under the Trump Administration, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/27/politics/covid-war-deaths-preventable/index.html"&gt;said in a &lt;em&gt;CNN &lt;/em&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; that hundreds of thousands of deaths in the US could have been averted if the government had acted more swiftly. But even after all those lessons and all those unnecessary deaths, the death toll is still growing — slower than before, but it has nowhere to go but up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVDwNt"&gt;Meanwhile, in stark contrast to our &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/22327548/covid-19-grief-bereavement-loss"&gt;national grief&lt;/a&gt;, there’s the relief and joy of millions of people getting vaccinated every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kgC2P"&gt;It feels like we live in a permanent state of contradiction. Yesterday, the CDC was loosening travel guidelines for fully vaccinated people, while CDC director Walensky continued to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/science/cdc-travel-vaccinated.html"&gt;urge people to stay home and avoid unnecessary travel&lt;/a&gt;. Texas and Mississippi &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56297329"&gt;are lifting mask mandates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/california-reopening-faq.html#link-2fa61dce"&gt;California is easing restrictions&lt;/a&gt;, while President Biden &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/546177-biden-bemoans-too-many-acting-as-if-covid-19-fight-over-it-is-not"&gt;warns repeatedly that the fight is not yet over&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wes2H2"&gt;We wait uncomfortably in this liminal space, caught between two potential ways that the next few months could play out before we ultimately cross the finish line. Will we pass through it beaming, with our friends and family at our side? Or will the heavens open with a roar, drenching us, and driving some people off the course before they can reach the end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bbnawu"&gt;“You look out the front window and it’s raining,” Nirav Shah, director of Maine’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/as-coronavirus-infections-and-vaccinations-surge-hope-collides-with-dread/2021/04/02/d6bb9ff8-9318-11eb-bb49-5cb2a95f4cec_story.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “but from the back window, it’s sunny. And your house is literally on the cusp of the storm and you don’t know which way it’s going to go — stormy, or is it going to be sunny? That’s sort of where we are in COVID.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEFNpE"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;

Here’s an interesting interview about how they might change in the future. (Claudia Wallis/&lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These tech deals contain zero April Fool-ery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung’s One UI on the Galaxy S21 Ultra" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ph39LB8r90eY_j7JB5FRunwxRg0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69070618/vpavic_210119_4377_0157.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZXrz0e"&gt;Welcome to April. This month began with, frankly, too many brands insisting on making fools out of themselves. But now that the prankster holiday is behind us, we’re focused on deals that are still happening. This has been a fun week to write about deals because a little bit of everything has seen a discount. There have been several deals lately on game subscriptions, so my colleague Taylor Lyles put together &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348957/best-video-game-subscription-playstation-plus-xbox-game-pass-nintendo-switch-online-deals-price-sale"&gt;a big up-to-date guide&lt;/a&gt; to help you find the best prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="LlEHyK"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fqOvNy"&gt;Nomad’s Base Station Pro is half off until Saturday night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ATH8c1"&gt;If you have an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods and are still lamenting the fact that the AirPower charging mat never released, check out this deal. Nomad’s Base Station Pro does what the AirPower promised to do — charge three devices simultaneously — &lt;a href="https://www.pjtra.com/t/8-10090-88849-119386?sid=VergeDealExclusiveApril2021&amp;amp;website=309942&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fbase-station-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;and you can get it for $100&lt;/a&gt; instead of $200 through Sunday, April 4th, at 2:59AM ET (Saturday, April 3rd, at 11:59PM PT) when you use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VOX &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g5cwoA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="QZHhZ7"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O0unjQ"&gt;Save up to $150 on Samsung’s Galaxy S21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOkQ7f"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is currently offering the best prices on a new Samsung Galaxy S21 phone that’s carrier unlocked and works with most carriers globally. The S21 with 256GB of storage is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1614285-REG%2Fsamsung_sm_g991uzaexaa_s21_256gb_5g_smartphone.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F4%2F3%2F22364153%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s21-1password-nomad-base-station-pro-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available in the phantom gray color for $700&lt;/a&gt;. This is notable because it’s the same price as the 128GB version at Amazon right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Li7kix"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326026"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="MM2Zzs"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dlP4bB"&gt;Get a year of 1Password’s family subscription for half off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="56tN6W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers can save on 1Password’s password manager for the entire family (up to five people, including those who might live in a different household). One year of the service usually costs $60, but new users can sign up now and &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-14494353?sid=Verge1PasswordApril21" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spend just $30 over the course of a year&lt;/a&gt;. The monthly cost is just $2.50 to get individual access to the app on iOS, Android, macOS, Windows 10, or browser. This deal expires on April 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5srL8z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10426335" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Amazon apologizes for lying about pee — and attempts to shift the blame</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AneGtrqb-sd-IlqOcjX4QwBsvXk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69070243/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FbGdDN"&gt;Amazon has issued a rare public apology — but not to its workers, and with no real admission of guilt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kyRhC"&gt;Over a week ago, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350337/amazon-peeing-in-bottles-workers-exploitation-twitter-response-evidence"&gt;was caught publicly lying&lt;/a&gt; to Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) that its workers never feel the need to pee in water bottles (which is, in fact, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles"&gt;a well-documented issue at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516004/amazon-warehouse-fulfillment-centers-productivity-firing-terminations"&gt;how it robotically tracks and fires its laborers&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1d3r9e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon denies stories of workers peeing in bottles, receives a flood of evidence in return","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350337/amazon-peeing-in-bottles-workers-exploitation-twitter-response-evidence"},{"title":"How Amazon automatically tracks and fires warehouse workers for ‘productivity’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516004/amazon-warehouse-fulfillment-centers-productivity-firing-terminations"},{"title":"Amazon keeps trying to troll US Congress members in perplexing new PR strategy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352977/amazon-twitter-feud-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-trolling-labor-pee-bottles"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gOLV7L"&gt;Now, late on the Friday evening before Easter weekend, when few (hat tip to &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-offers-rare-apology-says-will-look-solutions-drivers-peeing-bottles/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeekWire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) are paying attention, &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/our-recent-response-to-representative-pocan"&gt;the company is apologizing to Pocan&lt;/a&gt; — and no one else. Amazon only apologizes for not being “accurate” enough, too — not for actually creating and contributing to situations where workers pee in bottles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jcVfw9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The @AmazonNews account didn’t bother to tweet any of this, BTW&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qky4SW"&gt;In fact, Amazon goes so far as to suggest the whole pee bottle thing is simply a regrettable status quo, pointing out a handful of times when other companies’ delivery drivers were also caught peeing in bottles, as well as embedding a handful of random comments on Twitter that happen to support Amazon’s views. You can almost &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/3/28/22354604/amazon-twitter-bernie-sanders-jeff-bezos-union-alabama-elizabeth-warren"&gt;hear Jeff Bezos saying&lt;/a&gt; “Why aren’t these people blaming UPS and FedEx? Let’s get more people thinking about them instead.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zgr8Rb"&gt;The blog post also strongly suggests that this is only an issue for delivery drivers, not Amazon’s warehouse workers — even though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17243026/amazon-warehouse-jobs-worker-conditions-bathroom-breaks"&gt;a 2018 expose from an undercover reporter found Amazon warehouse workers were also forced to skip bathroom breaks&lt;/a&gt;, and a worker who spoke to journalists &lt;em&gt;just last week&lt;/em&gt; suggested bathroom breaks were still an issue in 2021. “You’re sitting there and you have to go take a piss, but you don’t want to rack up ‘time off task,’” &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles"&gt;she told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPG26I"&gt;Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/27/22353929/lawsuit-alleges-amazon-failed-breaks-overtime-wages"&gt;currently facing a lawsuit over missed lunch breaks&lt;/a&gt; as well. And most importantly, all of this is happening in the shadow of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;an Amazon union vote in Bessemer, Alabama&lt;/a&gt; that could help shape the future of labor in the United States, let alone at Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WszsU0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon is becoming the face of American inequality","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356321/amazon-inequality-bezos-democrats-union-sanders-fulfillment"},{"title":"Why the Amazon union vote is bigger than Amazon","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="84IQeR"&gt;Amazon’s apology to Pocan is the kind of memo that deserves to be annotated, line-by-line, partially because one of its lines is actually fairly good — “Regardless of the fact that this is industry-wide, we would like to solve it. We don’t yet know how, but will look for solutions” — but because it’s past 1AM here and it turns out &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s blockquote tool doesn’t let me embed tweets, I’ll just give you the primary guts for now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="b4NN8w"&gt;On Wednesday last week, the @amazonnews Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonnews/status/1374911222361956359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1374911222361956359%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aboutamazon.com%2Fnews%2Fpolicy-news-views%2Four-recent-response-to-representative-pocan"&gt;tweeted the following&lt;/a&gt; back to Representative Mark Pocan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWl4sK"&gt;This was an own-goal, we’re unhappy about it, and we owe an apology to Representative Pocan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ViGRDh"&gt;First, the tweet was incorrect. It did not contemplate our large driver population and instead wrongly focused only on our fulfillment centers. A typical Amazon fulfillment center has dozens of restrooms, and employees are able to step away from their work station at any time. If any employee in a fulfillment center has a different experience, we encourage them to speak to their manager and we’ll work to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xX37Ak"&gt;Second, our process was flawed. The tweet did not receive proper scrutiny. We need to hold ourselves to an extremely high accuracy bar at all times, and that is especially so when we are criticizing the comments of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTeP8L"&gt;Third, we know that drivers can and do have trouble finding restrooms because of traffic or sometimes rural routes, and this has been especially the case during Covid when many public restrooms have been closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1F47ih"&gt;This is a long-standing, industry-wide issue and is not specific to Amazon. We’ve included just a few links below that discuss the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9OVuU"&gt;Regardless of the fact that this is industry-wide, we would like to solve it. We don’t yet know how, but will look for solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOwyI7"&gt;We will continue to speak out when misrepresented, but we will also work hard to always be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwnE7T"&gt;We apologize to Representative Pocan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jKXWyB"&gt;You can read &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/our-recent-response-to-representative-pocan"&gt;the full version here&lt;/a&gt;. When you’re finished, perhaps check out &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akd54e/she-wees-and-plastic-bags-amazons-pee-scandal-is-much-worse-for-women"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;’s interview with six &lt;em&gt;female&lt;/em&gt; Amazon delivery drivers&lt;/a&gt;, for whom the pee situation is obviously much worse.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX rocket debris lands on man’s farm in Washington</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EehkYxoJlo7vCl5X0mgqOGhqNes=/0x0:840x560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69069018/thumbnail_image2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A pressure vessel from SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket was found in a man’s farm last weekend. | Grant County Sheriff’s Office&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zRcHAa"&gt;A pressure vessel from a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket stage fell on a man’s farm in Washington State last week, leaving a “4-inch dent in the soil,” the local sheriff’s office said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0bPhD"&gt;The black Composite-Overwrapped Pressure Vessel, or COPV, was a remnant from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22351956/oregon-washington-meteor-shower-explanation-spacex-falcon-9-rocket-debris"&gt;alien invasion-looking breakup&lt;/a&gt; of a Falcon 9 second stage over Oregon and Washington on March 26, local officials said. The stage reentered the atmosphere in an unusual spot in the sky after sending a payload of SpaceX’s Starlink satellites to orbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBsJEW"&gt;A Grant County, Washington property owner, who told authorities he didn’t want to be identified, found the errant COPV — roughly the size and shape of a hefty punching bag — sitting on his farm one morning last weekend. He reported it to the Grant County Sheriff’s Office, GCSO spokesman Kyle Foreman said in a phone call. A sergeant was dispatched on Monday to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JDZZOH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Of course we didn’t have a protocol for this”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ExPZa"&gt;“Neither the property owner nor our sergeant are rocket scientists, of course, but judging from what had happened a few days prior, it looked to them like it was possibly debris from the Falcon 9 reentry,” Foreman said. So the sergeant called SpaceX, which confirmed to GCSO it appeared to be their’s and dispatched employees to retrieve the COPV on Tuesday. SpaceX didn’t respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qLgkhVpWxL5bG3dj3R4bgolzuQA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22417145/image.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Grant County Sheriff’s Office&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The COPV left a neat, COPV-shaped dent in the man’s farm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DyBQQd"&gt;“Of course we didn’t have a protocol for this, so we just erred on the side of returning someone’s property to them,” Foreman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PK6E47"&gt;A COPV is a part of the Falcon 9’s second stage, the smaller section of the rocket that detaches from the main stage at the edge of space and boosts satellites farther from Earth. The COPV stores helium at pressures of nearly 6,000psi, which is used to pressurize the second stage’s large tanks of propellant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5K24iM"&gt;While most second stage parts either hang out in orbit for years or reenter Earth over the ocean, last week’s stage put on a spectacular nighttime show over populated areas in the northwestern US. And somehow from that show, a COPV ended up embedded roughly 4 inches into the property owner’s farmland, some 100 miles inward from the Pacific coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NwJFJZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Looks like something went wrong, but SpaceX has said nothing about it”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AHzdDS"&gt;Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and a keen tracker of things in space, had been keeping tabs on the second stage and said its reentry wasn’t a surprise — but the timing and location of the reentry was a head-scratcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6xnbx"&gt;“It is a bit of a puzzle that the stage was not de-orbited under control back on March 4 — looks like something went wrong, but SpaceX has said nothing about it,” McDowell said. “However, reentries of this kind happen every couple of weeks. It’s just unusual that it happens over a densely populated area, just because that’s a small fraction of the Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZ93vX"&gt;The COPV in Washington wasn’t the only piece of debris to land on US soil in recent weeks. An &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Erdayastronaut/status/1378039464266719232?s=20"&gt;absolute&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/considercosmos/status/1378076880717373443?s=20"&gt;hellstorm&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joroulette/status/1377018893965869056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1377018893965869056%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F30%2F22358060%2Fspacex-starship-prototype-fail-landing-texas"&gt;debris&lt;/a&gt; rained over SpaceX’s Boca Chica, Texas facilities on Tuesday when a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358060/spacex-starship-prototype-fail-landing-texas"&gt;Starship prototype exploded mid-air&lt;/a&gt; during its attempt to land, marking the fourth explosion of a Mars rocket prototype in a row in Elon Musk’s speedy Starship test campaign. The 16-story-tall test rocket successfully launched over six miles in the air, but its return was utterly unsuccessful and resulted in the loss of all test data from the mission.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is limiting which apps can see everything else you have installed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Frgur8nRg5A-H2eZt0Wa4HFhp3c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69068935/akrales_201012_4137_0020.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="irXDa6"&gt;Google will soon be more selective about which apps on the Play Store can see all of the other apps you have installed (via &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-is-restricting-which-apps-can-see-the-other-installed-apps-on-your-device/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;). &lt;/em&gt;As &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/new-play-store-rules-block-most-apps-from-scanning-your-entire-app-list/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;points out, your list of installed apps, innocent as it seems, can communicate to developers personal traits like dating preferences and political affiliations. So starting on May 5th, 2021, developers will have to provide a very good reason for why Google should let you access info like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0TR4ec"&gt;Android 11 apps that currently request the “QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES” permission can see the full list of apps you have stored on your device. But Google recently updated its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10446026?hl=en"&gt;Developer Program Policy&lt;/a&gt; and now considers that info to be “&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10144311?visit_id=637529906115169103-1524561010&amp;amp;rd=1"&gt;personal and sensitive user data&lt;/a&gt;,” restricting which apps are allowed to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5oi4O"&gt;Once the change goes into effect in May, apps can only use the permission if their “core user facing functionality or purpose, requires broad visibility into installed apps on the user’s device.” Examples of apps that will be permitted to continue using this permission include file managers, browsers, and antivirus apps that need the data “for awareness or interoperability purposes.” Banking apps, digital wallet apps, and any other app that involves “financial transaction functionality” will get a pass “for security based purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRT5wU"&gt;Apps that don’t have a justifiable use case for the permission risk being removed from the Google Play Store. All developers who want to keep the permission in their apps need to complete &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9214102"&gt;a declaration form&lt;/a&gt; justifying their use of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIURiv"&gt;In case you’re worried that developers could &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; misuse the permission, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10158779#zippy=%2Cinvalid-uses"&gt;Google’s documentation&lt;/a&gt; clearly states it will come down hard on offending apps, whether they’re new to the Play Store or just updates to existing apps. Google could suspend apps and possibly terminate developer accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Two Coinbase employees exchanged NFT rings with their wedding vows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mQ8FXw1hXEgHHt1gM5unnGlwoCA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69068893/acastro_210319_1777_nft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U0GroO"&gt;Two Coinbase employees have managed to find a heartwarming use for NFTs by incorporating them into their wedding, exchanging the digital tokens as part of the ceremony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQFORx"&gt;Rebecca Rose and Peter Kacherginsky &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rgoldilox/status/1378014366923071490"&gt;say that alongside their traditional Jewish ceremony&lt;/a&gt;, the couple also sent each other digital tokens as “virtual rings” to each other. In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rgoldilox/status/1378014389710712837"&gt;a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; about the wedding, Rose said that their virtual rings now exist on the blockchain “for all to see as proof of our commitment to each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RX62XV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Most people get married in a place of religious worship, on a beach, or in the mountains. Peter (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_iphelix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@_iphelix&lt;/a&gt;) and I are NOT most people. We got married on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blockchain?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#blockchain&lt;/a&gt;. 1/7 &lt;a href="https://t.co/2ExexrlLbZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2ExexrlLbZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rebecca Rose (@rgoldilox) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rgoldilox/status/1378014362896461839?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="9NQvNN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hkgybj"&gt;Normally, a wedding picture with the couple at the altar using their phones would be, to put it mildly, kind of depressing. But with the context that they’re basically exchanging rings, albeit in an untraditional way, it makes it kind of cute. It also helps that you can actually see the exchange for yourself — obviously, &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x961cf9036557e84fc4ac9526547574966293234d#events"&gt;it’s on the blockchain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGwet3"&gt;I know we rag on NFTs a lot here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but honestly, the more I dug into the nerdy details of this, the cuter it got. For example, they named the token Tabaat, the Hebrew word for “ring.” If you look up the &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x961cf9036557e84fc4ac9526547574966293234d"&gt;Tabaat token on Etherscan&lt;/a&gt;, it shows that two tokens have been minted, and no more can ever be made. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/nXNdO5ZhvhQ?t=147"&gt;How romantic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84xOUP"&gt;There’s also &lt;a href="https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPoi4HVM66QoQF59Csc6P9qJPuco6WEg1pyh4VgQXMsu3"&gt;the animation&lt;/a&gt; that the couple commissioned to add to the NFT, which is itself a pretty decent representation of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WCzgxr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The name of the token is Tabaat, the Hebrew word for ring. We stored an animation by artist Carl Johan Hasselrot (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cjhasselrot?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@cjhasselrot&lt;/a&gt;) inside the unique tokens, which illustrates two distinct things becoming one, like in marriage. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFTArt?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NFTArt&lt;/a&gt; 3/7 &lt;a href="https://t.co/5s8hLGbRdG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5s8hLGbRdG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rebecca Rose (@rgoldilox) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rgoldilox/status/1378014380646825985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WyA3zE"&gt;The charm from this story isn’t really in the technical details — most people probably wouldn’t find the blockchain all that romantic. It’s that two nerdy people found a nerdy thing they were both passionate about and worked it into an important moment in their relationship. That’s something pretty easy to love. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify leaks another look at the Car Thing, this time from within in its own app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sMwkREjXrojO9fUZsVNFwT_5WRQ=/0x0:1424x949/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69068792/carthing.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A leaked image of Spotify’s Car Thing. | Image: Spotify / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1378033575417815041" target="_blank"&gt;Steve Moser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hPKsBP"&gt;Spotify’s much-anticipated in-car gadget, a voice-controlled music player known colloquially as the Car Thing, has just shown up in a &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/02/spotify-ios-app-car-thing-images/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;handful of in-app renders unearthed by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;contributor Steve Moser&lt;/a&gt;, who found the images in Spotify’s app code. These renders match up quite closely with photographs of the real deal submitted as part of filings to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231876/spotify-car-thing-fcc-design-screen-pictures-photos"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;back in January&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4eYAZ"&gt;Thanks to these renders, we have a much cleaner look at the evolved Spotify Car Thing design, which includes a large knob on the right, a color screen, and four buttons on top. Earlier official company renders from back when the product was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/17/18628772/spotify-car-thing-audio-experience-data-premium-assistant"&gt;formally announced in 2019&lt;/a&gt; showed off a much smaller screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XiwkE"&gt;Yet, Spotify’s design has since moved much closer to a smart display style, which makes sense considering it now more closely resembles a miniature infotainment screen you’d find in a modern vehicle. These new renders show off the screen and a possible interface design, in addition to various mount designs for attaching the device to different parts of the dashboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6fGB5s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10426569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nhDUWF"&gt;There’s no telling when or even if Spotify plans to formally launch the product. The company’s February event, where it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;detailed its new Hi-Fi streaming tier&lt;/a&gt;, came and went without any new information on the Car Thing, and the device was announced in 2019 as just a test product to help Spotify better understand users’ listening habits while on the go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pL36UI"&gt;So there’s no formal product name, potential release date, or any other information indicating if this will ever make it out of Spotify’s testing lab and into a consumer’s car. But the updated design and the FCC filings — and now the in-app renders — do suggest the product may have a future. We just don’t know what it looks like right now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s next Pixels will reportedly switch to a custom in-house GS101 processor</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fllf4"&gt;Google’s next Pixel flagship — the presumably named “Pixel 6” — will reportedly feature a Google-designed GS101 “Whitechapel” SoC (system on a chip), a first for the company, as reported by &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/02/pixel-6-google-gs101-whitechapel/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-6-custom-system-on-chip/#update1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rjg04Y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;’s report claims Google is working on two phones that will feature the Arm-based GS101 — presumed to be a flagship device to succeed last year’s Pixel 5 and a Pixel 4A 5G follow-up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EhhKh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;’s report, meanwhile, goes into further detail on the new SoC, claiming the GS101 chips will feature a “three cluster setup with a TPU (Tensor Processing Unit)” for machine learning applications. (For reference, Qualcomm’s own flagship &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt; uses Arm’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/26/21267893/arm-cortex-a78-mali-g78-cpu-gpu-designs-smartphones-2021-samsung-qualcomm-apple"&gt;Cortex-X1 / Cortex-A78&lt;/a&gt; / Cortex-A55 as a triple cluster CPU setup.) Additionally, the new SoC may feature an integrated security chip, similar to the Titan M. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlHZpy"&gt;The idea of Google making a custom TPU or security chip isn’t new: Google has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/26/17616140/google-edge-tpu-on-device-ai-machine-learning-devkit"&gt;previously made TPUs for servers&lt;/a&gt; and the Pixel 4’s Neural Core, along with the discrete Titan M chip on its current phones. But the custom-designed GS101 would presumably allow the company to integrate those features on a deeper level.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noJs1F"&gt;Rumors of the Whitechapel chips have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21221062/google-processor-pixels-chromebooks-whitechapel-samsung-qualcomm"&gt;circulated since last year&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-google-readies-its-own-chip-for-future-pixels-chromebooks-e5f8479e-4a38-485c-a264-9ef9cf68908c.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Google was looking to develop its own in-house chips for use in Pixel and Chromebook devices. That report claimed the company would be optimizing its chip for Google’s machine learning technology — something the &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt; report corroborates. The GS101 chip for the 2021 Pixel lineup would be the first fruits of the Whitechapel project, although &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;’ original report noted that Chromebook chips weren’t expected until further in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0sawQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;’s report also includes references to a “Slider” codename tied to the new device, which it says is also connected to Samsung’s Exynos SoCs (which the company uses on Galaxy smartphone devices outside the US). Samsung’s involvement on the manufacturing side — which &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; also reported last year — would make sense, as one of the largest manufacturers of smartphone semiconductors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZCfSoD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A Google-designed GS101 chip is an intriguing idea&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hhh5jf"&gt;The idea of Google-designed chips is a compelling one. Apple has long touted its tightly integrated software and hardware stack as a key part of how its iPhones, iPads, and now, its Mac computers are able to run so well — a key part of which is the company’s custom-designed A-series and M-series chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhO3S3"&gt;Google — and almost every other Android manufacturer, save Samsung and Huawei — doesn’t have that advantage. It instead relies on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chips, which dominate the Android marketplace in the US. Oftentimes, an Android device lives or dies on how well its manufacturer is able to synergize Qualcomm’s chips, Google’s software, and its own hardware designs. Similarly, the fact that, at their core, almost every Android device runs on the same chipset and the same software makes it difficult for any one model to stand out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJbcjC"&gt;But a Google-designed GS101 chip brings a tantalizing promise: that Google could bring an Apple-like boost in speed, performance, and battery life to Android (and specifically, its Pixel lineup) with a similar level of control over the hardware design, software, and processor. It’s an intriguing idea — assuming Google can pull it off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYiog0"&gt;That said, building a smartphone processor at the level of Apple or Qualcomm isn’t easy. While both companies use Arm as a common base, they’ve spent years refining those basic building blocks with customizations to suit their needs. Apple has been using custom designs in its processors since the 2012’s A6 design (as opposed to previous models that used licensed CPU designs from Arm itself). Qualcomm takes a similar approach in its modern processors, using custom Kryo cores that are semi-customized versions of Arm’s base Cortex designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4Pys1"&gt;It might take Google a few generations to fine-tune its Pixel chips. But if Google can actually deliver on a proper customized chip that’s built from the ground up to be specifically designed for Android’s software and the Pixel’s hardware, it could be the key to transforming the Pixel line from a sideshow to a true smartphone powerhouse.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHoW8g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest in the global semiconductor shortage</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From consoles to cars, it seems like everyone is having a hard time getting enough chips&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="DHYGjq"&gt;As the COVID-19 pandemic hit, demand for tech products suddenly spiked, just as it became difficult for chipmakers to know how much production capacity they actually needed. Now, anyone looking to build something with a computer chip in it has to deal with a global shortage. It’s affecting the production of everything from the obvious, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325999/gogo-5g-network-delay-chip-shortage"&gt;5G rollout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/21991081"&gt;GPUs&lt;/a&gt;, to things you wouldn’t necessarily expect, like &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/22030524"&gt;trucks and cars&lt;/a&gt;. Even large companies like Samsung are having to reevaluate plans to make sure they’ll be able to get the chips they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgaT6J"&gt;The problem has gotten so bad that US President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order"&gt;has pledged to address it&lt;/a&gt;, but industry insiders say the problem &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/22122297"&gt;will be sticking around for a while&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll be tracking the latest evolutions in policy surrounding the shortage and keeping up with the latest products affected by it right here, so stay tuned if you want to stay on top of the latest delays and changes.&lt;/p&gt;
