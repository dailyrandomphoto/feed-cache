    <title>The Atari VCS retro console gets its long-awaited retail release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QCERDzPEAGgu7eQtnF9u9k_H1n8=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69459612/download__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Black Walnut” version of the console, which comes with a joystick and controller.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Atari&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xGKuSV"&gt;The Atari VCS — a part-desktop PC, part-retro console modeled after the Atari 2600 — is finally available to buy at retail. Atari is selling the console via &lt;a href="https://atarivcs.com/atari-vcs-800-black-walnut-all-in-bundle/"&gt;its own site&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fatari-vcs-800-black-walnut-all-in-bundle%2F6459020.p%3FskuId%3D6459020&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/627563/atari-vcs-800-black-walnut-full-bundle"&gt;Micro Center&lt;/a&gt; also have their listings. This isn’t the first time the console has been available to the public (&lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/atari-vcs-review/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VGC&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that IndieGoGo backers recently received their consoles) but it’s the first time the machine has been available to buy at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdgMCA"&gt;The VCS has been a long time coming. Originally teased in 2017 as the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/6/12/15783074/ataribox-teaser-new-atari-product"&gt;Ataribox&lt;/a&gt;,” the project re-emerged the following year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/19/17140190/ataribox-atari-vcs-name-preorder-date-classic-gaming-console"&gt;as the Atari VCS&lt;/a&gt;, with Atari running an IndieGoGo campaign to fund its development &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/30/17408184/ataris-vcs-console-preorder-specifications-release-date-pricing"&gt;in June 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, the console had been due to ship in mid-2019 but reportedly ran into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20907755/atari-vcs-troubled-development-architect-operating-system-crowdfunding-campaign"&gt;series of development difficulties&lt;/a&gt;, culminating in the project’s lead architect quitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WBnu9R"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q7DP4BouzT4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="di0ndV"&gt;The device that’s been released technically does what Atari promised, but reviews have been pretty middling. &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/atari-vcs-review/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VGC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says the console’s built-in selection of 100 Atari games (18 from the arcade and 82 from the Atari 2600 console) might be emulated perfectly, but many are “so incredibly basic that they really don’t hold up to the mildest scrutiny in 2021.” There’s also an app store where you can buy modern games, but pickings are slim and lacking in exclusives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAywAA"&gt;The console technically also works as a streaming box for services like Netflix and Disney Plus, but &lt;em&gt;VGC&lt;/em&gt; notes these are just “glorified Chrome bookmarks” rather than native apps. At least the promised desktop mode actually works, allowing you to install Windows, Linux, or ChromeOS and use the machine like a modestly-specced but cool-looking desktop PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9xBCe"&gt;If you do decide to go down the desktop PC route, the Atari VCS is powered by an AMD Ryzen R1606G system-on-a-chip, paired with 8GB of RAM and 32GB of storage (both upgradeable). There are two USB 3.1 ports on the front and two on the rear along with Ethernet and HDMI 2.0 ports. In other words, don’t expect this machine to rival an Xbox Series S despite its similar $299.99 starting price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M8Rnnl"&gt;Suffice it to say that you probably shouldn’t be rushing out to drop upwards of $299.99 on the Atari VCS (or $399.99 for the Walnut version, which comes with an included wireless joystick and controller, which retail separately for $59.99 each). But despite its flaws, it’s still an interesting mini PC that might be worth checking out as a curiosity when it inevitably drops in price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Orp8vs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is bringing next-gen Xbox games to the Xbox One with xCloud</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EIu8nqfXVD48aseTMdH2L0XvbhI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69459566/acastro_210429_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kmxHXo"&gt;Microsoft will let Xbox One owners play next-gen Xbox games through its xCloud service. The news was &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/06/13/xbox-and-bethesda-games-showcase-recap/"&gt;buried in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; recapping Microsoft’s Xbox + Bethesda showcase, with the company confirming plans to leverage Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) for Xbox One consoles. That means the 2013 hardware will be able to play Xbox Series X exclusive games from 2021 — extending the lifecycle of what would normally soon be obsolete boxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O19nwD"&gt;“For the millions of people who play on Xbox One consoles today, we are looking forward to sharing more about how we will bring many of these next-gen games, such as &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, to your console through Xbox Cloud Gaming, just like we do with mobile devices, tablets, and browsers,” says Will Tuttle, editor in chief of Microsoft’s Xbox Wire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Nurj5W"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft is launching xCloud for consoles later this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KcyjmE"&gt;Until now, Microsoft had only described &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527461/xbox-xcloud-game-streaming-try-before-download-feature"&gt;xCloud on consoles as a way for players to “try [games] before you download&lt;/a&gt;,” but it’s clear the company sees the service as offering much more. Microsoft originally announced &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; as an Xbox One title, before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168892/microsoft-flight-simulator-xbox-release-date-announced"&gt;quietly removing references&lt;/a&gt; to the Xbox One launch in December. Microsoft recently confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22527483/microsoft-flight-simulator-xbox-series-x-s-launch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator &lt;/em&gt;will now launch&lt;/a&gt; on Xbox Series X / S consoles on July 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngBECS"&gt;It’s not clear when xCloud game streaming will be available on Xbox One consoles, though. It’s unlikely to be ready in time for the July launch of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, and Microsoft’s head of cloud gaming, Kareem Choudhry, previously said xCloud will be integrated into consoles “later this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9aEIQ"&gt;xCloud availability will provide a welcome boost for Xbox One consoles, particularly as Microsoft is upgrading its server blades to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527432/microsoft-xcloud-server-xbox-series-x-hardware-upgrade-game-streaming"&gt;run Xbox Series X hardware&lt;/a&gt; later this month. It will give this older hardware a way to play &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release"&gt;upcoming titles like &lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which, like &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator,&lt;/em&gt; will also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release"&gt;launch exclusively on the new Xbox Series X / S consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lincoln vehicles getting hands-free driving feature and native Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jZlKP8paNWnsL9Wojtg4pUFfPeU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69459521/Future_Lincoln__Exterior_Tease_with_Embrace_Lighting.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5y6cVe"&gt;Lincoln, Ford’s luxury brand, has announced plans to make its entire lineup either hybrid or all-electric by 2030 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454728/ford-plus-pro-electric-explorer-suv-investment"&gt;as part of its parent company’s new business plan&lt;/a&gt;. The brand will reveal its first all-electric vehicle in 2022, and it expects that half of its global sales will be zero-emissions vehicles by around 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhCSnY"&gt;In addition, Lincoln vehicles are gaining a hands-free advanced driver assistance feature based on Ford’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383460/ford-bluecruise-hands-free-adas-f150-mustang-mache"&gt;BlueCruise&lt;/a&gt; system, though the luxury marque will call its version “ActiveGlide.” New Lincoln vehicles coming in 2023 will also feature Google’s native Android Automotive operating system, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260176/ford-google-android-infotainment-os-2023"&gt;is being added to “millions” of Ford vehicles&lt;/a&gt; that same year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tQj6Z"&gt;Four of Lincoln’s electric vehicles will be built on the new flexible EV platform that Ford announced in May when it laid out its new $30 billion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454728/ford-plus-pro-electric-explorer-suv-investment"&gt;“Ford Plus” business plan&lt;/a&gt;. That platform can power vehicles with all- or rear-wheel drive setups, and it “allows [Lincoln] to reimagine the interior space, and deliver the power of sanctuary in a new way for our clients,” John Jraiche, the company’s global director for luxury vehicles, said in a briefing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANNAGZ"&gt;In April, Lincoln &lt;a href="https://media.lincoln.com/content/lincolnmedia/lna/us/en/news/2021/04/19/lincoln-china-zephyr-reflection-preview-car.html"&gt;announced a concept car in China called Zephyr&lt;/a&gt; that the company said offers a good picture of what its future vehicles might look like, inside and out. It featured a dashboard-spanning screen and new user interface that Lincoln refers to as “Constellation.” Lincoln released a short video on Wednesday of what that new UI might look like. The company said its “designers and engineers are also experimenting with digital scenting techniques, exploring how warm, pleasant scents positively affect the mood and overall well-being of the passengers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZMHnc"&gt;Lincoln was previously working on co-developing its first all-electric vehicle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113578/lincoln-rivian-electric-suv-ford-platform-tech"&gt;with EV startup Rivian&lt;/a&gt;, of which Ford owns at least a 10 percent stake. But the luxury automaker announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240212/ford-lincoln-cancel-rivian-suv-ev-coronavirus-pandemic-investment"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the pandemic that the project was canceled. While it seemed at the time that Lincoln had said it was still working with Rivian on another EV, the company said this week that this was a miscommunication. Rivian is still working with Ford on a future product, but its involvement with the Lincoln brand ended last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCbbjo"&gt;In more near-term news, Lincoln announced that the 2021 Nautilus will receive its first over-the-air software updates starting this summer. Those will upgrade the onboard navigation system and improve the Apple CarPlay experience. Later this year, an update will add hands-free capability for the built-in Amazon Alexa digital assistant. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11’s default wallpapers are Microsoft’s best yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V04wTRtkcFsAMNFGnzWZZZLeqro=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69459494/windows11wallpapers.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PgGPhO"&gt;Windows 11 leaked yesterday, offering a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu"&gt;closer look at some of the UI changes&lt;/a&gt; Microsoft is planning for its next version of Windows. The leak has also revealed what will likely become Microsoft’s default wallpaper for Windows 11, and a collection of new wallpapers that are bundled with the operating system. They’re Microsoft’s best Windows wallpapers yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2o7Vfx"&gt;The main default wallpaper includes light and dark mode versions, with what looks like a crumpled piece of fabric. It’s a big departure from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/25/8845379/windows-10-desktop-wallpaper"&gt;Windows logo that was used as the default in Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;, or the two &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/7/26/3188381/windows-8-wallpaper-rtm-leak"&gt;daisy flowers in Windows 8&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g81W2a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10609233"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xDEr2d"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can download the full-size versions in the gallery above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeWASS"&gt;Microsoft has also included a collection of other wallpapers inside Windows 11. The “Captured Motion” set offer a more colorful option, and the “Flow” collection are a more subtle take on the default. “Glow” is a set of four colorful orbs that light up the Windows 11 backdrop, and the “Sunrise” collection are a clear nod to the Sun Valley codename for the Windows 11 UI work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBbgTk"&gt;As this is an early and incomplete version of Windows 11, it’s not clear how many of these images will ship in the final version. These already look better than the flowers and scenic backgrounds included in Windows 10, and fit the overall UI changes to Windows 11. If you haven’t seen exactly what Microsoft is changing in Windows 11, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu"&gt;check out our hands-on&lt;/a&gt; to see the new UI, Start menu, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New website tracks which colleges will use eproctoring software this fall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gKN6pIX0ZTgrWm7XRwczmL-G8PQ=/302x0:1570x845/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69459461/Annotation_2021_06_15_150505.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qoLDQO"&gt;Privacy-focused nonprofit Fight for the Future has launched a &lt;a href="https://www.baneproctoring.com/"&gt;new website&lt;/a&gt; that tracks whether certain colleges and universities plan to use virtual proctoring software during the fall semester. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nn4Lae"&gt;The platforms — like ProctorU and Proctorio — often make use of students’ webcams to watch and record them as they work, using automated systems or live monitors to flag possible signs of cheating. The practice has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254631/university-of-illinois-urbana-champaign-proctorio-online-test-proctoring-privacy"&gt;sparked controversy&lt;/a&gt; in the US, with critics in both academia and government citing privacy concerns and the potential for such software to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374386/proctorio-racial-bias-issues-opencv-facial-detection-schools-tests-remote-learning"&gt;discriminate against marginalized students&lt;/a&gt;. Still, some colleges began using eproctoring last year to watch for dishonesty on take-home exams, after moving testing online due to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjFUVD"&gt;Many schools will resume in-person examinations this fall due to the wide availability of COVID-19 vaccines, but it seems that some plan to continue using eproctoring software in some capacity. Fight for the Future says it has asked a number of colleges about their plans and has stamped each one with labels for “Won’t Use,” “Might Use,” and “Are Using.” (Colleges that haven’t responded to Fight for the Future’s inquiries got a “Might Use.”) Viewers are prompted to tweet at and email each university to denounce the software’s use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ox1dSClnRSx57tvuHX4z_g8vFCw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660733/Annotation_2021_06_15_151054.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bqorls"&gt;Also on the front page is a “webcam image test” meant to determine whether eproctoring algorithms could accurately identify a viewer’s face (following reports that such algorithms disproportionately &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5gxg3/proctorio-is-using-racist-algorithms-to-detect-faces"&gt;fail to identify faces with darker skin tones&lt;/a&gt;). Fight for the Future says the test uses the same computer vision software used by prominent eproctoring platform Proctorio, but insists that it doesn’t collect any data from the widget. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LUtYrbwwy80hFm7avmAQXR09ZKw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660740/Annotation_2021_06_15_151330.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NlUefA"&gt;The website also urges followers to sign a petition addressed to school administrators and to submit “eproctoring horror stories” to the organization. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="d8l7RU"&gt;Sony’s next-gen PlayStation VR headset is likely to come out in late 2022, according to a new report. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-16/fading-iphone-lcd-screen-maker-pivots-to-virtual-reality"&gt;Bloomberg’s sources say&lt;/a&gt; Sony is “aiming to release the successor in the holiday period next year,” and that the headset will use OLED panels from Samsung Display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bekJ37"&gt;A release in that timeframe wouldn’t be too surprising, since Sony has already started talking up the PS5 headset’s potential. Its existence was first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296998/sony-ps5-next-gen-vr-headset-virtual-reality-features"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; in February along with some initial details, and Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337700/sony-new-ps5-playstation-5-vr-controllers-features"&gt;followed up&lt;/a&gt; by showing off the new controllers in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5WTRHd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Doom 3 for PSVR is a solid showcase for Sony’s Aim Controller","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22361736/doom-3-vr-edition-review-ps4-psvr-aim-controller"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="IHcna9"&gt;The headset itself hasn’t yet been revealed. But according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429523/playstation-vr-ps5-rumors-eye-tracking-foviated-render-4k-screen-haptics"&gt;an &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; from last month, it’ll have a total resolution of 4000 x 2040 and make use of eye tracking to enable foveated rendering, which should ease the processing load by using lower resolution imagery in your peripheral vision. The next-gen PSVR is also said to use inside-out tracking and include haptic feedback in the headset as well as the controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oj1oTK"&gt;Bloomberg’s report is more broadly focused on Japan Display Inc, an LCD specialist that has seen smartphone display sales slump as the market moved to OLED but now considers VR headsets “big business.” While OLED was initially the standard for VR, more recently manufacturers like Facebook and HTC have been moving to LCD panels because they’re more practical at higher resolutions, despite having lower contrast. Sony, however, appears to be sticking with OLED for the next PSVR.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus has no plans for a lower cost ad-supported option for now, CEO says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="disney+" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3M09JT8ikcC5kuw6rBscHimi6bM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69458264/disneyplus.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3IZQBf"&gt;Many major streamers support advertising in some form or another — think Hulu, HBO Max, or Sling TV as just a few examples — but Disney’s chief says the company’s marquee service won’t be adding ads to its service anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDnLJo"&gt;Speaking at the &lt;a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-at-the-credit-suisse-23rd-annual-communications-conference/"&gt;Credit Suisse 23rd Annual Communications Conference&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, Disney head Bob Chapek was asked by moderator and Credit Suisse managing director Doug Mitchelson whether the service planned to introduce an ad-supported entry tier at some point down the line. While he didn’t entirely dismiss the concept of a cheaper ad-supported tier on Disney Plus, Chapek said it wasn’t something the company was currently planning for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZZeCA"&gt;“We’re always reevaluating how we go to market across the world, but we’ve got no such plans now to do that. We’re happy with the models that we’ve got right now,” Chapek said. “We won’t limit ourselves and say no to anything. But right now, we have no such plans for that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKBB6a"&gt;Mitchelson raised an interesting point: Many Disney consumers are already familiar with an ad experience through the Disney Channel — it’s offered through cable, after all — and ad-supported streaming offered at a discount is popular among many major services. But as for its current pricing and that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348169/disney-price-increase-united-states-bundle-date"&gt;recent price hike&lt;/a&gt;? Chapek said that the leap from $7 per month to $8 did little to affect the company’s subscription numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B1piSH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Right now, we have no such plans for that.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="grYAu5"&gt;“We did launch at a very attractive price-value opening point,” Chapek said. “The first price increase that you mentioned in the first 16 months happened recently, and we’ve seen no significantly higher churn because of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4EtIh"&gt;Disney Plus will certainly see subscription increases over time. Most major services jack up their prices regularly, with many arguing that the value they provide justifies the ever-climbing monthly subscription fees. How quickly we’ll see Disney crank pricing up to Netflix- and HBO Max-subscription levels, however, is unclear. Based on &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/1/16/18185174/netflix-price-increase-subscription-chart-original-content-streaming"&gt;streaming trends&lt;/a&gt; for virtually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570259/hulu-live-tv-price-increase-cable-sports-news-virtual-bundle-disney"&gt;every&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540346/netflix-price-increase-united-states-standard-premium-content-product-features"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;streaming&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309678/fubo-tv-subscription-price-increase-cost-family-plan-standard-youtube-disney-warnermedia"&gt;service&lt;/a&gt; over the last several years, we’re very likely to see Disney’s cost continue to go up as well as the app expands its library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwaCc1"&gt;When the cost of the service does eventually climb to more closely mirror the value of the service, Disney would be wise to introduce either an a la carte tier to its service or add some kind of ad-supported plan. For now, at least, we’re spared.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zuckerberg says original Oculus Quest will get Air Link wireless streaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8uPlU9day7U464fy_I1hiC7blqo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69458128/akrales_190429_3371_0104.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vQO7Ua"&gt;Owners of the original Oculus Quest will get the ability to stream from their PCs to their headsets wirelessly, using the Air Link system that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22400197/oculus-quest-2-air-link-pc-streaming-v28-launch"&gt;been available to Quest 2 &lt;/a&gt;owners for a few months. When the feature was originally announced, it was an open question as to when the first-gen headset would get it (or if it even would), but &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113230565252971"&gt;under a post&lt;/a&gt; about the v30 update for Quest, Mark Zuckerberg said that Air Link would be coming “soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yeN9A6S0huEjLf_IP-9kuYZri9Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22661183/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zuckerberg’s post about the v30 update and his comment about Air Link.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NLuLNg"&gt;In the post itself, he also shows off being able to use multiple windows to multitask in Oculus Home, which acts as a virtual environment. In the video, he opens three windows at once, creating an environment not unlike sitting in front of three curved monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJsxqD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-quest-guardian-size-increasing/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the v30 update will also include the ability to create a bigger play space, with the Guardian system being updated to handle boundaries of 15m by 15m, or  just over 2,400 square feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qoIZnt"&gt;At the moment, Facebook hasn’t said when the v30 update will be coming out. The company said it didn’t have anything to add to Mark’s post when asked for comment about the release date, and wouldn’t say whether Air Link for the original Quest would be included in the v30 release or a different future update.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Noctua’s long-awaited passive CPU cooler is here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Carvf2ORZcTbaWKWArcGl-pHOTo=/0x0:1712x1141/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69458104/noctua_passive_cpu_cooler.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Nk5oo"&gt;Noctua is known for making mighty quiet PC fans, and now it has a CPU cooler that doesn’t need a fan at all. &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/noctuas-15kg-fanless-heatsink-cools-a-core-i9-9900k"&gt;Two years after&lt;/a&gt; announcing a passive heatsink potent enough to keep a Core i9-9900K CPU in check, the dead-silent &lt;a href="https://noctua.at/en/nh-p1"&gt;Noctua NH-P1&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/press-release/noctua-launches-its-nh-p1-passive-cpu-cooler-for-110-usd"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;VideoCardz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;) &lt;/em&gt;has finally gone &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WC64NN8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale today for $110&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an absolute unit at 1.2 kilograms (2.6 pounds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RC0Tgm"&gt;According to the company’s delightfully ASMR build video below (&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/au/noctua-passive-pc-build-guide-video/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), the final product’s six soldered heatpipes and thick fins are good enough to run a Core i9-11900K near its TDP of 125W, and even give you a slight overclock to 3.6GHz, though it’ll heavily depend on your case and other components that might also generate heat. The company has a whole set of &lt;a href="https://noctua.at/en/nh-p1-setup-guidelines"&gt;setup guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://ncc.noctua.at/coolers/NH-P1-68/cpus"&gt;CPU compatibility list&lt;/a&gt;, and even a list of &lt;a href="https://ncc.noctua.at/recommended/NH-P1-68/cases"&gt;recommended cases&lt;/a&gt; so you know what you’re getting into and start off on the right foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j3iMWc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/khbvxsPTI84?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T11Lgr"&gt;Assuming you’ve got those things in check, you shouldn’t have too much trouble fitting it to your motherboard: it appears to be compatible with all modern desktop CPU sockets and has “100% RAM clearance on LGA1200 and AM4,” with a note that you might want to avoid tall RAM modules if you’re using an LGA2066 motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sT_zD04Ai7U12zTAVkduJxkNVd4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22661268/981_2021_06_15_981_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="89AdRO"&gt;The company also has a quiet (12.1dB) new 120mm fan, the &lt;a href="https://noctua.at/en/products/fan/nf-a12x25-ls-pwm.html"&gt;NF-A12x25 LS-PWM&lt;/a&gt;, if you really want an extra burst of cooling on occasion. It’s set to come to a dead stop at 0 percent PWM, so your fan controller can only turn it on when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
