    <title>The lower-cost OnePlus 9R is official, and it sounds surprisingly strong</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-zItN_GfnjTA-cyQGDGhjtf8Xho=/0x0:1203x802/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69019938/colors_banners_color_1_banner0_pc_ae27cc_crop2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9R will be sold in black or blue color options.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Photo: OnePlus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kw3HcE"&gt;Yesterday’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22340406/oneplus-9-phone-price-release-date-availability"&gt;OnePlus event&lt;/a&gt; covered the high-end 9 and 9 Pro, but outside of that spotlight, the company has quietly revealed a smartly specced, less-expensive model: the OnePlus 9R. CEO Pete Lau &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338504/oneplus-9r-less-expensive-phone-confirmed-india-5g"&gt;confirmed last week&lt;/a&gt; that the 9R was on the way and would launch in India. It’s now &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.in%2F9r&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F24%2F22348430%2Foneplus-9r-specs-price-availability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;listed on the company’s Indian website&lt;/a&gt; starting at ₹39,999, which is about $550. That’s an attractive price indeed, especially considering you’ll get one useful camera feature here that the $729 OnePlus 9 doesn’t have: optical image stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYMf0E"&gt;The 9R doesn’t include the Hasselblad-branded cameras on the 9 and 9 Pro, which isn’t actually a big loss. The 9 and 9 Pro offer newer hardware with features like bigger pixels and a higher-res ultrawide, so you do miss out on some nice upgrades, but the Hasselblad-developed color tuning is nothing special. You do, however, get a stabilized 48-megapixel main camera, which helps reduce blur from camera shake in lower lighting conditions. It’s unfortunately missing from the 9, though it is included on the $969 OnePlus 9 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r08mIl"&gt;Other cameras on the 9R include a 16-megapixel ultrawide, a 5-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor. This system is borrowed from the OnePlus 8T, which is wholly capable of good image quality, even though its macro and monochrome cameras aren’t very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cPKPAX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uVsRpJ"&gt;There’s a 6.55-inch 1080p OLED with fast 120Hz refresh rate — same as the OnePlus 9 — and a Snapdragon 870 processor with either 8GB or 12GB of RAM. It’s not quite as powerful as the top-notch 888 processor on the 9 and 9 Pro, but it should be more than adequate to keep day-to-day tasks running quickly and smoothly. The 9R is equipped with a 4,500mAh battery with 65W fast wired charging, a handy OnePlus signature feature that delivers a full charge in just under 40 minutes. Wireless charging, however, isn’t offered. Oh, and there’s 5G support, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yhBHSr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10410330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4H9RQj"&gt;All told, it looks like a series of smart trade-offs for almost $200 less than the flagship model. Right now, the phone is only confirmed to launch in India, but we’re hopeful that it will make its way to European and North American markets. While OnePlus brought its good &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$300 Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; to the US earlier this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;midrange Nord&lt;/a&gt; never made it stateside. The 9R looks like an excellent candidate to fill in a wide gap between the budget N10 and the basic flagship model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VL2w2Z"&gt;In the meantime, customers in India can preorder the 8GB RAM / 128GB version for ₹39,999 (~$550) or the 12GB RAM / 256GB model for ₹43,999 (~$600).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon adds annoying streaming service buttons to its Fire TV remote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cu0hMDawE91quN2kOG1psC7fmeA=/0x0:827x551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69019922/61_qUrdzXlL._AC_SL1000_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Agpx3p"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08D6WJYD9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is coming out with a third generation of its Alexa Voice Remote&lt;/a&gt;, and it includes some unwelcome new buttons that will take you to the Amazon Prime, Netflix, Disney Plus, and Hulu apps. If you’re one of the people who subscribes to and regularly uses all of those exact streaming services, this remote could be a nice upgrade. But for everyone else, the buttons will only add friction and annoyance to the Fire TV control experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuonV0"&gt;We here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have talked about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/4/24/21232655/netflix-button-tv-remotes-advertisement-marketing-streaming"&gt;why we don’t like these buttons before&lt;/a&gt;. They turn your remote into a canvas for permanent advertising for services you may not even use, and they take up space that could be used for buttons that take you to services you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; use. If you, say, don’t subscribe to Disney Plus or Hulu, then the buttons are, at best, useless to you and, at worst, waiting to be accidentally pressed, leaving you to back out of an app that’s begging you to subscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFFYbp"&gt;The obvious alternative is to make the buttons mappable to the services you use and not put permanent branding on them. If the remote instead came with four buttons you could use to open your preferred streaming services, this would be a very different story. Alas, it is not. But hey, now the voice control button is an Alexa button for even more branding! (I will concede that this isn’t that bad, given that it was already called the &lt;em&gt;Alexa&lt;/em&gt; Voice remote.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emuyHTwpxWSxzu7vUnxsTE1K5CY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394536/51SgcH5ly_L._AC_SL1000_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The previous generation of the remote (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Alexa-Voice-Remote-with-power-and-volume-controls/dp/B07B6L2QCF/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=alexa+voice+remote&amp;amp;qid=1616603882&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;which is still for sale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;), minus the branded buttons.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E4pUm8"&gt;I don’t want to make it sound like a few annoying buttons (that could actually be useful to some people) are the end of the world or that this new remote has no redeeming qualities. There’s actually one more new button that takes you to a “guide” showing you a cable-esque timeline of all the content available from the live providers you have, such as Sling, Hulu, or YouTube TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohaKGc"&gt;Unlike the branded ones, it’s small and not brightly colored, so it’s easy to ignore if you don’t need it (and it won’t be as prone to accidental presses). I just wish remote manufacturers would let us choose the functions we want on our remotes, especially since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/streaming-wars"&gt;the streaming service landscape is ever-changing&lt;/a&gt;, and people have taken to subscribing to one service for a few months then switching to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7ajfs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how Tesla’s new touchscreen drive selector works</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dtbs-OCvl1zTjJLze44amyn_c6g=/0x0:1686x1124/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69019629/MS_Interior_Carousel_C_Desktop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TLcXUP"&gt;When Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252832/tesla-model-s-redesign-plaid-mile-range-interior-refresh"&gt;announced a redesigned&lt;/a&gt; Model S sedan and Model X SUV earlier this year, one of the biggest changes to how those cars work was quite literally hard to see: Tesla decided to remove the gear-selector stalk from the steering wheel and is going to try to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256504/teslas-model-s-x-redesign-automatic-shifting-prnd-gears"&gt;automate shifting between park, reverse, neutral, and drive (PRND)&lt;/a&gt;. The company said there would be an option on the touchscreen as a backup, but it wasn’t until today that we had a sense of exactly what that looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRFOMy"&gt;Instead of touchscreen “buttons” for each drive mode, drivers will have to tap-and-drag on a small car icon on the top-left corner of the new horizontal touchscreen. (In fact, that car icon was visible in the photos Tesla released for the refreshed Model S and Model X, though it wasn’t clear what it was for.) Drag up to put the car into drive, drag down to put the car in reverse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Sc1Uvb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ok, so this is how u change gears on the new S/X   &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@elonmusk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tesla?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@tesla&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/dXtsSzQBAS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dXtsSzQBAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Michael Hsu (@hsumacher) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hsumacher/status/1374585378988953601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SN8l6l"&gt;Neutral is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nickwhoward/status/1374711863842377728"&gt;buried in a deeper menu&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s still unclear how you put the car into park. Perhaps since Teslas can operate without the slow “creep” of internal combustion cars (though there is an option to turn that on), you will be able to just stop the car with your brake pedal and it will stand still, maybe even switch into park when you get out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F4Aymg"&gt;Now, according to Elon Musk, this is all just a backup to the car automatically switching gears for you. “Car guesses drive direction based on what obstacles it sees, context &amp;amp; nav map,” Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354680585139187713"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; back in January. “After you drive without using a PRND stalk/stick for a few days, it gets very annoying to go back &amp;amp; use a shifter! You can override on touchscreen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCYNLm"&gt;In an internal document obtained by &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/01/27/tesla-new-steering-wheel-force-touch-buttons-autopilot-sensors/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after the announcement, Tesla said a vehicle would “automatically shift to Reverse once the driver presses the brake pedal” if the car noticed it was facing a garage wall, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98TGYs"&gt;Musk was asked about this change when he was on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278792/elon-musk-joe-rogan-tesla-roadster-spacex-hover-thrusters"&gt;Joe Rogan’s podcast in February&lt;/a&gt;, and he said he’d been testing the feature and really enjoyed it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFdC1W"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musk:&lt;/strong&gt; If you just get in, when you press the brake pedal and then press the accelerator, it will figure whether you want to go backwards or forwards based on...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ucQzda"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogan: &lt;/strong&gt;That’s crazy. How’s that possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1O8D1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musk: &lt;/strong&gt;Well, it just looks and sees: is there an obstacle in front? Okay, you probably don’t want to whack it, so you probably want to go backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dntlIm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogan: &lt;/strong&gt;Right, but what if you want to go backwards and there’s nothing in front of you? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBkkj2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musk: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, what if it’s ambiguous? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6H7EP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogan: &lt;/strong&gt;Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="su4TkI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musk: &lt;/strong&gt;So it would default to the inverse of whatever you started, and then you can just swipe on the screen and change direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKwIp5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogan: &lt;/strong&gt;But isn’t it easier to just hit like that way to go to reverse, lift up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9tO1a"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musk: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, you’ll see, you almost never...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPuG3c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogan: &lt;/strong&gt;You do it? So this is something you’ve driven and it’s intuitive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQ0Afc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musk: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, once you get rid of the stalk and have the car figure it out, it’s annoying to have a stalk after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keTqdW"&gt;Musk loves to push boundaries with his companies, and this decision definitely represents a big change in what is a basic function for a car. But Tesla is far from the first automaker to tinker with gear selectors. The Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards are more explicit about the order in which PRND are displayed than how a driver selects them, so car companies have tried everything from gear selector buttons to knobs to weird levers that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256504/teslas-model-s-x-redesign-automatic-shifting-prnd-gears"&gt;wind up causing dangerous mode confusion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MSI’s GS66 Stealth review: powerful but pricey</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Other laptops with the RTX 3070 perform nearly as well&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6qYdie"&gt;I had hoped that MSI’s GS66 Stealth for 2021 would look and feel a &lt;em&gt;little &lt;/em&gt;different than last year’s model — not that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21348101/msi-gs66-stealth-gaming-laptop-review-rtx-2070-super-300hz"&gt;the 2020 version&lt;/a&gt; was particularly busted in any major way. In fact, the previous model was a few nips and tucks shy of reaching Razer’s high bar for gaming laptop design. But while the outside shell of this year’s model is exactly the same as last year’s, I can live with that because what’s inside is mostly all-new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7c2Bh"&gt;The review unit we tested is the current pinnacle of mobile graphics tech: Nvidia’s new RTX 3080 Max-Q graphics chip, with 16GB of video memory (Nvidia also makes an 8GB variant). MSI also added a gorgeous canvas of a display: a 15.6-inch 1440p (QHD) IPS G-Sync screen with a fast 240Hz refresh rate. The price for this configuration will be $2,599 when it releases in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dVG2z"&gt;The other specs are good, too, but not necessarily cutting-edge. It has 16GB of RAM, a 1TB NVMe SSD, and the same big, four-cell 99.99Wh battery that was in the previous iteration. It is equipped with an &lt;a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/208018/intel-core-i7-10870h-processor-16m-cache-up-to-5-00-ghz.html"&gt;Intel Core i7-10870H&lt;/a&gt; processor, which on paper is a slight step down compared to the &lt;a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/202329/intel-core-i7-10875h-processor-16m-cache-up-to-5-10-ghz.html"&gt;Core i7-10875H&lt;/a&gt; in the previous model I tested, but I didn’t notice a difference in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9QsNMx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10410056"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JW6jh3"&gt;The original first-look at this laptop focused on how good it was at playing games at QHD resolution. Since then, our team has reviewed several other laptops that feature Nvidia’s latest generation of RTX 30-series graphics cards, as well as a few that have QHD screens, too. In that time, we’ve agreed that the RTX 3070, the next notch down on the totem pole of Nvidia’s latest graphics card lineup, is better at QHD gaming than we expected. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315386/razer-blade-15-base-2021-review-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-3070-qhd-screen-performance"&gt;Razer Blade 15 Base&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt; are two key examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kywT56"&gt;If it’s confusing to fathom how a lesser GPU could come close to outpacing what’s supposed to be a much better performer, it’s mostly about the thickness of a laptop. Those two examples are a little thicker than the GS66 Stealth and have a similar or higher amount of power level allotted to their GPUs set to a similar or higher boost clock speed. As we saw, that can result in comparable performance, despite costing hundreds of dollars less than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="z5vDb7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nvidia is requiring laptop makers to be more transparent about RTX 30-series specs ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QoqhZj"&gt;On the other side of that coin, the RTX 3080, like the one you’ll find in this laptop, is good at getting you a few extra frames per second over that. But most gamers, especially ones who are trying to save money when possible, will likely still be happy with the performance of a more affordable laptop. MSI makes cheaper variants of the GS66 Stealth that I’ve listed below, but for now, it’s limiting its use of a gorgeous QHD screen for just this high-end model. That’s a disappointment, since other companies like Razer and Asus are including them in more budget-conscious gaming laptops with performance that isn’t too far off from this model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n6tNQ6K8haUWY4MrISWUCGXlQl8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251172/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This year’s GS66 Stealth looks and feels exactly the same as 2020’s, which is both good and bad in some ways.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vJ0MB9"&gt;Back to the specs, this year’s GS66 Stealth makes the jump up to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22212938/wifi-6e-rollout-starting-2021-smartphones-tvs-laptops-vr-routers"&gt;Wi-Fi 6E&lt;/a&gt; compatibility and Bluetooth 5.2. This laptop has an HDMI 2.0 port, so it’s limited to outputting 4K resolution at up to 60 frames per second. Of the things MSI updated in this year’s GS66, the HDMI port should have been a little higher on the list than Wi-Fi 6E. Several other models we’ve reviewed feature HDMI 2.1, allowing 4K output with up to 120 frames per second to really take advantage of the hardware while connected to an external high refresh rate monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlYies"&gt;General performance outside of gaming felt similarly snappy to last year’s model. A big stack of tabs in Microsoft Edge, alongside Slack and Spotify, didn’t slow this machine down. It didn’t perform nearly as well in our Adobe Premiere Pro export test, though. Tasked with exporting a five-minute, 33-second 4K video, the laptop took six minutes, 30 seconds, compared to the three-minute, 14-second export time that we got with last year’s model. The battery life can last for around three hours and change under a light load of applications. That’s less than the roughly five hours of screentime I was getting with last year’s model, but then again, this one has a QHD screen compared to FHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;em&gt; performed the worst of any recent AAA title I tested, but the numbers are still impressive.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="M40Vyy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10301829"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lrHyue"&gt;But the real question is: was Nvidia’s latest high-end graphics chip worth the wait — and can it keep up with a QHD display? The short answer is that, like my colleague Tom Warren saw on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;the desktop version of the RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt;, this mobile variant is a leap over what the last-gen RTX 2080 could provide. Since this is also the first generation of gaming laptops that offer QHD screens, it’s a little hard to compare the two, but there’s no question that games look better than before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNNE23"&gt;The RTX 3080 with 16GB of video memory is capable of running some of the most demanding games in QHD well beyond 60 frames per second — with all graphical settings adjusted to max and with ray tracing and other RTX settings activated, when applicable. That’s an incredible achievement. And if you’re someone who doesn’t always play the latest games as they are released, these specs will afford you even more headroom to power through your backlog, with a fantastic display to enjoy them on to boot. The IPS screen that MSI opted to use is rich with contrast and better viewing angles than I expected, and its G-Sync adaptive sync does a great job of keeping visuals free of artifacts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fbjYdT"&gt;I was able to spend time playing &lt;em&gt;Horizon: Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, most of which have ray tracing and / or DLSS (deep-learning super sampling) graphical options to take further advantage of this powerful graphics chip. Since &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;don’t ship with built-in benchmarking tests, I simply ran around a variety of locales to stress-test the hardware (the other games have scripted methods for gathering performance metrics). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kT2h56Oz1XhD3XObu8TXkymHGWA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251173/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I couldn’t stop holding my eyeballs this close to the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o1pUO9"&gt;As someone who’s used to playing games on a 1080p display, I was impressed to see such graphically intensive games run this fluidly, especially at a higher native resolution. However, we know now that this laptop isn’t the only machine on the market that can achieve beyond 60 frames per second in-game performance, and in most cases, you don’t even need an RTX 3080 to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1jfAgm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10301825"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Var6nM"&gt;As I mentioned up top, the design of the 2021 GS66 Stealth is note-for-note the same as last year’s model. The overall look is stellar, though, and I wish every gaming laptop had a trackpad this generously large. It has backlit keys that can be programmed to dazzle with RGB splendor through SteelSeries software, but that’s really the only element that reveals this is a gaming laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFSUis"&gt;Well, aside from the very loud fans. I noted that last year’s model was relatively quiet, even under pressure. I’ve heard laptops louder than this new RTX 3080 version, but the decibel level went high enough so that at times I felt I needed headphones to hear all of the in-game details. Of course, that differed depending on the game. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; made this laptop whir the loudest of the games I tested, while &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;actually ran fairly quietly by comparison. But even when the GS66 Stealth is just idling during a browser, it’s audible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eT4fmVn7Ip2xLZdyMjPb-8cHsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251177/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This QHD screen is pin-sharp, but importantly, it’s really vibrant, and the viewing angles are generous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O3XMlL"&gt;I found other flaws with the design. The keyboard layout is still crowded, with the important function key placed awkwardly next to the control key, making it cumbersome to do simple tasks like adjust the volume and brightness. Also, the bottom of the laptop chassis still flexes in a slightly worrying way. I don’t think it’s liable to break under normal use, but for a pricey machine like this, the design doesn’t inspire confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="GVRJAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10410113"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2Ije5"&gt;If you’re looking to buy one of MSI’s non-QHD models today, there are a number of options. You can get a system equipped with a less powerful RTX 3060 chip starting at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730437098990828811" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,799.99&lt;/a&gt;, one with the RTX 3070 for &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1611894-REG%2Fmsi_gs66_stealth_10ug_075_15_6_gs66_stealth_gaming.html%3FSID%3Ds1610634215938lifha52581&amp;amp;xcust=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,399.99&lt;/a&gt;, or with the new RTX 3080 chip starting at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730437267445605394" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,699.99&lt;/a&gt; (that model has a lesser CPU, an FHD 300Hz display, but more RAM than this one). The specs start with a 1080p IPS display with a 240Hz or 300Hz refresh rate. &lt;a href="https://www.msi.com/Laptop/GS66-Stealth-10UX/Specification"&gt;MSI’s product landing page&lt;/a&gt; indicates that it will be possible to upgrade to a 4K 60Hz IPS display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92IlMH"&gt;Just like last year’s GS66 Stealth, this is an alluring package that delivers just about everything that I want in a gaming laptop. Its design is mature, and it has a generous amount of ports. Though, also like last year’s model, it has some flaws, like the over-crowded keyboard and some problem areas on the chassis that flex more than they should. The inclusion of a QHD screen with a capable GPU overshadows most of the issues, making this a stellar machine for gaming and watching movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="MrDxB6"&gt;This is one of the slimmest, yet most powerful laptops available, but it’s tough to recommend outright to most people when some less expensive models, like the Zephyrus G15 or the Razer Blade 15 Base can get you most of the way there in terms of gaming performance, at QHD resolution no less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UeBx6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photography by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTEuH3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2:09PM ET, March 24th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSI has released the price for this laptop, so we’ve now added a score, as well as more context surrounding its performance and value compared to other gaming laptops that we’ve recently reviewed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack quickly removes the ability to message strangers with DM invites over harassment concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zeg1Ys5n0Mwhu89m-bhJ-uZBMts=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69019365/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KM5YVb"&gt;Slack became a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348126/slack-connect-direct-messaging-dm-company-feature"&gt;public messaging platform this morning&lt;/a&gt; with the wider rollout of a new cross-organizational direct messaging feature, and now it’s already taking steps to mitigate the dangers of operating such a platform without well-thought-out moderation protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vExEfT"&gt;The company says in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348422/slack-connect-direct-message-abuse-harassment"&gt;concerns the feature could be used to send abusive messages or harassment with relative ease&lt;/a&gt;, it’s now disabling the option to send a message alongside an invite. That way, if someone knows your email address, they can’t spam your inbox with potentially abusive messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUEZct"&gt;“After rolling out Slack Connect DMs this morning, we received valuable feedback from our users about how email invitations to use the feature could potentially be used to send abusive or harassing messages. We are taking immediate steps to prevent this kind of abuse, beginning today with the removal of the ability to customize a message when a user invites someone to Slack Connect DMs,” Jonathan Prince, the company’s vice president of communications and policy, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hu7pTT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We made a mistake in this initial roll-out that is inconsistent with our goals for the product and the typical experience of Slack Connect usage.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="drBGDz"&gt;“Slack Connect’s security features and robust administrative controls are a core part of its value both for individual users and their organizations. We made a mistake in this initial roll-out that is inconsistent with our goals for the product and the typical experience of Slack Connect usage. As always, we are grateful to everyone who spoke up, and we are committed to fixing this issue.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Om0TA"&gt;The overall concern, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/44/status/1374737695444901891"&gt;first raised by Twitter employee Menotti Minutillo&lt;/a&gt;, was that the feature did not have robust opt-out protections for individual users and no way to easily prevent people from spamming you with email invites. That seems benign on the surface; if someone wants to harass you and they have your email address, surely they can just send you a harassing email. But Slack Connect bypasses any filters or inbox protections you may use by sending you an email from its feedback@slack.com address with the DM invite, with the email containing whatever message the sender decided to attach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8Gtbmd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;well that was easy as shit to abuse&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- send invite with nasty language&lt;br&gt;- slack emails you w/ the full content of the invite&lt;br&gt;- can't block the emails because they come from a generic slack address that informs you of invites&lt;br&gt;- abuser can keep inviting w/ abusive language &lt;a href="https://t.co/Mw9W5L251a"&gt;https://t.co/Mw9W5L251a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/dWEAD7ccRO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dWEAD7ccRO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Menotti Minutillo (@44) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/44/status/1374737695444901891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOfNXU"&gt;That means if your organization uses this feature, you can’t filter it out without fear of missing important Slack emails and you also have no easy way to opt out. (It’s not even clear right now whether the feature can be turned off for individual accounts.) &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/slacks-new-dm-feature-connect-is-thankfully-opt-in/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;reported this morning&lt;/a&gt; that the DM feature would be opt-in for a company’s or organization’s IT department to enable at its discretion, but that doesn’t mean it would give individual employee’s active control over who could DM them. And there was also no filtering or monitoring in place that would detect whether someone was sending a hateful message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KVnXV"&gt;There are new concerns popping up, too, such as being able to view whatever Slack groups individuals are a part of — either paid or free ones — if that person happens to accept an invite from someone using Slack Connect. And while Slack Connect is generally designed for enterprise users whose companies pay for premium features, a Slack Standard plan with Connect enabled costs as little as $8 per month per user (or $6.67 per month per user when billed annually). That suggests someone could exploit these issues rather easily and on the cheap if they choose to, even in the absence of the invite message feature Slack just disabled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="B7FDY2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ok, so not only is this a harassment vector, but if you put in someone's email address, it shows you the name of every slack they're on. This is a critical and catastrophic information leak: &lt;a href="https://t.co/XwLCt8Rl34"&gt;https://t.co/XwLCt8Rl34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eleanor Saitta (@Dymaxion) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Dymaxion/status/1374779750464561154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Microsoft makes Xbox Party Chat free as part of its Xbox Live free-to-play changes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QNcl4kUvYkEZky78SCx0ajPfkbs=/0x0:1618x1079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69019215/xboxdashboard.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OZ8xIb"&gt;Microsoft is announcing today that Xbox Party Chat will be free for Xbox owners soon. The software maker has started testing a new Xbox dashboard update with testers today that unlocks Xbox Party Chat, multiplayer in free-to-play games, and the Looking For Groups (LFG) feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sh86bm"&gt;Xbox Party Chat is a surprise addition to Microsoft’s announced plans to remove the paywall for free-to-play multiplayer games. The removal came after Microsoft was forced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/23/22245630/microsoft-xbox-live-gold-price-increase-reversed-f2p"&gt;reverse a price hike&lt;/a&gt; to its Xbox Live Gold subscriptions earlier this year. Microsoft is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345276/microsoft-xbox-live-network-rebrand-name-change"&gt;renaming its Xbox Live service to just Xbox network&lt;/a&gt;, which is part of dashboard changes the company is currently testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WmGTCo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Xbox Insiders in Alpha Skip Ahead &amp;amp; Alpha today we are flighting some new features. Multiplayer in Free-to-play games, Looking 4 Groups and Party Chat on Xbox no longer requires an Xbox Live Gold membership as we flight and test these service changes ahead of general availability&lt;/p&gt;— Brad Rossetti (@WorkWombatman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WorkWombatman/status/1374776344052072450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="syeOHY"&gt;Xbox testers can now access multiplayer free-to-play games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, without needing an Xbox Live Gold subscription. This puts Xbox in line with Sony and Nintendo’s online services that also don’t require a subscription for free-to-play games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdFCbD"&gt;These changes will appear for all Xbox owners in the coming months, once Microsoft is ready to push this dashboard update out to all users. This latest dashboard update also includes a &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/24/xbox-insider-release-notes-alpha-skip-ahead-2108-210322-1900/"&gt;new firmware update&lt;/a&gt; for the Xbox Wireless Headset that will improve mic monitoring levels and lower the volume of status tones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijQBpM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 10 is getting new File Explorer icons as part of a visual overhaul</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0xKOs9nyVaClNWKhxLRMKgMKPCg=/0x2:1936x1293/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69018986/file_explorer_icons.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IfEGl7"&gt;Microsoft is giving the File Explorer inside Windows 10 a visual overhaul with new icons. The software giant has started rolling out a test build of Windows 10 that includes changes to the system icons you’ll find in File Explorer, including the Recycle Bin, Documents folders, and devices like disk drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVGuA6"&gt;“Several changes, such as the orientation of the folder icons and the default file type icons, have been made for greater consistency across Microsoft products that show files,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/03/24/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-21343/"&gt;says  Amanda Langowski&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s Windows Insider chief. “Notably, the top-level user folders such as Desktop, Documents, Downloads, and Pictures have a new design that should make it a little easier to tell them apart at a glance.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OwxRmtBGS4E4Fw1aGC4wVzbIDz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394605/DriveAndRecycle_2x.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Recycle Bin icon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VqlJGz"&gt;Perhaps daringly, Microsoft also notes that “and yes, the Recycle Bin icon has also been updated!” — a clear nod to some changes the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/23/8089387/microsoft-windows-10-new-icons"&gt;tried to make to the Recycle Bin&lt;/a&gt; in the past that didn’t go down well with Windows users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RF9Xxc"&gt;These icon changes are fairly minor in the grand scheme of Windows, but they’re part of a broader effort inside Microsoft to modernize Windows. Microsoft unveiled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313037/microsoft-windows-10-new-system-icons-ui-overhaul-sun-valley"&gt;new system icons&lt;/a&gt; for Windows 10 earlier this month, and the company previously updated some of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145157/microsoft-windows-10-new-icons-modern-release-update-apps"&gt;Windows 10 icons&lt;/a&gt; last year with colorful versions and also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21310597/microsoft-windows-10-start-menu-design-new-alt-tab-features"&gt;tweaked the Start menu&lt;/a&gt; to make it more streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_CZLVTuCe78aY8ZO1zQ1YgW538c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394581/Pictures_Folder_2x.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new File Explorer icons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Stqbvh"&gt;Microsoft is also planning a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;,” codenamed “Sun Valley.” The company is expected to detail its visual plans and more about the future of Windows in the coming months as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261997/microsoft-news-events-gaming-cloud-windows"&gt;dedicated news event&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eEDMGh"&gt;The icon updates will arrive alongside some tweaks to the layout of File Explorer, too. Microsoft is adding additional padding between elements in File Explorer, and there will be a compact mode to return to the classic File Explorer mode. The updated view is a little more touch-optimized and complements the new icons.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo made a tool to help you show off your Animal Crossing island</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2qU0M6y1oDJ47cIh1JYyCNUXbyg=/0x174:1123x923/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69018885/IMG_0420.5.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gs0uio"&gt;Nintendo has a new tool that lets show off your &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; island with a poster or even a trailer. While you’ve always been able to take screenshots and video clips from the game using the Switch’s built-in tools and share those with your friends and on social media, the new Island Tour Creator lets you add some &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;-themed flair to what you’ve captured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JQnbq"&gt;Nintendo made an example island tour video &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/animalcrossing/status/1374707642556375040"&gt;in this tweet&lt;/a&gt;. It includes a voiceover and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/5/15/21259948/animal-crossing-new-horizons-theme-song-nintendo-virtual-performance"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;’ iconic theme song&lt;/a&gt;, and the trailers you make will have them, too, which I thought was a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xzSnXf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;[Announcement]&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AnimalCrossing?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AnimalCrossing&lt;/a&gt;: New Horizons Island Tour Creator website is now available! Show off your island by creating fun posters and videos with content captured on your &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NintendoSwitch&lt;/a&gt;. Here's just one example, featuring Ninten Island!&lt;a href="https://t.co/mYxkogv0xu"&gt;https://t.co/mYxkogv0xu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ehxaS7UmQJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ehxaS7UmQJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Isabelle (@animalcrossing) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/animalcrossing/status/1374707642556375040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7ReAsn"&gt;And here’s a poster I made for my island, Hoopla: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AjYNT0izDLNLYMuaXG_RM5pFDaw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394385/IMG_0419.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fyqoVG"&gt;To use the Island Tour Creator, which only works on mobile, visit &lt;a href="https://www.tanuki-kaihatsu.com/en_US/index.html"&gt;this link on your smartphone&lt;/a&gt;. From there, you’ll be asked to log in to your Nintendo account, and after a brief chat with Tom Nook, you’ll be able to pick between making a poster or a trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0IHJD"&gt;You can use media taken from the game that you’ve saved to your phone or posted to Twitter, and both the poster- and trailer-making tools have lots of customization options. I really wish you could use the Island Tour Creator in-game in some way, though, since getting screenshots and video from my Switch to my iPhone is a bit of a hassle. But once I had everything I wanted saved on my phone, using the tool was straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IiQQL4qNm-7zCRredUIdCad2HhI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394346/IMG_0416.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Island Tour Creator interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L825FC"&gt;Now that people have had their hands on &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22327659/animal-crossing-new-horizons-first-year-timeline-events-holidays"&gt;more than a year&lt;/a&gt;, I’m looking forward to seeing the virtual tours and posters people create to show off their islands. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s brightest OLED TV ever starts at $2,200</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dLNwgHTqL4ohxW4uVFrvbiAu7Wc=/0x0:1101x734/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69018857/LG_OLED_evo_Wall_Mount.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dlnvhs"&gt;LG today announced the pricing for its 2021 lineup of 4K OLED TVs. The most buzz-worthy part for home theater enthusiasts is the new G1 series, which includes LG’s new “OLED evo” panel with a brighter picture than any of the company’s past OLEDs. But the G1 doesn’t come cheap: it’s $2,199 for a 55-inch model, $2,999 for a 65-inch, and $4,499 if you want a 77-inch screen. LG says the G1 sets also “have an unbelievably thin bezel with included wall mounting leaving virtually no gap from screen to wall.” You’re paying for both the superior picture and that gallery-like aesthetic here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZArqJo"&gt;Stepping down from the G1, you get the C1 series, which succeeds last year’s highly praised CX series. All sizes of the C1 TVs still come with the full suite of HDMI 2.1 features (4K at 120Hz, variable refresh rate, auto low latency mode, and eARC), and you get four HDMI ports with those capabilities. On the subject of gaming, this year’s LG TVs also add a new “game optimizer” area to the settings menu, which puts all the crucial options for next-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X / S gaming front and center for quick access. Both Nvidia G-Sync and FreeSync and AMD FreeSync Premium are supported by these panels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wu2P5G"&gt;The G1 might get brighter, but the C1 certainly comes bigger: this year, LG has an 83-inch size for $5,999. Just imagine that ginormous OLED on your wall. Both the G1 and C1 include LG’s latest processor, which includes AI scene detection to optimize the picture for whatever you’re watching. LG also added a new ability to automatically level out audio volume when switching between content sources and streaming apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXsVaY"&gt;At the bottom of the lineup is the A1 series, which is positioned as LG’s entry-level OLED. In exchange for that low starting price (just $1,299 for a 48-inch model), you’re completely losing out on HDMI 2.1 features, and there’s an older processor inside that can sometimes allow for more banding and other visual quirks in complex scenes. It’ll still give you a beautiful picture — the A1 supports Dolby Vision, of course — but I’d recommend deal hunting for a 2020 BX or CX before settling for the A1. Still, once sales kick in for the 2021 lineup, that base model might hit the $999 mark, which is huge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHMeCa"&gt;Keep in mind that whichever new LG you choose, it’ll come with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223767/lg-webos-6-tv-software-oled-qned-lcd-redesign"&gt;a much different webOS than we’ve seen previously&lt;/a&gt;. The company has done away with the old blades interface that popped up from the bottom of the screen. Now, the software looks more reminiscent of what you’d find on a streaming box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JcZkZ"&gt;Here’s the full pricing for LG’s 2021 OLED lineup:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rocket League is coming to Android and iOS with a spinoff called Sideswipe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D6k5JlbGVZezS3cDqtbZK_9eYYY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69018836/sideswipe_header.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Psyonix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aHSFKm"&gt;If you have been looking to play &lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;on the go but don’t own a Nintendo Switch, Psyonix’s massively popular vehicular soccer game is &lt;a href="http://rocketleague.com/news/announcing-rocket-league-sideswipe-for-mobile/"&gt;finally coming to mobile devices&lt;/a&gt;. The developer announced a new free-to-play version called &lt;em&gt;Sideswipe&lt;/em&gt; that will arrive on iOS and Android later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpx0rR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket League Sideswipe&lt;/em&gt; looks to be largely the same as the main version of &lt;em&gt;Rocket League,&lt;/em&gt; but it will bring a new perspective that accommodates mobile devices. According to the &lt;a href="http://rocketleague.com/news/announcing-rocket-league-sideswipe-for-mobile/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, players will compete in two-minute 1v1 or 2v2 matches. Another big change to &lt;em&gt;Sideswipe&lt;/em&gt; is a switch to touch controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MeAFrJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Rocket League’ coming to mobile devices is no surprise&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7mJrJy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sideswipe&lt;/em&gt; will be free to play, just like the main version, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21438194/rocket-league-free-to-play-release-date-psyonix-epic-games"&gt;switched to this model last year&lt;/a&gt;. Before the game releases, Psyonix announced that a limited alpha test will be available on Android via Google Play to players in Australia and New Zealand today. More betas will be available in the coming months, according to Psyonix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwWzgq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;coming to mobile devices is no surprise, as it joins other popular PC and console games that have been ported to iOS and Android in recent years to largely great success. Most notably, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906035/call-of-duty-download-number-biggest-launch-ever"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18660985/pubg-mobile-monthly-revenue-players-highest-grossing-mobile-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s mobile versions have grown substantially by releasing mobile versions, with &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PUBGMOBILE/status/1373786682357657605"&gt;hitting 1 billion downloads worldwide&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. Next week will see &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; expand to mobile as well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321348/league-of-legends-wild-rift-open-beta-mobile-ios-android"&gt;with the open beta of a spinoff called &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
