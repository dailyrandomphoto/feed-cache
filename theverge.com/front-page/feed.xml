    <title>Nintendo’s new Zelda Amiibo removes tedium for an extra $25</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/poJbb5nQvk4HQzrCAETclAd5ddQ=/45x0:549x336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69314163/Screen_Shot_2021_05_19_at_3.22.33_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="04yJy6"&gt;Nintendo is releasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288267/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-switch-re-release-nintendo"&gt;the HD remake of &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on the Switch on July 16th, and in the run up to the return of the — checks &lt;em&gt;Hyrule Historia — &lt;/em&gt;current earliest entry in the Zelda timeline, it’s also selling a new amiibo. &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/2021/new-zelda-and-loftwing-amiibo-figure-launches-alongside-the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-on-july-16/"&gt;The $25 “Zelda and Loftwing”&lt;/a&gt; NFC-equipped figurine features the proto-princess and her bird companion, but also comes with the unique ability to teleport to the game’s floating hub world from anywhere, bypassing one of &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt;’s many annoying quirks for an extra cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGWcFC"&gt;Fast travel in &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt; is normally only accessible at in-game save points, a remnant of the more rigid Zelda design the game launched with on the Wii in 2011. When this new amiibo is placed on the Switch in the HD remake, you can automatically return to the sky to restock on items or upgrade something, and then return to wherever you were without missing a beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LWSAQl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Meet the new Zelda &amp;amp; Loftwing amiibo, launching on 7/16! This amiibo features two characters on a single base and can be used to travel between the surface and the sky in The Legend of Zelda: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SkywardSwordHD?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SkywardSwordHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="https://t.co/mbhwOfSzX5"&gt;https://t.co/mbhwOfSzX5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/YFK5WbYYHZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YFK5WbYYHZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1394824252600295426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HpVWYw"&gt;For comparison, the &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; amiibo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/24/15041136/nintendo-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-amiibo-collectibles"&gt;unlocked exclusive weapons, armor, and health items&lt;/a&gt; in the game rather than adding new gameplay functionality. Exclusive armor is one thing, but it’s even more frustrating to lock a quality-of-life feature behind the purchase of a plastic collectible. Nintendo is already doing some things to sand down the harder edges of &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt; to make it work better on the Switch, like offering sword combat with the thumbstick rather than just motion controls. Why not do the same thing with a more user-friendly fast travel system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVODfC"&gt;There are potential ways to avoid plopping down around $85 for the ideal version of &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re willing to wade into the murkier waters of emulation, we’ve experimented with ways to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/12/15223338/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-amiibo-hacking-ethics"&gt;create a homemade amiibo&lt;/a&gt; with an RFID toaster and some NFC tags. It’s a natural reaction to amiibo selling out fast, and Nintendo tying more and more attractive, and in this case, useful features to them. If this new Zelda amiibo proves as popular as the recent paper &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22352196/acnh-sanrio-hello-kitty-amiibo-cards-target-sold-out-scalpers-resell-buy-new-horizons-switch"&gt;amiibo cards for &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have, it could become a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4yjE4"&gt;The “Zelda and Loftwing” amiibo will be released on July 16th for $24.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Five more women are suing Amazon for discrimination and retaliation </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uaMcp5eSlUlqVP9ZCyDQn1PBw1c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69314106/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XUFPIU"&gt;Five female Amazon employees filed discrimination lawsuits against the company Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/5/19/22444177/amazon-five-more-lawsuits-employees-allege-race-and-gender-discrimination-charlotte-newman"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The women worked at vastly different areas of the business, ranging from a warehouse to corporate HR. All say they were retaliated against by white managers after bringing forward complaints of racial discrimination, sexism, or sexual harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpVQwP"&gt;One of the plaintiffs, a 64-year-old Black woman named Pearl Thomas, said she was placed on a performance improvement plan after complaining about her boss’s racist remarks. Thomas, who worked in HR, claimed her boss used the “n-word” in reference to her, and told her and another Black colleague “you don’t want to be an angry Black woman.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qEiTJE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;He allegedly made comments like “Latins suck,” and “How is a Latin like you working here?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Owtb7G"&gt;Diana Cuervo, a 40-year-old Latina warehouse manager, said she was fired after reporting her white boss for racism. He allegedly made comments like “Latins suck,” and “How is a Latin like you working here?” in front of her, according to &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITGR0U"&gt;Three of the women still work at Amazon. Two have left the company. Their cases are all being brought by Wigdor LLP, the law firm representing Charlotte Newman — &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/3/1/22306508/amazon-race-discrimination-sexual-harassment-assault-lawsuit-charlotte-newman"&gt;a Black Amazon manager who is also suing the company for race and gender discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMgpBa"&gt;“Women and employees of color at all levels of Amazon have had their complaints of harassment and discrimination brushed under the rug,” said Wigdor LLP partners Lawrence M. Pearson and Jeanne M. Christensen in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt;. “Amazon can no longer dismiss abusive behavior and retaliation by white managers as mere anecdotes. These are systemic problems, entrenched deep within the company and perpetuated by a human resources organization that treats employees who raise concerns as a problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uT7LxB"&gt;The lawsuits follow similar allegations of gender discrimination and bias at companies such as Pinterest and Google. In December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22175043/pinterest-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement-coo-francoise-brougher"&gt;Pinterest settled a lawsuit brought by former COO Françoise Brougher&lt;/a&gt; for $22.5 million. Brougher said she was fired after complaining about sexism and unequal pay. Timnit Gebru, a prominent Black AI ethics researcher, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;was fired from Google in December&lt;/a&gt; while writing a paper about the dangers of large language models. She has publicly accused the company of racism, gaslighting, and retaliation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cw0YnS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An Amazon spokesperson denied any claims of wrongdoing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j0iiWU"&gt;On May 26th, Amazon shareholders will &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon-investors-urged-by-proxy-firm-to-vote-in-favor-of-racial-audit/#:~:text=The%20New%20York%20State%20Common,those%20issues%20affect%20Amazon's%20business.&amp;amp;text=Amazon%20is%20asking%20shareholders%20to%20reject%20the%20proposal."&gt;vote on a proposal from the New York State Common Retirement Fund&lt;/a&gt; calling for an independent audit into how the company’s civil rights, equity, and diversity and inclusion policies impact the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IGNHVd"&gt;In a statement emailed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an Amazon spokesperson denied any claims of wrongdoing. “We are conducting thorough investigations for each of these unrelated cases, as we do with any reported incidents, and we have found no evidence to support the allegations,” they said. “We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment in any form, and employees are encouraged to raise concerns to any member of management or through an anonymous ethics hotline with no risk of retaliation.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack will let you list your pronouns right under your job title</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vLHMivyZVm5-d30CMCpMkIc55Ws=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69314094/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="szxV4s"&gt;Slack is now rolling out a new field for profiles that will let you list your pronouns right under your name and job title. Once filled out, your pronouns will appear both on the mini-profiles you see when you click on someone’s name and in their full profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HASRc0"&gt;Note that your Slack profile may already have a pronouns field, if an administrator created a custom field for your company’s employees. (When I went to check &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Slack, I found we already had one.) Slack says administrators can continue using that custom field or choose to turn on this new one, though the new dedicated pronouns field has the benefit of appearing more prominently in your profile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YI5ucKyoNhPCA_qNraXhbg7LLrQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526743/Slack_pronouns_feature.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Slack&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s how your pronouns will appear in Slack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YVfP3p"&gt;This new field will be hidden by default, however — Slack administrators will have to flip it on for everyone in a Slack workspace. If you’re an administrator and want to do that, &lt;a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/1500011115781-Manage-pronoun-display-for-member-profiles"&gt;here’s a quick guide from Slack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ut3OBE"&gt;Slack joins a few other apps in letting people add pronouns to profiles, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431055/instagram-pronoun-profile-update-setting"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; (which just got them last week), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/11/17846054/okcupid-pronoun-options"&gt;OkCupid&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/2/18646740/lyft-pronoun-choice-app-lgbtq-pride"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter says its image crops weren’t very biased, but is phasing them out anyhow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EZ4lAOE3Foiq73pgWUiyibepiJE=/182x0:1142x640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69313861/Screen_Shot_2021_05_19_at_12.37.31_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08667.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Yee, Tantipongpipat, Mishra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xgPOSi"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421574/twitter-crop-issue-bigger-images-rollout"&gt;is phasing out its image cropping algorithm&lt;/a&gt; in favor of showing larger previews, and &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/insights/2021/sharing-learnings-about-our-image-cropping-algorithm.html"&gt;the company has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s been looking into accusations that the system was biased. It found that the crops were slightly biased towards certain races and genders, but Twitter’s main gripe seems to be that the algorithm doesn’t give users control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PiKM3w"&gt;Starting in 2018, Twitter started using the algorithm to crop images so they fit in its image preview boxes. The algorithm tries to determine what will be most visually interesting to a user so it can include it can include it in the preview, but some have accused it of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;favoring white faces over black ones&lt;/a&gt;. To determine if that’s the case, Twitter had some of its researchers &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08667.pdf"&gt;produce a report&lt;/a&gt; analyzing the choices it makes when determining crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cTpfha"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How to crop an image is a decision best made by people”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8JpTkS"&gt;When testing to see if the algorithm indeed had racial biases, the researchers’ found that the algorithm chose to crop to white women over black women 7 percent of the time, and white men over black men 2 percent of the time, with an overall 4 percent preference for white individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owUeJz"&gt;Twitter also tested for gender bias, trying to see if the algorithm chose to crop around men more than women, and if it cropped pictures of women inappropriately (read: cropping around a woman’s chest or legs, rather than her face). It found that the algorithm favored women 8 percent of the time, but didn’t seem to crop them in a perv-y manner: in the approximately 3 percent of cases where it didn’t crop to a woman’s face, it was focused on things like a sports jersey’s number.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GDpmnRo-GrPBNgsTYJBafpyeZK0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526431/Screen_Shot_2021_05_19_at_1.28.56_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08667.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Yee, Tantipongpipat, Mishra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image from the report showing a correct and incorrect crop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4jfq2y"&gt;Twitter admits that the algorithms could still be harmful in other ways it hasn’t tested, and that relying on machine learning to crop images takes a lot of agency away from users. The company said draws the conclusion “that not everything on Twitter is a good candidate for an algorithm, and in this case, how to crop an image is a decision best made by people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvTTKE"&gt;To let people make that decision, Twitter has made the image previews bigger in its iOS and Android apps, so the algorithm doesn’t have to make as many cropping decisions. When it does need to crop an image, like if the image is very tall or wide, the user will be shown a preview of what it will look like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0faVz"&gt;The cropping algorithm hasn’t fully gone away, especially in the case of Twitter for the web where image preview crops still abound, but Twitter seems to hope that in most cases machine learning will take a back seat to human intuition.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is getting a trilogy of Fear Street movies in July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fear Street" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ML2lo_DkCCucTWlLmqogYI94g6A=/364x0:2634x1513/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69313525/Fear_Street.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fbmk8N"&gt;The ’90s are back in Netflix’s latest horror movies. A trilogy of movies based on R.L. Stine’s classic &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt; book series is coming to the streaming service in July. Plan your spooky movie nights accordingly: part one will debut on July 2nd, followed by sequels on the 9th and 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Spdn87"&gt;Here’s the basic premise, according to Netflix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="TAQVDi"&gt;In 1994, a group of teenagers discovers that the terrifying events that have haunted their town for generations ​may all be connected — and that they may be the next targets. Based on  R.L. Stine’s best selling horror series, the trilogy follows the nightmare through Shadyside’s sinister history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DA0BKv"&gt;Each film will cover a different time period. The first will take place in 1994, while the sequels will explore 1978 and — of course — 1666.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RNkx3"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt; books originally debuted back in 1989 and served as a more teenage-oriented counterpart to the blockbuster and hugely influential &lt;em&gt;Goosebumps&lt;/em&gt; series, which helped make Stine a household name. Back in 2015, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/14/9519805/goosebumps-rl-stine-interview"&gt;Stine told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “I never wanted to be scary, either. I only wanted to be funny.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="R3hyNc"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F19%2F22444137%2Fapple-accessibility-updates-disabilities-iphone-ipad-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a variety of new and updated features for people with disabilities today. Beginning May 20th, customers can use the new SignTime sign language interpreter service to contact AppleCare and retail customer care through their web browsers. Software updates later this year to iOS, watchOS, and iPadOS will bring improved options for Assistive Touch, VoiceOver, hearing aid support, and background sounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="inBvEa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We believe everyone should have the tools they need to change the world. Accessibility is a fundamental right, and we’re always pushing the boundaries of innovation so that everyone can learn, create and connect in new ways. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GAAD?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GAAD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/oZwQNG7p5x"&gt;https://t.co/oZwQNG7p5x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1395074896791674885?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OzzyD6"&gt;The new SignTime service is launching first in the US, UK, and France, and offers remote interpreter access for American Sign Language, British Sign Language, and French Sign Language. People can also use the service in Apple stores to get interpretation without booking it in advance, potentially preventing the hassle of wrangling an interpreter on short notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GElgH8"&gt;People with limb differences will be able to use Assistive Touch on watchOS, which should enable them to use Apple Watch without touching the screen. (Apple did not verify which Watches this will work for.) Apple says the Apple Watch can detect muscle movement and tendon activity through its built-in sensors, allowing users to control a cursor on the watch screen, answer calls, access notifications, and more by making various movements and gestures. (You can see it in action in the video &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F19%2F22444137%2Fapple-accessibility-updates-disabilities-iphone-ipad-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on this page&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gg8fFG"&gt;iPadOS will support third-party eye-tracking devices, allowing people with low mobility to move a cursor with their gaze and perform actions by holding eye contact, rather than tapping the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGGMmo"&gt;VoiceOver, Apple’s built-in screen reader, will be updated to include more details in images. According to Apple, it will allow people to navigate images with text and data tables by rows and columns, and describe people and objects in images. People will also be able to add image descriptions with Markup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OSdE9"&gt;Apple plans to upgrade the Made for iPhone hearing devices program, too, with support for bidirectional hearing aids. Users will also be able to upload their hearing test results to Headphone Accommodations to more easily customize how the feature amplifies sounds and adjusts different frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Three smiling Memojis, showing one with a cochlear implant on the left, one with nasal oxygen tubes in the center, and one with a soft helmet on the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xafYxYSX8o60kVdNupxHnTZbpls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526096/apple_gaad21_new_memoji_05192021.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UCeQKs"&gt;For neurodiverse people (or anyone who likes white noise), Apple is introducing Background Sounds that can be incorporated with other audio and system sounds. They include “balanced, bright, or dark noise, as well as ocean, rain, or stream sounds” that can be set to play continuously and mask distracting or overwhelming noises.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emW7wY"&gt;Other features Apple is planning for later in the year include the ability to use mouth sounds like clicks or pops instead of using physical buttons, the customization of display and text size settings in individual apps, and new Memoji options with cochlear implants, oxygen tubes, and soft helmets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNKugC"&gt;Companies large and small always have room for improvement when it comes to making their products accessible, but Apple has generally been a leader in the space. These updates hopefully signal a continued commitment to designing with disabled people in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDofnN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The level of Mac malware is not acceptable, says Apple’s Craig Federighi at Epic trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At The Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NKC7LIxZ9HPRsGn7Ta9ZY_QK5yY=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312798/967357020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gjuVel"&gt;The antitrust case between Apple and Epic continued today, and it brought Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, to the stand. Federighi’s mission was pretty clear from the outset: to extol the security benefits that come with iOS’s walled-off ecosystem and warn of the dangers that would come with breaking the App Store model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTIwUX"&gt;But in building that argument, Federighi also made some surprisingly blunt concessions about security on macOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fGp6j"&gt;“If you took Mac security techniques and applied them to the iOS ecosystem, with all those devices, all that value, it would get run over to a degree dramatically worse than is already happening on the Mac,” Federighi said in the testimony. “And as I say, today, we have a level of malware on the Mac that we don’t find acceptable and is much worse than iOS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XqAfB"&gt;Federighi made the claim as part of a broader argument for why iOS could not adopt the same software model as macOS, which allows for alternate software sources like the Epic Games Store. But in making the case for iOS security, the software chief ended up painting a bleak picture of security on the desktop platform. The full exchange is presented in context below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0ncbts"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judge Rogers:&lt;/strong&gt; There are multiple stores on the Mac. So, if that can happen on the Mac, why should we not allow the same stores to exist on the phone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gO2e1B"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craig Federighi:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it’s certainly how we’ve done it on the Mac and it’s regularly exploited on the Mac. iOS has established a dramatically higher bar for customer protection. The Mac is not meeting that bar today. And that’s despite the fact that Mac users inherently download less software and are subject to a way less economically motivated attacker base. If you took Mac security techniques and applied them to the iOS ecosystem, with all those devices, all that value, it would get run over to a degree dramatically worse than is already happening on the Mac. And as I say, today, we have a level of malware on the Mac that we don’t find acceptable and is much worse than iOS. Put that same situation in place for iOS and it would be a very bad situation for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="g1xvsS"&gt;Federighi also cast the difference between the two platforms in unusual terms, describing the desktop platform as something akin to a car. “If operated correctly, much like that car, if you know how to operate a car and obey the rules of the road and are very cautious, yes,” he said when asked directly whether macOS is safe. “If not, I’ve had a couple of family members who have gotten some malware on their Macs.” macOS allows software to be downloaded and installed from the web, but &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/protect-your-mac-from-malware-mh40596/mac"&gt;Apple advises customers&lt;/a&gt; that restricting this functionality to the App Store is “the most secure setting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UiPm6h"&gt;In contrast, Federighi presented iOS as a child-safe version of the less restricted macOS. “With iOS, we were able to create something where children — heck, even infants — are able to operate an iOS device and be safe in doing so. It’s really a different product,” Federighi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BriuCU"&gt;Federighi’s testimony comes in the final days of the trial, with much of the remaining time devoted to testimony from Apple executives. CEO Tim Cook is expected to take the stand on Friday, with closing statements from both sides given on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can get a PS5 at GameStop right now (UPDATE: Sold Out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uHIqtjYCigW_LpsI9ak-P1e9_0Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312642/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bJx4Fx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 19th, 2021 5:03 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameStop has sold out of both PS5 bundles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2vD5L"&gt;GameStop has released some precious stock of the PS5 consoles, both for the $499.99 disc-based version and the disc-less model that costs $100 less. However, it’s offering them in bundles, as GameStop has been wont to do since the console launched late last year. Stock is coming in and out, as usual, so stay on the page if you want to ensure the best chance that you’ll get one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cj0S3"&gt;You can get the disc-based console with &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;MLB The Show 21&lt;/em&gt;, an extra DualSense controller, and a $20 GameStop gift card &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-mlb-the-show-21-and-returnal-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225170K.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $729.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fUp5OE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425629"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UauFSn"&gt;Alternatively, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-with-ps-plus-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225171U.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the disc-less model comes in a $599.99 bundle&lt;/a&gt; that includes a second DualSense controller, a $20 GameStop gift card, a $50 credit for the PlayStation Store, and a one-year subscription to PS Plus for online gaming and complimentary downloads each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jOKl1L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425625"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N8HQ6j"&gt;If you want some extra games and accessories for your (hopefully) new PS5, check out some suggestions below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Yxm7hx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562978"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Here’s Anker’s apology after 712 Eufy customers had camera feeds exposed to strangers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qn69jZgQxCRLhfiFXhrwiKd2eKk=/824x0:1814x660/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312547/191106_165716_9.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Anker/Eufy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wMQrSX"&gt;Eufy has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EufyOfficial/status/1395064482804731907"&gt;put out a statement&lt;/a&gt; apologizing for a glitch that occurred two days ago, allowing some Eufy home security camera users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440298/eufy-privacy-glitch-server-error-camera-feed-exposed"&gt;to see video from other users’ homes&lt;/a&gt;. The statement explains that it happened during a software update, but the company claims it only affected a small number of users: just 712 people across the US, Canada, Mexico, Cuba, New Zealand, Australia, and Argentina. Eufy says that the issue was fixed with an emergency update less than two hours after it was identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yW8k7P"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Eufy confirmed that “users were able to access video feeds from other users’ cameras.” However, in its official statement &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EufyOfficial/status/1395064482804731907"&gt;posted to Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (which can be viewed in full below), Eufy doesn’t explain what the bug actually was. It does say it’s working to keep this from happening again in the future, by upgrading its network and the authentication mechanisms between the cameras, servers, and app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7wezI"&gt;The initial reports of the bug &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/neayuo/access_to_random_cameras_in_another_country/"&gt;came from Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, with users reporting that they were able to see and control the live feeds from all the Eufy cameras in someone else’s home, as well as see any previously recorded footage and the other user’s email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZ1vq9"&gt;Eufy suggests that that users in the affected countries (listed above) should unplug then replug their security home base, then log out of the Eufy security app before logging back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRijJ9"&gt;The full statement is below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dYJfOC"&gt;During a software update performed on our server in the United States on May 17th at 4:50 AM EDT, a bug occurred affecting a limited number of users in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Cuba, New Zealand, Australia, and Argentina. Users in Europe and other regions remain unaffected. Our engineering team identified the issue at 5:30 AM EDT and immediately rolled back the server version and deployed an emergency update. The incident was fixed at 6:30 AM EDT. We have confirmed that a total of 712 users were affected in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Oe4M8"&gt;Although the issue has been resolved, we recommend users in the affected countries (US, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, New Zealand, Australia, and Cuba) to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9au7fl"&gt;- Please unplug and then reconnect the eufy security home base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z39RaK"&gt;- Log out of the eufy security app and log in again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PojYd"&gt;All of our user video data is stored locally on the users’ devices. As a service provider, eufy provides account management, device management, and remote P2P access for users through AWS servers. All stored data and account information is encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNDzFS"&gt;In order to avoid this happening in the future, we are taking the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCfptt"&gt;- We are upgrading our network architecture and strengthening our two-way authentication mechanism between the servers, devices, and the eufy Security app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wjfd36"&gt;- We are upgrading our servers to improve their processing capacity in order to eliminate potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teVTKM"&gt;- We are also in the process of obtaining the TUV and BSI Privacy Information Management System (PIMS) certifications which will further improve our product security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koFQwB"&gt;We understand that we need to build trust again with our customers. Thank you for trusting us with your security and our team is available 24/7 at &lt;a href="mailto:support@eufylife.com"&gt;support@eufylife.com&lt;/a&gt; and Mon-Fri 9AM-5PM (PT) through our online chat on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Feufylife.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F19%2F22444164%2Feufy-security-camera-glitch-privacy-feed-exposed-statement-details" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eufylife.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>11 things we know about the new smartwatch OS from Google and Samsung — and some we don’t</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ESs1F_Zl_AyG-xjOgNOkUM36xkg=/23x0:1592x1046/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312329/Screen_Shot_2021_05_19_at_1.48.00_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJLmvt"&gt;Yesterday brought the momentous news that Google and Samsung will merge together their Wear OS and Tizen-based smartwatch platforms into a single operating system. The new software is currently being referred to as Wear, but that name could change as we get closer to the first devices that will ship with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkqJBd"&gt;The unified platform is intended to give Android smartwatches a huge boost and much simpler strategy. It will also allow developers to create apps and widgets for a single OS instead of splitting their efforts between Wear OS and Tizen. A lot of this is spelled out in more detail in the below video, but let’s also focus on the big highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3d2POI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kYIb9g1r4lw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PCl44B"&gt;It’s going to be faster than Wear OS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6mEUO8"&gt;Speed and responsiveness were one of the major talking points when Google and Samsung made this announcement during the I/O 2021 keynote. The companies are claiming that apps open up to 30 percent faster than they currently do on Wear OS. Google also promises “smooth user interface animations and motion,” which hasn’t always been a strength of Wear OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="V5mrLs"&gt;Battery life will be a step up, too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="a5Ap1m"&gt;Samsung’s smartwatches were already routinely outlasting Wear OS products, so this doesn’t come as a surprise. The company is lending Google some hardware expertise to ensure better stamina. “Samsung implemented our best technology to provide optimized performances, and advanced sensor batching and low power display technology to ensure an efficient and long-lasting battery,” &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/a-new-era-of-smartwatch-innovation-starts-here/"&gt;Samsung’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Janghyun Yoon wrote&lt;/a&gt; after Tuesday’s news. &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/wear-os/wear-io21/"&gt;Google’s Bjorn Kilburn said&lt;/a&gt; customers can expect “handy optimizations like the ability to run the heart rate sensor continuously during the day, track your sleep overnight and still have battery for the next day.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s57RXPu8xV8gdBssRwTANsqbDbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523438/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_2.31.35_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="U7FD3y"&gt;The next Samsung Galaxy Watch will run Wear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1vPwBI"&gt;Samsung has confirmed that its next smartwatch — and all others in the pipeline — will run the unified Wear platform. But the company made sure to note that it will bring over some of its popular hardware elements, like the rotating bezel mechanism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eSi1MG"&gt;A standalone Google Maps app will do turn-by-turn directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="USphat"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-wear-os-io-samsung-fitbit-partnership/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we learned that there are plans for a Google Maps app on Wear that features “a new user interface that will also work even if your phone is not with you.” That hints at cellular data support on the new unified platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7HbPmQ"&gt;Spotify and YouTube Music apps will support offline downloads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KJQ7bt"&gt;Spotify already allows owners of Samsung smartwatches to download songs for offline listening, and now that same convenience &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442880/spotify-youtube-music-download-offline-playlists-podcasts-updates"&gt;will be extended to Wear&lt;/a&gt;. That’s one thing Spotify for the Apple Watch still doesn’t do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xN1lTr"&gt;Google also confirmed that YouTube Music will be available on Wear. Like Spotify, it’ll include full support for offline listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dj07Co"&gt;Fitbit activity tracking will be built into the platform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gLK3qO"&gt;Having completed its acquisition of Fitbit at the start of this year, Google will now integrate some of the brand’s health and activity tracking features into Wear. Future premium Fitbit wearables will also run the unified platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gccHxx"&gt;Device makers will be able to customize the look and feel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i7v57H"&gt;Google tried to emphasize on Tuesday that this platform isn’t just intended for itself and Samsung. “All device makers will be able to add a customized user experience on top of the platform,” Kilburn said. That’s going to prove important if Google wants to keep companies like Garmin on board with the new platform. And we can’t forget about the many traditional watchmakers — Fossil, Citizen, TAG Heuer, and others — that have gotten behind Wear OS in recent years in the absence of a flagship smartwatch from Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j0uZLt"&gt;Apps should be faster and easier to develop with new APIs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="chEw9f"&gt;Wear’s apps will use the latest Android development techniques like Jetpack and Kotlin to help reach the best possible performance. Google is also promising to make life easier for app makers with new APIs that cover Tiles, health services, watchfaces, complications, and more. And an activity indicator will show when certain functions are running in the background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XyPTaD"&gt;Some Wear OS smartwatches might get upgraded to Wear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q2OdZD"&gt;There aren’t any firm promises yet, but Google at least didn’t outright say existing products &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; be updated to the new OS. The company told &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/18/wear-os-revamp-current-models/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “we will have more updates to share on timelines once the new version launches later this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qPkD6H"&gt;Samsung will not update Galaxy Watch models to Wear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8uudYx"&gt;Samsung will not be updating its Galaxy Watch line to Wear, but says it has no intention of leaving its current customers in the dust once it starts releasing Wear hardware. “For customers who already own the Tizen OS based Galaxy smartwatches, we are continuing to provide at least three years of software support after the product launch,” the &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/editorial-a-new-era-of-smartwatch-innovation-starts-here?utm_source=mainkv&amp;amp;utm_medium=internal"&gt;company said Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. However, it seems plausible there will be more than a few features and new Wear tricks that will never make their way to older Galaxy smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wjuRQV"&gt;Samsung will bring over its watchface designer tool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Cupd81"&gt;Some people out there really care about having a good watchface selection on a pricey smartwatch. Google and Samsung are promising a wide mix of styles, and Samsung told Wired its design tool — and many of the company’s own signature watchfaces — will be available on Wear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="71558Q"&gt;The unknowns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ekd1iU"&gt;Google and Samsung shared a decent chunk of information on day one, but we’re still left without answers to a few important questions. We should learn more details over the summer as we head into fall hardware season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PhmIyB"&gt;When will the first Wear smartwatch be available?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sVmmhq"&gt;Is the underlying operating system closer to Wear OS or closer to Tizen? (Considering that developers will be using Android tools to build apps, it seems like the former.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wNbgne"&gt;Will there be required helper apps like some of Samsung’s watches have needed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kwdrOg"&gt;Is Wear going to continue offering some semblance of iOS support?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eglWmQ"&gt;What’s going to happen to Samsung Pay and Bixby? Are they both goners on the wrist?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
