    <title>Honor 50 review: lose a Huawei, gain a Google</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Google’s software makes the Honor 50 a contender rather than competitive&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="kUBDaT"&gt;It’s rare that you need to get into geopolitics at the outset of a smartphone review, but it’s impossible to avoid with the Honor 50. It’s the first Honor-branded device to release outside of China since the brand &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;spun out from parent company Huawei last year&lt;/a&gt;. It means that despite Huawei’s continued presence on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18216988/white-house-huawei-china-equipment-ban-trump-executive-order"&gt;USA’s entity list&lt;/a&gt;, Honor is now able to include Google’s apps and services on a new phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bho8iK"&gt;Having access to these services, which include critical parts of the Android ecosystem like Google Play in addition to apps like Google Maps and YouTube, means that the Honor 50 is the first Honor phone in years to actually have a shot at being a viable purchase for customers outside of China. Its midrange starting price of €529 (about $616) doesn’t hurt, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVw4Hm"&gt;But while leaving its former parent company has opened a Google-shaped window for Honor, it’s also closed a Huawei-shaped door. Honor is now on its own, without the backing of one of the most well-resourced technology companies in the world. As a result, while not a bad phone, the Honor 50 ends up not feeling competitive with other handsets in its price range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MhIbgR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10834487"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7L1usZ"&gt;The Honor 50 starts at €529 (around $616) for 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, which is the version I’ve been using, but stepping up to €599 (about $698) gets you 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Regardless of which option you go for, you get the same Snapdragon 778G processor and a 4,300mAh battery that can be fast charged at up to 66W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NC0vPA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You get the choice of 6 or 8GB of RAM&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NjxZsU"&gt;Honor’s phones have always been available with loud designs, and the Honor 50 is no different. My model came in a shiny white colorway, with the letters “HONOR” tiled across its back, and there’s also a garish sparkly silver color option available alongside more conventional black and green options. While I don’t love the color options, I think Honor deserves credit for its approach to the dual-ring camera bump on the Honor 50, which is a lot more interesting than the generic rectangles found on the backs of most devices (Huawei’s Nova 9 uses a very similar design, which Honor says is because the design was developed before the split).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVMwc7"&gt;Around front, the Honor 50 has a 6.57-inch 1080p OLED display, with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and a small centrally orientated hole-punch notch for the phone’s 32-megapixel selfie camera, which moderately curves around the left and right edges of the phone. I can’t fault the screen’s rich blacks or vibrant colors, and the under-display fingerprint sensor is fast and responsive. If you don’t like curved displays, then you won’t like the Honor 50’s, but at least the phone doesn’t suffer from any palm-rejection issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t82WZd3sISbJxPFlNaKC4jF-PuU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963228/jporter_211025_4826_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A curved screen might not be to everyone’s tastes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d-r-IsZluIIa_rXonBd_Y9D03Ss=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963226/jporter_211025_4826_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I like the camera bump more than the color.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y7l4aF"&gt;The Honor 50’s screen has a 120Hz refresh rate, which makes it feel fast to use and smooth to look at, and the Snapdragon 778G processor happily keeps up, even while the screen quickly scrolling through visually intensive apps like Twitter. I had no problems with performance during my time with the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TjJhn1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s no IP-rating and no wireless charging&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TggGOl"&gt;The rest of the specs are more basic. There’s no IP rating for dust and water resistance and no wireless charging, and when it comes to audio, the phone outputs sound from a basic downward-firing speaker. It’s loud enough for listening around the house, but you’ll be reaching for a pair of headphones in noisier environments. Honor includes a pair of USB-C headphones in the box, which is fairly unusual these days, and almost makes up for the lack of a headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulJlYu"&gt;Honor’s Magic UI software, which runs atop of Android 11 on the Honor 50, is broadly inoffensive. However, it has its annoyances and, by default, is set up in a way that I think most people are going to want to tweak. For starters, it uses Microsoft’s SwiftKey rather than Google’s Gboard keyboard that I think most Android users will be more familiar with. There are also a ton of stock Honor apps that I disabled in my first couple of days with the phone, and I don’t love the way Honor’s software defaults to eschewing Android’s typical app drawer for an iOS-like homescreen. It’s easy enough to rectify with some tweaks, but it feels a little cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eq6YfkE9SHvOAV1u0qIM91qD_Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963224/jporter_211025_4826_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone has four rear cameras in its camera bump.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tsf43s"&gt;I had no complaints with the battery life of the Honor 50, averaging a little over seven hours of screen on time between charges. I never had to put the phone on to charge at the end of the day with less than 40 percent charge remaining. The Honor 50 supports 66W fast charging via an included charger that’s branded as Honor’s own “SuperCharge” charging standard, which isn’t compatible with third-party chargers. Honor claims the included charger can get the phone from 0 to 100 percent charge in 45 minutes (unfortunately, my review sample came with an EU plug, so I was unable to verify this claim myself). But a full charge in under an hour is nothing to be sniffed at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S043nr"&gt;The headline camera specs of the Honor 50 appear to be impressive at first glance, but the devil’s in the detail. Yes, it’s a 108-megapixel quad-camera array, but there’s no telephoto camera, and beyond the main sensor, the three additional cameras are a comparatively low-resolution 8-megapixel ultra-wide angle, a 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e5rzBK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10834528"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AH69Sq"&gt;Things don’t get off to a great start with the Honor 50’s main camera. Even in daylight, there can be a distinct lack of detail in its shots, like in the shot of the black cat above, where there’s very little definition or texture in its fur. Colors are vibrant at the risk of being a little oversaturated, and faces come out looking a little too bright and textureless. White balance is at least pretty natural, and I think selfies come out generally looking OK, helped by the fact that there’s an easily accessible shortcut to turn on background blurring and a beauty mode slider (if that’s a feature you’re interested in). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caOsnn"&gt;Low light performance leaves a lot to be desired, where the Honor 50 produces shots that are dark and muddy. But the bigger problem is that the phone takes way too long to take photographs in low light. When trying to take a shot of a group of people at a party, the Honor 50 refused to take a photo for several agonizing moments, which is far longer than people at a party are willing to wait to have their photo taken for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AVLEUhGmjx-P5x--gjLjWPl3NmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963229/jporter_211025_4826_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A USB-C and bottom-firing speaker, but no headphone jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/648NqA0oDE6Rqeo032kNax-Cqm8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963225/jporter_211025_4826_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 120Hz display is hard to fault.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9VgiQb"&gt;At its starting price, the Honor 50 is a comfortably midrange device. But there are a lot of accomplished smartphones available at similar prices. Phones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus Nord 2&lt;/a&gt; (€499 for its step-up 12GB RAM / 256GB storage model) or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt; (€539 for its 128GB storage variant) are both excellent phones that offer a much more rounded experience than the Honor 50. And if you’re considering the Honor 50 with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, then you’re just €50 away from the recently announced Pixel 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFEUIv"&gt;It’s a crowded part of the market, and simply having access to Google’s apps and services isn’t enough to make an impact. Honor’s software can feel bloated, and its camera is sluggish and lacking in detail. Speedy 66W fast charging and a slick 120Hz display aren’t enough to distract from the fact that the Honor 50 has some weak spots when compared against the best midrange handsets available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="jX6wqK"&gt;Honor might be a viable purchase now that it can once again include Google’s apps and services on its devices. But it has more work to do if it wants to be truly competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="VegvPD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10834541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>These might be the first leaked photos of Intel’s Arc Alchemist graphics card</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kIrpDSn-HCtZmLEogZDIPE1E-HI=/250x0:2268x1345/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70065416/Intel_Arc_Alchemist_DG2_512EU_Reference_Card.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zy1KA7"&gt;Intel is building dedicated gaming graphics cards, due out in Q1 2022, and we may have just gotten our first look at the big one, the Arc Alchemist. Here are some leaked images from YouTuber &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD7s1ZFLoO4"&gt;Moore’s Law is Dead&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-arc-alchemist-flagship-desktop-graphics-card-has-been-pictured"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Videocardz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9kKZnIg2tGgalgPXsgStVXRGLag=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968221/Intel_Arc_Alchemist_DG2_512EU_Reference_Card_back.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b5SdZrqSjsQQFmsWBpnGibwcqV4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968220/Intel_Arc_Alchemist_DG2_512EU_Reference_Card.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Kgk6xc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626912/intel-arc-gpu-brand-alchemist-codename-release-date"&gt;Arc is Intel’s new GPU brand&lt;/a&gt;, designed to compete with Nvidia GeForce and AMD Radeon, and the Arc Alchemist is the first GPU in the company’s roadmap that’s actually scheduled to release. The company had previously built &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058422/intel-dg1-discrete-gpu-graphics-card-announcement-ces-2020"&gt;the Intel DG1&lt;/a&gt; to test the GPU waters, but that was a comparatively weak card, based on the Xe LP (low-power) graphics architecture, and consumers couldn’t actually buy it. This new card is part of Intel’s Xe HPG roadmap (high-power / gaming) and is said to deliver performance akin to an Nvidia RTX 3070 thanks to 512 execution units (EUs) and 16GB of GDDR6 memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNMsUy"&gt;Leaks suggest that Intel may also have several variants of its “DG2” GPU in the works, including lighter versions with 448EUs, 384EUs, 256EUs or as few as 128EUs for an entry level GPU. Even that would be notably more than the number of graphics core clusters that Intel has typically integrated into its own CPUs. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is officially closing its Redwood City and Toronto offices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B-_zegsYlSpgdeKWjkbt066v9S4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70065346/acastro_190530_1777_nintendo_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrations by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="buKWZ9"&gt;Nintendo is closing its Redwood City, California and Toronto, Canada offices, the company confirmed in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-nintendo-shutters-california-office-1847966405"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on the closure of the Redwood City offices earlier on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwqDdv"&gt;Here is the company’s full statement on the decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eHs3Ig"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo of America headquarters are in Redmond, WA, and Vancouver, BC. We are moving more of our employees and operations into those headquarters and will be closing small satellite offices in Toronto, ON, and Redwood City, CA, over time. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTfvZk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devon Pritchard, Executive Vice President, Business Affairs and Publisher Relations for Nintendo of America (NOA), will assume interim leadership of Sales, Marketing and Communications following the departure of Nick Chavez. Ms. Pritchard will oversee strategy and execution of sales, marketing and communications across the U.S. and Canada.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KQuJJT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; reports that about 100 employees have been displaced in the Redwood City offices as a result of the decision. Nintendo declined to comment when we asked how many employees would be affected by the move, but its statement above does suggest some employees will be able to relocate. It’s not clear why the offices are being closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZncHV"&gt;The Redwood City office is still shown on a map of Nintendo’s office locations on &lt;a href="https://careers.nintendo.com/about-us/"&gt;the company’s jobs website&lt;/a&gt;. “Here you’ll find the Sales and Marketing departments, as well as NMI, a dedicated merchandising field team who work with retail stores across the country,” a description reads. The Toronto office is also still on the site, described as a “sales office for NOCL.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFjxY1"&gt;As of earlier today, there were &lt;a href="https://careers.nintendo.com/job-openings/"&gt;no open positions listed&lt;/a&gt; for the Redwood City location, even the company appears to have had an open role for a “Specialist, Experiential Marketing” &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nintendo+job+opening+redwood+city&amp;amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS968US968&amp;amp;ei=H258YYupMpy90PEP5daBgA4&amp;amp;oq=nintendo+job+opening+redwood+city&amp;amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyCAghEBYQHRAeMggIIRAWEB0QHjoHCAAQRxCwAzoECAAQQzoKCC4QxwEQ0QMQQzoFCAAQkQI6CwguEIAEELEDEIMBOgoIABCxAxCDARBDOhAILhCxAxCDARDHARDRAxBDOgcIABCxAxBDOggILhCABBCxAzoLCAAQgAQQsQMQgwE6EQguEIAEELEDEIMBEMcBENEDOggIABCABBCxAzoICAAQsQMQkQI6CwgAELEDEIMBEJECOgUIABCABDoICAAQgAQQyQM6CAgAEMkDEMQCOgYIABAWEB46DggAEIAEELEDEIMBEMkDSgQIQRgAUOOpDVjs3w1gmuENaAFwAngAgAGXAYgB2ReSAQQyNy42mAEAoAEByAEIwAEB&amp;amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;amp;uact=5&amp;amp;ibp=htl;jobs&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiUg_Cmz_DzAhWGHjQIHeLDB9MQkd0GegQIKhAB#fpstate=tldetail&amp;amp;htivrt=jobs&amp;amp;htiq=nintendo+job+opening+redwood+city&amp;amp;htidocid=1i0BSar28w0cW3CrAAAAAA%3D%3D"&gt;as recently as two days ago&lt;/a&gt;, according to Google caches.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HAARTlLkud9IRrtLfT_Yaa82Clw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968113/Screen_Shot_2021_10_29_at_3.15.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Redwood City doesn’t have any open roles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fNTtXP"&gt;Given that the Redwood City office was focused on sales, marketing, and merchandising, it likely won’t affect the development of Nintendo’s games or hardware. Most of Nintendo’s games are developed overseas, though it also has developer Retro Studios in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3YILG"&gt;The closure comes just weeks after the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt;Nintendo Switch with an OLED screen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22710468/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of Nintendo’s biggest games of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Szd8Vn"&gt;Meta &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fwithin-to-join-meta%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that the studio behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746070/supernatural-vr-workout-app-adds-boxing-oculus-quest"&gt;VR workout game Supernatural&lt;/a&gt; will be joining the company, adding to the roster of studios owned by what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751220/facebook-portal-oculus-quest-meta-horizon-renaming"&gt;used to be known as&lt;/a&gt; Facebook’s Oculus division. The company says that Within, the company behind Supernatural, will continue to work on the popular fitness app and will also help Meta’s Reality Labs “enhance future hardware to support VR fitness apps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QOwsz"&gt;Meta scooping up Within isn’t necessarily a surprise move: it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537795/is-facebook-cornering-the-vr-market"&gt;spent the last few years&lt;/a&gt; acquiring tons of popular VR studios, like &lt;em&gt;Lone Echo&lt;/em&gt; devs Ready at Dawn, the team behind &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;, and others working on projects that some have called the VR versions of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22530144/facebook-oculus-studios-acquires-bigbox-vr-population-one"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YtiwG4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Is Facebook cornering the VR market?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537795/is-facebook-cornering-the-vr-market"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="nhazQh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10833239"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6GfxTu"&gt;Given Meta’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22749648/active-pack-oculus-quest-2-fitness-workouts-sweat-hygiene"&gt;focus on its headsets as workout tools&lt;/a&gt; (Supernatural even &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOn2CZWnxxY"&gt;got a callout&lt;/a&gt; in its Connect keynote on Thursday), it tracks that Zuckerberg’s company would want to add a popular VR fitness game to its roster. The move, however, doesn’t help with concerns that Meta is going to end up owning the entire virtual reality market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kx1Qeg"&gt;While Supernatural&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is Within’s flagship app, &lt;a href="https://www.with.in/about"&gt;according to the company’s site&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also been the host of VR experiences, too — in 2016, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/22/12253358/mr-robot-virtual-reality-elliot-flashback-story-sdcc-2016"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr. Robot &lt;/em&gt;VR episode&lt;/a&gt; (executive produced by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22379859/vr-virtual-reality-fitness-work-out-supernatural-chris-milk-interview"&gt;Within founder Chris Milk&lt;/a&gt;) was shown on the app, and the company’s website contains dozens of documentaries, music videos, and more. That streaming tech and library of content isn’t a bad get either for a company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;trying to build a metaverse&lt;/a&gt; where people hang out and watch content together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PT9rVm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best thing to do in VR is work out","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22379859/vr-virtual-reality-fitness-work-out-supernatural-chris-milk-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>All iOS users can now Super Follow on Twitter </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter Super Follows and Ticketed Spaces test announcement" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q7mPX9qC4uayVHnJ8yHu0lV9854=/0x0:4892x3261/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70065142/Hero_image__1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FaV4Z8"&gt;Twitter is allowing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1453847498200686596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;all iOS users to Super Follow select creators&lt;/a&gt;. The feature, first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651138/twitter-super-follow-launch-subscription-ios"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; in September and only available in the US and Canada, allows users to monetize their Twitter account and create exclusive content through monthly subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOoJS0"&gt;Twitter first announced Super Follows in February and rolled it out to select creators in September. Within the first two weeks, subscribers had contributed around $6,000, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/twitter-super-follows-has-generated-only-around-6k-in-its-first-two-weeks/"&gt;according to SensorTower&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SkRkLm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It’s Super Following time –– everyone globally on iOS now has the option to Super Follow select creators.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1453847498200686596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DTf37s"&gt;Users interested in Super Follows have to meet the minimum requirements, according to the&lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/super-follows-policy"&gt; Super Follows policy&lt;/a&gt;. They have to be 18 or older, have at least 10,000 followers, have tweeted at least 25 times in the past 30 days. Once accepted, they have to tweet a minimum of 25 tweets every 30 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4KXE8"&gt;Users are &lt;a href="https://media.twitter.com/en/articles/blogs/2021/be-the-first-to-try-ticketed-spaces-and-super-follows"&gt;eligible to earn up to 97 percent&lt;/a&gt; of revenue from their Super Follows subscription after in-app purchase fees, with Twitter taking 3 percent. However, if a user earns $50,000, they can earn up to 80 percent of revenue after in-app purchase fees, and Twitter will increase its share up to 20 percent of future earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rBkXa"&gt;Super Followers are supposed to have access to bonus content and get badges to be easily recognized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VZBCs"&gt;Twitter says it plans to include Android and web users in the future as it expands Super Follows. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku launches new personal-use developer kit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_sjk6rY90VzzO_zRqUFY9apOTg=/0x50:1500x1050/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70064865/Roku_Streaming_Stick_4K.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HN7UBM"&gt;Roku is launching a new independent developer kit that will allow developers to “experiment with and customize their devices” in personal-use capacities. Roku says it hopes the IDK will lead to innovation around internet-of-things applications, such as connecting a Roku device to a thermostat or game development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3yHSP"&gt;Roku unveiled its plans for the new IDK at its online developer summit this week. The company made it clear in an &lt;a href="https://blog.roku.com/developer/2021/10/26/idk"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; about the IDK that its Roku SDK will remain the primary channel development kit for commercial applications but said that the new developer kit “enables developers to explore the platform’s capabilities and personalize their Roku experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P05wQs"&gt;The company isn’t quite clear on how developers will use the new IDK, Roku’s VP of content partnerships Tedd Cittadine said during a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQb4EJug-WA"&gt;keynote address&lt;/a&gt;, but its primary purpose is to help Roku continue to innovate its platform. Some applications might include building games that work specifically with the Roku remote or building apps to control smart home devices around the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ODdfHl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Developers can use the IDK and code in their favorite programming language to create applications beyond streaming channels.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0vhgza"&gt;“Developers can use the IDK and code in their favorite programming language to create applications beyond streaming channels,” the company said in an &lt;a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/idk/idk-faqs.md"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; about the new developer kit. “For example, developers can build applications in JavaScript that pull together data from various sources, effectively turning their TV monitor into a snapshot view of their daily news, weather, calendar appointments, and even traffic conditions for their office commute.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKzkpT"&gt;Roku did specify that IDK applications will not be supported on Roku TVs, streambars, or its legacy streaming players. Roku devices will also need to be running Roku OS 10.5 or higher. In addition to the IDK launch, Roku announced it’s also launching a new beta channel tool for developers to test their apps before making changes live on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJU8Z6"&gt;Lastly, the company said that it will be removing non-certified channels from its platform by March of next year. These channels are SDK channels that are used for testing by developers. A spokesperson for the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they are “not published to the Roku channel store or shared publicly because in most cases, they are channels that are being tested ahead of launch.” The company declined to comment on how many non-certified channels would be affected by the change.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iFixit actually tore down Apple’s backordered $19 screen cloth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X9235Iq9RFn0msZiVqbVb_uj64c=/0x319:6899x4918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70064814/finallayout.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: iFixit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9ZkUv0"&gt;I can’t say I expected there to be more news about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733198/apple-polishing-cloth-clean-devices"&gt;Apple’s $19 Screen Polishing cloth&lt;/a&gt;, but here we are. Not only has iFixit given it the teardown treatment and a (perhaps slightly tongue-in-cheek) repair score, but it’s apparently become one of Apple’s hardest-to-get products. And yes, to reiterate, we are still talking about a cloth made to clean your devices’ screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x42ohl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/technology/apple-polishing-cloth.html"&gt;As noted by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the 6.3-inch-sided square of fabric is now backordered, with Apple’s website saying that you won’t get it for 10-12 &lt;em&gt;weeks&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;meaning it’ll get delivered sometime between January 7th and January 21st, 2022. If you order pretty much any configuration of the redesigned MacBook Pro that the cloth launched with, you’ll get your custom-built laptop at least a week before you get your cleaning cloth — and that’s with the worst-case estimate for the MacBook and best-case one for the cloth. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DthHDomLTUNCKblqE2HtQVOd4RU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967806/Screen_Shot_2021_10_29_at_13.29.29.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not too bad, in comparison.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8Bd9KG"&gt;Why is this happening? How did it catch the attention of &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;? Maybe &lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/54122/macbook-pro-2021-teardown"&gt;looking at iFixit’s teardown&lt;/a&gt; will provide some answers! (Spoiler: nope.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQbSYT"&gt;iFixit doesn’t have a dedicated page for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shroud_of_Turin"&gt;The Cloth&lt;/a&gt;, so you’ll have to scroll past a bunch of boring details about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;the MacBook that I’m definitely not drooling over&lt;/a&gt; to see the results. Once you do, though, its a surprisingly in-depth look at the accessory. iFixit reveals that it’s actually two pieces of material glued together and even takes a microscope to it to compare it to regular old microfiber. The teardown is brief (obviously, it’s literally a cloth), but well worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1VBQZsZkcoliO91AQdlJeqkmpgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967824/interiorshot.jpg"&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Breaking news: it’s a cloth &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; a potential ravioli.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dIUev8"&gt;But when compared to the actually decent (for Apple, at least) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22517104"&gt;reparability of the new MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, the Polishing Cloth gets a disappointing 0 / 10 repair score for distracting the iFixit crew. That’s really a bummer, because if you accidentally cut yours to pieces like iFixit did, you’ll have to wait a couple months to get a replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhLKrw"&gt;Finally, if you needed yet another reason to check out &lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/54122/macbook-pro-2021-teardown"&gt;iFixit’s article&lt;/a&gt; (besides, you know, the in-depth technical breakdown of Apple’s new laptops) just know that it has one of the funniest &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZVkW9p-cCU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Psycho&lt;/em&gt; references&lt;/a&gt; I’ve seen for a while. Hats off to you, iFixit, for providing us with something fun to look at on a Friday (and for coming to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22702324/on-the-verge-event-date-tickets-guests-creators"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s birthday party&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7022385139283922182?is_copy_url=0&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;sender_device=pc&amp;amp;sender_web_id=6998606657735525894"&gt;teach people how to fix JoyCon&lt;/a&gt; last weekend). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix employees at the heart of the Dave Chappelle controversy file charges against the company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T5UJEXG6Oc1qdQiL9HEsFKnf9p8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70064779/acastro_211025_1777_netflix_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OOsOfR"&gt;Two Netflix employees at the heart of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728337/netflix-fires-organizer-trans-employee-walkout-dave-chappelle"&gt;Dave Chappelle controversy&lt;/a&gt; have filed labor charges against the company, alleging the streaming giant retaliated against them for engaging in protected activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFVV2l"&gt;B. Pagels-Minor, a Black trans program manager, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728337/netflix-fires-organizer-trans-employee-walkout-dave-chappelle"&gt;fired while organizing a walkout&lt;/a&gt; related to Netflix’s support of Chappelle’s comedy special&lt;em&gt; The Closer&lt;/em&gt;, which has been widely condemned as transphobic. Terra Field, a trans software engineer, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720724/netflix-suspends-trans-employee-tweeted-dave-chappelle-the-closer"&gt;suspended after posting a viral tweet thread&lt;/a&gt; about the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYna08"&gt;Netflix said it fired Pagels-Minor for allegedly leaking confidential information — a charge they have categorically denied. The company said Field was suspended for attending a director-level meeting she wasn’t supposed to, though it reinstated her after finding no ill intent. In the charge, Field says she and hundreds of other Netflix employees were invited to attend the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdpKbP"&gt;Now, the employees are filing unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board. They say Netflix’s actions were designed to stop workers from speaking out about their working conditions, including the desire to create a safe environment for Netflix staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2kd2p"&gt;“This charge is not just about B. and Terra, and it’s not about Dave. It’s about trying to change the culture and having an impact for others,” says attorney Laurie Burgess. “The charge is all about collective action. It’s about supporting your coworkers and speaking up for things you care about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQbmTd"&gt;Filing with the NLRB supports the goal of collective action. But it’s also an easier choice than filing in state court, as both Pagels-Minor and Field signed Netflix employment agreements that require them to resolve disputes in private arbitration, &lt;a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/the-growing-use-of-mandatory-arbitration/"&gt;a process that tends to favor the employer&lt;/a&gt;. (This is common at large tech companies, though both Google and Activision Blizzard have recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750450/activision-blizzard-ends-forced-arbitration-bobby-kotick-paycut"&gt;ended forced arbitration&lt;/a&gt; due to employee organizing efforts.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oV1gBg"&gt;The NLRB investigates all charges it receives. If it finds the allegations have merit, it can try to secure a settlement or, if that fails, issue a complaint. For employees, the best-case scenario outside of settling is getting reinstated with backpay and forcing Netflix to post a notice that workers are allowed to engage in protected activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="My53N6"&gt;In a carefully worded statement, Netflix implied Pagels-Minor was the source &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;behind a &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; story&lt;/a&gt; that contained internal metrics about how much Netflix paid for &lt;em&gt;The Closer. &lt;/em&gt;The&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/16/media/netflix-employee-fired-david-chappelle/index.html"&gt;narrative then spread in the media&lt;/a&gt;, though employees who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;said they didn’t believe it was true. After Pagels-Minor was fired, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; continued to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-10-17/dave-chappelle-s-special-cost-more-than-squid-game?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;publish stories containing internal metrics&lt;/a&gt; about Netflix shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XASC0W"&gt;B., who is 35 weeks pregnant, is now about to lose their health insurance. “Amidst all the stress, I am trying to take one day at a time and focus on my health,” they said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “As a high-risk pregnancy, I have to be careful. We don’t even know what our health insurance situation is, and we are scheduled to be in a hospital having a baby in less than 30 days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGIqbk"&gt;Field has applied for medical leave from Netflix. Since speaking out, she has received a credible death threat and been doxxed. “This is what happens with trans people — we’re tolerated as long as we’re quiet, but if we speak up we get harassed,” she says in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It has been a really stressful few weeks, but I intend to keep fighting for our community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XOR16"&gt;Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is continuing to stand by the special, although he’s &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/10/netflix-ted-sarandos-speaks-up-dave-chapplle-the-closer-controversy-interview-1234858762/"&gt;walked back previous claims&lt;/a&gt; that “content on screen doesn’t directly translate to real-world harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lx5cgk"&gt;Earlier this week, a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; investigation found that in 2020, Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747488/netflix-suppress-cuties-algorithm-search-results-dave-chappelle"&gt;suppressed search results after the controversy around the film &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to quell public outrage. The company did not take similar steps for &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acWfW7"&gt;The trans employee resource group &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733098/netflix-trans-employees-demands-dave-chappelle-walkout"&gt;released a list of demands&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the October 20th walkout. They want Netflix to invest in trans creators and revise internal processes on commissioning potentially harmful content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gd5G41"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; after the original publication of this article, a Netflix spokesperson denied retaliating against employees. “We recognize the hurt and pain caused to our trans colleagues over the last few weeks. But we want to make clear that Netflix has not taken any action against employees for either speaking up or walking out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gb0Pqm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 29th, 7:44PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Netflix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iFixit teardown of the 2021 MacBook Pro reveals easier battery swaps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Stretchy adhesive being pulled out of the MacBook case" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D4XKs1Pzbz9ciQvtwenwg88di68=/0x3:7360x4910/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70064757/MBP_M1_2021_42e3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The trackpad has to be removed to reveal two of the pull tabs | Image: iFixit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WwFeoc"&gt;Online tech repair guide and parts retailer iFixit has published its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F54122%2Fmacbook-pro-2021-teardown&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F29%2F22753063%2Fmacbook-pro-ifixit-teardown-battery-swaps-pull-tabs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest teardown&lt;/a&gt; for the new 2021 MacBook Pro and reveals at least one small win for reparability: the ability to replace the battery pack modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vwjDJY"&gt;The battery modules in the new MacBook Pros, much like many mobile devices, are now attached via adhesive strips with pull tabs. This makes it easier to remove them, as long as none of the tabs rip while pulling. The trackpad needs to also be carefully removed to reach the remaining pull tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d2W2ZP-_AkC5s1ZYf852Xw5BjVw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967611/MBP_M1_2021_117_Updated3f.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iInWyk"&gt;Batteries in MacBook Pros used to have their own frame or shell, which made them easier to install or remove via screws or locking tabs (although that takes more interior space). Starting in 2012, Apple wanted to make laptops thinner, so battery structures were removed to save some real estate. The biggest issue with MacBook Pro model years 2012–2020 was that Apple used glue to all but permanently fuse the battery to the top case of the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2L7j3q"&gt;HDMI and SD card ports are fixed to the logic board, but the rest of the ports are modular, though you would have to remove the whole logic board to replace them. Fans and the speakers also require a logic board removal before a replacement is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X4IIqJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple MacBook Pro 14 and 16 review: return to form","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oglYwI"&gt;The only real remaining qualms are that replacing the screen would mean losing True Tone, and replacing Touch ID would lose its main ability. While Touch ID in iPhones being non-repairable used to make sense for security reasons, it’s interesting to see no new development on reparability here since Apple’s new wireless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397196/magic-keyboard-touch-id-m1-mac-macbook-intel"&gt;Touch ID keyboard&lt;/a&gt; can be paired to different M1 computers.&lt;/p&gt;
