    <title>Amazon apologizes for lying about pee — and attempts to shift the blame</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FbGdDN"&gt;Amazon has issued a rare public apology — but not to its workers, and with no real admission of guilt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kyRhC"&gt;Over a week ago, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350337/amazon-peeing-in-bottles-workers-exploitation-twitter-response-evidence"&gt;was caught publicly lying&lt;/a&gt; to Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) that its workers never feel the need to pee in water bottles (which is, in fact, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles"&gt;a well-documented issue at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516004/amazon-warehouse-fulfillment-centers-productivity-firing-terminations"&gt;how it robotically tracks and fires its laborers&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1d3r9e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon denies stories of workers peeing in bottles, receives a flood of evidence in return","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350337/amazon-peeing-in-bottles-workers-exploitation-twitter-response-evidence"},{"title":"How Amazon automatically tracks and fires warehouse workers for ‘productivity’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516004/amazon-warehouse-fulfillment-centers-productivity-firing-terminations"},{"title":"Amazon keeps trying to troll US Congress members in perplexing new PR strategy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352977/amazon-twitter-feud-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-trolling-labor-pee-bottles"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gOLV7L"&gt;Now, late on the Friday evening before Easter weekend, when few (hat tip to &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-offers-rare-apology-says-will-look-solutions-drivers-peeing-bottles/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeekWire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) are paying attention, &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/our-recent-response-to-representative-pocan"&gt;the company is apologizing to Pocan&lt;/a&gt; — and no one else. Amazon only apologizes for not being “accurate” enough, too — not for actually creating and contributing to situations where workers pee in bottles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jcVfw9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The @AmazonNews account didn’t bother to tweet any of this, BTW&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qky4SW"&gt;In fact, Amazon goes so far as to suggest the whole pee bottle thing is simply a regrettable status quo, pointing out a handful of times when other companies’ delivery drivers were also caught peeing in bottles, as well as embedding a handful of random comments on Twitter that happen to support Amazon’s views. You can almost &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/3/28/22354604/amazon-twitter-bernie-sanders-jeff-bezos-union-alabama-elizabeth-warren"&gt;hear Jeff Bezos saying&lt;/a&gt; “Why aren’t these people blaming UPS and FedEx? Let’s get more people thinking about them instead.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zgr8Rb"&gt;The blog post also strongly suggests that this is only an issue for delivery drivers, not Amazon’s warehouse workers — even though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17243026/amazon-warehouse-jobs-worker-conditions-bathroom-breaks"&gt;a 2018 expose from an undercover reporter found Amazon warehouse workers were also forced to skip bathroom breaks&lt;/a&gt;, and a worker who spoke to journalists &lt;em&gt;just last week&lt;/em&gt; suggested bathroom breaks were still an issue in 2021. “You’re sitting there and you have to go take a piss, but you don’t want to rack up ‘time off task,’” &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles"&gt;she told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPG26I"&gt;Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/27/22353929/lawsuit-alleges-amazon-failed-breaks-overtime-wages"&gt;currently facing a lawsuit over missed lunch breaks&lt;/a&gt; as well. And most importantly, all of this is happening in the shadow of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;an Amazon union vote in Bessemer, Alabama&lt;/a&gt; that could help shape the future of labor in the United States, let alone at Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WszsU0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon is becoming the face of American inequality","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356321/amazon-inequality-bezos-democrats-union-sanders-fulfillment"},{"title":"Why the Amazon union vote is bigger than Amazon","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="84IQeR"&gt;Amazon’s apology to Pocan is the kind of memo that deserves to be annotated, line-by-line, partially because one of its lines is actually fairly good — “Regardless of the fact that this is industry-wide, we would like to solve it. We don’t yet know how, but will look for solutions” — but because it’s past 1AM here and it turns out &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s blockquote tool doesn’t let me embed tweets, I’ll just give you the primary guts for now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="b4NN8w"&gt;On Wednesday last week, the @amazonnews Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonnews/status/1374911222361956359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1374911222361956359%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aboutamazon.com%2Fnews%2Fpolicy-news-views%2Four-recent-response-to-representative-pocan"&gt;tweeted the following&lt;/a&gt; back to Representative Mark Pocan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWl4sK"&gt;This was an own-goal, we’re unhappy about it, and we owe an apology to Representative Pocan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ViGRDh"&gt;First, the tweet was incorrect. It did not contemplate our large driver population and instead wrongly focused only on our fulfillment centers. A typical Amazon fulfillment center has dozens of restrooms, and employees are able to step away from their work station at any time. If any employee in a fulfillment center has a different experience, we encourage them to speak to their manager and we’ll work to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xX37Ak"&gt;Second, our process was flawed. The tweet did not receive proper scrutiny. We need to hold ourselves to an extremely high accuracy bar at all times, and that is especially so when we are criticizing the comments of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTeP8L"&gt;Third, we know that drivers can and do have trouble finding restrooms because of traffic or sometimes rural routes, and this has been especially the case during Covid when many public restrooms have been closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1F47ih"&gt;This is a long-standing, industry-wide issue and is not specific to Amazon. We’ve included just a few links below that discuss the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9OVuU"&gt;Regardless of the fact that this is industry-wide, we would like to solve it. We don’t yet know how, but will look for solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOwyI7"&gt;We will continue to speak out when misrepresented, but we will also work hard to always be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwnE7T"&gt;We apologize to Representative Pocan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jKXWyB"&gt;You can read &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/our-recent-response-to-representative-pocan"&gt;the full version here&lt;/a&gt;. When you’re finished, perhaps check out &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akd54e/she-wees-and-plastic-bags-amazons-pee-scandal-is-much-worse-for-women"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;’s interview with six &lt;em&gt;female&lt;/em&gt; Amazon delivery drivers&lt;/a&gt;, for whom the pee situation is obviously much worse.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX rocket debris lands on man’s farm in Washington</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EehkYxoJlo7vCl5X0mgqOGhqNes=/0x0:840x560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69069018/thumbnail_image2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A pressure vessel from SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket was found in a man’s farm last weekend. | Grant County Sheriff’s Office&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zRcHAa"&gt;A pressure vessel from a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket stage fell on a man’s farm in Washington State last week, leaving a “4-inch dent in the soil,” the local sheriff’s office said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0bPhD"&gt;The black Composite-Overwrapped Pressure Vessel, or COPV, was a remnant from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22351956/oregon-washington-meteor-shower-explanation-spacex-falcon-9-rocket-debris"&gt;alien invasion-looking breakup&lt;/a&gt; of a Falcon 9 second stage over Oregon and Washington on March 26, local officials said. The stage reentered the atmosphere in an unusual spot in the sky after sending a payload of SpaceX’s Starlink satellites to orbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBsJEW"&gt;A Grant County, Washington property owner, who told authorities he didn’t want to be identified, found the errant COPV — roughly the size and shape of a hefty punching bag — sitting on his farm one morning last weekend. He reported it to the Grant County Sheriff’s Office, GCSO spokesman Kyle Foreman said in a phone call. A sergeant was dispatched on Monday to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JDZZOH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Of course we didn’t have a protocol for this”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ExPZa"&gt;“Neither the property owner nor our sergeant are rocket scientists, of course, but judging from what had happened a few days prior, it looked to them like it was possibly debris from the Falcon 9 reentry,” Foreman said. So the sergeant called SpaceX, which confirmed to GCSO it appeared to be their’s and dispatched employees to retrieve the COPV on Tuesday. SpaceX didn’t respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qLgkhVpWxL5bG3dj3R4bgolzuQA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22417145/image.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Grant County Sheriff’s Office&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The COPV left a neat, COPV-shaped dent in the man’s farm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DyBQQd"&gt;“Of course we didn’t have a protocol for this, so we just erred on the side of returning someone’s property to them,” Foreman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PK6E47"&gt;A COPV is a part of the Falcon 9’s second stage, the smaller section of the rocket that detaches from the main stage at the edge of space and boosts satellites farther from Earth. The COPV stores helium at pressures of nearly 6,000psi, which is used to pressurize the second stage’s large tanks of propellant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5K24iM"&gt;While most second stage parts either hang out in orbit for years or reenter Earth over the ocean, last week’s stage put on a spectacular nighttime show over populated areas in the northwestern US. And somehow from that show, a COPV ended up embedded roughly 4 inches into the property owner’s farmland, some 100 miles inward from the Pacific coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NwJFJZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Looks like something went wrong, but SpaceX has said nothing about it”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AHzdDS"&gt;Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and a keen tracker of things in space, had been keeping tabs on the second stage and said its reentry wasn’t a surprise — but the timing and location of the reentry was a head-scratcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6xnbx"&gt;“It is a bit of a puzzle that the stage was not de-orbited under control back on March 4 — looks like something went wrong, but SpaceX has said nothing about it,” McDowell said. “However, reentries of this kind happen every couple of weeks. It’s just unusual that it happens over a densely populated area, just because that’s a small fraction of the Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZ93vX"&gt;The COPV in Washington wasn’t the only piece of debris to land on US soil in recent weeks. An &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Erdayastronaut/status/1378039464266719232?s=20"&gt;absolute&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/considercosmos/status/1378076880717373443?s=20"&gt;hellstorm&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joroulette/status/1377018893965869056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1377018893965869056%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F30%2F22358060%2Fspacex-starship-prototype-fail-landing-texas"&gt;debris&lt;/a&gt; rained over SpaceX’s Boca Chica, Texas facilities on Tuesday when a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358060/spacex-starship-prototype-fail-landing-texas"&gt;Starship prototype exploded mid-air&lt;/a&gt; during its attempt to land, marking the fourth explosion of a Mars rocket prototype in a row in Elon Musk’s speedy Starship test campaign. The 16-story-tall test rocket successfully launched over six miles in the air, but its return was utterly unsuccessful and resulted in the loss of all test data from the mission.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is limiting which apps can see everything else you have installed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Frgur8nRg5A-H2eZt0Wa4HFhp3c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69068935/akrales_201012_4137_0020.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="irXDa6"&gt;Google will soon be more selective about which apps on the Play Store can see all of the other apps you have installed (via &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-is-restricting-which-apps-can-see-the-other-installed-apps-on-your-device/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;). &lt;/em&gt;As &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/new-play-store-rules-block-most-apps-from-scanning-your-entire-app-list/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;points out, your list of installed apps, innocent as it seems, can communicate to developers personal traits like dating preferences and political affiliations. So starting on May 5th, 2021, developers will have to provide a very good reason for why Google should let you access info like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0TR4ec"&gt;Android 11 apps that currently request the “QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES” permission can see the full list of apps you have stored on your device. But Google recently updated its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10446026?hl=en"&gt;Developer Program Policy&lt;/a&gt; and now considers that info to be “&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10144311?visit_id=637529906115169103-1524561010&amp;amp;rd=1"&gt;personal and sensitive user data&lt;/a&gt;,” restricting which apps are allowed to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5oi4O"&gt;Once the change goes into effect in May, apps can only use the permission if their “core user facing functionality or purpose, requires broad visibility into installed apps on the user’s device.” Examples of apps that will be permitted to continue using this permission include file managers, browsers, and antivirus apps that need the data “for awareness or interoperability purposes.” Banking apps, digital wallet apps, and any other app that involves “financial transaction functionality” will get a pass “for security based purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRT5wU"&gt;Apps that don’t have a justifiable use case for the permission risk being removed from the Google Play Store. All developers who want to keep the permission in their apps need to complete &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9214102"&gt;a declaration form&lt;/a&gt; justifying their use of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIURiv"&gt;In case you’re worried that developers could &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; misuse the permission, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10158779#zippy=%2Cinvalid-uses"&gt;Google’s documentation&lt;/a&gt; clearly states it will come down hard on offending apps, whether they’re new to the Play Store or just updates to existing apps. Google could suspend apps and possibly terminate developer accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Two Coinbase employees exchanged NFT rings with their wedding vows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mQ8FXw1hXEgHHt1gM5unnGlwoCA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69068893/acastro_210319_1777_nft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U0GroO"&gt;Two Coinbase employees have managed to find a heartwarming use for NFTs by incorporating them into their wedding, exchanging the digital tokens as part of the ceremony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQFORx"&gt;Rebecca Rose and Peter Kacherginsky &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rgoldilox/status/1378014366923071490"&gt;say that alongside their traditional Jewish ceremony&lt;/a&gt;, the couple also sent each other digital tokens as “virtual rings” to each other. In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rgoldilox/status/1378014389710712837"&gt;a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; about the wedding, Rose said that their virtual rings now exist on the blockchain “for all to see as proof of our commitment to each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RX62XV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Most people get married in a place of religious worship, on a beach, or in the mountains. Peter (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_iphelix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@_iphelix&lt;/a&gt;) and I are NOT most people. We got married on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blockchain?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#blockchain&lt;/a&gt;. 1/7 &lt;a href="https://t.co/2ExexrlLbZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2ExexrlLbZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rebecca Rose (@rgoldilox) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rgoldilox/status/1378014362896461839?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="9NQvNN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hkgybj"&gt;Normally, a wedding picture with the couple at the altar using their phones would be, to put it mildly, kind of depressing. But with the context that they’re basically exchanging rings, albeit in an untraditional way, it makes it kind of cute. It also helps that you can actually see the exchange for yourself — obviously, &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x961cf9036557e84fc4ac9526547574966293234d#events"&gt;it’s on the blockchain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGwet3"&gt;I know we rag on NFTs a lot here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but honestly, the more I dug into the nerdy details of this, the cuter it got. For example, they named the token Tabaat, the Hebrew word for “ring.” If you look up the &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x961cf9036557e84fc4ac9526547574966293234d"&gt;Tabaat token on Etherscan&lt;/a&gt;, it shows that two tokens have been minted, and no more can ever be made. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/nXNdO5ZhvhQ?t=147"&gt;How romantic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84xOUP"&gt;There’s also &lt;a href="https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPoi4HVM66QoQF59Csc6P9qJPuco6WEg1pyh4VgQXMsu3"&gt;the animation&lt;/a&gt; that the couple commissioned to add to the NFT, which is itself a pretty decent representation of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WCzgxr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The name of the token is Tabaat, the Hebrew word for ring. We stored an animation by artist Carl Johan Hasselrot (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cjhasselrot?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@cjhasselrot&lt;/a&gt;) inside the unique tokens, which illustrates two distinct things becoming one, like in marriage. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFTArt?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NFTArt&lt;/a&gt; 3/7 &lt;a href="https://t.co/5s8hLGbRdG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5s8hLGbRdG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rebecca Rose (@rgoldilox) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rgoldilox/status/1378014380646825985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WyA3zE"&gt;The charm from this story isn’t really in the technical details — most people probably wouldn’t find the blockchain all that romantic. It’s that two nerdy people found a nerdy thing they were both passionate about and worked it into an important moment in their relationship. That’s something pretty easy to love. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify leaks another look at the Car Thing, this time from within in its own app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sMwkREjXrojO9fUZsVNFwT_5WRQ=/0x0:1424x949/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69068792/carthing.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A leaked image of Spotify’s Car Thing. | Image: Spotify / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1378033575417815041" target="_blank"&gt;Steve Moser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hPKsBP"&gt;Spotify’s much-anticipated in-car gadget, a voice-controlled music player known colloquially as the Car Thing, has just shown up in a &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/02/spotify-ios-app-car-thing-images/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;handful of in-app renders unearthed by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;contributor Steve Moser&lt;/a&gt;, who found the images in Spotify’s app code. These renders match up quite closely with photographs of the real deal submitted as part of filings to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231876/spotify-car-thing-fcc-design-screen-pictures-photos"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;back in January&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4eYAZ"&gt;Thanks to these renders, we have a much cleaner look at the evolved Spotify Car Thing design, which includes a large knob on the right, a color screen, and four buttons on top. Earlier official company renders from back when the product was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/17/18628772/spotify-car-thing-audio-experience-data-premium-assistant"&gt;formally announced in 2019&lt;/a&gt; showed off a much smaller screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XiwkE"&gt;Yet, Spotify’s design has since moved much closer to a smart display style, which makes sense considering it now more closely resembles a miniature infotainment screen you’d find in a modern vehicle. These new renders show off the screen and a possible interface design, in addition to various mount designs for attaching the device to different parts of the dashboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6fGB5s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10426569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nhDUWF"&gt;There’s no telling when or even if Spotify plans to formally launch the product. The company’s February event, where it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;detailed its new Hi-Fi streaming tier&lt;/a&gt;, came and went without any new information on the Car Thing, and the device was announced in 2019 as just a test product to help Spotify better understand users’ listening habits while on the go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pL36UI"&gt;So there’s no formal product name, potential release date, or any other information indicating if this will ever make it out of Spotify’s testing lab and into a consumer’s car. But the updated design and the FCC filings — and now the in-app renders — do suggest the product may have a future. We just don’t know what it looks like right now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s next Pixels will reportedly switch to a custom in-house GS101 processor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UA39PPvobXrUsE2Dqftlu_P4UDs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69068620/akrales_201012_4137_0013.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fllf4"&gt;Google’s next Pixel flagship — the presumably named “Pixel 6” — will reportedly feature a Google-designed GS101 “Whitechapel” SoC (system on a chip), a first for the company, as reported by &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/02/pixel-6-google-gs101-whitechapel/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-6-custom-system-on-chip/#update1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rjg04Y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;’s report claims Google is working on two phones that will feature the Arm-based GS101 — presumed to be a flagship device to succeed last year’s Pixel 5 and a Pixel 4A 5G follow-up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EhhKh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;’s report, meanwhile, goes into further detail on the new SoC, claiming the GS101 chips will feature a “three cluster setup with a TPU (Tensor Processing Unit)” for machine learning applications. (For reference, Qualcomm’s own flagship &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt; uses Arm’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/26/21267893/arm-cortex-a78-mali-g78-cpu-gpu-designs-smartphones-2021-samsung-qualcomm-apple"&gt;Cortex-X1 / Cortex-A78&lt;/a&gt; / Cortex-A55 as a triple cluster CPU setup.) Additionally, the new SoC may feature an integrated security chip, similar to the Titan M. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlHZpy"&gt;The idea of Google making a custom TPU or security chip isn’t new: Google has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/26/17616140/google-edge-tpu-on-device-ai-machine-learning-devkit"&gt;previously made TPUs for servers&lt;/a&gt; and the Pixel 4’s Neural Core, along with the discrete Titan M chip on its current phones. But the custom-designed GS101 would presumably allow the company to integrate those features on a deeper level.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noJs1F"&gt;Rumors of the Whitechapel chips have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21221062/google-processor-pixels-chromebooks-whitechapel-samsung-qualcomm"&gt;circulated since last year&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-google-readies-its-own-chip-for-future-pixels-chromebooks-e5f8479e-4a38-485c-a264-9ef9cf68908c.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Google was looking to develop its own in-house chips for use in Pixel and Chromebook devices. That report claimed the company would be optimizing its chip for Google’s machine learning technology — something the &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt; report corroborates. The GS101 chip for the 2021 Pixel lineup would be the first fruits of the Whitechapel project, although &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;’ original report noted that Chromebook chips weren’t expected until further in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0sawQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;’s report also includes references to a “Slider” codename tied to the new device, which it says is also connected to Samsung’s Exynos SoCs (which the company uses on Galaxy smartphone devices outside the US). Samsung’s involvement on the manufacturing side — which &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; also reported last year — would make sense, as one of the largest manufacturers of smartphone semiconductors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZCfSoD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A Google-designed GS101 chip is an intriguing idea&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hhh5jf"&gt;The idea of Google-designed chips is a compelling one. Apple has long touted its tightly integrated software and hardware stack as a key part of how its iPhones, iPads, and now, its Mac computers are able to run so well — a key part of which is the company’s custom-designed A-series and M-series chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhO3S3"&gt;Google — and almost every other Android manufacturer, save Samsung and Huawei — doesn’t have that advantage. It instead relies on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chips, which dominate the Android marketplace in the US. Oftentimes, an Android device lives or dies on how well its manufacturer is able to synergize Qualcomm’s chips, Google’s software, and its own hardware designs. Similarly, the fact that, at their core, almost every Android device runs on the same chipset and the same software makes it difficult for any one model to stand out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJbcjC"&gt;But a Google-designed GS101 chip brings a tantalizing promise: that Google could bring an Apple-like boost in speed, performance, and battery life to Android (and specifically, its Pixel lineup) with a similar level of control over the hardware design, software, and processor. It’s an intriguing idea — assuming Google can pull it off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYiog0"&gt;That said, building a smartphone processor at the level of Apple or Qualcomm isn’t easy. While both companies use Arm as a common base, they’ve spent years refining those basic building blocks with customizations to suit their needs. Apple has been using custom designs in its processors since the 2012’s A6 design (as opposed to previous models that used licensed CPU designs from Arm itself). Qualcomm takes a similar approach in its modern processors, using custom Kryo cores that are semi-customized versions of Arm’s base Cortex designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4Pys1"&gt;It might take Google a few generations to fine-tune its Pixel chips. But if Google can actually deliver on a proper customized chip that’s built from the ground up to be specifically designed for Android’s software and the Pixel’s hardware, it could be the key to transforming the Pixel line from a sideshow to a true smartphone powerhouse.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHoW8g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest in the global semiconductor shortage</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Intel Skylake chip shots" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j123McRaN9CApLaWlFpBP0Q-VGs=/2x0:1018x677/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69068410/vs09-02_0831cxs-2.0.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From consoles to cars, it seems like everyone is having a hard time getting enough chips&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="DHYGjq"&gt;As the COVID-19 pandemic hit, demand for tech products suddenly spiked, just as it became difficult for chipmakers to know how much production capacity they actually needed. Now, anyone looking to build something with a computer chip in it has to deal with a global shortage. It’s affecting the production of everything from the obvious, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325999/gogo-5g-network-delay-chip-shortage"&gt;5G rollout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/21991081"&gt;GPUs&lt;/a&gt;, to things you wouldn’t necessarily expect, like &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/22030524"&gt;trucks and cars&lt;/a&gt;. Even large companies like Samsung are having to reevaluate plans to make sure they’ll be able to get the chips they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgaT6J"&gt;The problem has gotten so bad that US President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order"&gt;has pledged to address it&lt;/a&gt;, but industry insiders say the problem &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/22122297"&gt;will be sticking around for a while&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll be tracking the latest evolutions in policy surrounding the shortage and keeping up with the latest products affected by it right here, so stay tuned if you want to stay on top of the latest delays and changes.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Peter Kneffel/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bNwLH1"&gt;Microsoft has updated its &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fevents" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;events website&lt;/a&gt; to reveal the dates of Microsoft Build 2021. Per the new listing, the annual conference will take place from May 25th–27th this year. It will also be held &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21211721/microsoft-events-build-2021-digital-only-coronavirus-plans"&gt;virtually&lt;/a&gt;, along with many of Microsoft’s 2021 events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eoRr57"&gt;A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed the dates to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Please stay tuned for more information to come,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWvmRP"&gt;“Microsoft Build is where developers, architects, start-ups, and students learn, connect, and code together, sharing knowledge and expanding their skillset, while exploring new ways of innovating for tomorrow,” the website reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SeJx0T"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;That moment you go to confirm the dates of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MSBuild?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MSBuild&lt;/a&gt; and find this! Hey that is me!!! :) Can't wait! Let's do this!!! &lt;a href="https://t.co/bBdV9orRpz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bBdV9orRpz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Donovan Brown #BlackLivesMatter (@DonovanBrown) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DonovanBrown/status/1377739812770353157?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xZic88"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://mybuild.microsoft.com/"&gt;Build-specific website&lt;/a&gt; still includes information about Build 2020 and does not appear to have been updated with the new dates yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqyMkP"&gt;Microsoft Build 2020 was also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21163586/microsoft-build-2020-virtual-event-cancel-online-coronavirus"&gt;held remotely&lt;/a&gt;. The 48-hour event was free of charge; workshops and keynotes were live-streamed. Build is primarily targeted at developers and is often Microsoft’s opportunity to showcase upcoming changes to Windows, Office, Edge, and other services. At last year’s conference, the company exhibited its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21260005/microsoft-office-fluid-web-document-features-build"&gt;Fluid Framework&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21262060/microsoft-windows-10-launcher-powertoy-spotlight-alfred-download-build"&gt;PowerToys Run launcher&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21258697/microsoft-windows-project-reunion-win32-uwp-apps-apis-build"&gt;Project Reunion&lt;/a&gt;, among other new products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8A01AD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The biggest announcements from Microsoft Build 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21264363/microsoft-build-2020-top-news-annoucements-fluid-office-windows-reunion-edge"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9n9Tpr"&gt;The announcement comes as daily reported COVID-19 cases are &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/covid-2021-04-02"&gt;still trending upward&lt;/a&gt; in the US. About &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/coronavirus/2021/3/31/22361028/johnson-covid-vaccine-error-ruin-doses"&gt;30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the US population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine so far, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html"&gt;still recommending&lt;/a&gt; that all people avoid medium and large gatherings, regardless of vaccine status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxMlrF"&gt;“The safety of our community is a top priority,” a Microsoft spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a statement regarding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21163586/microsoft-build-2020-virtual-event-cancel-online-coronavirus"&gt;last year’s announcement&lt;/a&gt;. “We look forward to bringing together our ecosystem of developers in this new virtual format to learn, connect and code together.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="uhgtqt"&gt;The global chip shortage has been a growing concern in the tech industry (and it has even &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/22042472"&gt;grabbed the interest of the US president&lt;/a&gt;) as it starts to affect the production of more and more products, from cars to graphics cards to game consoles. For a great explanation of all the factors that have led to the shortage, you should read &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-semiconductors-chips-shortage/?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s breakdown&lt;/a&gt;. It digs into factors like pandemic-fueled demand and the small number of companies actually able to produce the chips that now power so much of our digital lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYr7eU"&gt;One of the most interesting features of the article is an interactive graphic that shows the customers and industries that make use of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which gives a great idea of the scale and potential downstream effects of the manufacturing bottleneck when one company becomes a dominant force in the consumer electronics component pipeline. You’ll probably learn something new from playing around with it — like the possibly surprising size of Texas Instruments, a company many mostly associate with calculators. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7JVkPA"&gt;The article also dives into factors that are more obscure but no less important, like lead times and inventory planning. Despite the depth, the &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;piece still manages to show the interplay between all of the global occurrences and companies involved with surprising clarity, which is why &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-semiconductors-chips-shortage/?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;it’s well worth a read&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dish is begging authorities for help with T-Mobile’s CDMA shutdown looming</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CY4Z8b"&gt;Dish Network issued a new letter to the Federal Communications Commission this week, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/dish-tmobile-network-shutdown-fcc-466e406c-db9d-4318-8cec-3579a54fdf04.html"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting the urgent situation it faces if T-Mobile moves ahead with its planned January 2022 CDMA network shutdown. “We believe that T-Mobile’s actions raise significant competition and public interest concerns,” the letter states. It would be a blow to Dish’s business, but most importantly, millions of Boost Mobile customers would feel the impact as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPWrRn"&gt;Boost Mobile, a former Sprint MVNO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632376/boost-mobile-sale-sprint-tmobile-merger-approval-promise"&gt;sold to Dish&lt;/a&gt; as part of T-Mobile’s acquisition, serves 9 million customers. According to the letter, more than half of them rely on CDMA service. Its prepaid service is an accessible alternative to contract plans for low-income customers; there’s no credit check required or even a credit card. Customers can pay for phones and service at retailers like Walmart and top them off as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y9BNlO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Boost customers may not necessarily even have an email registered with the company&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e1N4zX"&gt;It makes for an appealing service if the costs and contracts of major carrier plans are prohibitive, but it’s also what makes migrating these customers to a newer network uniquely challenging. Boost customers may not necessarily even have an email registered with the company, and those still using slower 3G CDMA devices are likely doing so not because they prefer it, but because they can’t afford a new phone. In less than a year, they’ll be forced to choose between making that purchase or losing their current cell service altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9poK8v"&gt;Bearing &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/4/10/21207520/coronavirus-deaths-economy-layoffs-inequality-covid-pandemic"&gt;disproportionate effects of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and related economic fallout, it’s likely not a great time for these customers to be shopping for a new phone. Dish also points out that the global chip shortage makes it an especially bad time to try to secure a large number of new devices for customers. Overall, the company’s letter to the FCC makes quite clear how dire the situation is in its view: “A forced migration of this scale under this accelerated time frame is simply not possible and will leave potentially millions of Boost subscribers disenfranchised and without cell service come January 1, 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w4StEr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A forced migration of this scale under this accelerated time frame is simply not possible”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BHOBXK"&gt;As part of the Sprint merger, T-Mobile agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708411/dish-tmobile-sprint-carrer-merger-assets-spectrum-boost"&gt;help set Dish up as the US’s fourth wireless carrier&lt;/a&gt;, and selling the prepaid Boost business to Dish was one step in that plan. However, in late 2020, T-Mobile notified Dish that it would be shutting down the CDMA network that many Boost customers use in early 2022, several years earlier than Dish had anticipated. It’s a move the company has been quick to call anti-competitive, both in &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/dish-chairman-calls-out-t-mobile-for-being-anticompetitive_id130387"&gt;previous communications&lt;/a&gt; and in this latest letter to the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lyXfQq"&gt;T-Mobile doesn’t see things the same way. It isn’t technically violating the agreement by doing so, and in the company’s view, it has given Dish plenty of notice. Here’s what it had to say in a statement on the matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="S0FHwM"&gt;Everything we are doing here is exactly consistent with the agreement that DISH made with us a year and a half ago, and we have been very proactive and transparent about the timing for this transition with all of our MVNOs, including DISH. We gave DISH notice in October 2020 for a January 1st 2022 transition – far more than the required 6-month contractual agreement. Our agreement with DISH is also clear that they are responsible for migrating Boost customers, just as we are responsible for migrating Sprint customers, and we are confident that DISH is already making plans to take good care of their impacted customers prior to the transition date. Given the advance notice that they received, just a small percentage of Boost customers should need to upgrade their handsets by the end of this year, and typically those customers would be supported with incentives and promotions to get their handsets upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tn11Sl"&gt;In fact, the company is taking a kind of victory lap on the anniversary of the acquisition with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Fceo-mike-sievert-merger-year-1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F2%2F22364126%2Fboost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new post on its blog&lt;/a&gt;, celebrating the 5G network it’s been able to build with Sprint’s former spectrum. Based on the tone of this latest letter to the FCC, it’s a celebratory mood that Dish certainly doesn’t share.&lt;/p&gt;
