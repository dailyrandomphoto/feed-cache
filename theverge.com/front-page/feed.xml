    <title>Apple’s rumored AR/VR headset might rely on a nearby iPhone or Mac for processing </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OJUD22"&gt;Apple’s rumored AR/VR headset is designed to rely on another device, and may have to offload more processor-heavy tasks to a connected iPhone or Mac, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-ar-vr-headset-will-need-connection-to-other-device-such-as-iphone"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apple is reportedly working on a custom chip for the headset, an SoC that’s intentionally missing capabilities found in Apple’s other processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LX3luT"&gt;While the new chip reportedly doesn’t have Apple’s neural engine, which handles AI and machine learning, it’s reportedly designed to be &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; at wirelessly sending and receiving data, and compressing/decompressing video than traditional chips, which makes sense if the headset is designed to stream data from another device rather than doing the heavy processing itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZFa7pg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A stripped-down SoC for augmented battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="difQ8f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s sources say it’s designed to be as power-efficient as possible for maximum battery life, something that both removing unused parts of the chip and streaming data from another device might help with. For wearable technology, like a watch or set of glasses, there’s always been a delicate balance between battery life and performance/capability. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/apple-watch-review"&gt;original Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; handed off many tasks to a connected iPhone, though Apple was eventually able to make its onboard processor powerful enough to handle many of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jq6vJ0"&gt;If the idea of Apple’s headset relying on a separate device sounds familiar, it might be because of &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-19/apple-team-working-on-vr-and-ar-headset-and-ar-glasses?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;this 2020 &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;, which mentioned that earlier versions of the headset were meant to work with a separate “stationary hub, which in prototype form resembled a small Mac,” until Jony Ive stepped in to say that it should be self-contained and Tim Cook sided with his design chief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEF5Cc"&gt;Ive no longer works for Apple, but that doesn’t necessarily mean Apple’s going back to a bulky or stationary hub: &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reports the AR/VR headset still has its own CPU and GPU inside, and suggests it might be able to communicate with a phone or tablet or even work in a basic stand-alone mode. Some of Apple’s devices, like the Apple Watch, can still perform basic tasks in low battery mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="H2Ab96"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Think big picture&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="suzp5N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; also reports that the device will have an “unusually large” image sensor, as big as one of the headset’s lenses, which has apparently been difficult to manufacture. It hasn’t shown up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318239/apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022-analyst-kuo"&gt;in previous leaks&lt;/a&gt;, but the publication says it’s designed to “capture high-resolution image data from a user’s surroundings for AR”.  That might come in handy considering the headset is reportedly both an AR and VR device — since it’s difficult to do VR without completely obscuring the user’s view, and difficult to do AR without the user being able to see the outside world, the image sensor could be meant to provide a view of the user’s surroundings from inside the headset — similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590794/oculus-mixed-reality-api-quest-2-development-kit-unity"&gt;Oculus’ passthrough view&lt;/a&gt;, but perhaps at higher quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRKW00"&gt;While rumors about Apple working on an augmented reality device have been around for years, the idea is still coming into focus. Noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318239/apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022-analyst-kuo"&gt;has predicted&lt;/a&gt; that we’d see a “helmet-type” headset in 2022, but &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; says that the custom chips for the headset won’t be ready for mass production for at least a year. If that’s correct, even the best-case scenario would be an extremely tight turnaround to get a product out the door by the end of 2022, though that might still be possible if the first version is aimed at developers or a very limited number of early adopters. &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; says that the sleeker glasses model could come out as soon as 2023, while Kuo predicts mid-2025. Unlike the “helmet-type” headset, the glasses device is rumored to be exclusively for AR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWxWOP"&gt;As for what the headset will actually do, Apple CEO Tim Cook has long enthused about AR and how it will “&lt;a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2017/11/the-transcript-of-todays-opening-statement-from-apples-ceo-on-fiscal-q4-2017-is-now-available.html"&gt;transform the way you work, play, connect and learn&lt;/a&gt;,” and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX9xBB_vBsc&amp;amp;t=433s"&gt;let people have “enhanced” conversations&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond that, we don’t really have a clear picture of what kind of AR/VR features or interface the company wants to implement. Without that, it’s hard to guess whether the device having to offload processing onto something else is destined to be just a quirk of early models, or a design decision that will stick around for years. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox is getting voice chat, starting first with ‘Spatial Voice’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nkVsZu65YCUCM5UZNXIMjUHZ9Tc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69811684/VRG_ILLO_4472_RobloxExplainer.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9ARDJI"&gt;Roblox is taking its first steps to introduce voice chat by opening up a feature it’s calling “Spatial Voice” to select developers in an invitation-only beta, the company announced Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqoyN8"&gt;“With Spatial Voice, Roblox creators will begin to test developing experiences where conversations can happen in a realistic way, mirroring how we listen and respond to the world around us each day,” Roblox’s chief product officer Manuel Bronstein &lt;a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/09/future-communication-metaverse/"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Based on this limited description, it sounds like Spatial Voice will attempt to reflect the way voices carry in the real world and require you to be close proximity to another player to speak to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aUVevY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Adding voice chat raises concerns about moderation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="68WCaA"&gt;Adding voice chat of any kind into &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; immediately raises concerns about how the company will moderate conversations, especially given &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21333431/roblox-over-half-of-us-kids-playing-virtual-parties-fortnite"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox’s&lt;/em&gt; massive popularity with children&lt;/a&gt;. But Roblox plans to roll out the feature slowly, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/roblox-voice-chat-spatial-audio/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, giving access first to 5,000 developers and all of them will be 13 or older. And in an interview with &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, Bronstein suggested that the company may never give access to kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrngUx"&gt;“I think we want to take it slowly and we want to learn as we go through it,” Bronstein said. “We may start, as I mentioned, with the developers. It is likely that right after that, we may go to an audience that is 13 plus and park there for a while until we understand exactly if all the pieces are falling into place before deciding if we ever open it to a younger audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwdnCy"&gt;As for moderation, Roblox will let users self-report issues. “Our community will be able to self-regulate and flag a user that is not adhering to community standards, and that user may be removed from an experience or lose speaking privileges,” Bronstein said in his blog. That could be a helpful tool to root out bad people, but it puts the onus of reporting on the users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9JKVc"&gt;Roblox is also planning a voice chat experience that will allow you to chat with your friends wherever they are in &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports. That experience sounds more like what you might be used to if you’re hanging out with your buddies on Discord, where you can be playing different games but still hang out in the same voice channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGayUt"&gt;This broader voice chat will be apparently be bolstered by Roblox’s acquisition of the chat platform Guilded, &lt;a href="https://ir.roblox.com/news/news-details/2021/Roblox-Acquires-Guilded-a-Platform-to-Connect-Gaming-Communities/default.aspx"&gt;which it acquired in August&lt;/a&gt;. “Though Roblox’s work on voice pre-dates the acquisition, Guilded will lay the groundwork for Roblox’s future voice plans,” according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPu3U1"&gt;The addition of voice chat could make &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; an even more popular place to hang out and help it better compete with other metaverse-y games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. But in taking this slow approach, Roblox seems to trying to get ahead of challenges voice chat could bring the to platform. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is reportedly planning to release an Amazon-branded TV as soon as October</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/roAyLzrOELZFJ7jj7MxY9C3TJXE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69811531/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2PqnnB"&gt;Amazon is set to release Amazon-branded TVs as soon as October in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-close-to-launching-its-own-tv-in-the-us-2021-9?utmSource=twitter&amp;amp;utmContent=referral&amp;amp;utmTerm=topbar&amp;amp;referrer=twitter"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The TVs will have Alexa, screen sizes “in the range of 55 to 75 inches,” and will be designed and manufactured by third parties such as TCL, &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; reports. The company is also developing a TV designed in-house, &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; says, but it’s unclear when that might be released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpz2RO"&gt;Amazon already has many irons in the fire with TVs — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607331/amazon-best-buy-toshiba-insignia-fire-tv-f50"&gt;partners with Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; to sell Toshiba and Insignia TVs that run Amazon’s Fire TV software, offers &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.in/AmazonBasics-139cm-inch-Ultra-Smart/dp/B087JYBBSR/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=amazonbasics%2Btv&amp;amp;qid=1609453677&amp;amp;s=electronics&amp;amp;sr=1-2&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an AmazonBasics-branded TV in India&lt;/a&gt;, and has the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289197/amazon-fire-tv-stick-2020-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Stick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17484412/amazon-fire-tv-cube-review-alexa-echo"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Cube&lt;/a&gt;, which you can hook up to your TV. But this rumored new Amazon-branded TV could indicate that the company is stepping up its television efforts to take on TV stalwarts like LG and Samsung more directly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybWQlH"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter’s Super Follows could run into an App Store problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s3RtNCTgacZO7yAvgofUL3FyLUs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69810672/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VAZkit"&gt;The launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651138/twitter-super-follow-launch-subscription-ios"&gt;Super Follows&lt;/a&gt; marked the beginning of the end for truly free content on Twitter, and the start of whatever Patreon-infused future lays ahead for the microblogging app. Supporting creators directly with monthly payments isn’t a bad thing, but as app researcher &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1433372120080261120?s=20"&gt;Jane Manchun Wong spotted on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, the way they currently work on iOS is a little weird — each Super Follow subscription is an individual App Store in-app purchase (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/02/each-twitter-super-follow-in-app-purchase/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUWukA"&gt;You can see for yourself by pulling up &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271"&gt;the App Store on an Apple device or the web&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter currently only lists 10 in-app subscriptions of various prices, each associated with Super Following an individual creator. Wong speculates only 10 are shown because the App Store isn’t designed to show as many in-app purchases as Twitter is currently offering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IvCY2nkG0JeTKAOQuHZsLp5hbCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823505/Screenshot_2021_09_02_12.23.35_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt;s Super Follow subscriptions listed as in-app purchases on the App Store.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lbsXOb"&gt;There seems to be some truth to that, and an additional problem: Apple only allows for &lt;a href="https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/devb57be10e7"&gt;“10,000 in-app purchase products” per developer account&lt;/a&gt;. Even with &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/super-follows-policy"&gt;Twitter’s eligibility requirements&lt;/a&gt; for Super Follows (among them, having 10,000 followers), it really seems like that might prove to be an issue as more people use the features, especially with the launch of other paid products like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644283/twitter-ticketed-spaces-live-audio-test"&gt;Ticketed Spaces&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22464291/twitter-blue-subscription-service-canada-australia-undo-reader-mode"&gt;Twitter Blue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srjv8c"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitch-live-game-streaming/id460177396"&gt;Other apps like Twitch&lt;/a&gt; have found ways around the in-app purchase product limits by selling subscription tokens that can be repeatedly purchased and offered to creators. Twitter tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it found setting up Super Follows this way made it easier to manage subscriptions through Apple’s existing system. “As always, we’ll listen to feedback and iterate as needed as we roll out Super Follows more broadly,” a Twitter spokesperson said in an email on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lknwcu"&gt;Whether or not Twitter’s current arrangement for Super Follows proves to be a problem depends entirely on how popular the feature ends up being. Twitter’s trying a lot of new features, but they don’t all have to necessarily stick (or make sense) to matter. Some, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;like Fleets&lt;/a&gt;— which Twitter killed off after less than a year— will effectively self-yeet due to lack of popularity anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FAA grounds Virgin Galactic’s core spaceship pending probe into Richard Branson’s flight</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WUR5G4"&gt;Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo is grounded until the Federal Aviation Administration completes and signs off on an investigation into the company’s high-profile test flight carrying Richard Branson, the agency said Thursday. During that July flight, Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo veered out of its approved airspace on its descent toward land, the FAA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7Kl0o"&gt;The company “may not return the SpaceShipTwo vehicle to flight until the FAA approves the final mishap investigation report or determines the issues related to the mishap do not affect public safety,” an FAA spokesperson said on Thursday. SpaceShipTwo, a winged suborbital space tourism plane that launches to the edge of space from a carrier aircraft, landed its crew of Branson and three company employees safely. But it wasn’t until this week — nearly two months later — that the public learned the mission wasn’t as successful as the company made it out to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GRU8e"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-red-warning-light-on-richard-bransons-space-flight"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Yorker &lt;/em&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; published on Wednesday first revealed the FAA investigation and found that the two pilots for Unity 22, the formal name for the mission, had been alerted to yellow and red warning lights during the ship’s rocket-powered ascent to space. Those lights, &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; reported, indicated the spaceship wasn’t ascending vertically enough to be able to free-glide back with enough momentum to land after reaching space. As the spaceship was returning, it veered out of its Air Traffic Control airspace, prompting an FAA investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Branson and Virgin Galactic employees celebrate the Unity 22 mission after returning from space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fgTMkr"&gt;“We take this seriously and are currently addressing the causes of the issue and determining how to prevent this from occurring on future missions,” a Virgin Galactic spokesperson said in a statement on Thursday, reiterating that the crew was never in any danger during the flight. “We have been working closely with the FAA to support a thorough review and timely resolution of this issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1atRc7"&gt;Virgin Galactic, a publicly traded space tourism company that billionaire Richard Branson founded in 2004, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652887/faa-investigating-virgin-galactic-richard-branson"&gt;said late Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that the FAA probe “has no impact on future test flights,” even as the probe remains active. FAA investigations into unexpected in-flight events, like Virgin Galactic’s, keep future flights grounded until the agency’s inquiry is complete and any potential corrections are made by the company. Virgin Galactic didn’t respond to a request for clarification on how it concluded the incomplete probe wouldn’t impact its next test flight, Unity 23, which is slated for sometime in the next month. That flight will carry three members of the Italian Air Force as the company’s first revenue-generating mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgnL0s"&gt;“The FAA is responsible for protecting the public during commercial space transportation launch and reentry operations,” the agency’s statement added, clarifying its role in spaceflight safety as Virgin Galactic &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/virgingalactic/status/1433424970223276035?s=20"&gt;started advertising Unity 23&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8DKIw"&gt;The Unity 22 mission on July 11th was one of Virgin Galactic’s most publicized and celebrated flights. It was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/17/22573791/space-tourism-industry-bezos-branson-musk-billionaire-phase"&gt;key marketing event&lt;/a&gt; to prove the company’s core spaceship is safe for paying customers to fly, and a lavish spectacle as Branson, a 71-year-old daredevil entrepreneur, fulfilled his long-held goal to get a taste of space. Branson was poised to fly on a later mission but opted to fly on Unity 22 instead shortly after rival billionaire Jeff Bezos announced he’d fly his company Blue Origin’s rocket to space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPUKEo"&gt;The mission event was filled with theatrics, some of which were misleading: A video that made it look like Branson biked to Spaceport America on the morning of his spaceflight was actually pre-recorded a week prior. “We regret the error and any confusion it may have caused,” the company &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/virgin-galactic-acknowledges-bransons-pre-launch-bike-ride-never-happened-2021-07-13/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFXVsD"&gt;And amid all the pomp and circumstance, which included a live performance from Khalid and Branson popping a bottle of champagne on stage upon returning from space, there was no mention of the aircraft’s deviation from its approved airspace, or anything about the red light warnings seen by the pilots. According to the New Yorker story, the FAA didn’t immediately get notified of the mishap by Virgin Galactic either. The company acknowledged it didn’t “initially” tell the FAA of SpaceShipTwo’s airspace deviation, and said it’s working with the FAA to update how it alerts the agency to future mishaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22B9WX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 2nd, 5:45PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds a statement from Virgin Galactic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPuCCN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch Series 7 may have new watchfaces to take advantage of bigger screens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A new Apple Watch watch face" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/myhnsQc4kRDXAiG6XP0LruvP6QE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69810488/vpavic_200929_4216_0171.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yD9iC1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s &lt;/em&gt;Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-02/apple-s-bigger-watch-will-jam-more-data-than-ever-on-your-wrist?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;shared more details Thursday&lt;/a&gt; about what to expect from the rumored &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;bigger screens&lt;/a&gt; coming to the next Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPk4uv"&gt;Gurman has &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-29/who-will-replace-tim-cook-as-the-next-ceo-of-apple-aapl-ksxiq29z"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the next watch, which he says will be called the Apple Watch Series 7, will be offered in 41mm and 45mm screen sizes. In his new article, he reiterated those sizes and added that the larger model’s screen will measure 1.9 inches diagonally, up from 1.78 inches on the bigger Series 6, and offer about 16 percent more pixels with a resolution of 396 x 484, up from 368 x 448. Both Series 7 watches will also have thinner borders around their screens, Gurman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mfR9IH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple is working on new watchfaces&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GLmiPO"&gt;Apple is also working on new watchfaces. One, called Modular Max, will apparently show the time, one small complication, and then have larger complications that “span the length of the screen stacked on top of each other below,” Gurman says. Another, which Gurman says goes by the name of Atlas and World Timer internally at Apple, “will let a user see all 24 time zones simultaneously.” One, called Continuum, will “change based on the flow of time and the current hour.” Apple is also working on new watchfaces for its Apple Watches made in partnership with Hermes and Nike. Some of these may ship with the Series 7, according to Gurman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="enV59t"&gt;As Gurman has said previously, he reiterated that the Series 7 will have a faster processor and a new case with flatter edges. However, production issues &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;reported Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; could mean the Series 7 is delayed or in short supply when it’s available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gBKZs"&gt;Apple plans to announce the new watches “as soon as this month,” Gurman says. That timeline would line up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21430844/apple-event-recap-biggest-announcements-watch-series-6-se-ipad-air"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20847477/new-apple-watch-series-5-2019-always-on-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Labor Day 2021 TV deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NhDrIiKtRgjE6OJmLVzuo_MMsyQ=/0x20:1440x980/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69810478/samsung_tv.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TajWIq"&gt;Labor Day in the US is a great opportunity to get deals on many types of tech products. Of course, we’re covering all of the best discounts across categories in our detailed guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/22652876/best-labor-day-sales-2021-tech-deals-tvs-laptops-headphones"&gt;best Labor Day sales&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ve made this post just to focus on the many 4K TV deals happening this weekend. There are deals on value-focused models that make it easy to get started right away with streaming TV and movie content, as well as TVs that have high-end features and a higher cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iv1ies"&gt;The best Labor Day deals on affordable 4K TVs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9AtFjV"&gt;TCL is usually known for TVs that come with Roku TV hardware built-in, but has started more recently to put out models that run on Android TV. Not to be confused with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22616941/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-price-specs"&gt;the even newer Google TV-equipped models&lt;/a&gt; that have a microphone built into the TV, you can get the 55-inch version of its mid-range 4-Series for $430 at Best Buy (normally $500). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vmprby"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10732342"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LYcP37"&gt;For an even bigger TV, Hisense’s A6G 4K model sells for a similar price to the TCL above, and also runs on Android TV software. This model has a 60Hz refresh rate display, but it features an auto low-latency mode for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mYBfFR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10265690"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YQEkOu"&gt;The best Labor Day deals on high-end 4K TVs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eIwSX6"&gt;Sony’s 55-inch Bravia XR LED 4K TV — which has full-array backlighting for more accurate lighting, particularly when handling darker scenes — is $1,200 at Best Buy, a cool $100 off its normal list price. This TV has a 120Hz refresh rate and one of its four HDMI ports is HDMI 2.1, supporting 4K resolution at up to 120 frames per second. And it ships with Google TV software built-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vo0aYj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10732366"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P2CHSa"&gt;For a TV that doesn’t actually look like a conventional display, check out Samsung’s Frame TV. It’s designed to look like, well, you’ve probably already guessed it. The Frame is a competent TV, though, with a 120Hz refresh rate, but its more noteworthy feature is that it can display art while in ambient mode to become more of a conversation piece than a conversation killer. Right now, the 55-inch model is available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749927639433300823#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for just shy of $1,300, its second-best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVVLmD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iLqhEk"&gt;If you want an OLED without an obscenely high price tag, a good place to start is with LG’s A1. The 55-inch version is $300 off its usual $1,600 price at Best Buy, and, unlike the pricier C1, the A1 has a 60Hz refresh rate display. That’s not a flaw if you primarily plan to watch movies or TV on your new TV, but gamers may want the 120Hz refresh rate screen in the C1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H2PdLO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10596459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0eBk5v"&gt;That said, if you have an extra $200 or so to spend, you should upgrade to the C1 for that 120Hz refresh rate. Normally $1,800, it’s currently $1,497 at Amazon and just a few dollars more at Best Buy. This is one of LG’s finest 2020 OLED models, complete with HDMI 2.1 ports that can display up to 4K resolution and 120 frames per second with some games and consoles. It’s also Nvidia G-Sync-ready, if you plan to connect it to a powerful gaming PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HCIfNh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10618444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="uG1JAH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Amazon is planning more aggressive moderation of its hosting platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-7yV1gx7ZZz0YWC8Koyhip6op5M=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69810343/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gaRVWu"&gt;Amazon is planning to expand its in-house moderation team for Amazon Web Services, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-amazon-ceo-unveils-55000-tech-jobs-first-hiring-push-under-his-watch-2021-09-01/"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Citing two sources, the report says Amazon is planning to develop a proactive threat monitoring capability within AWS, which will seek out prohibited content on AWS servers and remove it before it’s reported by users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7URF8L"&gt;Reached for comment, Amazon did not confirm or deny the accuracy of the report, but said it does not plan to pre-review content before it is posted on the platform. “As AWS continues to expand, this team (like most teams in AWS) will continue to grow,” a representative said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mYqAVa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Companies need to proactively monitor what’s on their platforms”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pKLHRK"&gt;The company has long maintained &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aup/"&gt;an Acceptable Use Policy for AWS&lt;/a&gt;, which forbids using the service for computer intrusions, spam, or the promotion of violence or other crimes. But enforcement of those terms has been largely reactive, often relying on external user reports to identify prohibited content. While the policy itself will not change, the aggressive enforcement approach will put AWS in the same category as major platforms like Facebook and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uk25oz"&gt;Terrorism researchers have previously called for a more proactive approach from hosting platforms, with &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/02/20/amazon-links-terrorist-content-tech-firms-confront-online-threat-column/2907719002/"&gt;one editorial in 2019&lt;/a&gt; calling out Amazon specifically. “Companies need to proactively monitor what’s on their platforms to be sure they are not inadvertently hosting it,” the editorial reads, “not wait for outsiders to expose it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1GhIMm"&gt;The move comes on the heels of a similar shift from Apple, which recently announced a controversial system to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;proactively scan for child abuse imagery in iCloud photos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvYkdJ"&gt;The shift toward proactive moderation is likely to inflame conservative concerns about supposed censorship on AWS, launched when Amazon abruptly discontinued Parler’s hosting after the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;refused to remove a string of violent threats&lt;/a&gt;. Parler sued Amazon in the wake of the decision, although it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310873/parler-amazon-aws-lawsuit-antitrust-hosting-free-speech"&gt;found little success in court&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwWqmy"&gt;Some aspects of that shift already appear to be underway. &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes that Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/27/amazon-isis-app-cloud/"&gt;took down an ISIS-linked website&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, following the trail from an app operated by an offshoot group that was not hosted on the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dhPQF"&gt;It’s part of a broader hiring push by CEO Andy Jassy, who had previously been in charge of AWS. Jassy plans to hire &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-amazon-ceo-unveils-55000-tech-jobs-first-hiring-push-under-his-watch-2021-09-01/"&gt;as many as 55,000 new employees in tech and corporate roles&lt;/a&gt;, including a significant expansion of the company’s satellite internet ambitions under Project Kuiper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXYF62"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6:33PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Updated with statement from Amazon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bVDJD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZtQHA8"&gt;Streamers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650578/twitch-streamers-walkout-protest-hate-raids"&gt;took a day off Twitch&lt;/a&gt; on September 1st to bring attention to the persistent hate raids that have plagued the platform in the past weeks. While skeptics panned the idea, suggesting that the walkout participants weren’t influential enough to effect significant traffic changes, according to data compiled by &lt;a href="https://gamesight.io/"&gt;Gamesight&lt;/a&gt;, a gaming analytics company, Twitch did see a drop in viewership.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S6U7hu5KeAaNwFbM3C9c3ZZ_Dbg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823468/Screen_Shot_2021_09_02_at_3.05.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gamesight.io&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lyGDrW"&gt;In this graph shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Gamesight measured the number of active channels (meaning the number of live channels) and hours watched every day for the last nine days at noon Pacific Time. According to Gamesight’s data, the number of active channels and viewer hours at 12PM PT on September 1st was at its lowest compared to the prior eight days. Here’s a breakdown of those numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UwGIyi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily Figures for Viewer Hours &amp;amp; Channels (Pacific Time)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;8/24 noon - Viewer Hours - 4,083,518 - Channels - 189,472&lt;br&gt;8/25 noon - Viewer Hours - 4,441,477 - Channels - 185,955&lt;br&gt;8/26 noon - Viewer Hours - 4,243,226 - Channels - 185,268&lt;br&gt;8/27 noon - Viewer Hours - 3,999,300 - Channels - 192,559&lt;br&gt;8/28 noon - Viewer Hours - 4,566,239 - Channels - 195,197&lt;br&gt;8/29 noon - Viewer Hours - 4,440,355 - Channels - 198,900&lt;br&gt;8/30 noon - Viewer Hours - 4,202,554 - Channels - 184,759&lt;br&gt;8/31 noon - Viewer Hours - 4,340,980 - Channels - 176,586&lt;br&gt;9/1 noon - Viewer Hours - 3,456,576 - Channels - 171,682&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4bQFKO"&gt;Looking at the raw numbers, it’s easy to see the dip. If you compare September 1st’s data with the Wednesday previous, that day had almost 1 million fewer hours watched and over 14,000 fewer live channels than just the week before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vQUfm"&gt;But there are additional factors that could have contributed to the dip. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22643215/drlupo-move-from-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusivity-deal"&gt;DrLupo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652368/timthetatman-streaming-twitch-switch-youtube-gaming"&gt;TimTheTatman&lt;/a&gt; — both popular streamers — announced they were leaving Twitch for exclusive streaming deals with YouTube Gaming. Schools in the US are back in session, and Gamescom likely inflated last week’s numbers. Another streamer data analytics team, &lt;a href="https://creatorhype.com/"&gt;CreatorHype&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://creatorhype.com/how-adayofftwitch-impacted-twitch/"&gt;took all of those parameters into account&lt;/a&gt; and still reported that Twitch’s viewership was down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwgijc"&gt;“Based on the data, #ADayOffTwitch impacted both the number of streamers and the viewership on the platform,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zachbussey"&gt;Zach Bussey&lt;/a&gt; of CreatorHype writes. “Depending on how you qualify that data, the impact might have been as low as 5 percent or potentially as high as 15 percent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2d50l"&gt;The hashtag &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23adayofftwitch&amp;amp;src=typed_query"&gt;#ADayOffTwitch&lt;/a&gt; was one of the top 10 trending hashtags for the day — a feat considering the news cycle consisted of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/09/02/nyregion/nyc-storm"&gt;Hurricane Ida battering New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/business/joe-rogan-covid-19.html"&gt;Joe Rogan’s COVID-19 diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/us/supreme-court-texas-abortion-law.html"&gt;Texas abortion battle&lt;/a&gt;. The event also garnered attention from big-time streamers like &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/hasanabi"&gt;Hasan Abi&lt;/a&gt; and press outlets like &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2021/09/01/with-a-day-off-twitch-marginalized-creators-highlight-the-plague-of-hate-raids/?sh=4ed0275d52cb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/gaming/2021/09/01/twitch-why-streamers-boycotting-platform/5680827001/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14RK85"&gt;Twitch is currently working on the hate raid problem, but there isn’t yet a timeline for when solutions will be available. In the meantime, streamers and third-party companies have created their own tools to fight back. Streamlabs, makers of some of the most popular stream management tools, used the day to &lt;a href="https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/introducing-safe-mode"&gt;announce it created Safe Mode&lt;/a&gt; — a free program that can essentially stop a hate raid in progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIKBdi"&gt;Data aside, the streamers responsible for creating and organizing the walkout feel good about what they’ve done. “To see how much this has made an impact is amazing to me,” says &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/shineypen"&gt;ShineyPen&lt;/a&gt;, the streamer who started #ADayOffTwitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ceyme"&gt;The walkout was designed to bring greater attention to the harassment disproportionately suffered by marginalized streamers and to agitate for proactive protections from Twitch. It seems, at least in part, that they’ve accomplished their goals.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fidQ3Y"&gt;“It was honestly just amazing to witness,” says &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rekitraven"&gt;RekitRaven&lt;/a&gt;, creator of the #TwitchDoBetter movement. “It felt like an awesome moment, especially when there were so many who doubted (and still doubt) what we’re trying to do in this space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ckKuiR"&gt;The organizers also know that one day of protest isn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qhGg0"&gt;“While we may not have hit Twitch in a significant way in terms of financial impact,” says &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/luciaeverblack"&gt;Lucia Everblack&lt;/a&gt;, another walkout organizer. “Our absence was absolutely felt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eX7APf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
