    <title>The LG Wing and Pixel 5 have been cleared to use coveted C-band 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The unusual LG Wing is one of only a few devices approved to use C-band 5G so far.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1M945v"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;LG Wing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; owners have something to look forward to: the Federal Communications Commission has approved these devices to use faster C-band 5G frequencies, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/lg-wing-google-pixel-5-get-a-new-future-with-c-band-access"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; tipster&lt;/a&gt;. The two phones have joined an exclusive company made up of some of the first devices approved to use the new frequencies. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt; phones and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12 lineup&lt;/a&gt; are the only others that currently offer support for these frequencies in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6RoS9N"&gt;C-band will deliver a much-needed speed boost to 5G in the US, particularly for Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T customers. Currently, their nationwide networks rely mostly on slower low-band spectrum. This swath of so-called mid-band frequencies went up for auction at the end of 2020, and &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/c-band-bidding-wraps-at-%248091b-/d/d-id/766706"&gt;US carriers bid a record $80.9 billion&lt;/a&gt; to secure blocks of spectrum for their use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xvx0Jx"&gt;These frequencies won’t be available for use until late 2021 / early 2022, but LG and Google appear to be getting ahead of the curve. With this FCC approval, the companies can offer software updates to enable the use of C-band frequencies on these specific devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MNKs3z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G: everything you need to know","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="em7U0J"&gt;As things stand now, not every 5G phone works with every kind of 5G frequency. Some devices, particularly budget models, support only low- and mid-band. Others are also compatible with high-band like Verizon’s Ultra Wideband, which the carrier indicates by selling certain models branded as “UW.” C-band will complicate things even more; manufacturers need to get FCC approval to retroactively add support to their existing devices so they can take advantage of the new spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLZ6OY"&gt;No doubt C-band will be a welcome addition to 5G networks in the US, but it’s one more thing to be aware of if you plan to buy a new phone this year. T-Mobile customers won’t need to worry as much since that carrier’s network already uses other mid-band frequencies. But if you’re on Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T and plan on hanging on to your phone for a few years, it’s worth getting a device that either supports C-band now or will in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfC8rr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z84kAx"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Audeze Penrose gaming headset nails almost everything except for comfort</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Great sound, full of features, but the fit might be a deal-breaker&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="SiQb3F"&gt;The Audeze Penrose has almost everything I want in a wireless gaming headset. Its high-end planar magnetic drivers deliver rich, balanced sound quality that’s easily superior to other models I’ve tested recently. It’s feature-packed, too, with individual volume and microphone levels, USB-C charging, a couple of options for wired connectivity (USB-C or 3.5mm), as well as support for simultaneous Bluetooth 5.0 audio connections. As a gaming headset, it’s stacked — which it should be for something that costs $299.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXjG6j"&gt;After reviewing a headset, I usually can’t wait to return to the familiar, plushy, warm-sounding cans of my own Sony WH-1000XM3, but the Penrose is a joy to listen to. Game audio sounds punchy without being over-delivered, I don’t need to blast the volume to hear subtle details, and even though this headset doesn’t have active noise cancellation, I was almost convinced it did due to a combined effort from its closed-back design and thick ear pads that yield better-than-average sound isolation. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Audeze Penrose" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0qNNz9Hrb4jtaK6kZ_hvUzPfizE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275062/cfaulkner_210128_4394_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition to 2.4GHz and Bluetooth, you can connect via USB-C or 3.5mm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8zGl9"&gt;The particular model that Audeze sent along for review is made to be compatible with PS4 and PS5 consoles and with PCs via its 2.4GHz wireless receiver. (It also works with the Nintendo Switch, even though that isn’t advertised.) It’s clad in black with blue trim to signify which family of consoles it was designed for. The company also makes an Xbox version called the Penrose X that has green trim, and that model’s unique receiver has a two-position toggle switch that lets it work with Microsoft’s proprietary wireless tech in one mode, then on PC in the other. Otherwise, it’s the same hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qgctql"&gt;There’s a caveat to all of this goodness: I didn’t find the Penrose to be comfortable to wear for even short gaming sessions. I never forgot that it was on my head because I felt squeezed the whole time, and that’s a deal-breaker for me. I should note that I have a somewhat large head, so it’s likely that people with smaller noggins won’t feel as compressed. But I imagine that its 320g weight would feel heavy on just about any noggin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pxKz7E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10315655"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uwzqb6"&gt;Other recent headsets I’ve liked, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519747/hyperx-cloud-ii-wireless-pc-gaming-headset-ps4-ps5-nintendo-switch-usbc-review-release-date-price"&gt;HyperX Cloud II Wireless&lt;/a&gt;, are 320g as well, but its weight is distributed much better. I barely notice that model on my head even after some time has passed, and that’s what I’m personally looking for in a headset. Granted, HyperX Cloud II doesn’t have hefty 100mm magnetic drivers like the Penrose does, which amounts to better sound at the expense of heavier ear cups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7DXy4"&gt;I’d give Audeze more of a pass if the Penrose was an original design, but it’s almost identical to the $399 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/14/17118960/audezes-mobius-headphones-gaming-3d-audio"&gt;Audeze Mobius&lt;/a&gt; released in 2018, which had enhanced 3D sound processing and head-tracking. (The Penrose lacks both features.) It also looks like the $299 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18171636/hyperx-cloud-orbit-gaming-headphones-planar-magnetic-price-release-date-ces-2019"&gt;HyperX Cloud Orbit released in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, which features Audeze’s planar magnetic drivers, and much of the Mobius’ design. The Penrose’s build quality is still exceptional, but I wish the company had put more focus on refining the design, particularly as it relates to comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Audeze Penrose" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BuHb_pwekMQ2d6QnzvrhmGq2I5M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275059/cfaulkner_210128_4394_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dials look easy to access, but they aren’t so simple to discern without looking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TrMLtb"&gt;As for the controls, the layout isn’t unintuitive, but some of the buttons don’t stand out enough when you’re feeling for them — specifically, the volume and mic level dials. Those are integrated into the backside of the left ear cup, and they’re raised, as opposed to being built flush into the ear cup, to make feeling for them easier (at least, that seems like the goal). Those raised hunks of plastic actually make the thin dials tough to discern and adjust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9A5xe0"&gt;Otherwise, it’s easy to take advantage of the Penrose’s main features, like being able to mute the mic with the switch on the left ear cup’s outer shell, or switching wireless modes with the multifunction button near where the detachable mic plugs in. The Penrose isn’t the only headset that lets you connect to a phone via Bluetooth while also being connected to your game console, but I think the execution here is great. If you get a call while you’re gaming, tapping the Penrose’s power button will pick up or hang up. (Careful, though: Audeze says your voice will be transmitted over both Bluetooth and wireless channels.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvOpfF"&gt;Battery life is lackluster. I’ve gotten around 10 hours of use per charge, whereas some less expensive competing models in our headset buying guide offer 30 or more hours per charge. It’s not great considering the price, but it’s not a huge issue for me since I usually leave my headset at my PC or PS5 charging overnight anyway (made easier by the reversible USB-C port).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Audeze Penrose" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G6_9U36Qf_BPATpxodGu3W0L3GQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275063/cfaulkner_210128_4394_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wireless receiver is shaped like a thumb drive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8IVNi7"&gt;It’s easy for me to recommend the Penrose based on its features and sound quality alone, but comfort plays an equally large role for me — and that’s where this headset is lacking the most. It’s a shame that the fit is so fatiguing because it’s really the only deal-breaker. Otherwise, the Penrose could be an ideal addition to any gamer’s life, especially those who want a headset that can connect to multiple devices simultaneously. Just heed the warning that, for certain head shapes and for people sensitive to wearing hefty headphones, it might not fit your head very well. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>McDonald’s is testing the ‘McPlant’ burger in Denmark and Sweden</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of a burger, french fries, and a soda in front of a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bRXM_ZTuhLLg-G9q0nnkXUolLVQ=/179x0:961x521/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68758038/McPlant_Burger.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The McPlant burger. | Image: McDonald’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FkT16B"&gt;McDonald’s new plant-based burger, which the company &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/2020/11/9/21556647/mcdonalds-plant-based-burger-is-the-mcplant-chicken-sandwich-wars-2021"&gt;announced in November&lt;/a&gt;, has debuted for a trial run in Denmark and Sweden, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/mcdonald-s-quietly-rolls-out-mcplant-burger-in-test-markets"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Dubbed the McPlant, the burger features a patty made from pea and rice proteins, which was co-developed with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564094/beyond-meat-new-burgers-plant-based-two-types-juicier-less-saturated-fat"&gt;Beyond Meat&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFfdLp"&gt;The trials began in January and will last until March 15th in Sweden and April 12th in Denmark. The McPlant’s Scandinavian success will be evaluated before potentially rolling out to other markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PI9LO"&gt;The patty is cooked on the same grill as beef burgers, so it’s not technically vegan (or vegetarian, depending on your dietary strictness). Nonetheless, a &lt;a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/se/sv-se/newsroom/article/News.Recent.mcplant.html"&gt;press release from McDonald’s Sweden&lt;/a&gt; pitches the McPlant as the latest option for “flexitarians” — people who are loosely vegetarian but still eat some meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOHuXE"&gt;McDonald’s and Beyond collaborated previously with the &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/2019/9/26/20885096/mcdonalds-beyond-meat-plant-sandwich"&gt;“P.L.T.” in Canada&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s unclear if the McPlant partnership will continue past these early trials. “While McDonald’s will source the McPlant patties for the tests through Beyond Meat, it didn’t specify the suppliers for future roll-outs,” says &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1aeoPk"&gt;The McPlant is the latest in a trend of fast food companies &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/5/28/18626859/meatless-meat-explained-vegan-impossible-burger"&gt;going in on simulated meats&lt;/a&gt;. In recent years, Burger King, Dunkin’, Starbucks, KFC, and others have all dabbled with products from either Beyond Meat or its competitor, Impossible Foods.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA is bringing back college football games without college players</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="NCAA Football 14" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c3RYwr-KYuD2UO5wPt3TxKvdUrU=/86x0:1015x619/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757817/ncaafb14_scrn_presentation_3_bmp_jpgcopy.1419979943.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NCAA Football 14&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cHNajs"&gt;After being missing in action for years, Electronic Arts announced today that it will be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTS/status/1356644353901539342?s=20"&gt;making college football video games again&lt;/a&gt;. EA is working with the Collegiate Licensing Company (CLC), a well-known licensing partner for many schools, to secure the use of over 100 teams in the FBS, including the stadiums, mascots, and uniforms used by these institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BNRLeR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;EA Sports College Football&lt;/em&gt; is currently in the works and still &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; early in its development cycle, with no launch window currently revealed yet. More importantly, &lt;em&gt;EA Sports College Football&lt;/em&gt; won’t use any real names or players’ likenesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fPBSbv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For those who never stopped believing...&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EASPORTSCollegeFootball?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#EASPORTSCollegeFootball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/2vDUYnbXEJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2vDUYnbXEJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— EA SPORTS (@EASPORTS) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTS/status/1356644353901539342?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qy0dme"&gt;&lt;em&gt;EA Sports College Football&lt;/em&gt; will be the first college football simulation game released by EA after the publisher &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/26/4774646/ea-wont-be-releasing-a-college-football-game-in-2014-after-all"&gt;canceled the series in 2013&lt;/a&gt; after former college athletes brought a class-action lawsuit against EA for the unauthorized use of their likenesses in its &lt;em&gt;NCAA Football&lt;/em&gt; titles. EA would &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/15/11242004/ncaa-football-settlement-payout-ea-sports"&gt;reach a settlement in 2016 for $40 million&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Cc3wk"&gt;The announcement of college football video games returning comes at an interesting time for sports fans. Last year, 2K announced that it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21172217/2k-nfl-video-games-madden"&gt;making NFL games again&lt;/a&gt;, with the first one slated to launch this year, but they would be non-simulation titles due to an existing partnership between EA and the NFL. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Super Bowl ad stars Michael B. Jordan as Alexa</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JdPkp97XF_-3-UUGz3SCYlR_YkY=/105x0:1523x945/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757737/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_8.32.24_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6clUfv"&gt;Amazon is no stranger to Super Bowl ads, and the company has another one ready for this year’s big game. The 2021 ad stars actor Michael B. Jordan, who you might know as Erik Killmonger from &lt;em&gt;Black Panther &lt;/em&gt;or quarterback Vince Howard from &lt;em&gt;Friday Night Lights&lt;/em&gt;, as the company’s Alexa smart assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AJqys"&gt;In the ad, a woman dreams of what it would be like if Alexa was personified as the very handsome Jordan, and she’s appropriately smitten with the AI. At one point, for example, the woman asks Alexa to dim the lights, and Jordan takes off his shirt in response. (Her partner then humorously rushes over to demand Alexa turn the lights back up.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZ8bn5"&gt;The ad is a fun twist on Super Bowl ads that use attractive women to sell something. (Some of Carl’s Jr. and GoDaddy’s infamous Super Bowl commercials come to mind.) It’s all made that much better by Jordan’s terrifying eyes, which are the unnatural glowy-blue you might recognize from the rings on an Amazon Echo device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kltatk"&gt;You can watch a 60-second version of the commercial at the top of this post. A 90-second version is embedded in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazon/status/1356595348022689799"&gt;tweet from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ukdgCZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Alexa's new body looks good.

&lt;p id="EOUV4w"&gt;This isn’t the first time Amazon has used a celebrity to impersonate Alexa in a Super Bowl ad. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/31/16954704/amazon-super-bowl-ad-alexa-cardi-b-anthony-hopkins-commerical-gordon-ramsey-rebel-wilson"&gt;The 2018 commercial&lt;/a&gt; featured the voice talents of Gordon Ramsay, Rebel Wilson, Cardi B, and Anthony Hopkins as Alexa when it “lost” its voice. And if you want to reminisce on many years of other star-studded Alexa ads from Amazon, here’s a list of the company’s past Super Bowl shorts:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You too can own a stonks figurine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yUBeDc_Jyo6EIJA81nmYcdPYZnQ=/0x0:1124x749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757567/01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y3pmU3"&gt;He’s real, he’s here, and I am so happy. &lt;a href="https://youtooz.com/products/stonks"&gt;The stonks guy is now a five-inch-tall, $30 thing you can buy&lt;/a&gt;, complete with a line graph that’s forever up 69 percent. It first debuted last July, but don’t let that stop you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTQuhV"&gt;Officially his name is Meme Man, and he’s the wonky former mascot of &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/756598251050956/photos/pb.756598251050956.-2207520000.1457643821./756599924384122/?type=3&amp;amp;theater"&gt;at least one surrealist meme page&lt;/a&gt;, though he began his life as &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/meme-man"&gt;a failed model of a human head&lt;/a&gt; over at 4chan’s 3D modeling board. Meme Man, however, has transcended his origins. You probably know him best in his banker config, confidently and wordlessly asserting that the Line Will Go Up and that numbers, by extension, can be trusted. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aajEDYims8yC2kjo8DzmVZE2tS4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275799/926e5009_c10a_48fe_b90e_fa0760f82fcd.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lbuPqt"&gt;I’m not gonna lie to you: I have never wanted anything so dumb so badly before. Possibly that’s because of the climate. A pack of wild redditors &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/melvin-capital-reddit-gamestop/index.html"&gt;nearly bankrupted at least one hedge fund last week&lt;/a&gt;; the memes (and Meme Man) were naturally omnipresent. The frenzy of posts was intoxicating, and people were hopeful that by buying GameStop stock they might change the balance of our hopelessly broken financial system. It wasn’t silly, either; hope springs eternal from the human breast, and what’s a market if not the reification of people’s hopes and desires? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPtpo2"&gt;Anyway, Youtooz, the company behind the figurine, has written an incredible backstory for their product. “On the NASDANQ ^ NDQA 0.69USD (+69%), it’s always a bull run. Standing at five inches tall, Stonks has been immortalized in vinyl form,” the company writes. “Dressed in a black tailored suit and tie, you can be sure that this investor knows what he’s talking about.” And they’re right. Who knows more about the stock market than a guy in a black suit and tie? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkvRE4"&gt;However, the situation seems a little dark, at least for today. $GME is down many, many percentage points; it looks like the frenzy is starting to calm, and that the lines are righting themselves. Things are returning to the mean. The correct lines are going up again, and the invisible hand has returned to its invisible position. (It had previously halted trading on GameStop stock in Robinhood because of that app’s liquidity crisis brought on by retail redditors.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtY26O"&gt;The stonks guy, however, holds. Because playing the market isn’t about today — it’s about tomorrow, and the day after that, and the months and weeks and years it takes for storylines about property and capital to play out. The market is about the belief in a better future for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;; investing is a fundamentally individual pursuit. The stock market is as good a place as any to place your fears and dreams about the future, though its abstraction might prevent you from looking at the world around you and wondering how everything was assigned its value. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Millions is giving away $1 million — but who’s the real winner?  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CuGOyoNIk5Xu298d6zOuPnveu6c=/0x70:1440x1030/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757496/Millions_Ticket.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z5tgeB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://millions.app/"&gt;Millions is a new startup&lt;/a&gt; with a big promise: simply pick six numbers on its website, follow the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/millions"&gt;@Millions Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, and you could win $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eYYuk"&gt;It’s not some kind of scam, either: it’s being funded by same big names, like Biz Stone (one of the co-founders of Twitter), Joey Zwillinger (an Allbirds co-founder), Dave Gilboa and Neil Blumenthal (co-founders and CEOs of Warby Parker), Jeff Raider (who helped found both Warby Parker and Harry’s), and Daniel Greenberg (who helped found the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21320127/mschf-products-jesus-shoes-puff-chicken-office-business"&gt;viral internet firm MSCHF&lt;/a&gt;) among others. And the company — whose actual team is staying anonymous for now — is going to do 10 lottery drawings for the big $1 million prize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4sAxv"&gt;It sounds too good to be true. A free million-dollar giveaway being run by an anonymous new internet startup, all for just following them on Twitter? &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WRddex1fg7_qqHbwR5D38Vi3hTk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268714/Screen_Shot_2021_01_29_at_2.50.13_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PWMEsp"&gt;Well, that’s because it sort of is: Millions isn’t promising to actually give away $1 million. It’s effectively holding a standard pick-six lottery, similar to things like the &lt;a href="https://www.powerball.com/games/home"&gt;Powerball&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.megamillions.com/how-to-play"&gt;Mega Millions&lt;/a&gt; lotteries. &lt;em&gt;If &lt;/em&gt;someone actually wins that lottery, the company will pay up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jEijp"&gt;But it turns out, that’s a big &lt;em&gt;if.&lt;/em&gt; The Millions lottery is actually &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; much&lt;/em&gt; harder to win than even the biggest real-world games because it has users pick six balls from 1-99, instead of the 1-69 or 1-70 pools that the traditional games require. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T03Cxf"&gt;It’s not a perfect analog since both Powerball and Mega Millions have players match five balls, and then also correctly guess a 1-26 or 1-25 Powerball / Mega Ball number, instead of a straight pick-six format here, but the odds speak for themselves. Winning the Powerball jackpot is about a one in 292,201,338 chance. Winning the grand prize in the Mega Millions lottery is about one in 302,575,350. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zbdRIE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Winning the $1 million jackpot in Millions is 1 in 1,120,529,256 chance&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JieTEa"&gt;Winning the $1 million jackpot in Millions? One in 1,120,529,256. Mathematically speaking, your chance of winning a major lottery (already infinitesimally small) is still nearly&lt;em&gt; three times as likely&lt;/em&gt; as winning the jackpot in Millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxlKd4"&gt;Of course, the organizers behind Millions seem well aware of this: when asked about the low chances, the Millions organizers told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the “odds of winning the Weekly Prize are slim. But hey, all it costs is a Twitter follow!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJpolo"&gt;Looking at the official rules, the $1 million prize isn’t even listed as the “grand prize” of the competition. It’s a secondary, weekly prize that the company will give out if — and only if — someone hits the over one in a billion shot of matching all six numbers in one of the 10 weekly drawings. On the off chance that multiple winners hit that number somehow, it’ll get divided up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsarvq"&gt;The “real” prize is a far more modest $10,000, which will be randomly given to one of the entrants at the end of the 10 weeks — a sizable prize, to be sure, but a far cry from $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbi8Ty"&gt;The difference, of course, is that even with Millions’ one-in-a-billion odds, it’s still free to enter. Buying a lottery ticket costs $2; entering the Millions giveaway is free — or at least, free in terms of actual money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIuBL8"&gt;So, why bother? Well, because it seems that the actual point of Millions is to build up a brand and Twitter presence for the new company. The initial $1,000,000 giveaway is just the theoretical starting point; as the site explains, “Millions builds products that give away money to people. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Millions"&gt;@Millions&lt;/a&gt; is the first of such experiences.” The company has already been giving away smaller prizes on Twitter for the past several weeks as a soft launch, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBYSri"&gt;In essence, the big Millions giveaway is just another standard lottery — but instead of buying a ticket with cash, you’re paying with a Twitter follow and your contact information, valuable data that the company can use to help build its brand and launch future products down the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gj3usn"&gt;Millions could easily parlay this first venture into hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Twitter followers, all for the low cost of $10,000. And it’s easy to imagine future lotteries that then leverage that user base down the line for other ventures that may actually make money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7ZeaJ"&gt;Of course, someone might win that $1 million prize. Millions is doing 10 drawings, one every week over the next ten weeks. Depending on how popular the service gets and how lucky everyone is, someone could actually get paid. But the odds are certainly not in anyone’s favor — except for Millions’, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram’s ‘recently deleted’ feature lets you change your mind about deleting a post</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vfP2kGzAgjMJyc1NrFLv__e5ttI=/308x0:2108x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757513/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_9.17.13_AM__1_.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9ZsiAN"&gt;Instagram is making it easier to bring back deleted posts. The company is rolling out a “recently deleted” feature in the app that’ll allow you to review content you’ve deleted, including photos, videos, reels, IGTV videos, and stories, and restore them. Instagram is positioning this feature as helpful against hacks, particularly if hackers gain control of an account and start deleting content. Starting today, users will need to confirm they’re the account owner through either text or email in order to permanently delete or restore content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFAPUG"&gt;Deleted items will stay in the folder for 30 days, and if not touched, they will automatically delete after that point. Deleted stories are the exception, however: they will only stay in the recently deleted section for 24 hours before they’re permanently removed. To access the folder, navigate to Settings &amp;gt; Account &amp;gt; Recently Deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqelnN"&gt;Clearly, Instagram wants to give people chances to keep their content before permanently removing it. The app already offers an archive, or a way to keep posts without them being publicly available, and with this feature, it’s allowing people to keep their posts as an option, even if they want to initially delete them. Instagram benefits from having more content, and thereby more data, on users. The more it can encourage people to keep their posts, the better it is for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6j79qN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction 2/2, 12:22 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story initially stated that users need to confirm they’re the account holder in order to access the feature in general, but they actually only need to do so to permanently delete or restore content. We’ve updated to reflect this change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition cuts multiplayer in favor of single-player improvements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Po-a5wtjsREc_Fob1jw3mwe1x44=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757109/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition__EDENPRIME_3840x2160.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rnEauq"&gt;When the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21518322/mass-effect-legendary-edition-original-trilogy-remaster-announced"&gt;enhanced remake&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect &lt;/em&gt;trilogy arrives, it won’t include multiplayer. According to longtime &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect &lt;/em&gt;developer Mac Walters, the team would have had to put in an immense amount of effort to bring the feature to the &lt;em&gt;Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;. “At some point we had to draw a line,” the project director said in a briefing about the game. “We’ve talked about doing the remaster for some time now, and at least at one point in time everything was on the table.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2riBX"&gt;BioWare introduced multiplayer to the final installment of the trilogy, &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3&lt;/em&gt;. Although “these aren’t insurmountable challenges,” Walters said, they would have required focus on features outside of the single-player experience: how to incorporate crossplay or what to do with people who still play &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt;’s multiplayer today. “How do we honor that, how do we bring them in, can we somehow bridge that gap,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pIcsF"&gt;When the game launched in 2012, multiplayer served a narrative purpose as well. The game’s ending is partly dependent on the player’s “galactic readiness,” a combination of factors like player choice, resources, and success in competitive matches; a high readiness level helps usher in the game’s top-tier endings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nEzPy"&gt;Speaking with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Walters said the game has been rebalanced. Not only is multiplayer removed as a factor, but players who choose to skip directly to &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3 &lt;/em&gt;without playing previous games won’t be penalized. “It is intended to get those best endings, or the higher tier endings — I won’t say which one is best or worst — but obviously playing will be easier,” he said. “We just basically took that section out and redistributed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4n6s4F"&gt;Although some players might be disappointed by the game’s missing multiplayer, Walters said that, ultimately, it came down to creating the best-possible cohesive story experience. “The overall &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; is a better representation of the original trilogy because we’re able to focus on those single-player moments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBfEa6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; will launch May 14th on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BioWare is finally improving Black character customization in Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xPHm34M9UYCjnh46wCb39zS3TUE=/559x0:3799x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757137/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition__OMNIBLADE_3840x2160.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sAMgYe"&gt;Although the &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; trilogy allowed players to create their own Shepard, the game had  limited options for making non-white characters. Environment and character director Kevin Meek told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that improving options for people of color was one of its top priorities when it came to &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming remastered collection. “If you have type 4 hair or a really dark skin tone or if that’s the Shepard you wanted to play as, you just did not really have that option in the original Mass Effect,” Meek said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWMsS7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; packages all three games with all of their corresponding DLC. Although the game won’t add new story content, it does overhaul its graphics and expand some gameplay elements to make them more modern. In returning to the series, BioWare had an opportunity to fix its shortcomings in the game’s original design. “There are certain hairstyles that just don’t work, especially for the female Shepards,” Meek said. “There was very little there that supported that at all. There was long flowing hair options, you can color it black, but those didn’t really work.” The team began by making a list of hairstyles it was missing, then working out textures. “You can’t put a really tight, really clean buzzed cut with shiny, shiny hair,” Meek said by way of example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tak0iU"&gt;In deciding which hairstyles to incorporate into a modernized game set in the future, the developers aimed for more “timeless” options. “The difference between style and fashion,” Meek said. Part of the improvements to the game’s fade hairstyles, for example, includes “sci-fi futuristic patterns” buzzed into the sides. “You don’t want to grab people’s attention, you just want it to fit within the &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect &lt;/em&gt;universe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdNDYL"&gt;In addition to new hairstyles, skin tones, and more, the game is also improving on its “iconic” FemShep — a player-voted model that didn’t appear until the trilogy’s final installment. The canon character model’s late inclusion was “really limiting” for many players. “It’s pretty unfair for the people playing as females, you go through all of these moments throughout &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt; and then you get to &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3&lt;/em&gt; and you’re just given this choice of do you want to continue with your Shepard, or do you want to switch your visuals completely,” Meek said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v94a6I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; will launch May 14th on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.&lt;/p&gt;
