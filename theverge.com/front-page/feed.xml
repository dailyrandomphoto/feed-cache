    <title>Amazon threatened with criminal probe over reported search and product discrimination</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rP8gqo"&gt;House lawmakers are giving Amazon &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__judiciary.house.gov_uploadedfiles_letter-5F-2D-5Famazon-5Fmisrepresentations-5F-2D-5F10.18.21.pdf&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=0wboxaxDvI2j3I5JR1N_op4UPS4msfrwmjVlLMwAKrc&amp;amp;m=lXKiD4YjMq3QcotpF0kJmWDE_AU13C-t2LO1MLna7t4&amp;amp;s=afDGMeUFUobGwNgRwI3fkGRTqpas0bL7kdkszLx4tHI&amp;amp;e="&gt;one last chance to correct the record&lt;/a&gt; on whether it uses seller data to copy popular third-party products and manipulate marketplace search results in light of recent reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLKVKU"&gt;In the Monday letter addressed to Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy, lawmakers called on the company to provide “exculpatory evidence” to corroborate congressional testimony that directly conflicts with recent reporting regarding the use of third-party seller data. Specifically, lawmakers called out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21347083/jeff-bezos-amazon-tech-antitrust-hearing-jayapal-questioning"&gt;Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for statements&lt;/a&gt; made in a 2020 hearing, claiming that the ecommerce giant “prohibits the use of anonymized data, if related to a single seller, when making decisions to launch private brand products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krZyj9"&gt;That claim was contradicted by a series of recent reports from &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-rigging/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/amazon-puts-its-own-brands-first-above-better-rated-products"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which found that Amazon used data from independent sellers to copy popular products and manipulate search results favoring their own house brand items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GBfYXC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“At worst, it demonstrates that they may have lied to Congress.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e21czT"&gt;“At best, this reporting confirms that Amazon’s representatives misled the Committee,” a bipartisan group of House Judiciary Committee lawmakers wrote. “At worst, it demonstrates that they may have lied to Congress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AM5Cw"&gt;Third-party sellers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21335706/antitrust-hearing-highlights-facebook-google-amazon-apple-congress-testimony"&gt;have accused Amazon of this behavior&lt;/a&gt; for years, and the company’s alleged discriminatory behavior was part of a yearslong House antitrust investigation into the company and other lawmakers last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hHvLzs"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Monday responding to the letter, an Amazon spokesperson said that the company “did not mislead the committee.” The spokesperson reiterated Amazon’s internal policy banning employees from using seller data to make private label products; the same policy Bezos mentioned in his testimony last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CpxFgG"&gt;“We investigate any allegations that this policy may have been violated and take appropriate action,” the spokesperson said. “In addition, we design our search experience to feature the items customers will want to purchase, regardless of whether they are offered by Amazon or one of our selling partners.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mL674g"&gt;The lawmakers have given Amazon until November 1st to provide additional evidence supporting these claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYMZf6"&gt;Amazon sent along additional statements specifically addressing each report from last week. Regarding &lt;em&gt;The Markup &lt;/em&gt;story, Amazon pointed out that its house brand ad placements are “clearly labeled to distinguish them from search results,” and that results are tailored to “the customer’s query, the product the customer is shopping for, and whether the customer is shopping on desktop, mobile browser, or in our app.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zs6lPq"&gt;The Amazon spokesperson also went on to say “private label products are a common retail practice, and are good for customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8CCoi"&gt;Last Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators, led by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), put out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726897/amazon-apple-google-app-stores-marketplace-antitrust-competition-klobuchar-grassley"&gt;a new bill that would prevent companies&lt;/a&gt; like Amazon, Apple, and Google from using their dominance to disadvantage their competitors. The measure, The American Choice and Innovation Online Act, was approved out of the House Judiciary Committee last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2mitjo"&gt;In response to the bill, an Amazon spokesperson said that the measure would “jeopardize” the company’s ability to run a marketplace for the third-party sellers lawmakers argue the company hurts in search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkcYv2"&gt;As of publication, the Democrat-led bill has garnered bipartisan support from Republicans like Sen. Cynthia Lummis (WY), Josh Hawley (MO), and Lindsey Graham (SC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUCCbo"&gt;Amazon did not comment on whether it plans to issue new evidence to the committee before the end of the month. In the letter, House lawmakers encouraged the company “to correct the record” while they consider whether to refer the alleged false testimony to the Justice Department “for criminal investigation” if appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6PISv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dp9cb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Apple Voice plan will be $4.99 per month</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Music Voice Plan lets you access music through Siri.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g3viTf"&gt;Apple unveiled a new Voice plan for Apple Music during its Unleashed event on Monday that will be $4.99 per month. You can use only your voice and its Siri voice assistant to access all Apple Music content across Apple devices. It will be available later this fall in 17 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eE9bgi"&gt;The plan seems in response to Amazon Music’s Echo plan that’s priced at $3.99/month, which lets you use its Alexa voice assistant to request music via an Echo or Fire TV device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxGn7V"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKKtPj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22495680"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Pro event live blog &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces third-generation AirPods for $179</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NyOewOw7VnmjT0zzEC6Im56oKuQ=/238x0:2659x1614/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011892/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_1.11.15_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M1fVSZ"&gt;Apple has just introduced its third-generation AirPods, the latest set of the company’s massively popular true wireless earbuds. With a new design that blends aspects of the prior AirPods and AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods retain a hard plastic, one-size-fits-most fit in the ear. But the form factor is seeing significant change for the first time since 2016: the new earbuds have much shorter stems than before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I4qpkZ"&gt;They’re now water and sweat resistant. Battery life has been extended to 6 hours of continuous listening; that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mLFgKo"&gt;The company is putting a big emphasis on spatial audio and Dolby Atmos music mixes with the new AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ6Tic"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14016568/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review"&gt;original AirPods&lt;/a&gt; were released in 2016 and were followed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;a second-gen pair&lt;/a&gt; that added wireless charging and other modest improvements. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; arrived in 2019 with a more traditional in-ear fit with silicone ear tips. Last year, Apple expanded the AirPods line to cover over-ear headphones for the first time with the launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;the $549 AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tbkDkL"&gt;There’s a lot riding on the latest AirPods to sustain the huge popularity of their predecessors. Above all else, the earbuds are well regarded for their ease of use and seamless integration with Apple’s ecosystem of hardware, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3CNfp"&gt;But Apple faces more competition than ever before — especially at lower price points. Aside from the latest alternatives from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, Jabra, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, Sony, and others, newer entrants like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;Nothing&lt;/a&gt; have sought to set themselves apart on design and value with starting prices around $99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYJgAq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22495680"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Pro event live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s newly launched Lucy spacecraft is having issues with one of its solar panels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lai31ZuFR6c0DyxiXnoAYhGdLGM=/0x131:3110x2204/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011705/21_00210_lucy_solar_deploy_074.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of Lucy’s solar panels fully deployed before its launch&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Lockheed Martin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k92NoU"&gt;A robotic spacecraft that NASA just launched to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22711372/nasa-lucy-mission-jupiter-trojan-asteroids-12-years-launch"&gt;explore clusters of asteroids around Jupiter&lt;/a&gt; may be in some slight trouble on its journey through space. The space probe, named Lucy, is &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/lucy/2021/10/17/lucy-spacecraft-healthy-solar-arrays-being-analyzed/"&gt;having issues with one of its two main solar panels&lt;/a&gt;, which are critical for gathering rays from the Sun and generating power for the spacecraft on its 12-year trip through the Solar System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WOopU"&gt;NASA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22729626/nasa-launches-lucy-probe-study-jupiter-trojan-asteroids"&gt;launched Lucy early in the morning on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, October 16th, on top of an Atlas V rocket from Florida. The launch was deemed a success, putting Lucy on its trajectory to reach Jupiter’s asteroids, named the Trojans, by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s7dlq4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In the current spacecraft attitude, Lucy can continue to operate.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AB4wFg"&gt;But on Sunday, NASA announced that one of Lucy’s 24-foot-wide solar panels may not be fully latched, according to an update on the agency’s website. It’s unclear what that means for the future of the mission, but NASA says the mission team is working on analyzing the problem and will come up with next steps in the days ahead. In the meantime, both of the solar arrays are producing power and charging the battery, so the latch issue does not seem to be negatively affecting Lucy at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PF_ttE2IkpWqWKyes5fTq3l-Wy8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929031/final_lucy_high_end_render_pira.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Southwest Research Institute&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of the Lucy spacecraft at a Trojan asteroid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="In1o5M"&gt;“All other subsystems are normal,” NASA says in its statement. “In the current spacecraft attitude, Lucy can continue to operate with no threat to its health and safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5BrAn"&gt;However, an improperly latched solar array might be an issue as Lucy makes its way deeper into the Solar System. The spacecraft is slated to visit seven Trojan asteroids, as well as an asteroid in the main Asteroid Belt, and it will swing by Earth up to three times to get a boost from our planet’s gravity. It’s a long road ahead, and generating power from the Sun will be absolutely vital on its journey.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Someone unboxed the Pixel 6 early and didn’t bother to turn it on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pixel 6 color choices" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-XfVzGdHxQQaqtli3WLbugSjLuk=/0x22:3170x2135/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011701/pixel_6_phones.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Pixel 6 color choices | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="auC0LN"&gt;Google’s upcoming phones have made early appearances in leaks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/14/20865699/pixel-4-xl-leaked-photos-camera-specs"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/3/17814936/google-pixel-3-xl-leak-found-in-lyft"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/3/18527905/pixel-3a-xl-best-buy-leak-6-inch-display-64gb-ram-specs-features"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/3/4691652/did-google-just-leak-the-nexus-5-kitkat-video"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/12/3493954/lg-nexus-4-full-review-leaked-ahead-of-announcement"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; again, so it’s really no surprise that someone seems to have obtained a retail-boxed Pixel 6 unit ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;the fall launch event tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iG6u53"&gt;In a video posted initially to TikTok, then deleted but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CristianDimboiu/status/1450058587091390469"&gt;still available on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, @CristianDimboiu takes a literal approach to unboxing by removing the “Sorta Seafoam” green device from its carrier without going any further. You won’t see the screen turn on or see the screen at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dxeipT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Google Pixel 6 - World First Unboxing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GooglePixel6?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GooglePixel6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6Launch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6Launch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/0z6wttnVp7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0z6wttnVp7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris DB (@CristianDimboiu) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CristianDimboiu/status/1450058587091390469?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fd2ZyY"&gt;Fortunately, Google apparently ships its new phone upside down so that you can see the camera bar at the back with multiple lenses. It also appears that this phone ships with a cable and USB-C adapter but no charger, so hopefully, new owners will have one handy. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Google’s own preview&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the Pixel 6 Pro adds a telephoto lens to the mix, but more about the hardware performance, display characteristics, and software tweaks will have to wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cmdcuV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Pixel 6: what to expect from Google’s thoroughly pre-announced phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22722823/google-pixel-6-pro-event-android-12-magic-eraser-rumors"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PFB3Oe"&gt;What we know so far about the Pixel 6 family, thanks to retailer leaks over the weekend, is that pricing may have dropped compared to the Pixel 5. If information from Target is correct, then the 128GB Pixel 6 will go on sale for $599, while the 128GB Pixel 6 Pro costs $898.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="XVXIhW"&gt;Third-party health apps that pull patient data from electronic health record systems are vulnerable to hacks, according to a &lt;a href="https://approov.io/for/playing-with-fhir/"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt;. The electronic health records themselves, which are housed at health centers and subject to the federal privacy law HIPAA, are well protected. But as soon as a patient gives permission for their data to leave the health record and head toward a third-party app — like programs that track people’s medications, for example  — it’s easy for hackers to access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qT48k"&gt;Hospitals and health care systems are a major target for hackers, and attacks have only escalated over the past few years. Patient health data is some of the &lt;a href="https://www.accountablehq.com/post/why-is-phi-valuable-to-hackers"&gt;most valuable&lt;/a&gt; information to hackers: each record can be worth hundreds of dollars on the dark web, in part because they can’t be changed easily and it’s harder to detect when the data is used fraudulently. Credit card numbers, on the other hand, can easily be changed and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;are only worth a few dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cg25hZ"&gt;For this new report sponsored by app security company Approov, cybersecurity analyst Alissa Knight checked for vulnerabilities in apps built using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard, which was set up to encourage information exchange in healthcare. She started by checking apps built within the electronic health records themselves and didn’t find weaknesses. But when she tested third-party programs that link up with health records to pull out data, she found major problems. Knight was able to access over 4 million patient and clinician records from over 25,000 providers through those holes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlbkwh"&gt;“She didn’t need to use advanced cybersecurity hacking,” John Moehrke, an interoperability expert and member of the FHIR management group, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/10/18/my-jaw-dropped-basic-security-flaws-in-third-party-apps-leave-millions-of-patient-records-at-risk/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;STAT News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “She just used basic stuff that your freshman year of cybersecurity would have stressed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zaGXO"&gt;Third-party applications and data aggregators are important for healthcare — they help doctors and patients by pulling health records into more accessible formats, or they aggregate information from different appointments into one place. The Department of Health and Human Services has rules that encourage health systems to make sure they can talk to each other electronically — it’s important to help give people access to their own health information and to help doctors coordinate care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8jjoW"&gt;But there needs to be more care and security around those applications, Knight wrote in the report. Once data leaves a health record and enters a third-party application, it isn’t covered by HIPAA, so it isn’t subject to HIPAA’s standards around data protection or on how people should be notified if their data is accessed. The Federal Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688497/ftc-health-app-privacy-transparency-data"&gt;recently clarified&lt;/a&gt; that the third-party apps do have to notify users about data breaches, but the commission can’t add on additional privacy or security regulations for those apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZCAqb"&gt;“There needs to be some separate oversight mechanism to protect patients and the apps that they use,” the new report recommended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XVnRwm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uMaAYK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s 2021 MacBook Pro event live blog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple’s event invitation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/15YLNFd7PH2RbmgL3kbAafD-J4s=/61x0:2047x1324/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011638/Screen_Shot_2021_10_14_at_9.13.21_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s event invitation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Apple says something is getting “unleashed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="95O0lC"&gt;Apple is kicking off the very best week in tech with a rare Monday event, one it’s decided to call “Unleashed.” That could refer to any number of things, but at a high level we are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/17/22725365/apple-october-macbook-event-unleashed-rumors-pro-airpods"&gt;expecting it to be about new, redesigned MacBook Pro laptops with Apple’s own processors&lt;/a&gt;. Will they be called M1X, M2, or something else? What will the GPU performance be like? Will battery life match the excellent quality of the original generation of M1 Macs? All open questions we hope to see answered today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqn21b"&gt;There should be two sizes, with 14- and 16-inch screens. There have been long-standing rumors that Apple will bring back an SD card reader slot, MagSafe for charging, and may even switch these Macs over to more advanced, Mini-LED displays. Apple is also said to be doing away with the unloved (except by a few) Touch Bar and will have a regular row of honest-to-goodness function keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LemsyG"&gt;There’s also a late-breaking rumor that Apple will put an actually good webcam inside these MacBook Pros. The disappointing webcams were really the only notable downside with the M1 MacBook Air and base-spec MacBook Pro, so that’s overdue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUoNvQ"&gt;The other side of that webcam rumor is talk that the MacBook Pros will have thinner bezels and therefore an actual notch for the webcam. That likely won’t mean it will use face unlock for unlocking the Mac — a feature many Windows computers have had for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAJy6O"&gt;What else? Tough to say! There are a handful of products that we’ve been expecting, ranging from new AirPods to updated Mac Minis — plus of course we need a final release date for macOS Monterey. We’ll be live blogging the whole event, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h8mNjQ"&gt;Apple Unleashed keynote live blog&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Disney’s latest delays include Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Thor, and Indiana Jones 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hStMa9yaMq95489p-QRdM8pjmnM=/375x0:1500x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011531/strange.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Marvel Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yns5CS"&gt;Disney has just announced delays for &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/movies/marvel-studios-theatrical-release-schedule-2022-2023?linkId=136358525"&gt;its 2022 Marvel films&lt;/a&gt;, along with the upcoming fifth Indiana Jones movie, all of which have been pushed back to later in the year or moved to 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rjtWQ"&gt;The Marvel movie shifts are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22348084/marvel-black-widow-streaming-disney-plus-theaters-strategy-wandavision"&gt;usual chain reaction delay&lt;/a&gt;: to push back one movie means pushing back all of them, so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654577/shang-chi-legend-ten-rings-theatrical-release-timing-marvel-mcu"&gt;there’s a domino effect&lt;/a&gt; in pushing everything back a bit: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gQSnp5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Marvel couldn’t wait any longer to kick off its next phase of movies and shows","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22348084/marvel-black-widow-streaming-disney-plus-theaters-strategy-wandavision"},{"title":"Shang-Chi could suffer because Marvel can’t push pause on its big story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654577/shang-chi-legend-ten-rings-theatrical-release-timing-marvel-mcu"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="IsrrsN"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt; is moving from March 25th, 2022 to May 6th (when &lt;em&gt;Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em&gt; was originally intended to be released).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="J14P9J"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em&gt;, in turn, moves from May 6th to July 8th (when &lt;em&gt;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&lt;/em&gt; was originally scheduled).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NBFfRJ"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&lt;/em&gt; is moving from July 8th to November 11th (when Captain Marvel sequel &lt;em&gt;The Marvels&lt;/em&gt; was planned for).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rDCmWw"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Marvels&lt;/em&gt; is moving from November 11th to February 17th, 2023, when &lt;em&gt;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&lt;/em&gt; was originally scheduled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nKkLWk"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&lt;/em&gt; is moving to July 28th, 2023, taking the spot of an “Untitled Marvel” movie that Disney had yet to announce. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NFMBMe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Delaying one Marvel movie means delaying all of them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oVrp2V"&gt;Other changes include Disney removing another unknown Marvel film set for release on October 6th, 2023 from its schedule entirely and a third Untitled Marvel movie getting bumped up a week from November 10th, 2023 to November 3rd. Given that Disney doesn’t announce Disney Plus release dates this far in advance, it’s hard to tell whether its 2022 tie-in streaming shows will also be delayed to keep pace with the shuffled film schedule, but it’s likely there will be some changes there, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dHbl12"&gt;Unchanged for now is the remainder of the 2021 Marvel schedule (which currently includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451091/eternals-marvel-trailer-chloe-zhao"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; on November 5th&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638877/spider-man-no-way-home-first-trailer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; on December 17th&lt;/a&gt;, and the Disney Plus series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22671358/hawkeye-first-trailer-disney-plus-christmas-jeremy-renner-hailee-steinfeld"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on November 24th). &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3&lt;/em&gt; is also keeping its May 5th, 2023 date, despite the shuffle of the rest of Marvel’s slate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DH60jK"&gt;A far more substantial delay is also coming to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375779/phoebe-waller-bridge-indiana-jones-5-harrison-ford"&gt;as-yet-untitled fifth Indiana Jones film&lt;/a&gt;, which is getting pushed back almost a year from July 29th, 2022 to June 30th, 2023, marking the latest delay for the James Mangold-directed sequel, which had originally been planned for a 2021 release. Harrison Ford is set to reprise his role as the titular character, alongside Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Mads Mikkelsen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMJMQd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/10/doctor-strange-2-thor-love-and-thunder-black-panther-wakanda-forever-release-date-changes-1234857549/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the delays don’t stem from a concern over COVID-related box office numbers or delays but rather due to the simple explanation of needing more time to finish production on some of its films, combined with the interconnected Marvel release strategy and the usual need to avoid conflicts with other studio’s blockbusters. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft execs reportedly warned Bill Gates years ago to stop emailing a female employee</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bill Gates" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cX33i_X31Ug-_krGCsdIKBD7c3A=/9x928:1820x2135/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011377/1183210445.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates | Photo by Indraneel Chowdhury/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s614Xu"&gt;Over 10 years before his departure from Microsoft’s board amid an investigation over an affair with an employee, former CEO Bill Gates was warned by two company executives about inappropriate emails between him and another woman, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-executives-told-bill-gates-to-stop-emailing-a-female-staffer-years-ago-11634559950"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dR2wt"&gt;While he was still an employee at Microsoft and serving as chairman of the board, Gates and a female employee exchanged “flirtatious” emails and propositioned the employee, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported. He was married at the time. When confronted by two company executives, Gates reportedly didn’t deny the exchanges and said he would stop the interaction. The executives informed some members of Microsoft’s board, but the board ultimately decided that since there was no physical interaction between the woman and Gates, no further action was necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YnIBvl"&gt;In response to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a spokesperson for Microsoft confirmed the accuracy of the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; report but offered no further comment. But company spokesperson Frank Shaw told the Journal that in 2008, the company was made aware of the email exchange, which happened in 2007. The employee did not make a complaint about the incident, Shaw told the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;. He described the emails as “flirtatious” but “not overtly sexual” and said Gates had discussed meeting the employee outside of work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tKTOG"&gt;A spokesperson for Gates provided a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that differs from the company’s account (and is the same as a comment provided to the &lt;em&gt;Journal)&lt;/em&gt;: “These claims are false, recycled rumors from sources who have no direct knowledge, and in some cases have significant conflicts of interest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5ilIK"&gt;In 2019, some of Microsoft’s board members &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/16/22439640/bill-gates-microsoft-board-alleged-affair-investigation"&gt;suggested that Gates should step down&lt;/a&gt; as an investigation about an alleged affair with an employee was being conducted. Gates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179214/bill-gates-steps-down-microsoft-board-philanthropy"&gt;resigned from the board in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, before the investigation was completed. The employee reportedly wrote in a letter to the board that she had a years-long sexual relationship with Gates. He and Melinda French Gates, who were married for 27 years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607200/bill-gates-melinda-french-gates-divorce-finalized-financial-assets-foundation"&gt;finalized their divorce in August&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Zoox will test its autonomous vehicles on Seattle’s rainy streets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XfbJ-uE245_Saxq7mO0cpnBOl6U=/0x0:5110x3407/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011310/Zoox_testing_its_L3_fleet_in_Seattle.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xAj4mx"&gt;Zoox, the autonomous vehicle company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304111/amazon-zoox-acquisition-self-driving-car-autonomous-vehicles-startup-robotaxi-bi-directional-vehicle"&gt;owned by Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, said it will test its vehicles on the hilly, rain-drenched streets of Seattle. The company also plans on opening an office there in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJvF07"&gt;Seattle will be the third city to host Zoox’s autonomous vehicles, after San Francisco and Las Vegas. The company said it will deploy a small number of vehicles to “get the lay of the land” before deciding how to expand its operations there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukwx82"&gt;“We’re excited to be testing in Seattle. The data we’re gathering will be invaluable for the continued development of our AI stack,” said Jesse Levinson, CTO and co-founder of Zoox, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="h98bnK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The data we’re gathering will be invaluable for the continued development of our AI stack”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0aHDfu"&gt;Zoox will use Toyota Highlander SUVs retrofitted with sensors and computer hardware to drive autonomously. The company is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173971/zoox-amazon-robotaxi-self-driving-autonomous-vehicle-ride-hailing"&gt;building its own vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, which looks like an oversized toaster on wheels, lacks typical controls like a steering wheel and pedals, and is designed to be bidirectional, meaning it can travel in either direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVSMBi"&gt;A spokesperson for the company wouldn’t disclose how many employees will be based in Seattle, but she did say that Zoox has more than 1,300 employees and a goal of creating more than 450 jobs in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRXFZI"&gt;Seattle is not a hot bed of autonomous vehicle testing, but it has seen its fair share of robot cars. Waymo, a sister company to Google and subsidiary of Alphabet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/3/10905774/google-self-driving-cars-test-kirkland-washington"&gt;tested its vehicles in Kirkland, Washington&lt;/a&gt;, a suburban area to the east of Seattle across Lake Washington. Like Zoox, Waymo cited the city’s wet conditions as ideal for testing autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaOOu7"&gt;Autonomous vehicles have experienced difficulty “seeing” in inclement weather such as rain or fog. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201117192605.htm"&gt;The car’s sensors, like cameras and lidar, can be blocked by snow, ice, or torrential downpours&lt;/a&gt;, and their ability to “read” road signs and markings can be impaired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHhGNv"&gt;“A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor, and it’s the exact same principle for our technology,” said Kai Wang, director of prediction at Zoox. “The challenges of the Seattle area will let us hone our software stack and ultimately improve the behavior of our vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;
