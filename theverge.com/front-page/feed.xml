    <title>Google updates YouTube ad targeting terms to remove hate speech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qB9Un6kPoAhiCH1f6exVnFZymcY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69102249/acastro_180806_1777_youtube_cancel_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fipdk5"&gt;Google says it has blocked several terms associated with hate speech from being used as ad keywords on YouTube videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxd96b"&gt;The move follows a &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2021/04/09/google-blocks-advertisers-from-targeting-black-lives-matter-youtube-videos"&gt;report by &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which found that advertisers could search for terms like “white lives matter” and “white power” when deciding where to place ads on YouTube: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6y5Psj"&gt;Google offered advertisers hundreds of millions of choices for YouTube videos and channels related to White supremacist and other hate terms when we began our investigation, including “all lives matter”—a phrase frequently used as a dismissive rejoinder to Black Lives Matter—and “White lives matter”—which the Southern Poverty Law Center &lt;a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/white-lives-matter"&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt; as both a neo-Nazi group and “a racist response to the civil rights movement Black Lives Matter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Hl5ici"&gt;At the same time, &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; found, Google was blocking advertisers from using terms such as “Black Lives Matter” to find videos and channels to run ads against. After &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; reached out to YouTube parent company Google for comment, it says the company actually &lt;a href="https://github.com/the-markup/investigation-youtube-ad-placements"&gt;blocked more racial and social justice terms&lt;/a&gt;, including “Black excellence” and “civil rights.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6S0Nw0"&gt;“We take the issue of hate and harassment very seriously and condemn it in the strongest terms possible,” a Google spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Though no ads ever ran against this content on YouTube, because our multi-layered enforcement strategy worked during this investigation, we fully acknowledge that the terms identified are offensive and harmful and should not have been searchable. Our teams have addressed the issue and blocked terms that violate our enforcement policies. We will continue to be vigilant in this regard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HFEFOQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We fully acknowledge that the terms identified are offensive and harmful and should not have been searchable”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rNAm0T"&gt;YouTube says it has several layers of protection in place to prevent offensive or harmful ads from running on its platform, and that it regularly removes videos containing hate speech. Last year, the company says it blocked or removed more than 867 million ads for trying to evade its detection systems and more than 3 billion bad ads in total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2Zp4h"&gt;Google says it does not publicly disclose how it develops its enforcement tools, so that so-called bad actors can’t circumvent its rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnONCO"&gt;YouTube has battled hate speech on its platform for several years, with mixed results. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18652576/youtube-supremacist-content-ban-borderline-extremist-terms-of-service"&gt;2019, it banned white supremacist content&lt;/a&gt;, and the company said it would restrict channels from monetizing videos that “repeatedly brush up against our hate speech policies,” preventing them from running ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vwVWJ2"&gt;In a blog post last June, &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/susan-wojcicki-my-mid-year-update-youtube-community"&gt;YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said&lt;/a&gt; the company’s hate speech policy “specifically bans videos alleging that a group is superior based on qualities like race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some Pixel 5 users can’t stream Netflix in HD because of a DRM issue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Pixel 5 (top) and the Pixel 4A 5G (bottom)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8-yq88lH2Qwde1dLphBc_pGpceo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69102063/akrales_201012_4137_0010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VAzoNH"&gt;Some Pixel 5 owners are &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/ml5l9w/widevine_changed_to_l3_after_april_updatepixel_4a/"&gt;apparently experiencing a bug&lt;/a&gt; with Google’s Widevine DRM platform that’s causing their phones to only play back Netflix videos in standard definition, instead of the usual HD and HDR10 quality that they should be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99e0Q1"&gt;Google is aware of the issue and is working on a firmware fix, but it still has to test and verify it so it’s not clear when it will be released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5if2hY"&gt;The issue, while not widespread, appears to be causing afflicted Pixel 5 devices to be downgraded to Widevine’s L3 status, instead of the usual Widevine L1 (which is what authenticates to allow for HD and HDR playback for Netflix, among other things). &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/06/pixel-widevine-l3/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; speculates&lt;/a&gt; that the issue appears to have been exacerbated by the recent April security update for the phone, although its not clear if the two are actually linked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOdrlT"&gt;Widevine is Google’s DRM service, which is used by a variety of premium streaming companies, including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney Plus, and Google Play Movies. Content is secured using a three-level system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mstutl"&gt;L1 is the most secure and ensures that all content processing and cryptography is handled within a trusted execution environment on the device’s processor. L2 devices only execute cryptography operations within that secure environment, while L3 devices don’t do any content processing or cryptography operations in a secure area of the chipset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZrn2O"&gt;Generally, in order to ensure that streamed content doesn’t get stolen, companies mandate that higher-quality HD, HDR, and 4K versions of movies and shows be limited to the more secure L1 devices. Google’s Pixel phones &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be L1-rated devices, but the aforementioned issue seems to be causing them to register as L3 hardware instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFJUNl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hans Zimmer’s ringtone for the Oppo Find X3 Pro is fit for a Hollywood score</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/THmENA15zQgYr6Suy6yWuuqijtk=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69101935/Hans_Zimmer_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Oppo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2JrrWE"&gt;Hans Zimmer, the legendary composer of &lt;em&gt;The Lion King&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt;, and other iconic soundtracks, has brought his epic compositions to a new audio medium: phone sounds. Yes, Hans Zimmer created a ringtone and other phone sounds for Oppo’s newest flagship, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22324860/oppo-find-x3-pro-flagship-announced-10-bit-microlens-specs"&gt;the Find X3 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGZoV7"&gt;The fact that Zimmer made these ringtones isn’t news. Oppo made a big deal about his involvement in March, posting a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaQEEHooI64"&gt;video interview with him&lt;/a&gt; and an entire song &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK2oi-JWoss"&gt;he composed just for Oppo&lt;/a&gt; (called “Colourful Future,” if you were wondering) on its YouTube channel. But these videos didn’t have what I wanted to hear: the actual Zimmer-composed sounds by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTXRKX"&gt;So I asked an Oppo PR rep if they could send the tones my way, and they did. Now, I can’t stop listening to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaK2xZ"&gt;I’ve embedded them in this post so you can hear them, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NySR4b"&gt;Ringtone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbvxaP"&gt;Here is the Zimmer-made ringtone — it’s beautiful. As my colleague Ian Carlos Campbell said, “Does he want me to cry every time the phone rings?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A5X1yc"&gt;&lt;audio controls="" style="width: 100%;"&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430221/RINGTONE_____.mp3"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430221/RINGTONE_____.mp3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(File opens a new window)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4rOzB5"&gt;“I want the ringtone to open a door that says there is the possibility to feel something,” Zimmer said about the ringtone in Oppo’s video interview. It worked, Hans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W9WW9Q"&gt;Alarm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5mC3nL"&gt;Here’s the Zimmer-composed alarm tone. It sounds like waking up to a beach sunrise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WqkLMo"&gt;&lt;audio controls="" style="width: 100%;"&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430219/ALARM___.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430219/ALARM___.mp3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(File opens a new window)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="860BgG"&gt;Text tone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="khPUjq"&gt;Here’s the charming text tone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OCC8Mf"&gt;&lt;audio controls="" style="width: 100%;"&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430220/NOTIFICATION____.mp3"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430220/NOTIFICATION____.mp3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(File opens a new window)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JfOsLu"&gt;Notification sound&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="z1JG7s"&gt;And here’s a generic notification sound, which I’d like all of my apps to use from now on, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0KMtwh"&gt;&lt;audio controls="" style="width: 100%;"&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430222/TEXT___.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430222/TEXT___.mp3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(File opens a new window)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bfe0Gb"&gt;These are so good that now I’m hoping Google or Apple will work with Zimmer to refresh their phone sounds next. (Just imagine Zimmer’s take on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTcXZqIZxbA"&gt;iPhone’s classic Marimba ringtone&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phTDXT"&gt;I also recommend you watch Zimmer’s full interview &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaQEEHooI64"&gt;on Oppo’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, where he describes how he hears colors. Honestly, I believe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8L4zdS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LaQEEHooI64?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>HP’s Chromebook x360 14c is getting 11th Gen Intel processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HP Chromebook x360 14c in tablet mode on a black background. The screen displays sand dunes from above." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bFpZ_xlMBREZMNOU6czIUBR3BZs=/0x152:1650x1252/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69101864/HP_Chromebook_x360_14c_Tablet.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7Hsyge"&gt;HP has announced an update to its Chromebook x360 14c, its premium convertible Chromebook aimed at students and remote workers: the laptop now includes Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors. Configurations start at $649.99 and will be available for purchase &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?prodsku=6458047&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-14-2-in-1-touchscreen-chromebook-intel-core-i3-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-mineral-silver%2F6458047.p%3Floc%3DHP_6458047_PR%26ref%3D186%26skuId%3D6458047&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMuPUa"&gt;You can configure the 14c with up to a Core i5, as well as 256GB of PCIe SSD storage. It also comes with a 1920 x 1080 touch display, a 720p HD camera with a privacy switch, a backlit keyboard, and a fingerprint reader. HP hasn’t yet provided prices for the higher-spec models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Chromebook x360 14c seen from the back, angled to the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/03yOJ9ZRwODcdTzWtaJEV8K5H7I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22432308/HP_Chromebook_x360_14c_RearLeft.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oGK0Ke"&gt;While $649.99 is a low price as laptops go, the Chromebook x360 14c will sit toward the premium end of the Chromebook market — it features some of the more powerful processors, nicer displays, and better port selections that you can find in a Chromebook. In fact, the device is one of our top picks for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; you can buy. &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/hp-chromebook-x360-14c"&gt;Reviewers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/hp-chromebook-x360-14c-review"&gt;praised&lt;/a&gt; the laptop for its high-quality design, excellent keyboard, and solid audio. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hitman’s best feature, the Elusive Target, has arrived in Hitman 3</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dbtFlJJV9o4eh16VpRXZAkTIc0c=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69101773/ET_BBLOG.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: IO Interactive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RmFCyG"&gt;Fans of &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt;’s excellent Elusive Target missions will be happy to hear that the first of these made for a &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt; level &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hitman/status/1380520882150416384"&gt;is now live&lt;/a&gt;. The mission tasks you with hunting down “The Collector,” aka Kody Haynes, in the game’s Dartmoor map. The mission is live for 10 days starting today. It’s not the first Elusive Target to have released since &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt; came out (there was a legacy mission set in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hitman/status/1365345892283293699"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hitman 1&lt;/em&gt;’s Sapienza map&lt;/a&gt;, for instance), but it’s the first available for one of the third game’s new levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2SC65a"&gt;For those who might be unaware of &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt;’s Elusive Targets, they’re some of the funnest missions the game has to offer. Ever since the 2016 &lt;em&gt;Hitman &lt;/em&gt;reboot, developer IO Interactive has regularly added new missions as time-limited events to its games. You get a certain number of days to complete the mission, and once it’s gone, it’s gone. You also only get one shot — so players (read: me) can’t rely on their usual trial-and-error tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="d4SUj9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;HITMAN 3's first Elusive Target arrives TODAY! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take on the ultimate Hitman challenge and take down this unique, time-limited target in Dartmoor. Make your shots count, there are no second chances. The Collector will be available in HITMAN 3 for 10 days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck! &lt;a href="https://t.co/uSsqdNeH7a"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uSsqdNeH7a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— HITMAN 3 (@Hitman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hitman/status/1380520882150416384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HcP8BX"&gt;This time around, IO Interactive deserves kudos for coming up with a truly bizarre character for you to assassinate. Yes, he’s an art collector, but he’s also an art collector who went into hiding after embezzling money from his wife’s family’s fast-food empire (?) and insists on murdering any and all previous owners of the artwork he collects (?!). If ever a fictional character deserved to die, it’s definitely this bozo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNw2pE"&gt;The Collector joins a host of colorful Elusive Targets that IO has politely requested that its players murder. Perhaps most notably, &lt;em&gt;Hitman 2&lt;/em&gt;’s first such target was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/26/18026612/hitman-2-sean-bean-elusive-target-interview"&gt;played by none other than Sean Bean&lt;/a&gt;. “The player can kill me any way they want,” the famously death-prone actor told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview, “I don’t know what to say about that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFHBkt"&gt;After The Collector, &lt;em&gt;Hitman’s &lt;/em&gt;next Elusive Target will be The Politician, which will be available in &lt;em&gt;Hitman 2&lt;/em&gt;’s Hawke’s Bay level starting on April 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s ad delivery system still has gender bias, new study finds</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vxiynI"&gt;An audit by researchers at the University of Southern California &lt;a href="https://ant.isi.edu/datasets/addelivery/"&gt;found that Facebook’s ad delivery system&lt;/a&gt; discriminates against women, showing them different ads than it shows to men and excluding women from seeing some ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmT5H2"&gt;“Facebook’s ad delivery can result in skew of job ad delivery by gender beyond what can be legally justified by possible differences in qualifications,” the researchers wrote in their report, “thus strengthening the previously raised arguments that Facebook’s ad delivery algorithms may be in violation of anti-discrimination laws.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cnkcm"&gt;The team of researchers bought ads on Facebook for delivery driver job listings that had similar qualification requirements but for different companies. The ads did not specify a specific demographic. One was an ad for Domino’s pizza delivery drivers, the other for Instacart drivers. According to the researchers, Instacart has more female drivers but Domino’s has more male drivers. Sure enough, the study found that Facebook targeted the Instacart delivery job to more women and the Domino’s delivery job to more men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0kdkT"&gt;The researchers conducted a similar experiment on LinkedIn, where they found the platform’s algorithm showed the Domino’s listing to as many women as it showed the Instacart ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PqEqoF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This isn’t the first time research has found Facebook’s ad targeting system to be discriminating against some users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kxcZxz"&gt;Two other pairs of similar job listings the researchers tested on Facebook revealed similar findings: a listing for a software engineer at Nvidia and a job for a car salesperson were shown to more men, and a Netflix software engineer job and jewelry sales associate listing were shown to more women. Whether that means the algorithm had figured out each job’s current demographic when it targeted the ads is not clear since Facebook is tight-lipped about how its ad delivery works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vrc8g"&gt;“Our system takes into account many signals to try and serve people ads they will be most interested in, but we understand the concerns raised in the report,” Facebook spokesperson Tom Channick said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We’ve taken meaningful steps to address issues of discrimination in ads and have teams working on ads fairness today. We’re continuing to work closely with the civil rights community, regulators, and academics on these important matters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDHDct"&gt;This isn’t the first time research has found Facebook’s ad targeting system to be discriminating against some users, however. A &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race"&gt;2016 investigation by &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that Facebook’s “ethnic affinities” tool could be used to exclude Black or Hispanic users from seeing specific ads. If such ads were for housing or job opportunities, the targeting could have been considered in violation of federal law. Facebook said in response it would bolster its anti-discrimination efforts, but &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-advertising-discrimination-housing-race-sex-national-origin"&gt;a second &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 found the same problems existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSlM0r"&gt;And in 2019, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development &lt;a href="https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/Main/documents/HUD_v_Facebook.pdf"&gt;filed charges&lt;/a&gt; against Facebook for housing discrimination, after finding there was reasonable cause to believe Facebook had served ads in violation of the Fair Housing Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLln3v"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/Main/documents/HUD_v_Facebook.pdf"&gt;HUD said in a complaint&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook’s targeting tools were reminiscent of redlining practices, as it allowed ads to exclude men or women from seeing particular ads, as well as a map tool “to exclude people who live in a specified area from seeing an ad by drawing a red line around that area,” according to the complaint. Facebook settled the lawsuit and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18273018/facebook-housing-ads-jobs-discrimination-settlement"&gt;said in 2019 it had dropped&lt;/a&gt; ad targeting options for housing and job ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnylCV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated April 9th 11:53AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from Facebook spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airlines ground some 737 Max airplanes after Boeing discovers new problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-AVIATION-BOEING" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mSKtUshgJOCvsTkZBDvOzZVI8BI=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69101513/1229675092.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d9cZqR"&gt;Boeing has &lt;a href="https://boeing.mediaroom.com/news-releases-statements?item=130847"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; that airlines temporarily take the 737 Max out of service because of an issue with the plane’s electrical systems. It’s the latest in a now very long line of problems that have cropped up with this particular plane since two of them crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. But it’s the first to ground the plane since the Federal Aviation Administration approved its return and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165956/boeing-737-max-flight-brazil-gol-airlines"&gt;it went back into service late last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFon1x"&gt;The new problem has to do with whether there is “a sufficient ground path” for a particular component of the plane’s electrical power system, according to Boeing. Southwest Airlines, which is the most dependent in the US on the 737 Max, has already grounded 30 of the planes, while American Airlines has pulled 17 and United Airlines has pulled 16, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-boeing-737max-electrical-problem-idUSKBN2BW1EE?taid=607041c87cca5200012b62c6&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This all comes as air travel is rebounding in a big way in the US, thanks to a dramatic increase in vaccinations against the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7h6EWZ"&gt;That’s a different issue from the one that led to the two fatal crashes, which involved Boeing installing a piece of safety software &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18518176/boeing-737-max-crash-problems-human-error-mcas-faa"&gt;that it didn’t tell pilots or the government about&lt;/a&gt; as part of a rush to bring the plane to market. But it’s not the only one to come to light since those crashes. Boeing previously found &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/84be1490f98bbefca9e8efa7b05ccff2"&gt;debris in the fuel tanks of 737 Max aircraft&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hyDI0"&gt;The FAA — which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189609/faa-boeing-737-max-senate-report-coverup-tests-whistleblowers"&gt;accused in December by a Senate investigation&lt;/a&gt; of working with Boeing to manipulate tests during the recertification process of the 737 Max — said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FAANews/status/1380511841860866048"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that it “will ensure the issue is addressed.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon workers vote down Alabama union campaign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-IT-POLITICS-LABOR-AMAZON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gRb00DespYht6eGD8N_5QVlkFNw=/0x0:5154x3436/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69101469/1232001976.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cjuZM3"&gt;Amazon employees at a Bessemer, Alabama warehouse have voted against unionizing the facility’s roughly 5,800-person workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Nc7E0"&gt;The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) announced that out of 3,041 potentially valid votes, 1,798 workers at the BHM1 fulfillment center had voted against joining a union, while 738 workers voted in favor. (The union had previously reported collecting a total of 3,215 ballots.) The eligibility for 505 ballots was contested, mostly by Amazon; because more than half the total votes opposed unionization, these challenged ballots were not opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzIxqv"&gt;Workers voted in February and March by mail over whether to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), a possibility Amazon fought with anti-union meetings and other aggressive measures. BHM1 is only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;the second US Amazon facility&lt;/a&gt; to hold a union vote, following a far smaller group of warehouse technicians in Delaware. If workers had approved the union, it would have become the largest group to gain representation in a single NLRB election since 1991.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tADUKD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s the second Amazon facility union vote in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e9sjNW"&gt;The RWDSU says it will appeal the election, requesting a hearing on whether the election results should be set aside. “We won’t let Amazon’s lies, deception and illegal activities go unchallenged, which is why we are formally filing charges against all of the egregious and blatantly illegal actions taken by Amazon during the union vote,” RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum said in a statement on Friday. “We demand a comprehensive investigation over Amazon’s behavior in corrupting this election.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ITd7fG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;1/2 Thank you to employees at our BHM1 fulfillment center in Alabama for participating in the election. There’s been a lot of noise over the past few months, and we’re glad that your collective voices were finally heard.&lt;/p&gt;— Amazon News (@amazonnews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonnews/status/1380559192969289732?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gCJO8K"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonnews/status/1380559192969289732"&gt;tweeted in support&lt;/a&gt; of employees who had voted against the union. “It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true,” it said &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/the-election-in-bessemer?utm_source=social&amp;amp;utm_medium=tw&amp;amp;utm_term=amznnews&amp;amp;utm_content=bessemer_election"&gt;in a news release&lt;/a&gt;. “Amazon didn’t win — our employees made the choice to vote against joining a union.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a826eP"&gt;Amazon has long resisted unionization and waged an aggressive campaign in Bessemer. The company brought in expensive anti-union consultants and held so-called “captive audience” meetings, which are mandatory workplace lectures where unions are presented in a negative light. Amazon ran a multi-pronged anti-union ad campaign, including Facebook ads, warehouse banners, signs in the break rooms and restrooms, mailers, and a constant barrage of text messages to workers. Supervisors frequently took workers aside to have one-on-one meetings encouraging workers to vote “no.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sAeTw"&gt;These tactics are generally legal under US labor law, which significantly advantages employers. While Amazon enjoyed unfettered access to employees at the fulfillment center, organizers weren’t allowed inside and instead had to campaign in the parking lot, canvassing employees as they left. During the campaign, Amazon had the county change the timing on a traffic light leaving the warehouse parking lot, a measure the company said was taken to reduce congestion but which organizers say made their work harder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mtLzEB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our system is broken”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UCFF6j"&gt;One possible tactic the union could contest is Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/08/amazon-bessemer-mailbox-union/"&gt;push to have a mailbox installed&lt;/a&gt; at the warehouse site. Documents obtained by the union through a records request revealed Amazon urged the U.S. Postal Service to install the dropbox as the voting process began. The NLRB had previously struck down Amazon’s request to host in-person voting at the warehouse, saying that in addition to presenting a COVID-19 risk, it would create the impression the company had a role in the election. Amazon has said the mailbox was intended to make voting easier, but the union says it had the potential to intimidate workers and that its instructions to have workers submit their ballots to it constituted improper ballot harvesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6K5307"&gt;Amazon workers outside BHM1 have carried out more informal activism, including during the coronavirus pandemic, when employees claimed that Amazon had failed to reveal COVID-19 cases and provide adequate protective measures. In complaints obtained by news outlets, the NLRB determined that Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345094/amazon-queens-warehouse-workers-labor-law-covid-19"&gt;illegally retaliated&lt;/a&gt; against some of these workers. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/technology/amazon-nlrb-activist-workers.html"&gt;The NLRB also found&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon acted illegally in firing two workers who pushed it to address its climate impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UiZrLa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 9th, 11:30AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated vote count and added statement from RWDSU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMStf9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 9th, 12:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated vote count with final numbers from the NLRB.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IoLUYv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 9th, 12:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from Amazon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How tech companies are ignoring the pandemic’s mental health crisis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_JQ_nj_cRwYCtCJvB0Vs0wZ_SD8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69101374/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vMX2Ka"&gt;There is plenty that scientists don’t understand about the long-term effects of COVID-19 on society. But a year in, at least one thing seems clear: the pandemic has been terrible for our collective mental health — and a surprising number of tech platforms seem to have given the issue very little thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmyD6R"&gt;First, the numbers. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; reported that the number of adults in the United Kingdom showing symptoms of depression had nearly doubled from March to June of last year, to 19 percent. In the United States, 11 percent of adults reported feeling depressed between January and June 2019; by December 2020, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-021-00175-z&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F9%2F22375409%2Fmental-health-crisis-tech-companies-self-harm-platform-policy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that number had nearly quadrupled, to 42 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="MM9kSR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:831613"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Y0gJ3"&gt;Prolonged isolation created by lockdowns has been linked to disruptions in sleep, increased drug and alcohol use, and weight gain, among other symptoms. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/04/07/biden-says-suicides-are-up-because-covid-that-may-not-have-happened/"&gt;Preliminary data about suicides in 2020 is mixed&lt;/a&gt;, but the number of drug overdoses soared, and experts believe many were likely intentional. Even before the pandemic, Glenn Kessler reports at &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, “suicide rates had increased in the United States every year since 1999, for a gain of 35 percent over two decades.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wP7Rmb"&gt;Issues related to suicide and self-harm touch nearly every digital platform in some way. The internet is increasingly where people search, discuss, and seek support for mental health issues. But according to new research from the Stanford Internet Observatory, in many cases, platforms have no policies related to discussion of self-harm or suicide at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nlwzj"&gt;In “&lt;a href="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/self-harm-policies-report"&gt;Self-Harm Policies and Internet Platforms&lt;/a&gt;,” the authors surveyed 39 online platforms to understand their approach to these issues. They analyzed search engines, social networks, performance-oriented platforms like TikTok, gaming platforms, dating apps, and messaging apps. Some platforms have developed robust policies to cover the nuances of these issues. Many, though, have ignored them altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpOgpU"&gt;“There is vast unevenness in the comprehensiveness of public-facing policies,” write Shelby Perkins, Elena Cryst, and Shelby Grossman. “For example, Facebook policies address not only suicide but also euthanasia, suicide notes, and livestreaming suicide attempts. In contrast, Instagram and Reddit have no policies related to suicide in their primary policy documents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8hXXX0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook is miles ahead of some of its peers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nlpzxW"&gt;Among the platforms surveyed, Facebook was found to have the most comprehensive policies. But researchers faulted the company for unclear policies at its Instagram subsidiary; technically, the parent company’s policies all apply to both platforms, but Instagram maintains &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-community-guidelines-faqs"&gt;a separate set of policies&lt;/a&gt; that do not explicitly mention posting about suicide, creating some confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csrYJO"&gt;Still, Facebook is miles ahead of some of its peers. Reddit, Parler, and Gab were found to have no public policies related to posts about self-harm, eating disorders, or suicide. That doesn’t necessarily mean that the companies have no policies whatsoever. But if they aren’t posted publicly, we may never know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgeIqO"&gt;In contrast, researchers said that what they call “creator platforms” — YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch — have developed smart policies that go beyond simple promises to remove disturbing content. The platforms offer meaningful support in their policies both for people who are recovering from mental health issues and those who may be considering self-harm, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xEh6AO"&gt;“Both YouTube and TikTok are explicit in allowing creators to share their stories about self-harm to raise awareness and find community support,” they wrote. “We were impressed that YouTube’s community guidelines on suicide and self-injury provide resources, including hotlines and websites, for those having thoughts of suicide or self-harm, for 27 countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewrPuT"&gt;Outside the biggest platforms, though, it’s all a toss-up. Researchers could not find public policies for suicide or self-harm for NextDoor or Clubhouse. Dating apps? Grindr and Tinder have policies about self-harm; Scruff and Hinge don’t. Messaging apps tend not to have any such public policies, either — iMessage, Signal, and WhatsApp don’t. (The fact that all of them use some form of encryption likely has a lot to do with that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKrgzV"&gt;Why does all of this matter? In an interview, the researchers told me there are at least three big reasons. One is essentially a question of justice: if people are going to be punished for the ways in which they discuss self-harm online, they ought to know that in advance. Two is that policies offer platforms a chance to intervene when their users are considering hurting themselves. (Many do offer users links to resources that can help them in a time of crisis.) And three is that we can’t develop more effective policies for addressing mental health issues online if we don’t know what the policies are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vsk6VK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can’t moderate if you don’t even have a policy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NzJ3yI"&gt;And moderating these kinds of posts can be quite tricky, researchers said. There’s often a fine line between posts that are discussing self-harm and those that appear to be encouraging it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jb2otw"&gt;“The same content that could show someone recovering from an eating disorder is something that can also be triggering for other people,” Grossman told me. “That same content could just affect users in two different ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ImZ7i"&gt;But you can’t moderate if you don’t even have a policy, and I was surprised, reading this research, at just how many companies don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u03w8O"&gt;This has turned out to be a kind of policy week here at Platformer. We talked about how &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/clarence-thomas-lobs-a-speech-bomb"&gt;Clarence Thomas wants to blow up platform policy as it exists today&lt;/a&gt;; how YouTube is &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/youtube-does-a-number-on-us"&gt;shifting the way it measures harm on the platform&lt;/a&gt; (and discloses it); and how &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/twitch-calls-in-the-cavalry"&gt;Twitch developed a policy for policing creators’ behavior on other platforms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTPA0p"&gt;What strikes me about all of this is just how fresh it all feels. We’re more than a decade into the platform era, but there are still so many big questions to figure out. And even on the most serious of subjects — how to address content related to self-harm — some platforms haven’t even entered the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6TijlA"&gt;The Stanford researchers told me they believe they are the first people to even attempt to catalog self-harm policies among the major platforms and make them public. There are doubtless many other areas where a similar inventory would serve the public good. Private companies still hide too much, even and especially when they are directly implicated in questions of public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79e17x"&gt;In the future, I hope these companies collaborate more — learning from one another and adopting policies that make sense for their own platforms. And thanks to the Stanford researchers, at least on one subject, they can now find all of the existing policies in a single place.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘It was a lot of fun to be a samurai for six months.’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="o6p31Z"&gt;Before he started working on &lt;em&gt;Yasuke&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming anime series on Netflix, Grammy-nominated producer Flying Lotus was only somewhat familiar with the story. “I knew that there was a Black samurai that existed, but I didn’t know much, because there wasn’t really much out there for so long,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. So when it came time to adapt the tale, Lotus — who served as both composer and executive producer on the show — knew that they’d have to take some creative liberties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6ZR7X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yasuke&lt;/em&gt; is a six-episode series that follows the life of the titular samurai, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuke"&gt;a real-life historical figure&lt;/a&gt; who arrived in Japan in 1579. However, much of his life remains a mystery, and much of what has been documented could be best described as conjecture. There are a lot of holes in the Yasuke legend — which gave the team lots of room to be creative. The anime follows the samurai’s life, but it also mixes in elements of fantasy and sci-fi: there are mechs and robots, humans transforming into animals, and all kinds of magic and sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5iXFC"&gt;For Lotus, it was the fact that the show would be an anime that inspired many of these far-out ideas. “It was rich enough on its own,” he says of the Yasuke legend, “but for anime it just needed that extra thing to take it over the edge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wV51x0"&gt;Lotus is just one part of an impressive creative team behind the show. &lt;em&gt;Yasuke&lt;/em&gt; is directed by LeSean Thomas, possibly best-known as the creator of &lt;em&gt;Cannon Busters&lt;/em&gt;, and features &lt;em&gt;Get Out&lt;/em&gt; star Lakeith Stanfield in the lead role. Meanwhile, revered animation studio Mappa is helming the production. Lotus is no stranger to these kinds of collaborations — most notably, he’s worked with C&lt;em&gt;owboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; creator Shinichirō Watanabe on a number of projects — and he says part of what made &lt;em&gt;Yasuke&lt;/em&gt; so interesting was that he was involved beyond just the soundtrack, which included helping shape the story early on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="Vd0hRf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oYcK1LQl_Fs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zMdH5Z"&gt;The trick, he says, was balancing history and fantasy. “I think there’s enough of the historical document in the show that serves Yasuke’s story, and honors his story,” he explains. “When we tell our version, no one really knows what happened to him after a certain point — I thought it was fun to speculate as to what that could be. It’s such an important time for this story to come out.” Lotus adds that, while Thomas was well-versed in the historical side, his own contributions were different. “I was the person to bring in the more left-field concepts, and the more ethereal ideas and spiritual concepts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykt59I"&gt;Being so involved in the production also helped when it came to the score. Lotus says that, initially, he mostly knew what he &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; want the show to sound like. “I knew that people were going to be like ‘Oh, Flying Lotus is involved, he’s going to do a hip-hop thing, so it’s going to be like &lt;em&gt;Afro Samurai&lt;/em&gt;, it’s going to be like &lt;em&gt;Samurai Champloo&lt;/em&gt;, maybe it’ll be like &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; if he does a jazz thing,’” he explains. “This is also the stupid voice in my head, the voice that’s going off all the time. I also wanted to do something that’d surprise me, and be true to what I’m looking at.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HwdBtf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I wanted it to be a journey getting there.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yzYavO"&gt;He says he started thinking about the music from the very beginning, but it wasn’t until production was well underway, and he was able to see actual animation, that he could properly compose. The process involved watching episodes with musical instruments in arms’ reach — a few keyboards, some Japanese and African percussion instruments — and seeing what felt right. It took a while to find that sound, he explains, but once he did things started to flow. “I just felt the call to action,” Lotus says. “Alright, Yasuke’s got to cut some people up, well I’m gonna help him with my music. I’ll help him win these battles. I’m going through this with you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="MIQm5v"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylqBPksn36A?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mUAXpI"&gt;Part of that involved writing the songs in chronological order, so that the music developed alongside the character. “I wanted to have the music have progression like Yasuke’s character and the story that’s being told. Along the way, the story gets more magical; you start dealing with witchcraft and shamans and sorcery and all of this stuff. I wanted it to be a journey getting there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lYRvQF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I have a deep connection with this.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B7hzjK"&gt;Often composers aren’t given a lot to go on; maybe they’re shown some art and given a few notes from the director about the mood of a scene. But because he was so involved in the show’s creation, Lotus was able to create the score in a more organic way. That’s not to say that the process didn’t have any drawbacks: namely, there was a lot more pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="30W79C"&gt;“It makes it way more intimidating,” Lotus says. “Being there from the beginning, you know how much everybody worked on this. You know how much LeSean put in, and Lakeith had his voice in there, and the studio drew all of these amazing things and all these animators, character designers, directors worked on it already. They did their part. Now here you go: set the tone, and be great, in a pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pBlhit"&gt;The important thing, he says, is that he wasn’t just a “gun for hire,” a big name brought on to help promote the show. For Lotus, his relationship to the source material was much more significant than that. “I have a deep connection with this, deeper than someone giving me a bunch of cool pictures to make music to. I’m invested in this.” Plus, he notes, “it was a lot of fun to be a samurai for six months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ux3p5B"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Yasuke &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;debuts on Netflix on April 29th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
