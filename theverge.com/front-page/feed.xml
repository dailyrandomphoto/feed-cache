    <title>Nanoleaf’s Lines make it easy to color your walls with light</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;These modular light bars add some flexible futuristic fun to your smart home&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QkvPJH"&gt;Indoor lighting has gone from functional to fun in the last few years, whether that involves simply screwing in a couple smart light bulbs or adding complicated, colorful effects that can change the entire mood of your home. Nanoleaf is one of many companies forging ahead with innovative, colorful smart lighting products, and its latest offering — &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/nanoleaf-lines/?utm_source=General&amp;amp;utm_medium=linesnanoleaf&amp;amp;utm_campaign=linesnanoleaf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22725220/nanoleaf-lines-modular-smart-lighting-release-date-price&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22489261__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the $199 Nanoleaf Lines&lt;/a&gt; — might just be the most entertaining yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYqK2f"&gt;The Lines join Nanoleaf’s growing catalog of LED wall panels in various sizes and shapes, this time adding a new trick — backlighting. Available for pre-order now and on sale November 8th, these are ultra-lightweight LED light bars with dual-color zones where each zone is capable of displaying one of over 16 million RGB colors. They can be mounted on the wall or ceiling and can go from a soothing sunset scene to an intense nightclub look (complete with beat throbbing motion) with the touch of a button (or a voice command). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c3dAbF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10840282"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MoTTjN"&gt;Where Nanoleaf’s previous release, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466594/nanoleaf-elements-light-panel-smart-home-price-release"&gt;elegant wood-look Elements panels&lt;/a&gt;, was a move towards more traditional home decor, the Lines are a shift back to the company’s core audience: those who want a futuristic vibe in their living space. They are ideally suited for setting up behind a gaming monitor or big-screen TV where you can tie them into Nanoleaf’s screen mirroring capabilities (but you’ll need to use a computer for this integration). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebDxj9"&gt;The most notable feature of Lines over Nanoleaf’s other wall-lighting options is that they’re backlit. Combined with a 20-lumen rating per Line (a setup of nine generates 180 lumens), they can work as ambient lighting behind a computer screen as they won’t run the risk of blinding you when you accidentally set them to turn on at full brightness one morning (I speak from experience).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C9YFT8FdfT_H5j9Two5b4bQPdM8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968038/jtuohy_211027_4855_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nanoleaf’s music visualizer feature uses a built-in microphone to listen to ambient sounds and pulse the lights with the beat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rW3gOC"&gt;As an ambient lighting option, they are feature-rich, coming with 19 pre-loaded scenes in the Nanoleaf companion app, including standard smart lighting modes like Reading, Warm White, and Daylight, and fun ones that take advantage of all those colors. My household enjoyed the Blood Dripping option this past Halloween, and the Prism and Raspberry Lemonade scenes were also favorites for their fun pops of color. Despite options such as Reading, however, these won’t work for task lighting — they just don’t give off enough light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsWHIb"&gt;Most Scenes have a motion setting where the lights cycle through different patterns, and some have a rhythm setting that uses a built-in microphone to pulse the lights in time with any music playing. Both of these effects are impressive, with smooth motions, seamless color mixing, and no unsightly stuttering or flickering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssfNKx"&gt;It’s also possible to create your own Scenes, but setting one up is tricky and in my testing they never seemed to work as well as the preset ones. I preferred to rely on the many other Nanoleaf owners who have mastered the overly complicated app and uploaded scenes that I can download to the lights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lqV3Nuc9Du5ww1cfUQ_j3K2m-Yo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968028/jtuohy_211027_4855_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nanoleaf Lines will work with the Nanoleaf desktop app for screen mirroring, reflecting on-screen activity through the lights, but the feature wasn’t available during my testing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bs7eOY"&gt;Unlike Nanoleaf’s recent panels, the Lines aren’t touch capacitive, so you can’t use them as smart home buttons or play games on them, but they do have a Thread radio inside and can act as a Thread Border Router. This means they should integrate smoothly with the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;smart home interoperability standard Matter &lt;/a&gt;when it arrives next year. In the meantime, Lines can act as a hub for Nanoleaf’s Essentials lighting, which consists of smart A19 bulbs and standard light strips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="c1uT17"&gt;&lt;q&gt;My household enjoyed the Blood Dripping option this past Halloween&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="thYXYY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10841206"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aoEfxn"&gt;All of Nanoleaf’s products work with Apple’s HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, and Google Home, as well as SmartThings and IFTTT. This lets you control them with your voice and add them into automations or routines.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFgOmM"&gt;I added a Vibrant Sunrise scene to my Alexa Good Morning routine, so when I tell the assistant Good Morning, the Lines mimic a natural, gradual sunrise with red and orange hues, turning to yellows and whites. I also tried out a few schedules in the Nanoleaf app, including one that switches to Tuscany Sunset at 7PM, gradually ramping up the brightness over 10 minutes, then switching off three hours later. These all worked reliably and accurately, and I had no problems with connectivity during my testing (the Lines connect to 2.4GHz Wi-Fi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5nQyh"&gt;The modular design of the Lines makes them better for filling up a blank wall with fewer pieces than Nanoleaf’s other options, which also means it’s less expensive to create a full design. You can link up to 18 Lines per power supply, and you get nine Lines for $200, as opposed to seven Shapes for the same price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3bLDfD"&gt;The connectors give you six angles to choose from, and you can easily span a small wall with nine or 12 pieces (a starter kit comes with nine, the add-on for $70 has three). With the Elements and Shapes options that I’ve previously tested, I’d need around 10 to 14 (depending on size) to fill a similar space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q0-hAkR1C-WNIjhs1jY2KwYCr3Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968040/jtuohy_211027_4855_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Their modular design and six angles to choose from make the Lines easy to create unique and intricate designs with, but we weren’t able to recreate a V for Verge with them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FcgtkLzbKh0LMIW7LRZ9u4KgNjU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968034/jtuohy_211027_4855_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When turned off the Lines still have a nice sculptural look.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QrRB9cPJRAbQBqnqAKoAgsVgH1I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968023/jtuohy_211027_4855_0011_sq.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One connector also acts as a controller, so you can turn the lights on or off, adjust brightness or change the scene directly on the lights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v2N5FY"&gt;This brings me to their biggest drawback — the price. The least expensive of Nanoleaf’s decorative wall lighting fixtures (and a proper bargain compared to the price you’d pay for a piece of art to fill a large wall), $200 for LED light bars is still a tough sell. You can pick up smart LED light strips for under $30 and get a somewhat similar effect. Plus, if you don’t like the look of white bars on your wall when you don’t have them lit up, you need to pay an extra $20 for nine “skins” (pink or black) to dress them up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpuBwb"&gt;The Lines look okay when turned off — not as good as the Elements panels, whose faux-wood look resembles a wood sculpture on the wall — but good enough because the design is more distinctive against a wall (assuming it’s not painted white) than Nanoleaf’s other panels, which have a more “blob of white plastic” aesthetic when switched off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgqta4"&gt;If you do decide to splurge, installing Nanoleaf Lines is surprisingly simple. Really, the most challenging part is deciding what pattern to use. While Nanoleaf has made it relatively easy to reposition should you change your mind, the paint on your wall is not likely to be as amenable, and unlike the larger panels, the lines won’t cover up any mistakes if you do mess up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZ4gMD"&gt;The best course is to lay out your design on the floor or a table first and then carefully transpose it. Nanoleaf offers lots of handy suggestions in the box and a virtual visualizer in the app that lets you design a pattern in the app and see what it will look like on your wall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IQg1o"&gt;Placing them on the wall is simple; the Lines are thin plastic bars with a triangular tip that snap into a hexagonal connector with six slots. Put a connector on the wall using the supplied double-sided adhesives and snap the Line or Lines into it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KsAbLS"&gt;You can ceiling mount these, too, and they’re super lightweight, but Nanoleaf does recommend using screws to affix them (sold separately). In any scenario, you’ll need to plan around a nearby outlet and find a way to work the almost 15-foot cable into your setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wOTNbwEHLKkQRKm6YYeFtPzDjuk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968030/jtuohy_211027_4855_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lines snap easily into the hexagonal connector, which is the piece that attaches to the wall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ysd-dMBT1EL6VDjcWjh1M_cU7nA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968029/jtuohy_211027_4855_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The connector has six angles to choose from which position the light bars at 60-degree angles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yUoAx8"&gt;Unfortunately, the connector is a different design from Nanoleaf’s Shapes and Canvas panels, so you can’t link these with an existing setup you have, which sort of kills Nanoleaf’s whole modular lighting pitch dead in its tracks. They did add the ability to go around corners, which could be pretty cool — but you have to buy special connectors for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W0TMUN"&gt;If you are looking for a way to add some futuristic fun and vibrant color into a gaming room, living room, bedroom, or other space, Nanoleaf’s Lines are an excellent option. Yes, you can pick up some LED light strips for $30 and get a somewhat similar effect, but these are very well-designed, making it simpler to achieve a more interesting, eye-pleasing design that is more feature than fixture. With a two-year warranty and future-proofed smart home tech inside them, they’re also likely to last you a lot longer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to create a signature for PDF documents on a Mac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="adobe signature" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CjbjjFADHTq31dc0jvrpDmyryDw=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68941923/Adobe-Reader-EchoSign-iPad-Ink_Signature_Tool.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="biDYjK"&gt;These days, hard copy paperwork is fast becoming the exception rather than the rule, and more and more official papers are being turned into PDF documents. (PDF stands for Portable Document Format; it is a standard created by Adobe in the early 1990s that allows paper documents to be turned into exact digital copies.) However, even digital documents have to be signed. You can do it the long way — print those documents out, sign them, and then scan them back into your computer — or you can create a digital signature and place it directly on the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldxgQF"&gt;If you’re using a Mac, the process is refreshingly easy — just use the built-in Preview app to create and save your digital signature. (If you’re using a Windows PC, unfortunately, it’s not quite as simple.) After that, when you open a PDF using Preview, it will be a simple matter of dropping the signature into the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wuj5t1"&gt;To create your signature, you first have to have a PDF ready:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FqdcaZ"&gt;Open a PDF document using your Mac’s built-in Preview app. (If you don’t have a PDF document handy, you can create one with your favorite word processor and save it as a PDF file.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jTP7Vf"&gt;Open the Markup tool, either by clicking on the “pen in a circle” symbol on the top right of the Preview window or by selecting View &amp;gt; Show Markup Toolbar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9tESYh"&gt;Click on the Signature icon (it’s the one that looks like a signature on a line).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on the Signature icon to create your signature via trackpad, camera, or phone" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UUzOkY0V_xOxGmA2jcph5CZPuPQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357983/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_3.00.02_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on the Signature icon to create your signature via trackpad, camera, or phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gOqMsK"&gt;Now, you can create your signature. (If you’ve already created at least one signature, click on the “Create Signature” button.) You will have either two or three buttons on top of the window. Here are your choices: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YZoTUM"&gt;Select Trackpad. Click on the “Click Here to Begin” button in the center of the screen, sign your name on the trackpad, hit any key, and then click on “Done.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tF4TPe"&gt;Write your name on a piece of white paper, select Camera, and hold the paper up to the camera (and on the line that appears across the screen) until you see the signature appear on the screen. (Two notes: first, the signature will appear reversed as you hold it up, but the digitized version will be correct. Also, if there are any other markings on the paper or if the paper doesn’t fill the screen, you are likely to get other markings recorded besides the signature, so you may need to try it a couple of times to get it right.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="As you hold your written signature up to the camera, it will appear reversed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bw8S_766-dKovKfLDHMnZFnJVsg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357988/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.26.12_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As you hold your written signature up to the camera, it will appear reversed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When the signature is captured, it will no longer be a mirror-image" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DH8G9WgqNgZSplZCnVpDfYeaBYA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357992/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.29.48_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When the signature is captured, it will no longer be a mirror image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="HedzDU"&gt; If you have an iPhone associated with the Mac, you will also have a button labeled “iPhone.” Choose that, and your phone will almost immediately pop up a field on which you can write your signature; your signature will be mirrored on your Mac.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When the signature is captured, it will no longer be a mirror-image" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O7c_r1m6Yo-O7GwkqYvJqIRUBFc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358000/mysig.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This screenshot shows what the signature field looks like on an iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="As you write, the signature will simultaneously appear on your screen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9X2ZS9zUPN0qTZ-lpYuolp4Kh0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358019/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.34.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As you write, the signature will simultaneously appear on your screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AgSFFf"&gt;With any of these methods, if you need to try again, just hit the “Clear” button on the lower left of the window to get rid of the unwanted signature. Once you’re happy with it, click on “Done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWPnNK"&gt;Now, whenever you want to add your signature to a document in Preview, just click on the Signature icon and click on your signature. It will appear in a box on your document, which you can then use to adjust the size and location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your signature will now appear under the Signature icon in the Preview app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X1t60BhdsgBtpswS5moYEm85nzo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358020/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.42.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your signature will now appear under the Signature icon in the Preview app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vMQ-3CcSxEIGPJYSAPS4PQPuK7Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358021/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.46.48_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can move the signature to where you want it and make it larger or smaller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="53mHeR"&gt;And if you want a second or third signature, just create them in the same way. After that, when you click the Signature icon, you’ll see all your created signatures and can select the one you want to use. Don’t need one of the signatures anymore?

    <title>Razer’s latest productivity peripherals are focused on low noise and long battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OMnFbsB-b1jjhy8fH6o4ObHXCWQ=/0x0:3540x2360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079325/Key_Visual_1_crop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pro Type Ultra and Pro Click Mini. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lJiYPk"&gt;Razer has updated its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21375181/razer-pro-click-type-ergonomic-wireless-mouse-mechanical-keyboard-humanscale"&gt;suite of productivity peripherals&lt;/a&gt; with the new Pro Click Mini wireless mouse, the Pro Type Ultra wireless keyboard, and the Pro Glide XXL mouse mat (also wireless). Among the new features of the peripherals are sound dampening foam in the keyboard, “silent mechanical” switches in the mouse, and improved battery life across both models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rebzs7"&gt;As its name suggests, the Pro Click Mini is a more compact version of Razer’s existing Pro Click wireless mouse, so it’s easier to stash in a laptop bag. Despite being cheaper at $79 rather than $99, it benefits from having a similar dual-mode scroll wheel to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22650400/razer-basilisk-v3-chroma-rgb-scroll-wheel-price-features"&gt;Basilisk V3&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you swap between a free-spinning scroll mode and more traditional tactile scrolling. It’s not rechargeable like the Pro Click (the Mini uses AA batteries instead), but the upside is that it offers up to 15 months of battery life rather than 2.5. It can connect over Bluetooth or via Razer’s 2.4GHz USB dongle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UMAd9QIxxb91ygr-4iNd6yetf8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22976420/Pro_Click.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Pro Click Mini features silent switches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QUfH6h"&gt;The Pro Type Ultra, meanwhile, costs $159 compared to $139 for the existing Pro Type. That extra money gets you an included leatherette wrist rest, plus the ability to use the keyboard wired in addition to wireless. But perhaps the most practical benefit is its extended battery life, which goes up to 214 hours if you’re using the keyboard over Bluetooth without backlighting or 207 hours using the 2.4GHz USB dongle (up from 84 and 78 hours, respectively). Those figures drop dramatically to just 13 hours if you’re using the keyboard’s backlighting, however. It’s equipped with Razer’s linear yellow switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mhl85"&gt;Finally, there’s the Pro Glide XXL, a 94cm / 37-inch-wide mouse mat that’s designed for both a mouse and keyboard to sit on simultaneously. It costs $29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHwxnd"&gt;Razer’s Pro Click Mini mouse and Pro Glide XXL mouse mat are both releasing today, while its Pro Type Ultra keyboard will launch before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Loop is a new Office app for the hybrid work era</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pEp0P_pK6lucE0PjQraF-jfchds=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079355/oZ667Nh.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ty7BUv"&gt;The biggest change to Microsoft’s Office documents in decades is expanding into Microsoft Loop, a hub for a new way of working in Office. Microsoft Loop is the new branding for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21260005/microsoft-office-fluid-web-document-features-build"&gt;Microsoft’s Fluid work&lt;/a&gt;, blocks of collaborative Office content that can live independently and be copied, pasted, and shared with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yrk15"&gt;Much like Fluid, Microsoft Loop has three main elements: Loop components, Loop pages, and Loop workspaces. Loop components are live pieces of content that can exist across multiple apps, updated in real time and free for anyone to jump into. That could be a list shared in a Teams channel and also editable in a Loop page, or notes in a calendar entry that are also available to be pasted into Outlook and edited in real time within an email.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3tMgG0y7QTY1GrctVSHFKDyxqto=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22978875/Loop_People_moving_in_and_out_of_pages.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new Loop app brings together all of its Fluid component work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XZSpp6"&gt;These components can also exist in the main Microsoft Loop hub, inside what Microsoft calls shared Loop workspaces. It’s almost like a project board, where you can see a list of all Loop components and Loop pages and who is currently working on them. Think of it as a modern File Explorer, where everything is live and collaborative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmmZ7G"&gt;Loop pages are the individual canvases where people can share and collaborate on Loop components. It’s like a modern version of a whiteboard but far more powerful because you can insert and share components that people have created outside of Loop. Not everyone even needs to be part of the entire Loop page, as the individual components could be edited in real time from other apps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jdkJZd4Uc7jQjZfd3CCZsmNsMdc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22978877/microsoftloop.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Loop components can live across multiple apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C721DX"&gt;These collaborative Loop components have been the dream of Microsoft for the past couple of years, and it’s clear the company has been adjusting how Loop works to fit the realities of pandemic life. A central Microsoft Loop hub looks like an improved way to track and organize these components — and a clear response to the new hybrid work era to which many businesses are adjusting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oKsK2P"&gt;Microsoft’s demonstrations of Loop components &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538144/microsoft-fluid-components-documents-office-teams-onenote-outlook-whiteboard"&gt;have been impressive so far&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ll need to experience them for ourselves to really understand whether Loop can truly deliver the seamless experience that Microsoft keeps promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6aRzR"&gt;While Microsoft has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21260005/microsoft-office-fluid-web-document-features-build"&gt;talking about Loop (Fluid) for nearly 18 months&lt;/a&gt;, it’s still not something that’s inside Office apps yet. Microsoft Loop components will now arrive in Teams, Outlook, and OneNote this month, and the main Microsoft Loop app will be released at a later date. “We will share more about the availability of the Microsoft Loop app in the upcoming months,” says Wangui McKelvey, general manager of Microsoft 365.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is giving businesses access to OpenAI’s powerful AI language model GPT-3</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NdeMVPI7tSGEbZxGWqsLb4K4dWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079350/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yhuj0d"&gt;It’s the AI system once deemed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224704/ai-machine-learning-language-models-read-write-openai-gpt2"&gt;too dangerous&lt;/a&gt; to release to the public by its creators. Now, Microsoft is making an upgraded version of the program, OpenAI’s autocomplete software GPT-3, available to business customers as part of its suite of Azure cloud tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPKkbq"&gt;GPT-3 is the best known example of a new generation of AI language models. These systems primarily work as autocomplete tools: feed them a snippet of text, whether an email or a poem, and the AI will do its best to continue what’s been written. Their ability to parse language, however, also allows them to take on other tasks like summarizing documents, analyzing the sentiment of text, and generating ideas for projects and stories — jobs with which Microsoft says its new Azure OpenAI Service will help customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tXeED"&gt;Here’s an example scenario from Microsoft:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="dEfMtg"&gt;“A sports franchise could build an app for fans that offers reasoning of commentary and a summary of game highlights, lowlights and analysis in real time. Their marketing team could then use GPT-3’s capability to produce original content and help them brainstorm ideas for social media or blog posts and engage with fans more quickly.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="U7YlWg"&gt;GPT-3 is already being used for this sort of work via an API &lt;a href="https://beta.openai.com/"&gt;sold by OpenAI&lt;/a&gt;. Startups like Copy.ai promise that their GPT-derived tools will help users &lt;a href="http://www.copy.ai"&gt;spruce up work emails and pitch decks&lt;/a&gt;, while more exotic applications include using GPT-3 to power a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21042942/ai-dungeon-nick-walton-openai-gpt2-text-adventure-game-web-version-launch"&gt;choose-your-own-adventure text game&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22734620/fictional-influencers-fourfront-fake-tiktokers"&gt;chatbots pretending to be fictional TikTok influencers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ydu5x8"&gt;While OpenAI will continue selling its own API for GPT-3 to provide customers with the latest upgrades, Microsoft’s repackaging of the system will be aimed at larger businesses that want more support and safety. That means their service will offer tools like “access management, private networking, data handling protections [and] scaling capacity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="czKupT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft already uses GPT-3 in its products&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="afOWwR"&gt;It’s not clear how much this might cannibalize OpenAI’s business, but the two companies already have a tight partnership. In 2019, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20703578/microsoft-openai-investment-partnership-1-billion-azure-artificial-general-intelligence-agi"&gt;invested $1 billion in OpenAI&lt;/a&gt; and became its sole cloud provider (a vital relationship in the compute-intensive world of AI research). Then, in September 2020, Microsoft bought an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451283/microsoft-openai-gpt-3-exclusive-license-ai-language-research"&gt;exclusive license&lt;/a&gt; to directly integrate GPT-3 into its own products. So far, these efforts have focused on GPT-3’s code-generating capacities, with Microsoft using the system to build autocomplete features into its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22451144/microsoft-gpt-3-openai-coding-autocomplete-powerapps-power-fx"&gt;suite of PowerApps applications&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555777/github-openai-ai-tool-autocomplete-code"&gt;Visual Studio Code editor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GS8QzJ"&gt;These limited applications make sense given the huge problems associated with large AI language models like GPT-3. First: a lot of what these systems generate is rubbish, and requires human curation and oversight to sort the good from the bad. Second: these models have also been shown time and time again to incorporate &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/07/here-are-a-few-ways-gpt-3-can-go-wrong/"&gt;biases&lt;/a&gt; found in their training data, from sexism to Islamaphobia. They are more likely to associate Muslims with violence, for example, and hew to outdated gender stereotypes. In other words: if you start playing around with these models in an unfiltered format, they’ll soon say something nasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2IkUr"&gt;Microsoft knows only too well what can happen when such systems are let loose on the general public (remember Tay, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist"&gt;the racist chatbot&lt;/a&gt;?). So, it’s trying to avoid these problems with GPT-3 by introducing various safeguards. These include granting access to use the tool by invitation only; vetting customers’ use cases; and providing “filtering and monitoring tools to help prevent inappropriate outputs or unintended uses of the service.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtMfle"&gt;However, it’s not clear if these restrictions will be enough. For example, when asked by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; how exactly the company’s filtering tools work, or whether there was any proof that they could reduce inappropriate outputs from GPT-3, the company dodged the question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HVrPMg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I would not want to be the person or company accountable for what it might say based on that training data”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bgy7dP"&gt;Emily Bender, a professor of computational linguistics at the University of Washington who’s written extensively on large language models, says Microsoft’s reassurances are lacking in substance. “As noted in [Microsoft’s] press release, GPT-3’s training data potentially includes ‘everything from vulgar language to racial stereotypes to personally identifying information,’” Bender told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; over email. “I would not want to be the person or company accountable for what it might say based on that training data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LvtT9L"&gt;Bender notes that Microsoft’s introduction of GPT-3 fails to meet the company’s own &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fai%2Fresponsible-ai" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AI ethics guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, which include a principle of transparency — meaning AI systems should be accountable and understandable. Despite this, says Bender, the exact composition of GPT-3’s training data is a mystery and Microsoft is claiming that the system “understands” language — a framing that is &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/25/1032111/conscious-ai-can-machines-think/"&gt;strongly disputed by many experts&lt;/a&gt;. “It is concerning to me that Microsoft is leaning in to this kind of AI hype in order to sell this product,” said Bender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mus3Ar"&gt;But although Microsoft’s GPT-3 filters may be unproven, it can avoid a lot of trouble by simply selecting its customers carefully. Large language models are certainly useful as long as their output is checked by humans (though this requirement does negate some of the promised gains in efficiency). As Bender notes, if Azure OpenAI Service is just helping to write “communication aimed at business executives,” it’s not too problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jakaJ"&gt;“I would honestly be more concerned about language generated for a video game character,” she says, as this implementation would likely run without human oversight. “I would strongly recommend that anyone using this service avoid ever using it in public-facing ways without extensive testing ahead of time and humans in the loop.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams enters the metaverse race with 3D avatars and immersive meetings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i4JGYKk68xGHwAHYD_ETao8Ad_Q=/47x0:554x338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079343/teamsmesh.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AwjnkY"&gt;Microsoft is entering the race to build a metaverse inside Teams, just days after Facebook rebranded to Meta in a push to build virtual spaces for both consumers and businesses. Microsoft is bringing Mesh, a collaborative platform for virtual experiences, directly into Microsoft Teams next year. It’s part of a big effort to combine the company’s mixed reality and HoloLens work with meetings and video calls that anyone can participate in thanks to animated avatars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bXiTE"&gt;With today’s announcement, Microsoft and Meta seem to be on a collision course to compete heavily in the metaverse, particularly for the future of work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RAUR7TrRriIaoK3MeSylGp3QrDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22979285/teamsmesh.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teams will soon have new 3D avatars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SfYOW0"&gt;Microsoft Mesh always &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22308883/microsoft-mesh-virtual-reality-augmented-reality-hololens-vr-headsets-features"&gt;felt like the future of Microsoft Teams meetings&lt;/a&gt;, and now it’s starting to come to life in the first half of 2022. Microsoft is building on efforts like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317526/microsoft-teams-together-mode-dynamic-view-new-features"&gt;Together Mode&lt;/a&gt; and other experiments for making meetings more interactive, after months of people working from home and adjusting to hybrid work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqbCK5"&gt;“We got hit by meeting fatigue in the virtual world,” explains Nicole Herskowitz, general manager for Microsoft Teams, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “After 30 or 40 minutes max in a meeting, it was very hard to stay engaged and focused.” That initial meeting fatigue led to Together Mode, and now Microsoft hopes Mesh will further help reduce the cognitive overload of having to be on video calls all day long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5AiPI"&gt;Microsoft Teams will get new 3D avatars in a push toward a metaverse environment, and you won’t need to put a VR headset on to use them. These avatars can literally represent you both in 2D and 3D meetings, so you can choose to have an animated version of yourself if you’re not feeling like turning your webcam on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SWaTLDCOJCX6UUtm8Cd0nY6xjBQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22978968/Mesh_for_Teams_grid.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Teams is getting new 3D avatars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zKfZjf"&gt;“It’s not binary, so I can choose how I want to show up, whether it’s video or an avatar, and there’s a variety of customized options to choose how you want to be present in a meeting,” says Katie Kelly, principal product manager for Microsoft Mesh, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We are able to interpret your vocal cues to animate that avatar, so it does feel present and it does feel like it’s there with you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYDAHa"&gt;Microsoft will use AI to listen to your voice and then animate your avatar. If you switch to a more immersive 3D meeting, then these animations will also include raising your avatar’s hands when you hit the raise hand option or animate emoji around your avatar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6AAW4"&gt;The immersive spaces are really where Microsoft sees this Mesh integration as being the most useful, particularly in its efforts to build a metaverse for businesses. Microsoft envisions virtual spaces inside Teams where people can network and socialize with games or even use Microsoft apps to collaborate on projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sowvBuzragXjGxPwdg1huPLLeB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22978969/Ignite_2021_MESH_Demo_26.00_02_47_37.Still023.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teams will include virtual meeting spaces in 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ODSK4OiIk2fyMXREsUZ9QGPkYto=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22978970/Mesh_for_Teams__slide_6.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Translation and transcription will help bridge the language gap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cro8r5"&gt;These virtual environments will obviously work best with a VR or AR headset, but they’ll be open to anyone across multiple devices thanks to the animated avatar work. “I think the thing that really separates how Microsoft is approaching metaverse and our own experiences is starting with the human experience, so the feeling of presence, talking to somebody, making eye contact, and reactions are going to be important,” explains Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODeVIQ"&gt;Microsoft is even building in translation and transcription support, so you might be able to meet in a virtual Teams space with a co-worker from across the world with fewer language barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XiWDW"&gt;The promise is that Microsoft Teams will be able to start to use these virtual spaces and avatars in the first half of 2022. “The goal is that by the first half of next year, you’ll be able to go into an immersive space and then be able to collaborate and use Microsoft’s tools,” says Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QrtTLmMU-qJV-aV-K2FVTYhkOjs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22979296/microsoftmetaverse.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft’s vision for its metaverse.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NeGNfT"&gt;Businesses will be able to build their own virtual spaces, or metaverses, inside Teams. That’s something that Accenture has been experimenting with after creating its own virtual campus for employees before the pandemic. This virtual space soon became useful, as the company has used it to onboard new hires during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfUStD"&gt;Microsoft’s push for a metaverse inside Teams comes just days after Facebook rebranded to Meta as its company name. Meta is working on very similar concepts to Microsoft, led by the idea of a digital avatar that represents you in virtual spaces. Meta’s Reality Labs division has been building consumer hardware and software, including the Quest VR headset, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21266945/facebook-ar-vr-remote-work-oculus-passthrough-future-tech"&gt;teased its own vision&lt;/a&gt; of remote work using augmented and virtual reality last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNUXvo"&gt;Microsoft and Meta will clearly compete heavily in the metaverse era. It’s an area Microsoft has spent years investing in, with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18235460/microsoft-hololens-2-price-specs-mixed-reality-ar-vr-business-work-features-mwc-2019"&gt;HoloLens work&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/3/16408626/altspacevr-microsoft-acquisition-vr-community"&gt;acquisition of AltspaceVR&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft and Meta aren’t alone, though. Many companies have started using &lt;a href="https://spatial.io/"&gt;platforms like Spatial&lt;/a&gt; to offer virtual spaces for events, meetings, and networking opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sNm6MI"&gt;Meta has billions of daily users across Facebook and Instagram to leverage for its metaverse ambitions, and Microsoft has the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406472/microsoft-teams-145-million-daily-active-users-stats"&gt;millions of daily Teams users&lt;/a&gt; and integration into Office to try to make the metaverse a reality for businesses. The metaverse battle for your digital avatars is only just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Edge browser is now available on Linux</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qsdU2Sx5vTphauXb5-9dWC8Tjac=/124x0:1435x874/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079372/3EPTdvX.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1PDp8y"&gt;Microsoft is launching the stable version of its Edge browser for Linux this week. While preview versions of Edge for Linux have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449062/microsoft-edge-linux-preview-october-release"&gt;available for more than a year&lt;/a&gt;, the official launch will now see Edge supported fully on Linux with regular stable channel updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSpyNE"&gt;If you’re already running preview builds of Edge on Linux, you can get the latest stable version by running the &lt;strong&gt;sudo apt install microsoft-edge-stable &lt;/strong&gt;command. If you’re new to Edge on Linux, then the installer is &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fedge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now available on Microsoft’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ze2U3k"&gt;Many Linux users will already be using Chrome or Firefox, but Edge is yet another browser option that might work on distros where Chrome isn’t fully supported. Microsoft has also added a number of privacy features to Edge to limit tracking and cookies, and the Linux version of Edge shares most of the same features that are available on Windows and macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FvXOuA"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fedge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;download Edge for Linux over at Microsoft’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft opens up Excel to custom data types with images, arrays, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wh3kZUr-VqJf1RJsx8cH0MwjZ4s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079328/acastro_180226_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RxzPxY"&gt;Microsoft Excel used to only allow two types of data: text and numbers. After overhauling Excel with its own live custom data types last year, Microsoft is opening up Excel to give developers the freedom to create their own custom data types that can contain images, arrays, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="soNAou"&gt;A new JavaScript API will be available to preview inside Excel later this month, which will let developers create these custom data types for inputs and outputs and enable custom functions. Excel developers will be able to create their own add-ins or update existing ones to use the JavaScript API. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vf2OCofDwQKByReYnGvkVdsuL6M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22979147/Excel_API_Bloomberg_GIF.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg is using Microsoft’s new JavaScript API in Excel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tn05Vy"&gt;This will open Excel up to far more custom data types, including content cards, images, matrices, arrays, and formatted number values. Excel has long had support for macros and add-ins, but Microsoft’s new APIs should make this a lot more efficient and easier for developers to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QP2Tg"&gt;“These more flexible structures give you the ability to organize complex data as objects and expose this data to users in more natural ways,” explains Wangui McKelvey, general manager of Microsoft 365. “You can share the power of data types across your entire organization and create add-ins or solutions which can connect data types to your own service or data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwBATM"&gt;A preview of the new JavaScript API in Excel will be available later this month, but it’s not clear exactly when this will be rolled out to all Microsoft 365 users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SwiftKey now connects copy and paste across Android and Windows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mBY7SP_DaDoA6Icf01c1miCnkJ4=/8x0:2552x1696/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079192/twarren__windows11main_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ydkGud"&gt;Microsoft SwiftKey is getting a handy new feature that syncs your clipboard across Android and Windows devices (via &lt;a href="https://mspoweruser.com/swiftkey-keyboard-copy-and-paste/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSPoweruser&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). So if you use SwiftKey on your Android device, you’ll be able to paste any text you’ve copied on your Windows computer (and vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0txBN"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;MSPoweruser&lt;/em&gt; notes, the feature, called Cloud Clipboard, comes as a part of the most recent SwiftKey update, pushing the current version to 7.9.0.5. It was first available in &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/04/swiftkey-beta-v7-8-5-3-adds-clipboard-sync-between-windows-and-android/"&gt;the beta version of Microsoft SwiftKey&lt;/a&gt; in August, but now it’s officially rolled out to everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9OUpp6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Cloud Clipboard will only save the last piece of text you’ve copied and will automatically delete the clip after one hour&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6JJgIW"&gt;SwiftKey has instructions on how to use the Cloud Clipboard on &lt;a href="https://support.swiftkey.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050207692-How-to-use-Microsoft-SwiftKey-to-copy-and-paste-across-your-devices"&gt;its support page&lt;/a&gt;. The feature isn’t enabled by default, and it requires a PC with the Windows 10 2018 update or later. You also have to set up the feature on both platforms before you can start using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggCVmV"&gt;To enable the feature on Android, make sure you’ve &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;downloaded the latest version of the app from Google Play&lt;/a&gt;, and then open SwiftKey. Select Rich input &amp;gt; Clipboard, and toggle on “Sync clipboard history to the cloud.” SwiftKey will then prompt you to sign in or create a Microsoft account.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wiIuf2C5MIlxtlAOjIGn5XSGvSE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22979218/windows_swiftkey_clipboard.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="apuzE2"&gt;You can enable the Cloud Clipboard on your Windows PC by heading to Settings &amp;gt; System &amp;gt; Clipboard. From there, turn on both the “Clipboard history” and “Sync across devices” toggles. After you sign in to your Microsoft account, your clipboards should be synced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dcNWHg"&gt;SwiftKey’s support page also notes that the Cloud Clipboard will only save the last piece of text you’ve copied and will automatically delete the clip after one hour. Your last copied clip will appear in the SwiftKey prediction bar, letting you quickly paste the text on your phone. Concerning the security of copying and pasting data across the cloud, SwiftKey only says that the clip data is encrypted, not processed or stored by their service, and is “not associated with your Microsoft account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XJqM5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/11/15616480/microsoft-windows-10-cloud-clipboard-feature"&gt;Microsoft first began exploring the concept of a Cloud Clipboard in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, and that vision also included iPhones. It’s unclear when (or if) the Cloud Clipboard will be available to iPhone users — SwiftKey’s support page vaguely says that it’s “not possible to sync your clips to iOS at this time.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Ysdobu3Dq5hfr7-QRZnyVxadrk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079139/Early_Black_Friday_Deals.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Beginning in early October, some retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — have been lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them have price-matching policies that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score a great deal before it sells out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="noa6oq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"},{"title":"Know the holiday shipping and return policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570161/holiday-shipping-return-policy-apple-google-microsoft-amazon"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="fUcNXl"&gt;Amazon Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wDZo4M"&gt;Amazon began publishing its Black Friday deals earlier than most retailers, launching mostly single-day sales starting on October 4th. So far, we’ve seen significant deals on Apple products, TVs from Samsung and Sony, Kindles, and more. The retailer continues to launch early Black Friday deals, namely as part of its &lt;a href="https://amazon.com/events/epicdeals?tag=thewire06-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;ascsubtag=dealblogzz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Epic Daily Deals&lt;/a&gt; event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOYFV4"&gt;Note that if you’re not already an Amazon Prime member, you can also save a little more money and enjoy two-day shipping when you sign up for a free, month-long trial of Prime. The membership will also give you access to Amazon’s Lightning deals, which are discounts that often only last for a few hours or a single day. After the trial ends, however, you’ll pay $12.99 per month — unless you’re a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Student/b?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=3&amp;amp;imprToken=92bdf01b-6da1-28cb-387&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=668781011"&gt;student&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/58f8026f-0658-47d0-9752-f6fa2c69b2e2/qualify"&gt;receive qualifying government assistance&lt;/a&gt;, which means you’ll pay either $6.49 or $5.99, respectively — so be aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwMndD"&gt;Right now, Amazon is discounting all sizes of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, the LG C1,  and throwing in a six-month subscription to HBO Max. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model&lt;/a&gt; is on sale for $1,097 instead of $1,297, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=44&amp;amp;imprToken=4cbe668d-20f0-845e-452&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22514911%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is $1,297&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=43&amp;amp;imprToken=4cbe668d-20f0-845e-452&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22514911%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch is selling for $1,797&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, all sport several features gamers will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, and support for HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MqKN84"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fDTpC7"&gt;Typically $400, Amazon is currently selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best-sounding noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for non-Apple users — the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VW98ZKG/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=34&amp;amp;imprToken=4cbe668d-20f0-845e-452&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22514911%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; — for $248. That’s one of the lowest prices Amazon has ever sold them for. As we wrote in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the comfortable headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound while providing 17 hours of playback per charge. They even come outfitted with a USB-C port for charging, and they fold up in a compact manner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aWXUjn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5gVG7"&gt;Amazon is also discounting various sizes of Samsung’s The Frame, a unique kind of TV that functions both as wall art and an HDR-compatible QLED. Right now, for example, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,497&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $998&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. The TV offers a decor-friendly design while also displaying customizable images when somebody’s in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into a smart 4K TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and a 120Hz refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jNcvZm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qcHKiS"&gt;The latest Roku Streaming Stick 4K, which just launched in September, is selling at Amazon at a record low. Normally $50, the retailer is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=44&amp;amp;imprToken=fabe66d6-42ba-471e-6ad&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22512890%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering the streaming device for just $30&lt;/a&gt;. The 2021 model is faster, comes with improved Wi-Fi performance, and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. Roku’s players also now support AirPlay 2, which means you can use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to easily cast content to the device. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PuNKYt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bjBb4F"&gt;Last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-improved-Charging-included/dp/B083KVM9VW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; are selling for $100 instead of $150 on Amazon for a limited time. The deal specifically applies to the black, cloud blue, and white variants, each of which comes with a wireless charging case. As we noted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;in our review&lt;/a&gt;, the lightweight pair of wireless earbuds greatly improve upon the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/8/18255221/samsung-galaxy-buds-headphones-truly-wireless-review-price-specs-features"&gt;original Galaxy Buds&lt;/a&gt; and are a good choice for Android users. The earbuds offer 11 hours of battery life, too, and feature improved microphones that result in far better voice calls. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WyI5ia"&gt;Samsung’s 43-inch M7 Smart Monitor is a smart 4K monitor that acts like a TV for your PC, one you can mount to your wall or a monitor arm using Vesa mounts. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096MY3BN8?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=36&amp;amp;imprToken=fabe66d6-42ba-471e-6ad&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22512890%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling it for $520, its best price to date, with a solar-powered remote control. The monitor can stream HDR10 content from popular apps without additional hardware, too, and supports Apple’s AirPlay 2. It also supports Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa, as well as USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j22lU8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10745870"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOJQiS"&gt;If you’re looking to add some storage space to your PC, Amazon is currently discounting Western Digital’s 2TB and 4TB My Passport models in a variety of colors. Typically $380, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Drive-WDBAGF0020BGY-WESN/dp/B08F1VVBL9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2TB SSD&lt;/a&gt; for $230, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Compatible-systems/dp/B08RX3TWJZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;4TB model&lt;/a&gt; for $550. Western Digital claims up to sequential read / write speeds of 1,050MB/s and 1,000MB/s, respectively, and the deal also includes a USB Type-A adapter in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GlKjia"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aubBFX"&gt;Other notable deals:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fKOGHl"&gt;Both the PC and PlayStation 5 versions of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NDYPWK7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are selling for $40 right now instead of $60, which is a good deal on what we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc"&gt;recently praised&lt;/a&gt; as an amazing action game. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VymIfY"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wolverine-Gaming-Controller-Wireless-Headset-Bundle/dp/B08NGCT6B1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer’s Wolverine V2 wired gaming controller&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially an affordable version of the Xbox Elite controller, is on sale at Amazon as part of a bundle with a Kaira Pro gaming headset. Normally $250, you can pick up both peripherals for $180 for a limited time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9kKV5j"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Chromebook-Celeron-Processor-Gigabit/dp/B07XL4JHXR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 11.6-inch Galaxy Chromebook 4&lt;/a&gt; is now on sale for $190 instead of $250 at Amazon. This particular model includes 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="FfgzdG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="ejfdaH"&gt;Best Buy Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E7iGos"&gt;Best Buy started rolling out big savings in a number of categories on October 18th with Black Friday price protection, meaning Best Buy will refund the difference in price of any item with this guarantee if it drops before November 26th. While anyone can cash in on the current savings, the Black Friday price guarantee only applies to Best Buy Totaltech and My Best Buy members. Best Buy is offering &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Ffree-shipping%2Fpcmcat276800050002.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat276800050002&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free shipping&lt;/a&gt; on any purchase greater than $35, and same-day service is available in certain ZIP codes if you submit your order by 3PM local time. Restrictions apply to certain larger items, however, most of which will require you to schedule a delivery time after making your purchase. If you’re ready to knock out some of your holiday shopping early this year, we’ve collected some of our favorite deals so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DPV4yv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"},{"title":"Best Buy stores will soon offer Samsung foldable repairs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744407/best-buy-authorized-samsung-foldable-repairs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="c5Ol71"&gt;The Lenovo Yoga 9i remains one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687992/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-pro-8-hp-spectre-macbook-air-creator-laptops-compare-specs"&gt;our favorite alternatives to the Microsoft Surface line of ultrabooks&lt;/a&gt; and, right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThlWBLJhS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is offering the slick 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; for $1,350. While this model received a similar discount a couple of months ago, it still remains a solid value. The foldable laptop boasts some impressive specs, too, with an 11th Gen Core i7 CPU, 512GB of storage, and Iris Xe integrated graphics. This hardware, paired with a 4K touchscreen display and a garaged stylus, makes the 9i a great choice for creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nisc5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10689258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mExVb6"&gt;This 70-inch LG TV may only feature midrange specs, but Best Buy has brought it down to its lowest price ever. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTimnyrsb7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG NanoCell 75 series TV is down to just $750&lt;/a&gt; for a limited time, a healthy $450 off the list price. The 4K panel is powered by LG's WebOS smart platform, which offers a solid array of streaming services and includes HDR10 for vivid picture quality. The 75 series also comes equipped with three HDMI ports and ARC compatibility, as well as Apple’s AirPlay 2, which allows you to cast content from your Apple device to your TV. It may not be as impressive as an OLED TV, but $750 for a 70-inch panel is still a solid value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tL6nXD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10835005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LReI5f"&gt;A few other hot deals at Best Buy:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="KJVtaJ"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max have been available for less, but the cheapest place to get them right now is at Best Buy, where you can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkuem3dVe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grab a pair in any color for $479&lt;/a&gt;, $70 off the regular MSRP. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wxld6d"&gt;Google’s lozenge-shaped Nest Mini is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkAfStZ60" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $25 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, half off the original price tag. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In his review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffer Cameron Faulkner called the smart speaker a great sounding upgrade over the last-gen Home Mini.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ysr84c"&gt;This 38-inch soundbar from Samsung is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkK7MFOaD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $280 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The 7.1 soundbar comes packaged with a wireless subwoofer and rear-channel speakers, too, helping keep cable clutter to a minimum. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JXqlKy"&gt;Target Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VmdQS9"&gt;Target began releasing some of its first Black Friday deals on October 10th, and has been running similar deals every week since. However, the store &lt;a href="https://corporate.target.com/press/releases/2021/10/target-reveals-first-look-at-early-black-friday-sa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will officially launch&lt;/a&gt; weekly “Holiday Best” deals every Sunday starting October 31st both online and in-store; it will also publish additional “Holiday Best” deals from November 4th through November 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QInVnf"&gt;Target RedCard holders can also save an additional 5 percent while enjoying free shipping, and the store will be price matching items purchased between October 10th and December 24th &lt;a href="https://help.target.com/help/subcategoryarticle?childcat=Price+Match+Guarantee&amp;amp;parentcat=Policies+%26+Guidelines&amp;amp;searchQuery=search+help" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with some exclusions&lt;/a&gt;. With all that said, below are some notable deals we already know will take place in the next few weeks you should keep an eye out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RjbN8y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best noise-canceling headphones to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"},{"title":"The best cheap wireless earbuds to buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21575716/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds-budget"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="agQ676"&gt;Regularly $300, Target will be selling the &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/7moVRr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose QuietComfort 35 Noise Canceling Wireless Headphones II&lt;/a&gt; for $180 from November 4th through November 6th. That beats Amazon’s current all-time low of $199. Released in 2017, these wireless noise-canceling headphones can seamlessly switch between two paired devices and, unlike their predecessor, they support Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QWrlAQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rKPeGe"&gt;Target will be taking $350 off the 65-inch version of &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/donjWq" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Element’s affordable, frameless Roku TV&lt;/a&gt; from November 4th through November 6th. Normally $650, the TV will be on sale for $300, more than half off the original price. The 4K Ultra HD TV is compatible with HDR10, offers a 60Hz native refresh rate, and has four HDMI ports. It also supports Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant, while additionally working with Chromecast and Apple’s AirPlay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W2j4hz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10834759"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aNi8WR"&gt;The &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/YgB3Am" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Solo 3&lt;/a&gt; will be on sale for $100 at Target from October 31st through November 6th, a cool $100 off the original price tag. Although they’re beginning to show their age, we initially praised the comfortable headphones in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14051984/beats-solo-3-review-apple-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2016 review&lt;/a&gt; and noted how well they isolate exterior noise. They also offer great wireless performance and come in two colorways: black and rose gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CRz9fL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10757348"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="G60grT"&gt;Other notable Target deals happening soon:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2XWmQV"&gt;Target will offer up to 60 percent off &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/x9QDKd" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;select video games&lt;/a&gt; for Nintendo, Xbox, and PlayStation consoles from November 4th through November 6th. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1BiPh2"&gt;The retailer will also sell a silver version of &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/a12Qob" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP’s 15.6-inch laptop with Windows Home in S. Mode&lt;/a&gt; for $340 instead of $540 from October 31st through November 6th. This particular model features 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i3 processor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Fqz3U4"&gt;While they did not reveal specific prices, Target also said it will be offering Black Friday deals &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/ZdB3AQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on TVs from LG, Samsung, TCL, and more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h64IP9"&gt;Walmart Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zULrcm"&gt;The big blue supercenter recently revealed its vertical for its Black Friday deals, which begin November 3rd online and November 5th in stores. While some of these deals will remain live until November 17th, some of them expire as soon as November 7th. Wherever possible, we’ve noted the window of specific deals so you’ll know exactly when to jump on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTwNOz"&gt;Like most online retailers, Walmart offers free two-day shipping on orders over $35, as well as next-day delivery in certain ZIP codes at no extra charge. As an additional perk, Walmart has also extended its standard return policy during the holiday season, with many items purchased between November 1st and December 25 receiving extended return dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmpJFc"&gt;While many of these deals aren’t live yet, we’ve collected a handful that piqued our interest below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Q59sms"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wDwLVX"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus, the improved version of the original Galaxy Buds, will be &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Cosmic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F255407922" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Walmart for $59&lt;/a&gt; from November 3rd to the 7th. This deal brings them well below their typical $100 price tag, making them an excellent value. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted the drastic improvement in battery life as well as their comfortable fit. While Samsung has since improved on this design with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;, adding noise cancellation among other features, their higher price point makes them a slightly tougher sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qzr2Kf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJDOSq"&gt;The GoPro Hero 8 Black often retails for $300 on its own, but &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoPro-HERO8-Black-Dual-Battery-Charger-Bonus-Battery%2F199369934&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart will be offering the popular 4K action cam for just $250&lt;/a&gt; from November 10th through November 14th. The bundle also includes a dual battery charger and a total of three batteries, so you’ll never run out of juice. This rugged digital camera is perfectly suited for capturing fast-moving action wherever and whenever it happens. HyperSmooth technology provides an amazing level of image stabilization, while the LiveBurst feature automatically records anything that happens two seconds before and two seconds after your shot. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20891984/gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera-image-stabilization-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q7R0XL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10319874"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwKlAu"&gt;One of our favorite budget tablets from last year just got a little cheaper. The Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 is &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Tab-A7-32GB-10-4-Wi-Fi-Gray-SM-T500NZABXAR%2F882296471" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;going to be on sale at Walmart for $140&lt;/a&gt; from November 10th through November 14th. This brings it well below the lowest price we’ve seen for this particular model, which features 32GB of internal storage and a 10.4-inch display. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150980/samsung-galaxy-tab-a7-tablet-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted how impressed we were with the vibrant display and sturdy build quality of this unassuming tablet. It’s not going to rival, say, the latest iPad Air or Mini, but it remains a solid entertainment device, especially if you plan to consume Amazon content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UxwtI2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9581085"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="DC2Mly"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="qSby2y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
