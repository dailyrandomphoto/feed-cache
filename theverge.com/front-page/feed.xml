    <title>New trailers: In the Heights, the WeWork documentary, Concrete Cowboy and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mTuNk5prU9ow_n0IfFQXh7HaImw=/326x0:1531x803/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69002318/ramos.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Anthony Ramos stars in In the Heights | Warner Bros.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uFtcwt"&gt;So I have utterly failed at trying not to watch &lt;em&gt;Hannibal&lt;/em&gt; right before bed; it definitely makes for weird dreams but it’s so &lt;em&gt;good. &lt;/em&gt;I’m about halfway through season 2 now and getting very nervous for some of the characters I don’t remember from&lt;em&gt; Silence of the Lambs &lt;/em&gt;and/or&lt;em&gt; Red Dragon. &lt;/em&gt;I also hav&lt;em&gt;e Promising Young Woman &lt;/em&gt;queued up and trying to avoid spoilers for&lt;em&gt; The Falcon and the Winter Soldier &lt;/em&gt;until I can watch the first episode. Honestly too much good streaming content to keep up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GERG3X"&gt;That said, though, I am very excited by this week’s lineup because we have new trailers, plural, for &lt;em&gt;In the Heights&lt;/em&gt;, the movie adaptation of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s first Broadway play (he also wrote another one you may have heard of, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/theater/review-in-hamilton-lin-manuel-miranda-forges-democracy-through-rap.html"&gt;about Alexander Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;). Directed by Jon M. Chu, who directed &lt;em&gt;Crazy Rich Asians&lt;/em&gt;, the trailers have a lot of familiar faces from &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;, including Miranda as the Piragua Guy, Christopher Jackson (George Washington) as the Mr. Softee driver, and as narrator and main character Usnavi is Anthony Ramos, who played both John Laurens and Philip Hamilton. Let’s goooo...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Yib4DY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V4CRPvel2Vc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XAOR8W"&gt;In the Heights &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hIs0iG"&gt;Also starring in &lt;em&gt;In the Heights:&lt;/em&gt; Corey Hawkins, Melissa Barrera, Olga Merediz, Daphne Rubin-Vega, Gregory Diaz IV, Stephanie Beatriz, Dascha Polanco, and Jimmy Smits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rqdMlb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u5pTICZ2oeg?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=8&amp;amp;start=8" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SVZNG5"&gt;In the Heights- Washington Heights trailer &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="fmqXFM"&gt;I absolutely &lt;strong&gt;cannot wait. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Heights&lt;/em&gt; comes to HBO Max and theaters June 11th (the trailers say June 18th, but Chu announced on Twitter it was moving up a week): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Dh1RPW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Surprise. We coming to Theaters one week earlier!!! There has been so much demand since our trailer release this week that we decided to get it out to you sooner. Let’s gooooooooooooo!!!! See you soon. JUNE 11th 2021. &lt;a href="https://t.co/P5NB6z3INB"&gt;https://t.co/P5NB6z3INB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jon M. Chu (@jonmchu) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonmchu/status/1372718245321482244?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="THFsw7"&gt;Yes there are a few other trailers this week too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5Ag8tH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HVAESeO7dgc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0bQiRC"&gt;WeWork: Or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="tTJ9JX"&gt;This documentary tells the story of the co-working business that grew into a massive company only to flame out in spectacular fashion after releasing its&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1533523/000119312519220499/d781982ds1.htm"&gt;bonkers S-1&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also a TV &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/anne-hathaway-joins-jared-leto-in-apple-wework-tv-series"&gt;show in the works&lt;/a&gt; (based on the &lt;em&gt;WeCrashed &lt;/em&gt;podcast) that will star Anne Hathaway and Jared Leto, but this doc looks to be tightly focused on WeWork CEO Adam Neumann, who was at the center of it all. &lt;em&gt;WeWork &lt;/em&gt;comes to Hulu April 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kSF1I7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w8Pr9V2M-rE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4dn5kK"&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nrZHHZ"&gt;I have to state for the record that I think Godzilla would win a head-to-head with King Kong. This is the latest trailer for the go-big-or-go-home monster movie that stars Alexander Skarsgard, Millie Bobby Brown, Rebecca Hall, and Brian Tyree Henry. It’s slated to hit HBO Max March 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LBAak6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WZ3dgHqaw8U?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="m9czgs"&gt;Concrete Cowboy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LjC4DO"&gt;Another movie long-delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, &lt;em&gt;Concrete Cowboy&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of a son reuniting with his estranged father who works at a stable in the inner city rehabilitating horses. Based on the novel &lt;em&gt;Ghetto Cowboy&lt;/em&gt; by G. Neri, &lt;em&gt;Concrete Cowboy&lt;/em&gt; is directed by Ricky Staub and stars Idris Elba (honestly, so riveting in the trailer), Jharrel Jerome, Byron Bowers, Lorraine Toussaint, and Clifford “Method Man” Smith. It hits Netflix April 2nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="74etdz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uDDCulgiqs4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Nd9sMs"&gt;Four Good Days&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KyMrhg"&gt;Glenn Close is mother to Mila Kunis’ heroin addict, and trying to help her get clean once and for all. Glenn Close is so intense in the trailer in the very best watchful-worried-mom way. &lt;em&gt;Four Good Days&lt;/em&gt; was co-written and directed by Rodrigo Garcia, and is based on the outstanding piece &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2016/07/23/numb/"&gt;How’s Amanda? A story of truth, lies and an American addiction&lt;/a&gt; by Eli Saslow of the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;.  The film comes to theaters April 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQSZPO"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I love the earnest Google reviews of vaccination sites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-VACCINES" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P7wQ3O5WFemaKGsAADk37htg4_Q=/0x28:4706x3165/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69001817/1230841242.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Angela Weiss / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HF28ng"&gt;The first person I knew personally who got their COVID-19 vaccine was my grandma, and the news that a shot was officially in her arm was the best thing I’d heard since the pandemic began. Since then, more and more of my family and friends (and their families) have been vaccinated, and the jolt of happiness is still just as exhilarating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5jwby"&gt;I get emotional hearing about people I don’t know getting vaccinated, too. Turns out, I’m a huge softie when it comes to people getting protected from a deadly disease! Social media is full of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/27/22304009/vaccine-selfies-stickers-photo-antivirus-covid-coronavirus"&gt;post-jab selfies&lt;/a&gt; that will make me tear up a little during the workday. And this week, my wonderful co-worker Kait Sanchez pointed me in the direction of another way to soak up the joy of the newly vaccinated: the Google reviews of COVID-19 vaccination sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AuGDp0"&gt;Normally, I’m &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/smarter-living/trust-negative-product-reviews.html"&gt;appropriately skeptical&lt;/a&gt; when reading any online reviews since they’re highly subjective and usually only by people whose experiences were extremely good or extremely bad. But I threw that out the window scrolling through the latest reviews of the Javits Center in New York City, which I now fully believe is a happy place for people with vaccine appointments. It’s “so impressive,” one now-immunized person wrote. Someone who took their mom to an appointment wrote that “the service we received was beautiful.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kAC_oxQIRUmhHaGvflVQf9Mm7lk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382839/javits.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Google review from the Javits Center in New York City.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fpwQm8"&gt;People in Arizona are excited to get their shots at Chandler-Gilbert Community College. I’m so happy for Ken, who said he’s “half way to wonderful” after getting his first dose of the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/39pxtTlIKnFZDd4vWJYLVezT2kE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382855/chandler_gilbert_commuity_college_az.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google reviews for Chandler-Gilbert Community College in Arizona.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SmGNYM"&gt;Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts is usually home to the New England Patriots and New England Revolution, but these days, it’s also&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a five-star-reviewed mass-vaccination site for the state. Sandi got vaccinated there and said it was a great experience, writing, “You’re in and out within 30 min, but of course you must take pics!” — and attaching those pics. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OLnT_Zpn8WGfusYi8XEd9Sa3vjk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382859/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_10.52.33_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Google review for Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9WADhZLvXZ5JT784YbTPbVvANvQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382861/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_10.52.59_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Google review for Gillette stadium.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yI90kC"&gt;I’m not sure what impulse pushed people to leave reviews for COVID-19 vaccination sites, but I’m grateful for whatever it is. They made my day. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says Tesla would be “shut down” if its cars were used for spying in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Billionaire Elon Musk Receives Axel Springer Award" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2zEtyxYv7T9Ql9EZ-oXZqnF8gzE=/0x173:4000x2840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69001756/1229901940.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lJyQ8o"&gt;Elon Musk said Saturday if Tesla vehicles were used to spy in China, the company would be shut down, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-forum-musk/musk-says-tesla-would-be-shut-down-if-its-cars-spied-in-china-elsewhere-idUSKBN2BC04Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/a&gt; Musk made the remark while speaking via video link to the China Development Forum, addressing reports that China has barred its military and government personnel from using Tesla vehicles over security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcg5Ip"&gt;“There’s a very strong incentive for us to be very confidential with any information,” Musk told the forum. “If Tesla used cars to spy in China or anywhere, we will get shut down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HB8mQ3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-restrict-tesla-usage-by-military-and-state-personnel-11616155643?mod=mhp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; Friday that people who work for China’s military, government agencies and “state-owned enterprises in sensitive industries” were prohibited from driving Teslas. China is concerned that Tesla’s exterior cameras, which constantly record footage, could be used to gather images to be sent back to the US, according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2J8L9h"&gt;China is a huge market for Tesla and for electric vehicles; according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; the carmaker sold 147,445 vehicles in the country last year, which accounted for 30 percent of its global total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCJOrt"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-09/tesla-s-tone-with-china-authorities-differs-from-musk-s-in-u-s?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, Tesla and its leader have taken a different tone with Chinese authorities than with their US counterparts. For example, last month &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/tesla-says-sorry-to-china-s-state-grid-for-charging-blame-video?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Tesla apologized&lt;/a&gt; that one of its staff had blamed China’s electrical grid for damaging a customer’s vehicle: “We are deeply sorry for the misunderstanding and would like to apologize to the Nanchang Power Grid for the inconvenience caused,” Tesla said in a video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Irgqcs"&gt;Musk and Tesla have been more aggressive in their responses to US authorities; the CEO once &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-04/musk-hung-up-on-ntsb-chief-in-testy-april-call-about-tesla-probe?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;hung up on a call&lt;/a&gt; with the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, and last year he butted heads &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/15/21259436/elon-musk-fremont-tesla-battle-alameda-county-coronavirus-legacy"&gt;with authorities in Alameda County, California&lt;/a&gt;, where Tesla’s Fremont plant is located, over coronavirus restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jV9Ex"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Utah is about to pass a law making iPhones filter porn — but only if other states pass one, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSYUt9wUmA1idAmZL4uJakkyf4Y=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69001670/vpavic_4279_20201107_0134.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OPZaro"&gt;In the next week, Utah’s governor will decide whether to make all phones and tablets in the state filter pornography... sort of. The bill, which passed Utah’s legislature earlier this month, would require mobile devices to “automatically enable a filter capable of blocking material that is harmful to minors.” &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/utah-campaign-against-porn-phone-filter-plan-d2f3911b7887f2f145918d1718bf2504"&gt;Gov. Spencer Cox has said&lt;/a&gt; he will “carefully consider” signing it by the March 25th deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McNY4G"&gt;But the rule won’t change anything in the immediate future — a fact one lawmaker even cited as a benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwLFFD"&gt;In theory, &lt;a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2021/bills/static/HB0072.html"&gt;Utah’s H.B. 72&lt;/a&gt; mandates active adult content filters on all smartphones and tablets sold in Utah. Phone makers would provide a passcode to let buyers disable the filter, although it’s not clear if they’d need to verify the buyer’s age beforehand. If a filter &lt;em&gt;isn’t &lt;/em&gt;automatically enabled when a user activates the device, its manufacturer can be held legally liable if a minor accesses harmful content, with a maximum fine of $10 per individual violation. (“Harmful” content can include “any description or representation” of nudity or sexual conduct that doesn’t have artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UEBKta"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The law would basically make manufacturers auto-enable child protection tools&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kN1CuS"&gt;Apple and Google both offer parental controls on iOS and Android devices, but they’re turned off by default. Bill supporters like the anti-pornography group &lt;a href="https://endsexualexploitation.org/articles/statement-utah-passes-critical-solution-to-protect-kids-from-pornography-on-smartphones-and-tablets/"&gt;National Center on Sexual Exploitation argue&lt;/a&gt; that the filters are too complicated to activate, “leaving most parents helpless to protect their kids online.” So the law is basically aimed at making companies automatically enable them and add barriers to turning them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GEmvIu"&gt;If this bill is signed, though, it could run into immediate constitutional challenges. The ACLU of Utah, which opposed the rule, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/acluutah/status/1359750262718672899"&gt;tweeted that&lt;/a&gt; it “infringes upon the general public’s First Amendment rights to freely access the internet.” The Supreme Court famously &lt;a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/062697decency.html"&gt;struck down the Communications Decency Act&lt;/a&gt;, which banned making indecent materials available to minors, in 1997. Child protection filters can easily catch innocuous materials, and requiring devices block large swathes of content may not fly in court, even if those filters can be turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqFMcn"&gt;Moreover, the rule includes a huge loophole: it doesn’t take effect until five other states pass equivalent laws. If none pass before 2031, the law will automatically sunset. And so far, Utah is the only place that’s even got one on the table. “We don’t know of any other states who are working on any plans right now,” says Electronic Frontier Foundation media relations director Rebecca Jeschke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vrW6bq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lawmakers may care more about a “strong message” than practical effects&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="67fe9o"&gt;The bill is arguably being passed more as a political statement than a serious or immediate change. &lt;a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/03/05/porn-blocking-bill-wins/"&gt;State Senator Todd Weiler approvingly noted&lt;/a&gt; that the five-state rule “gives us years, most likely, to iron out all of the problems, if there are problems,” and in the meantime, “it does send a strong message.” A colleague, Sen. Jake Anderegg, said the bill posed fatal logistical problems — although he voted for it anyway, saying he didn’t “want to be the guy” who stood in the way of a child protection bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noJ6Pf"&gt;That said, as Jeschke points out, it’s hardly the first proposal of its kind. In 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/04/states-introduce-dubious-legislation-ransom-internet"&gt;more than a dozen state legislatures considered&lt;/a&gt; the “Human Trafficking Prevention Act,” which would have required device manufacturers to preinstall “obscenity” filters and then force buyers to pay $20 to turn them off. That bill was defeated in some legislatures, and it was &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cd5c2f15584f4f2cab2fea2d8304dee8"&gt;withdrawn in others&lt;/a&gt; after controversy over its architect — &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/porn-filter-campaigner-has-been-convicted-of-harassment-and-assault"&gt;an anti-gay activist&lt;/a&gt; who tried to marry his computer as a publicity stunt. &lt;a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/12/31/utah-lawmaker-wants/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Salt Lake Tribune&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that H.B. 72 sponsor Rep. Susan Pulsipher “talked” to the man behind that bill, but she said other people had been involved with her legislation as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lP9SvQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/utah-christian-anti-porn-filter"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Mel &lt;/em&gt;magazine points out&lt;/a&gt;, the law is linked with a larger playbook for cracking down on sex work. Utah passed a resolution in 2016 declaring pornography a “public health hazard,” and last year, it passed a law requiring sites like Pornhub to &lt;a href="https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/porn-sites-start-complying-with-utah-warning-label-law"&gt;add warning labels&lt;/a&gt; inside the state. In total, over a dozen states have passed language &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/9c91cfd28a7b461b87948f36117a432e"&gt;declaring a porn health crisis&lt;/a&gt;. So it’s possible other lawmakers will try to follow Utah’s lead — but it’s just as possible the law will fade away without ever taking effect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tenet coming to HBO Max — which director Nolan called the “worst streaming service” —on May 1st</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gtfntXnJ_tIibzhl0hFVhM1e2-U=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69001625/tenet_poster.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RXu1Ij"&gt;Christopher Nolan’s time-shifting thriller &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; will debut on HBO Max May 1st, just a few months after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22162918/christopher-nolan-tenet-hbo-max-warner-bros-streaming-service-cinematic-releases"&gt;director called it&lt;/a&gt; the “worst streaming service.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCDNEN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; was scheduled to be released in theaters last July, but had its opening date &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/20/21331356/tenet-delayed-warner-bros-christopher-nolan-international-disney"&gt;delayed several times&lt;/a&gt; because of the coronavirus pandemic. It debuted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21340447/tenet-release-date-united-states-international-delay-theaters-nolan"&gt;theaters outside the US&lt;/a&gt;, including Canada, France, Japan, and the UK in August, and in US theaters in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="geBxMY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Good news for anyone experiencing time linearly: Tenet is streaming May 1 on HBO via HBO Max! ⌛️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/dGbxGLOwyu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dGbxGLOwyu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— HBO Max (@hbomax) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbomax/status/1373333520047861766?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d5v7aQ"&gt;Nolan, long a proponent of watching movies on the big screen, was bluntly critical of Warner Bros.’ decision to release all of its 2021 films &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;. He said in a statement that “Some of our industry’s biggest filmmakers and most important movie stars went to bed the night before thinking they were working for the greatest movie studio and woke up to find out they were working for the worst streaming service.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DAYrqx"&gt;Reports at the time suggested that the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/business/media/warner-bros-hbo-max-movies-pay.html"&gt;studio kept filmmakers and stars in the dark&lt;/a&gt; about its streaming plans, and Nolan said many were caught off-guard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpC0AH"&gt;“There’s such controversy around it, because [Warner Bros.] didn’t tell anyone,” he &lt;a href="https://www.etonline.com/christopher-nolan-reflects-on-tenet-release-reacts-to-warner-broshbo-max-deal-exclusive-157414"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;ETOnline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in December. “In 2021, they’ve got some of the top filmmakers in the world, they’ve got some of the biggest stars in the world who worked for years in some cases on these projects very close to their hearts that are meant to be big-screen experiences. They’re meant to be out there for the widest possible audiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19GXLv"&gt;HBO Max, which launched in May 2020, had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252069/hbo-max-subscribers-wonder-woman-1984-att-earnings"&gt;nearly 40 million US subscribers&lt;/a&gt; as of January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QwKEcq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;, which stars John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, Michael Caine, and Kenneth Branagh, has grossed more than $363 million worldwide since its release. It’s up for two Oscars: Best Achievement in Visual Effects and Best Achievement in Production Design.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>V-Moda M-200 ANC review: $500 headphones can’t be this unpolished</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;V-Moda’s first noise-canceling headphones are built well and have balanced sound, but they fall short on features&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="tmz4ke"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max just might have ushered in a new norm of $500-plus wireless headphones. My argument in support of this? V-Moda’s new M-200 ANC headphones, which sell for $499.99 and, as the name makes obvious, are the company’s first headphones to include active noise cancellation. V-Moda is a company that’s well-known in the DJ world, and prior headphones like the original M100s and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16152736/v-moda-crossfade-2-wireless-review-bluetooth-headphones"&gt;Crossfade 2 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; have earned it some fans in the audiophile crowd. With the M-200 ANCs, V-Moda is trying to compete in a higher price bracket than ever before — but the results are a little uneven. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8MQcE"&gt;If there’s one thing that V-Moda has never wavered on, it’s durability. Like past models, the M-200 ANC headphones feel phenomenally strong and reassuring no matter how harshly you handle them. These things are built like tanks. My old pair of M100s must be at least seven or eight years old at this point, but the folding joints and other core hardware have never given out — even long after the headband material has started to wear and show its age. I still use ‘em as a gaming headset with V-Moda’s add-on boom mic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4BBYA"&gt;I think it’s fair to question whether this is the same V-Moda that it used to be; before the company was sold to Roland, I’d regularly sit down with founder Val Kolton, who seemed to hold the brand to an obsessive level of quality assurance. But so far, I don’t see any reason to question the robustness of these new headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="30GST9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10401766"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yOZWJb"&gt;The M-200 ANCs stick with the usual V-Moda aesthetic: it’s mostly a mix of metal and artificial leather. They also still fold down into the company’s signature carrying case. However, the size of the shield plates on each ear cup has changed. So if you’ve got old, customized plates, those will no longer fit. The ear pads (filled with memory foam) now attach magnetically and feel nice and cushiony. It used to be that you had to buy V-Moda’s aftermarket “XL” earpads for the best extended comfort, but not so this time around. I’m also glad they’re so easy to replace. Magnets!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHEC7s"&gt;There are buttons at the top of the right ear cup for play / pause and volume controls, and this is where the M-200 ANCs start to betray their asking price. The buttons are mushy, which I can understand since that means they don’t click loudly as you’re listening to music. It can still feel a bit cheap. Aside from this, their location so far at the top can make them awkward to reach when you’re actually wearing the headphones. Maybe it’s just my enormous head, but I struggled at times. The buttons at the bottom for power and noise cancellation are much simpler to reach (and for some reason, they’re clickier, too). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RcIzC-5iPndF4LqNsmL6bBagE_g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382875/VModaControls.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The music control buttons can be a little cumbersome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ub-DTGbGJ4rk094lzkKk9a_IPY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382877/VModaUSBC.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;V-Moda has made the switch to USB-C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5FNiPv"&gt;Out of the box with EQ settings left untouched, the M-200 ANCs have an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; neutral sound profile. I don’t know that I’d call them reference studio monitors, but they’re very flat. This can make for a jarring change if you’re switching over from other headphones like the AirPods Max or Sennheiser’s Momentum Wireless cans, which try to show you everything they’re sonically worth right off the bat without any adjustments. In this case, you’ll want to immediately explore the EQ presets (V-Moda’s app lets you take full manual control) to find something that sounds the best to you. Even if you crank the low-frequency sliders, the M-200 ANCs won’t rattle your brain. But you can get them to a point where EDM and hip-hop don’t underwhelm, which they can if you stick with the default, balanced EQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Urqfdu"&gt;When you do take the time to nail the EQ, the M-200 ANCs sound very good. V-Moda downsized to 40-millimeter drivers (from 50mm in the original M-200), but these headphones do a terrific job of preserving the mids through all sorts of EQ adjustments. “$500 noise-canceling headphones with neutral sound” strikes me as an odd zone to be playing in, but V-Moda can certainly paint itself as a standout here. They support aptX HD, aptX, AAC, and SBC Bluetooth codecs, so they’re well-rounded for wireless audio. I also tested them wired with my Apple Lossless files and streaming Amazon Music HD, and the M-200 ANCs proved wonderfully layered and rich. (They don’t seem to pass audio over USB-C, unfortunately, so that port is just for charging.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjZhDl"&gt;I’ve noticed that V-Moda’s app can be buggy; sometimes it’ll display a spinning loading indicator that never goes anywhere. The M-200 ANCs have also given me “iPhone can no longer connect to this device” errors, which required me to pair the headphones all over again. Roland needs to put more work into its software. Most frustrating of all is that the M-200 ANCs can only store two paired devices in memory. If you add a third, the first one will be overwritten. Want to switch between a phone, tablet, and PC without much fuss? Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JG7gXpHrgDOg_1mBdU2eCtR4dpo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382881/VModaDriver.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M-200 ANC ear pads attach to the headphones magnetically. Underneath them are these 40mm drivers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iUCtvS"&gt;These headphones don’t have a dedicated transparency mode that you can toggle on for hearing outside noise. But V-Moda did &lt;em&gt;blatantly&lt;/em&gt; steal a trick from Sony: you can hold a hand on the left ear cup, the music will drop in volume, and ambient noise will be piped in using the built-in microphones. Once you remove your hand, your music volume and ANC return to normal. That’s a useful feature for quick interactions or listening to an announcement at an airport or on a train, but at $500, I would’ve liked to see some way of keeping transparency mode enabled for as long as desired — no arm-lifting required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mr67QDQv916p4MA9hIG4lpT3u2Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382896/VModaCase.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;V-Moda might have the best carrying case around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BaKLBkcSKVPDPuDNmXq9aRZ3e6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382898/VModaEars.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M-200 ANCs don’t uncomfortably clamp down on your head.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tGg8ML"&gt;The M-200 ANCs lack sensors for detecting when they’ve been removed from your ears, so they won’t pause audio automatically like other premium noise-canceling headphones. Again, for $500, those extra convenience tricks should be part of the experience. Another would be multipoint Bluetooth pairing, which these headphones don’t give you either. Battery life is rated at 20 hours, which is on par with Bose and Apple but short of Sony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="LWOrQp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10401801"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uurxca"&gt;V-Moda is new to noise cancellation, and it shows. The M-200 ANCs can’t rise to the level of the AirPods Max or even lower-priced options like Sony’s 1000XM4s or the Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700. They’ll cut out a lot of lower-frequency noise, but the overall effect isn’t quite on the level of competitors. The V-Moda app lets you choose between 10 levels of noise cancellation, but even fully dialed up, I never quite felt like I was in that personal bubble of silence that the best ANC headphones provide. On the positive side, V-Moda’s noise cancellation didn’t result in any discomfort, nor did it noticeably alter the sound, which can happen with some headphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YyjjhPIB8mhqZSkBHlh4-Z95F3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382887/VModaMax.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who will be next to join the $500 noise-canceling headphones squad?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HYww7p"&gt;Along with the headphones and case, V-Moda includes a 3.5-millimeter cable, USB-C charging cable, and an airplane adapter. I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wish the company had bundled its BoomPro microphone — sold separately for $35 — right in the box with the M-200 ANCs. It feels like a missed opportunity, as the BoomPro is truly a great accessory for gaming and Zoom calls. Keep in mind that Apple didn’t even include a headphone cable with the AirPods Max, so I can’t knock V-Moda too hard, but this would’ve been a prime moment to give customers that bonus. It also would’ve helped boost the M-200 ANCs at voice call performance. As is, the built-in microphones are nothing special, and callers might find it difficult to hear you in loud or windy environments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="NIqCZK"&gt;I genuinely wonder if V-Moda would have priced these things at $500 in a world without the AirPods Max. With Apple’s cans set aside, you’d be looking at an upper echelon of Bluetooth headphones with options like the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins PX7 and Sennheiser Momentum 3 that tops out around $400. (No, I haven’t forgotten about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21409031/bang-olufsen-beoplay-h95-noise-canceling-headphones-announced"&gt;those $800 Beoplay H95s&lt;/a&gt;, but come on.) The M-200 ANCs are a solid pair of wireless headphones, and they maintain V-Moda’s fantastic build quality. But it’s impossible to overlook what’s missing when a company is asking for this much cash. The balanced sound signature will be a definite win for people who are explicitly looking for that. But these really needed to have a true transparency mode and better ANC to keep up with the pack and to warrant the significant investment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s version of a MacBook Pro looks even better than a real one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PKfzK4MEgHc9NL_E6dxEaIyDTDA=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68996280/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_1.50.09_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="48SGu8"&gt;Intel launched a new ad campaign starring Justin Long, Apple’s “I’m a Mac” actor, but for this campaign, Long is singing the praises of PC laptops and comparing them to MacBooks. The thing is, for reasons that we can’t quite figure out, Intel actually made the MacBook Pros in its commercials look &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than they do in real life, as spotted by &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/my4ZjCUkTsI"&gt;tech YouTuber Rene Ritchie&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHxUsS"&gt;Take a look at these two photos. The one on the left is a photo of a MacBook Pro with an M1 chip taken for &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; review. The one on the right is taken from &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rvDDC6ktCUg"&gt;this Intel ad&lt;/a&gt;. Can you spot the difference? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gCbYEy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10402291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EQAO3Z"&gt;I’ll spoil it for you: Intel’s version of the MacBook Pro has &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; thinner screen bezels, making it a nearly edge-to-edge display. I’d love it if my MacBook’s bezels were this thin! (Though Intel’s version of a MacBook Pro doesn’t have a webcam. Bummer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfrVaf"&gt;But Intel’s fabled all-screen MacBook Pro didn’t make just one appearance. It’s also &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9gtRRMd2_UI"&gt;in this ad&lt;/a&gt;, which attempts to ding the MacBook Pro for not being a 2-in-1. Look at that Mac — all screen! &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Umm86hxxxDCxyXPZek-082_221Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22383686/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_10.08.32_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="deOxPX"&gt;Intel did confirm to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Friday that it used real MacBook Pros with an M1 chip in the commercials, but the company wouldn’t initially say what it may or may not have changed about them: “With respect to filming and showcasing details, we’re not commenting at this time,” an Intel spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NmIWF"&gt;However, Intel’s Ryan Shrout confirmed a likely theory on Saturday: Intel changed the look of the MacBook Pros’ screens in post-production, which had the happenstance effect of making their screens look better than they do in real life. It was a rush job, apparently, and they made a mistake when compositing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6ZhPwq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Also, the composite on the Macs made the bezels look smaller than they should be, another mistake in composite due to time. We recorded using the current shipping M1-based machines.&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan Shrout (@ryanshrout) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ryanshrout/status/1373339942533926917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e0FVO2"&gt;(If you look at the image from the second ad, you can also see some kind of blackish-haze applied over the screen, which probably wouldn’t be there in reality.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Q96gD"&gt;These ads, in my opinion, are also kind of missing the point. None of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvDDC6ktCUg"&gt;Intel’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gtRRMd2_UI"&gt;four&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfHplU5fatE"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HebkohrCns"&gt;commercials&lt;/a&gt; demonstrate how Intel’s chips can compete with the MacBook Pro’s real advantage: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;Apple’s speedy and battery-efficient M1 chip&lt;/a&gt;. (So far, Intel has only produced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272041/intel-apple-macbook-m1-performance-benchmarks-processors"&gt;cherry-picked benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; to try and hit back at the M1.) And by trying to dunk on the MacBook Pro, Intel is also, in a way, dunking on itself, since it still provides chips for some models of the Apple laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1k50q1"&gt;And seriously, doesn’t that all-screen MacBook Pro just look &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnauH2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 20th, 9PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Intel’s confirmation that it was a compositing error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4IsIoq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Shrout tweeted on Saturday, not Sunday, because it is not Sunday yet. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22340964/twitter-accounts-bots-days-of-the-week-what-day-is-it"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I blame Daniel Craig.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This tiny car beat Tesla’s Model 3 as the best-selling EV in the world for January and February</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W_KTQ0pWWLh8V3MwV_N24ez5K3k=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68999986/1024px_Wuling_Hongguang_Mini_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Jengtingchen" target="_blank"&gt;Jengtingchen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xp09Gq"&gt;The Hong Guang Mini EV edged out Tesla’s Model 3 as the &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/491293/global-plugin-car-sales-january-2021/"&gt;top-selling electric vehicle&lt;/a&gt; in the world in January &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/495187/china-plugin-car-sales-february-2021/"&gt;and February&lt;/a&gt;, not a small feat for the relatively new hatchback. More than 36,000 of the tiny cars sold in January, compared to about 21,500 Model 3s, and the Hong Guang sold just over 20,000 units last month, compared to just under 13,700 Tesla 3s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDU1Py"&gt;The diminutive vehicle is made under a joint partnership between China’s state-owned SAIC Motor, Wuling Motors, and US carmaker General Motors, and is locally referred to simply as Wuling. The Hong Guang Mini EV sells in China only for 28,800 yuan, or about $4,500. It claims to get 170 kilometers (roughly 106 miles) per charge, and can reach a top speed of 100 kilometers per hour or 62 miles per hour (so no drag racing in this thing). &lt;a href="https://www.topgear.com.ph/news/car-news/2020-wuling-hong-guang-mini-ev-specs-prices-features-a962-20201026"&gt;Its specs include&lt;/a&gt; a wheelbase of 76.4 inches, and it is just under 115 inches long, 59 inches wide, and stands about 64 inches tall. Its total weight is about 1,466 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hVQML"&gt;In other words, it’s tall but skinny. Still, the manufacturer claims it can seat four people, and the rear seats fold down if you need storage space. For something very small, presumably. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1H1Eg"&gt;The 2021 base model of Tesla’s Model 3 EV on the other hand, gets more than 250 miles per charge, and its sticker price starts at just under $40,000. It has a wheelbase of 113 inches, is 185 inches long, 73 inches wide and about 57 inches tall. The base Model 3 weighs around 3,500 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODWpUG"&gt;The Hong Guang Mini EV launched last summer and was a &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/442357/wuling-15000-hong-guang-mini-ev-august/"&gt;surprise success&lt;/a&gt;, but is still only sold in China. Some &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/36218/this-adorable-four-seater-electric-hatchback-is-selling-like-crazy-in-china"&gt;reports suggest&lt;/a&gt; that it may come to other markets eventually, but the US is likely low on the list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8FUP3"&gt;It is cute, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="In8tu3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brazil regulator fines Apple $2 million for not including chargers with iPhone 12</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The dual camera system on the iPhone 12." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pgZL-7aIOLb2ZnWU4HIhu4bDJEc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68999752/vpavic_4243_20201018_0139.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9RLt8N"&gt;The consumer protection agency in Brazil’s São Paulo state has fined Apple $2 million for failing to include chargers within iPhone 12 boxes, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/20/brazil-agency-fines-apple-iphone-12-charger/"&gt;according to&lt;em&gt; 9to5 Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Procon-SP says Apple engaged in “misleading advertising, selling a device without the charger and unfair terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhGqAY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;Apple announced in October&lt;/a&gt; that the iPhone 12 and would not come with chargers or earbuds in their boxes, citing environmental concerns. By only including a USB-C to Lightning cable with iPhone 12 and other new models, Apple said it would be able to reduce the raw materials for each iPhone it sells, in addition to reducing the size of the phones’ boxes. Critics suggested the change had more to do with allowing Apple to reduce shipping costs, and environmental experts said the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519466/apple-iphone-12-chargers-airpods-greenhouse-gas-emissions-e-waste"&gt;impact on the environment would likely be minimal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5YEJv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.procon.sp.gov.br/procon-na-midia/"&gt;Procon&lt;/a&gt; said it asked Apple whether the company would reduce the iPhone 12’s price since there were no chargers included, and did not receive a response. The agency also accused the company of failing to help customers who had “problems with some functions” on their iPhones following updates. A spokesman for the agency said Apple “needs to respect these laws and these institutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rL1kTN"&gt;The fine does not seem like it would be particularly troubling for Apple, which had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252663/apple-q1-2021-earnings-iphone-12-mac-sales"&gt;$111.4 billion in revenue&lt;/a&gt; in the first quarter of 2021 (that total includes 2020 holiday sales of iPhone 12 models). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mw50E"&gt;Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6HHwGE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPhone 12 review: raising the bar","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Coinbase pays $6.5 million to settle trading investigation with CFTC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="the coinbase logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PAXWpt2s2f0G6FppAlP2yjgs3KM=/0x0:3888x2592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68999509/1231429911.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j2Prig"&gt;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said &lt;a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8369-21"&gt;in a news release&lt;/a&gt; Friday that cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase has paid $6.5 million to settle regulators’ claims that it reported misleading transaction data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2DNgW"&gt;According to the CFTC, between January 2015 and September 2018 “Coinbase recklessly delivered false, misleading, or inaccurate reports concerning transactions in digital assets.” The agency alleges that two trading programs operated  by Coinbase generated orders that traded with each other, which could have misled traders about the trading volume on the exchange now called Coinbase Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WDjHg"&gt;The CFTC also fined Coinbase for what are known as “&lt;a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/CFTCGlossary/index.htm#washsales"&gt;wash trades&lt;/a&gt;” in the Litecoin cryptocurrency and bitcoin that were conducted by a former Coinbase employee on Coinbase’s GDAX platform. Wash trades are banned because they create a false appearance of trading volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGsix7"&gt;A Coinbase spokesperson said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;  that it did not admit or deny the CFTC’s charges, and had “proactively engaged with the CFTC” over the course of its investigation. The staement notes that the settlement order “does not include any finding of harm to any Coinbase customer.” The company says it “firmly believe[s] that Coinbase has always aimed to create a reliable and secure trading environment for the benefit of our customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pLd4X"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300835/coinbase-s1-bitcoin-going-public-profit-revenue-invest-crypto"&gt;Coinbase publicly filed&lt;/a&gt; paperwork to list its stock on the NASDAQ exchange. According to the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm#i86a9d9b35e45447ea6eb369e5dcf1e6a_1197"&gt;S-1 prospectus&lt;/a&gt;, Coinbase had 43 million verified users at the end of 2020, with a total of $90 billion of assets held in trust. Since its founding in 2012 as a platform for bitcoin trading, Coinbase has handled some $456 billion of transactions. Last year, it had revenue of $1.2 billion, turning a profit of $322 million. &lt;/p&gt;
