    <title>Octopath Traveler is coming to Xbox Game Pass, and Undertale has just arrived  </title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Xbox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WgUfLH"&gt;Xbox &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/16/coming-soon-xbox-game-pass-march-2021-wave-2/"&gt;is announcing the next round of games coming to Game Pass&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a pretty stacked deck with games like &lt;em&gt;Undertale &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Octopath Traveler, &lt;/em&gt;both of which are coming to Xbox for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fwnn8O"&gt;Coming to all the Game Pass platforms (cloud, console, and PC) are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="5u3yxG"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt; (available today)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kIMhx0"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Empire of Sin &lt;/em&gt;(Available March 18th)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UqygYm"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yakuza 6: The Song of Life &lt;/em&gt;(March 25th)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tYv8Jy"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Narita Boy &lt;/em&gt;(March 30th)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="TOAuEm"&gt;Coming to just cloud and console is &lt;em&gt;Outriders&lt;/em&gt; (April 1st), and coming to just console and PC are &lt;em&gt;Octopath Traveler&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;/em&gt;, both on March 25th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6j2aS"&gt;The PC is also getting some love, with a few of games being added to the platform that were previously not available to PC Game Pass subscribers: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="EiDydI"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Nier: Automata &lt;/em&gt;(March 18th)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Hl6mOr"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Torchlight III&lt;/em&gt; (March 18th)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="74hx94"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire - Ultimate Edition&lt;/em&gt; (March 25th)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="txqnSp"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Supraland&lt;/em&gt; (March 25th)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="acjy7J"&gt;And finally, as if there weren’t enough games,&lt;em&gt; Star Wars: Squadrons &lt;/em&gt;will be available on EA Play for console players starting on March 18th. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will have access to the game through the included EA Play subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bn1vOt"&gt;Overall, there are some great games in here if you’re a Game Pass subscriber, whether you stream your games, play them on console or PC, or some of each. &lt;em&gt;Undertale &lt;/em&gt;coming to the service (and platform) feels like a &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt;, given the game’s incredible popularity and the fact that it’s been available on most platforms for a while now (it was released on the PlayStation Vita &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16151292/undertale-playstation-4-vita-release"&gt;almost three years ago&lt;/a&gt;). The game was first released in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxS4hD"&gt;Of course, many of these games are also becoming available for purchase on the Xbox as well, for those who prefer owning their games. And, as always, there must be some sort of balance in the universe, so three games will be leaving Game Pass on March 31st: &lt;em&gt;HyperDot&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Journey to the Savage Planet&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Machinarium. &lt;/em&gt;If you’ve been meaning to play any of those titles, it’s probably time to hop on it! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foxconn says it might build EVs at empty Wisconsin site, or in Mexico</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Foxconn’s “Fab”in Wisconsin. A state report says it no signs that it manufactures LCDs, or ever will" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vuIYBVJ9ETWze2iXZqvBH9KhjUs=/0x3:7192x4798/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68975977/Foxconn_proof_08_080520_3892.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://aerialscapes.com" target="_blank"&gt;Curtis Waltz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SyrArT"&gt;The chairman of Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn says the electronics giant is considering making electric vehicles at its mostly empty worksite in Wisconsin, where the company originally planned to make LCD panels. Either that, or Foxconn may make EVs in Mexico. The decision will be made by July 1st, chairman Young Liu said &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-wisconsin-mexico-scott-walker-taipei-313ff82519f7ac551f1a149eebf82b4e"&gt;at a press conference Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpnKjf"&gt;Best known for manufacturing iPhones, Foxconn has recently shifted some of its attention to the booming electric vehicle space as a way to diversify its revenue. Late last year, the conglomerate announced an EV platform on which &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/iphone-to-electric-cars-foxconn-reveals-ev-platform-promises-battery-breakthroughs/"&gt;other companies could build&lt;/a&gt;. This year, Foxconn announced tie-ups with China’s largest private automaker, Geely, and with a number of EV startups. It has agreed to build an electric vehicle with Fisker Inc., struggling startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212994/byton-foxconn-electric-vehicles-china-shutdown-extended"&gt;Byton&lt;/a&gt;, and may even build one with Faraday Future (as part of the deal with Geely), which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22247942/faraday-future-spac-merger-public-psac-property-solutions-nasdaq"&gt;now flush with cash after years on the brink&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jokfxm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Foxconn is considering Wisconsin or Mexico and will decide by July&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mY0Rrp"&gt;Foxconn also announced an EV partnership &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069288/foxconn-fiat-chrysler-electric-vehicles-china-joint-venture"&gt;with Fiat Chrysler in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, though neither company has commented on the project since. (Fiat Chrysler is now called Stellantis.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkEZwW"&gt;Fisker Inc. founder Henrik Fisker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298878/foxconn-fisker-ev-electric-vehicle-wisconsin-deal-fsr-suv"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; there was a “very good chance” that it would build a vehicle with Foxconn in Wisconsin, though the chairman’s comments Tuesday are the first time the Taiwanese company confirmed its interest in using the facility. Liu also said Foxconn is &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-assembler-foxconn-hints-at-making-electric-vehicles-in-u-s-11615905476"&gt;considering building EVs for multiple partners&lt;/a&gt; but dismissed rumors that it would work with Apple, which is developing an autonomous electric car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3QJsR"&gt;Foxconn broke ground on the factory in Wisconsin in 2018, after netting some $4 billion in tax credits and other incentives from state and local governments. The company promised it would invest $10 billion, build a 20-million-square-foot facility, and create 13,000 jobs all to make LCD panels. Former president Donald Trump once &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;called the site the “eighth wonder of the world.”&lt;/a&gt; The company said it wanted to build the Silicon Valley of the Midwest, calling it “Wisconn Valley.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YDI6Qt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside Foxconn’s empty buildings, empty factories, and empty promises in Wisconsin","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"},{"title":"Foxconn will build a new electric vehicle for Fisker","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298878/foxconn-fisker-ev-electric-vehicle-wisconsin-deal-fsr-suv"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5FmCbt"&gt;But that never happened. Foxconn has spent the intervening years narrowing the scope of its ambitions in Wisconsin, barely hitting hiring targets set by the state along the way, and has invested just 3 percent of that $10 billion total to date. The biggest structure it’s built measures only 1 million square feet. It was recently reclassified in official documents as a storage facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvD1Nr"&gt;Though Foxconn initially claimed it would manufacture LCD panels at the site, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;in reality&lt;/a&gt; the company has spent years searching for a viable product to manufacture in Wisconsin. For a time, it said it would use the space to create an “AI 8K+5G ecosystem” — though the company never coherently explained what that means. Foxconn also publicly considered &lt;a href="https://www.wpr.org/failed-partnerships-and-vacant-buildings-foxconns-wisconsin-commitment-remains-standstill"&gt;making coffee robots&lt;/a&gt; and, in the early throes of the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21213269/foxconn-ventilators-wisconsin-plant-medtronic-pb-560-open-source-design-covid-19"&gt;ventilators&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5FtlA"&gt;“I took over the Wisconsin task, and I need to make it a viable one, so I need to find a product that fits that location,” &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-wisconsin-mexico-scott-walker-taipei-313ff82519f7ac551f1a149eebf82b4e"&gt;said Liu&lt;/a&gt;, referring to how he inherited the project from previous chairman (and Foxconn founder) Terry Gou, who left the company to take on an ill-fated bid for president of Taiwan. “Whether it’s Wisconsin or Mexico, it’s not political, it’s business from my perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jade Raymond announces new Sony game studio just months after leaving Stadia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inside The 2016 E3 Electronic Entertainment Expo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LA6HuamQqcSOg08wuWFPqiUaEY4=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68975698/539774786.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="53vCQF"&gt;Longtime industry veteran Jade Raymond is heading up a new studio that will create original games for PlayStation. Raymond announced the news today via the &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/03/16/introducing-haven-a-new-montreal-based-independent-studio/#sf243985526"&gt;PlayStation Blog&lt;/a&gt;. “We want to create worlds where players can escape, have fun, express themselves, and find community,” Raymond wrote about the new studio, Haven. “We want to pour our passion into a project. We want to make something wondrous for people to experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQxTeY"&gt;Raymond is one of the game industry’s most prolific developers; her career’s spanned major stints at companies like Electronic Arts and Ubisoft in leadership roles. Most recently, she was leading Google’s first-party games studio, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18272996/google-stadia-studio-games-entertainment-exclusives-gdc-2019"&gt;Stadia Games and Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier this year, however, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; its in-house developer. Although many other devs shifted to new roles, Raymond left the company entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mK21qN"&gt;“It’s been a strange and difficult past 12 months,” Raymond wrote. “The pandemic, social injustice, and job elimination have impacted many of my closest friends, family, and co-workers. All of these factors, paired with an inability to see friends and family face-to-face, lulled me into a kind of self-reflective cocoon where I had to ask myself some tough questions about what really matters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ccDOc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ next update will let you design a custom umbrella</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6f5kIMRAHNc96JrZqaBA3G2Lilo=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68975632/800x450_Custom_design_umbrella.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pPW2l6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;already robust design tools are getting some improvements with &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/2021/free-update-for-animal-crossing-new-horizons-delivers-new-content/"&gt;a free update&lt;/a&gt; hitting March 18th. One new addition is a big upgrade to the NookPhone’s design app that will let you customize umbrellas, small flags, uchiwa fans, and photo stands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="binxxf"&gt;The app already let you make designs for shirts, dresses, and hats, so with the upgrade, you’ll be able to tailor an even more custom look (and make a fun photo stand while you’re at it). The upgraded app will also add 50 design slots to both the normal and Pro custom design modes, allowing you to create and save even more designs than before.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6LF8Q7937DkeGaTkoXXD1zzH3WA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374866/800x450_ACNH_MarchUpdate_CustomDesigns_ProEditor_EN_02.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You can make designs for new items in the &lt;/em&gt;New Horizons&lt;em&gt; update.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iadrWn"&gt;You’ll be able to buy the app upgrade with Nook Miles at the terminal in the Resident Services building. And while you’re there, you’ll be able to spend Nook Miles to add the Custom Design portal from the Able Sisters’ shop, which lets you connect to the internet to share and search for custom designs, right to your NookPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKMBOr"&gt;In addition, the update adds a cake to celebrate the game’s first anniversary (yes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22327659/animal-crossing-new-horizons-first-year-timeline-events-holidays"&gt;it has been out for nearly a year&lt;/a&gt;) and Sanrio-themed items that you’ll be able to get using amiibo cards available at Target on March 26th. There will also be new seasonal items you can purchase from Nook Shopping, including prom-themed items to help you host a virtual dance party and... whoopee cushions. (In honor of April Fool’s Day, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n5Mh_Vkp9W3tZ4W-QADsNg0LzfI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374903/800x450_ACNH_MarchUpdate_NewItems_01.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prank your friends with whoopee cushions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>The Demon Slayer movie is finally coming to the US after breaking records in Japan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iAyAzdYOWWxIgGeYNOZUAA8FV90=/206x0:1276x713/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68975621/Screenshot_2021_03_16_115642.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ufotable&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EUJ4fz"&gt;The excellent and massively popular anime &lt;em&gt;Demon Slayer &lt;/em&gt;has had as successful of a run at the box office as you can get in Japan — the movie adaptation of its “Mugen Train” manga arc is the highest-grossest film in the country’s history. Now, the film is finally coming to North America, starting with a theatrical run in the US and Canada on April 23rd with distribution from Aniplex of America and Funimation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6miFXO"&gt;The film’s official title, in true anime style, is a bit of a mouthful: &lt;em&gt;Demon Slayer – Kimetsu No Yaiba – The Movie: Mugen Train&lt;/em&gt;. But that hasn’t stopped the film from its box office domination. It broke the $100 million milestone in Japan in just 10 days, and it’s since grossed nearly $400 million in the country alone, beating out Hayao Miyazaki’s &lt;em&gt;Spirited Away &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Titanic &lt;/em&gt;for the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;all-time record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXJZoL"&gt;The film is rated R and runs for one hour and 57 minutes, ensuring that fans of the fantasy anime’s beautifully animated, high-octane combat will get to see some bloody and well-choreographed battle scenes. There will also be 4DX and IMAX screenings, and both dubbed and subtitled versions. According to Aniplex and Funimation, those interested in watching &lt;em&gt;Mugen Train&lt;/em&gt; at home will have to wait until June 22nd, when digital purchase and rentals will be distributed on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, the Microsoft Store, Vudu, and the PlayStation Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLzDnt"&gt;For those unfamiliar, &lt;em&gt;Demon Slayer &lt;/em&gt;is a fantasy manga authored by Koyoharu Gotouge that centers on the trials of young swordsman Tanjiro Kamado, who sets out on a quest to return his sister to her human form after she’s transformed into a demon. &lt;em&gt;Mugen Train &lt;/em&gt;specifically covers a middle chunk of the manga’s storyline, following the anime’s season 1 adaptation of the narrative’s beginning and first few arcs. The anime is produced by renown studio Ufotable, which also animated the film and is working on the show’s second season to premiere sometime in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xXxnDP"&gt;For years, the broadband debate has centered around connecting people living in rural and unserved areas across the country. But while some rural Americans don’t have the infrastructure necessary to connect to the internet, other families in urban communities face difficulties affording what’s already available. Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) is set to introduce a new measure Tuesday that could help millions of households access more affordable broadband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isDiay"&gt;“The more access to broadband people have, the more access and opportunity they have to the world beyond where they currently exist,” Bowman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Tuesday. “The internet is a library. It’s an encyclopedia. It’s information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V7htUt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The internet is a library. It’s an encyclopedia. It’s information.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CFbArj"&gt;Bowman’s “Broadband Justice Act,” co-sponsored by Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO) who chairs a housing subcommittee, would require the Housing and Urban Development Department, along with the Treasury and USDA, to update its utility allowance definitions to include broadband so it can be subsidized for families living in government-assisted housing. Other utilities like gas and electricity are already subsidized in this way. The bill would also create a new grant program to help wire buildings and build out other broadband-related infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYDYPu"&gt;“There’s a lot of momentum and energy around making this a utility, not just from members of Congress but from organizers on the outside,” Bowman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The grassroots is really behind this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDRZcj"&gt;The FCC already has subsidy programs, like Lifeline, that make broadband more affordable for qualified households, but it’s been the subject of disinvestment for many years. Many Lifeline subscribers receive poor connections, and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/09/lifeline-broadband-internet-fcc-coronavirus/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, many people who qualify for the program refuse to use it due to its insufficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82whFV"&gt;As Congress prepares for its next big infrastructure package, money for broadband expansion will likely be included in the process. Last week, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC) introduced &lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?id=c3c8f0e4-61d4-46fe-a28a-f81a09620a5d"&gt;a sweeping broadband package&lt;/a&gt; that would invest over $94 billion in building high-speed broadband infrastructure in unserved and underserved areas. The Senate Commerce Committee also &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/3/recent-federal-actions-to-expand-broadband-are-we-making-progress"&gt;plans to hold a hearing&lt;/a&gt; on broadband expansion this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoyBLq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tinder is giving away free mail-in COVID-19 tests</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KHUTiiNBw164I_i5CSFg3sKtQNM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68975382/TinderEverywell_NEWgradientBG_hand.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tinder&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bVC0w7"&gt;Tinder is giving 500 users a pair of free mail-in COVID-19 test kits — one for them and one for a Tinder match. The company says it’s a way to help people feel more comfortable meeting up with matches for real-life dates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKJXu5"&gt;It’s using tests from the medical testing company EverlyWell. People taking &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.everlywell.com%2Fproducts%2Fcovid-19-test%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F16%2F22333930%2Ftinder-covid-test-free-mail-in-everlywell" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EverlyWell’s coronavirus tests&lt;/a&gt; swab their noses at home and mail the sample to the lab. Results are posted online within one to two days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HgFpk"&gt;Throughout the pandemic, dating app companies have introduced new features to help people date safely. One main focus was on ways to facilitate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324221/tinder-bumble-video-virtual-dating-calls-feature-whyd-you-push-that-button-podcast"&gt;virtual dates&lt;/a&gt;, which are actually a good way to meet people without the risk of spreading or contracting COVID-19. Bumble recently launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325404/bumble-virtual-date-trivia-quiz-social-distancing"&gt;Night In&lt;/a&gt;, a feature that lets users play games together over a video call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RI3RTxfMsza6iFwvi8vFEfoZjrs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374751/TinderEverywell_phonemock_transparentBG.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tinder&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hkTKZ5"&gt;Tinder is framing its test kit giveaway as another way to reduce the risks of dating. “We’re excited to be working with Everlywell to make it easier for our members to go and meet their matches safely,” Nicole Parlapiano, Tinder’s vice president of marketing for North America, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3r524"&gt;But giving out test kits doesn’t make an in-person date entirely safe. Taking a COVID-19 test before meeting up with someone new helps but doesn’t eliminate risk entirely: someone could take the test, send it out, and then catch the coronavirus in the window before the result comes back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ux218z"&gt;Tinder gestures at this in an interface for the giveaway, saying that “a negative test result does not mean you don’t have or cannot transmit COVID-19.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2KHHq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/news?item=122492"&gt;According to Tinder&lt;/a&gt;, more and more people are saying in their profiles that they want to go on a date. There are ways to make that safer, like meeting outside, wearing masks, or avoiding other people before and after. Tests can play a role in that overall calculus — but a negative result isn’t a free pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dqekzm"&gt;Tinder users in the United States can claim a code for the tests on March 20th starting at 7PM ET. If you don’t manage to snag one, &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/community-based-testing-sites/index.html"&gt;free COVID-19 tests&lt;/a&gt; are also available at health centers and pharmacies across the country.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google antitrust suit takes aim at Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K4Ec_EvpkBEEJu-jHeyEtonebjU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68975277/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kzpnw1"&gt;State antitrust watchdogs are targeting Google’s plans to phase out third-party tracking cookies, building on a major lawsuit filed last year. The group of 15 attorneys general, led by Texas, updated its complaint about Google yesterday to include a more detailed case against the search giant, including new claims about Google’s strategic use of the Chrome browser. In particular, the new complaint takes aim at recent privacy updates to Chrome, which could better protect users’ personal data while also entrenching Google’s market position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHbos8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178988/google-antitrust-ad-tech-lawsuit-texas-attorney-general-paxton"&gt;Filed in December&lt;/a&gt;, the Texas complaint is one of three ongoing antitrust cases against Google. That same month, the Colorado attorney general led a group alleging that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22186994/google-search-antitrust-lawsuit-colorado-nebraska-state-ags"&gt;stifled competition by manipulating search results&lt;/a&gt;. A separate case from the Department of Justice is focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21454192/google-monopoly-antitrust-case-lawsuit-filed-us-doj-department-of-justice"&gt;Google’s dominance of the web search marketplace and associated ad business&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bx9nc0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Privacy vs. antitrust&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="chScBL"&gt;Like the original Texas complaint, Tuesday’s updated filing primarily focuses on Google’s technology for targeting ads across the web. The attorneys general argue that Google used its power in search, streaming video, and other markets to stamp out independent advertising platforms, forcing small businesses and media outlets to use its system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPHGcg"&gt;But in the updated complaint, the states apply this argument to Google’s “Privacy Sandbox” — a tool that’s supposed to replace invasive third-party tracking cookies with a more limited system devised by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shVxgH"&gt;“Google’s new scheme is, in essence, to wall off the entire portion of the internet that consumers access through Google’s Chrome browser,” the complaint reads. Blocking cookies might broadly be a good thing — other browsers like Firefox and Safari have already done it. But Chrome dominates the browser market, and it’s part of a much larger Google product suite. The suit argues that Google’s plans would require advertisers to use it as a middleman and would make Google’s own advertising system far more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7HRs1"&gt;For years, Google has been gradually scaling back its use of tracking cookies, announcing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310332/google-privacy-replacing-third-party-cookies-privacy-sandbox"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; that it will not establish an alternate system for tracking users on the web. But critics of the company — including &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/08/dont-play-googles-privacy-sandbox-1"&gt;the Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt; — have criticized those efforts as self-serving. Now, state regulators seem to be adopting those criticisms and putting new legal pressure on Google’s efforts to block tracking in Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hiF1F"&gt; “Google is trying to hide its true intentions behind a pretext of privacy,” the suit continues. With Privacy Sandbox, “Google does not actually put a stop to user profiling or targeted advertising — it puts Google’s Chrome browser at the center of tracking and targeting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUqdwG"&gt;Reached for comment, Google said the new allegations rested on a misunderstanding of Chrome’s privacy features. “Attorney General Paxton’s latest claims mischaracterize many aspects of our business, including the steps we are taking with the Privacy Sandbox initiative to protect people’s privacy as they browse the web,” a Google representative said. “These efforts have been welcomed by privacy advocates, advertisers and our own rivals as a step forward in preserving user privacy and protecting free content. We will strongly defend ourselves from AG Paxton’s baseless claims in court.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fHDsI2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1:50PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: LastPass’ free offering is changing today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dJQ2g2HYVUh22Vumczq79YDM3_Q=/0x0:2288x1525/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68975067/lpdevicesvault2xmin1png.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LastPass&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4rzJsY"&gt;LastPass, the popular password manager, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;announced changes&lt;/a&gt; last month to the free version of its software designed to make its Premium paid version much more attractive — and the free one much less so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iddYPN"&gt;“LastPass offers access across two device types – computers (including all browsers running on desktops and laptops) or mobile&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;devices (including mobile phones, smart watches, and tablets),” the company wrote in a &lt;a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2021/02/changes-to-lastpass-free/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “Starting March 16th, 2021” — that’s today — “LastPass Free will only include access on unlimited devices of one type.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9OTFzY"&gt;What that means: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;if you’re a LastPass free user, you’ll have to choose&lt;/a&gt; whether you want to access your passwords on your computer — in browser or via desktop app — or on your mobile device. You won’t be able to use both, though your passwords will sync across devices regardless. That said, you’ll have the opportunity to switch your main device three times, starting today. (LastPass is also offering a discount on Premium subscriptions for a limited time, presumably to dampen the sting.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhYGfc"&gt;If, however, you find all of this too onerous and you’d like to just switch password managers entirely, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295354/lastpass-export-delete-bitwarden-1password-zoho"&gt;I have some good news for you: moving your passwords out of LastPass is pretty easy&lt;/a&gt;. I actually did it myself, using (naturally) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295354/lastpass-export-delete-bitwarden-1password-zoho"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s guide&lt;/a&gt;. I chose Bitwarden because it syncs across mobile and desktop and it’s open source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzsubY"&gt;Also, if you’ve made it this far and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/24/15921282/best-password-manager-1password-lastpass-dashlane-how-to"&gt;you don’t have a password manager&lt;/a&gt; yet — what are you doing here? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;Get on that&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lu2ZDY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s 11th Gen desktop chips are here with faster speeds but fewer cores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1VXr2aM1xMOheCdlRNphASMD4GA=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68974858/RKL_i9_with_Box.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W8j3Mp"&gt;Intel’s next-generation desktop chips are finally here: after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225541/intel-processor-11th-gen-ces-2021-chips-specs"&gt;brief preview at CES&lt;/a&gt;, the company is fully unveiling its 11th Gen Core desktop chips (better known by their codename, Rocket Lake-S.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVHayt"&gt;Leading the pack is Intel’s new flagship chip, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225541/intel-processor-11th-gen-ces-2021-chips-specs"&gt;Core i9-11900K&lt;/a&gt;, with eight cores, 16 threads, boosted clock speeds up to 5.3GHz, support for DDR4 RAM at 3,200MHz, a total of 20 PCIe 4.0 lanes, and backwards compatibility with Intel’s 400 Series chipsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHl4LY"&gt;Eagle-eyed Intel fans might notice that the new chip is, on paper, actually a downgrade from last year’s top model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/4/30/21242512/intel-10th-gen-desktop-lineup-offers-gaming-processor-speed"&gt;the Core i9-10900K&lt;/a&gt;, which offered 10 cores and 20 threads (and a similar boosted clock speed of 5.3GHz). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMrgTD"&gt;That’s because Intel is debuting a new desktop core architecture for the first time in over half a decade with its 11th Gen Rocket Lake-S chips called Cypress Cove. Cypress Cove &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; replaces the Skylake microarchitecture, which the company has been using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/5/9094209/intel-skylake-processor-launch-release-date-price"&gt;since its 6th Gen chips in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4lvLwV9jYNOecGilzRSPI9kIcww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22373642/RKL_Family_Shot_2.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2frwpD"&gt;But the Cypress Cove design isn’t actually a whole new microarchitecture — it’s actually Intel’s Willow Cove chip designs and technologies that the company has been using on its 11th Gen 10nm Tiger Lake chips which Intel is backporting to its 14nm production process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTEtbj"&gt;Since those designs were meant for 10nm chips, though, Intel is limited in the number of cores it can fit when scaling them up to a 14nm size; hence, the reduction in core count year over year. But Intel still says that the new chips will offer better performance (at least, in some cases) than the 10th Gen, with the core architecture enabling up to 19 percent IPC (instructions per cycle) than the previous generation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YFK78"&gt;Intel’s argument here is effectively that sheer core count isn’t enough on its own — frequency speed and performance matters, too, and thanks to the maturity of the 14nm production process, Intel is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good at cranking out every last drop of performance from these chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KldjYw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10394413"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LXauO5"&gt;And Intel’s benchmarks (obviously) support that argument: head to head with last year’s Core i9-10900K, the i9-11900K offered between 8 to 14 percent better performance on games like &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Grid 2019&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Total War: Three Kingdoms&lt;/em&gt;. Intel also says that its top chip outperforms AMD’s flagship Ryzen 9 5900X processor for those titles, although by slightly smaller margins (between 3 and 11 percent better, according to Intel’s benchmarks). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbfGf1"&gt;That said, Intel’s tests were all running at 1080p, so we’ll have to stay tuned for more comprehensive benchmarking down the line on a wider range of titles — and particularly, at 4K resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q5HXgI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10395264"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j4sEvJ"&gt;The new architecture also brings other improvements, with up to 50 percent better integrated graphics compared to Gen9 thanks to the company’s new Xe graphics, with one-third more EUs than its Gen9 graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5T3r3"&gt;Given that these are desktop chips that will almost certainly be paired with a high-end discrete graphics card, that’s not the most groundbreaking improvement, however. And  while Intel will be offering several F-series models of the new chips without GPUs, the overall design is still the same on those models. That means that Intel isn’t going to be offering any niche models that ditch integrated GPUs to try to fit in more cores, at least for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdGkO4"&gt;The new chips also feature other improvements. The 11th Gen chips add Resizable BAR, for a frame rate boost on compatible Nvidia and AMD graphics cards. There’s built-in support for both USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 at 20Gbps as well as Intel’s own Thunderbolt 4, along with DDR4-3200 RAM. And Intel has added four additional Gen 4 PCIe lanes, for a total of 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJpJPh"&gt;As is traditional for a major new chip launch, Intel is also introducing its 500 series motherboards alongside the new processors, but the Rocket Lake-S CPUs will also be backwards compatible with 400 series motherboards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1IB8U"&gt;Additionally, there’s some new overclocking options with the new chips for users looking to squeeze out even more power. Specifically, Intel’s Extreme Tuning Utility software is getting refreshed with a new UI and some updated features alongside the 11th Gen chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTEXOO"&gt;The new 11th Gen Intel desktop processors are available starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
