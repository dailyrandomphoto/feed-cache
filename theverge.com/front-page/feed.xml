  &lt;p id="foKHZb"&gt;Despite having to weather &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525953/biden-tiktok-wechat-trump-bans-revoked-alipay"&gt;a variety of controversies&lt;/a&gt; having to do with its content and its ownership, TikTok persists as a popular video app — and no wonder. It allows you to quickly create videos, add a variety of effects, text captions, and audio backgrounds, and show to the world what you think is cute, funny, politically problematic, deadly serious, or in need of fixing. TikTok is full of cute animals, weird dances, snarky remarks, and imaginative dialogues between the same individual dressed up in two different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MW4f9C"&gt;In fact, it is hard to say who is having the most fun: those who are swiping through the wide variety of videos out there, discovering what other people are doing, dancing, and discussing, or those who are creating these imaginative videos and enjoying the attention and comments that they engender. (Or not enjoying it, depending on those comments — this is social media, after all, and so there are a lot of angry people out there.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRGXUK"&gt;If you want to know what all the fuss is about and want to give the app a try, either as a watcher or as a creator, we have your back. In &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Guide to TikTok, we’ve got step-by-step directions for new users and some excellent tips for knowledgeable creators. We explain how to find what you’re interested in, how to decline what you’re not interested in, and how to deal with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587113/tiktok-algorithm-wsj-investigation-rabbit-hole"&gt;algorithms that determine&lt;/a&gt; what you’re going to see next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gH3bBD"&gt;We hope you find them useful in your explorations of the wonderful world of TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC’s Vive Focus 3 is a great prototype for a true Oculus Quest rival</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;But it’s not for home VR&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="skHwfh"&gt;Let’s get this out of the way: you shouldn’t buy the HTC Vive Focus 3 for home VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="wplj6q"&gt;The Vive Focus 3 is HTC’s latest virtual reality headset, part of the Vive line that it first released in 2016. The Vive helped establish the modern VR industry, and the Focus 3 is one of only two big-brand standalone (as opposed to PC- or console-tethered) headsets on the market alongside Facebook’s Oculus Quest 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKzItM"&gt;But as Facebook lengthens its lead in consumer VR, HTC has voluntarily taken itself out of the running. The Focus 3, which opened for preorders last month, is meant for businesses, research institutions, and other professional settings. It’s equipped with a small suite of apps that hold little consumer appeal, and it is sold with HTC tech support and other enterprise-oriented features. At $1,300, it costs more than four times as much as the Quest 2’s $299 base price. Again: if you want a device for playing video games, exercising, or using most VR social spaces, don’t buy HTC’s standalone headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqIVDZ"&gt;So why write about it? Because I’m holding out hope that in a few years that could change. The Vive Focus 3 has polished, premium-feeling hardware that would feel great in a consumer product, while not being weighed down by the Quest’s Facebook-shaped baggage. It feels like a formula for building genuinely competitive home VR hardware — even if HTC isn’t making a play for that yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hp7eTh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10664853"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zp7tSB"&gt;The Focus 3 is HTC’s third generation of standalone headsets, or VR systems that are totally self-contained rather than plugged into a computer. It’s also the first Focus that really looks like a finished product. Where the 2018 Vive Focus and 2019 Focus Plus had a strange, swept-back look, the Focus 3 has a no-nonsense matte black design that resembles bulky goggles, with a shiny front plate where you’ll find the four cameras that handle head and hand tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBcTeT"&gt;HTC’s headset is larger and heavier than the Oculus Quest 2; it’s closer in size to the original Oculus Quest. But its design makes it far more comfortable than the original Quest &lt;em&gt;or &lt;/em&gt;the Quest 2 with its default strap. The Focus 3 ships with a cloth and plastic headband that tightens with a ring at the back, similar to the Elite Strap that Facebook sells for $49. VR headsets can still be tricky to wear without getting a headache, but the Focus 3 is more comfortable than most, as long as you’re careful to get a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mAbIH1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s as crisp as anything you’ll find in a consumer VR system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ia152K"&gt;The Focus 3’s big selling point is a 5K screen (or 2448 x 2448 pixels per eye, compared to the Quest 2’s 1832 x 1920) with a 90Hz refresh rate and 120-degree field of view (compared to 110 degrees on most consumer headsets). The display isn’t as extraordinarily sharp as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21720748/varjo-vr3-xr3-vr-ar-dual-resolution-headsets-price-shipping-specs"&gt;Varjo’s professional headsets&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s as crisp as anything I’ve seen in a consumer system. While there’s still a noticeable black ring around your field of view, it’s a little less intrusive than most of its competition. The only real drawback is some prominent “god rays” — a side effect of some VR lenses that can introduce halos of light in high-contrast images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhz1gk"&gt;It’s hard to practically evaluate the Focus 3’s maximum performance because HTC’s software selection is extremely limited — you won’t find graphically demanding games that clearly push its limits. But there also aren’t any red flags with its SnapDragon XR2 — the same chip used in the Quest 2 — even with the demands of the higher resolution display. The headset’s tracking worked perfectly for me under bright and dim light, especially compared to the earlier Vive Cosmos’ cameras at launch, and my battery lasted just shy of three hours with a mix of 3D experiences and web browsing, which is comparable to the Quest 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PRvzxRzgMDB7x2R4MlnOYIhoD6o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22727556/arobertson_210630_4670_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Focus 3 has more comfortable padding than other headsets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lkPEJT-3KYScmg7ixAPoR3e5tbA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22727555/arobertson_210630_4670_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dial on the back makes it easy to adjust the size quickly, which is important for businesses that might have multiple people sharing the Focus 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hpp6AR"&gt;I don’t love the Focus 3’s use of directed speakers instead of headphones; as with basically all speaker-based headsets, some sound bleeds out and is audible to people around you. But it’s less noticeable than, say, the Valve Index’s speaker bleed, and the audio itself generally sounds just fine. (There’s also a 3.5mm headphone jack and the option to pair Bluetooth headphones.) The only odd note is an unusually loud fan that also blows a very light breeze across your face — which, like the god rays mentioned above, is noticeable but not usually disruptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxD0On"&gt;Meanwhile, the Focus 3 is full of thoughtful little hardware touches. Its face mask is padded with the soft, non-absorbent material you’d find on a nice pair of headphones, not the porous padding many headsets (including the Quest 2) use — so you can clean it easily after sessions instead of dealing with a sweat-soaked ring of foam. The battery is swappable and located at the back of the headset for better balance, with a four-light charging indicator that gives you an immediate, detailed look at how much battery power you’ve got. There’s a microSD card slot for expanding the default 128GB of storage, as well as a wheel at the bottom to let you focus the headset, rather than the Oculus Quest 2’s awkward three-setting slider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pl2PpB"&gt;Features like swappable batteries are more useful for business customers — who might want to run a headset all day — than the average consumer. But they add up to a well-made device with bells and whistles Facebook either doesn’t have or sells separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oykpeD9B9lVG6bkmOZaFW9UIIz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22727558/arobertson_210630_4670_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Focus 3’s controllers aren’t quite as nice as the headset itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QXG2fJ"&gt;The Focus 3’s controllers are a big step up from earlier Vive designs. HTC held onto the original Vive’s wand-like controller shape for years, but it’s thankfully given the Focus 3 a now-standard Oculus Touch-style interface: each motion controller has two triggers, two face buttons, a menu button, and an analog stick, and they’re contoured to fit your hands. Like most Vive headsets, they use built-in rechargeable batteries instead of disposable AA ones — which sacrifices the immediate convenience of a swappable battery but also feels distinctly less wasteful, particularly when the controllers last much longer than the headset and both charge in an hour or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCeKd1"&gt;Unfortunately, the Focus 3 controllers still feel cheap compared to the much less expensive Oculus Touch controllers — or, for that matter, the Focus 3 headset hardware. Also, the main triggers have a distinct click, but they oddly fire just before you hit it. It creates a confusing delay if you’re pulling them quickly and repeatedly, like you do when hitting letters on a VR keyboard, and it feels simply pointless if (as I did) you just learn to not fully pull the triggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9tWG0K"&gt;Put the hardware aside, and the Focus 3 drives home how important native app ecosystems are for standalone headsets. The Focus 3 has a small “Business App Store” with specialized productivity tools and a few games, but you can’t even directly buy apps inside it; you have to open a separate window to get a license that will put them in your library. Companies can run their own software or use some of the default apps like Vive Sync, a virtual meeting room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="O1IEEB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;WebXR is a frustrating reminder of how useful VR web apps could be&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vxam6H"&gt;The most broadly consumer-oriented app I’ve found is Firefox, which works like any VR browser: normal websites appear in a box in front of your face, and WebXR sites let you click a button to enter a web-based VR experience. WebVR is a frustrating reminder of how powerful the web &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be for VR. It easily supports lightweight VR apps and games like a &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;-style rhythm game called &lt;em&gt;Moon Rider&lt;/em&gt;. But there’s no clear demand to build or optimize these apps, either — so most remain in the experimental or tech-demo stage. While the web holds the promise of easy cross-platform VR, it’s no substitute for a native app store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v9uPenkTKDYPQ5aL2_vu_lybT_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22727552/arobertson_210630_4670_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use the Focus 3 entirely standalone from a PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="voSiIj"&gt;That’s not a knock on the Vive Focus 3, because I think HTC is right to avoid the consumer market. Facebook is likely subsidizing the super-cheap Oculus Quest 2 with its monumental ad revenue elsewhere, and it’s acquired a library of first-party games HTC couldn’t currently match. HTC’s Viveport PC VR store has always felt like a shadow of the Oculus Store or Valve’s SteamVR, and abruptly jumping into mobile VR would just make the gap more pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2Oipk"&gt;Even so, HTC has built the first product that feels like a potential competitor to Oculus’ mobile VR, and the VR world needs that kind of competition. Facebook has funded a lot of excellent experiences, but it’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375118/oculus-facebook-account-login-data-privacy-controversy-developers-competition"&gt;alienated some VR fans&lt;/a&gt; with its aggressive Oculus-Facebook integration, particularly as it starts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22544468/facebook-oculus-quest-ads-resolution-games-blaston"&gt;introducing ads into the Quest&lt;/a&gt;. Some developers feel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"&gt;pressured by its market power&lt;/a&gt;. And while PlayStation’s upcoming PSVR 2 could offer solid indirect competition, it still won’t have a Quest-style self-contained design. But the Vive Focus 3 proves that making a true rival is more than possible — for a price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon to investigate allegations of harassment and discrimination in its AWS unit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/65it0m7FMQ1XqXI2wn2PjAB9OIU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622115/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mY6QZ5"&gt;Amazon will investigate allegations of discrimination and harassment within its Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit, following an employee petition that criticized AWS’s culture, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/19/amazon-suit-race-gender-discrimination/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. More than 550 Amazon workers signed the petition, which calls out AWS for its “underlying culture of systemic discrimination, harassment, bullying and bias against women and under-represented groups,” the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; reported. The petition further alleges that Amazon’s system to investigate claims of discrimination are “not fair, objective or transparent.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIZztV"&gt;The petition pointed to allegations from former AWS employees: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LaB7PJ"&gt;In May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444635/amazon-five-discrimination-retaliation-lawsuits-warehouse"&gt;five women sued Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, alleging race and gender discrimination. One of the women, Cindy Warner, worked in the AWS division and had accused a manager of making homophobic comments. When she hired a lawyer, Warner said she was fired in retaliation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vUhHyP"&gt;Last August, former AWS employee Laudon Williams &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-i-left-aws-laudon-williams/"&gt;wrote in a LinkedIn post&lt;/a&gt; that he left the company because he saw instances of what he considered gender discrimination. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="7UBPCR"&gt;The petition was sent to new Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, the former head of AWS, and current AWS chief executive Adam Selipsky, the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; reported. Selipsky later wrote an email to the petition’s author that said Amazon was hiring an outside firm to investigate. The petitioners want the company to conduct an independent investigation of AWS, to be completed by October 30th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODlVRp"&gt;Amazon did not immediately reply to a request for comment Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlbC7P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music’s spatial audio and lossless streaming are now available on Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JEEq4hgQe0J1hx7btXgB9fEu1TQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622020/acastro_180927_1777_apple_music_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Az5rUL"&gt;Apple Music listeners on Android can now take advantage of the Dolby Atmos spatial audio and lossless-quality streaming features that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;debuted on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS&lt;/a&gt; over a month ago. The latest update of the app for Android adds support for both features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UUoqv"&gt;Lossless should be available pretty universally on Android devices. Apple includes all the same warnings as on iOS about it consuming “significantly more data.” Like on Apple’s own platforms, Apple Music advises that external hardware like a DAC is required if you want to step up to hi-res lossless. (I’m curious whether this still applies on LG’s audiophile-friendly phones, which have an excellent built-in DAC, but haven’t had the chance to test yet.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xMQl1h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Music’s spatial audio is sometimes amazing but mostly inconsistent","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="H6fzOe"&gt;Spatial audio support on the Android side seems a more limited, however. Although the feature works with any headphones — just like on iPhone — Apple notes that your phone itself needs to support Dolby Atmos to enable spatial audio. On my Pixel 4A 5G, there’s no option for “Dolby Atmos” in the audio section of Apple Music’s settings. Other colleagues with more flagship-tier devices have a toggle for Atmos there. So I guess that’s the easiest way to tell whether your phone is capable of spatial audio playback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4YuHP"&gt;The beta version of Apple Music for Android actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436575/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3"&gt;tipped off&lt;/a&gt; that lossless and hi-res audio were coming to the service even before Apple made an official announcement. But now both are available on the regular Apple Music app for Android. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s last-gen WH-1000XM3 cost less than ever at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sony WH-1000XM3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qm1L5QV7GPedzu71laHN9Xgtk50=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622012/jbareham_180823_2895_0075.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2c0FQB"&gt;It’s sometimes easy to dismiss the previous generation of a product in favor of the latest version. In most cases, that’s smart to do, unless a deal is just too good to pass up. Case in point, Sony’s WH-1000XM3 noise-canceling headphones that released in 2018 are down to their lowest price yet at Best Buy today and through Sunday. Originally $350 (but usually selling between $220-$270 most days), &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743780474724360893#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get them new in the black colorway for $170&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon was offering this price earlier today, but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G4MNFS1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it appears to have sold out&lt;/a&gt; for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uo5C9c"&gt;Compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1000XM4 that released in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, the XM3s aren’t far behind. They are comparable in terms of sound quality, battery life, comfort, and with their noise cancellation effect. Though, the XM4 are unique in that they have an auto on / off playback sensor when you put on or take off the headphones, and they can connect with two Bluetooth sources simultaneously. We’ve seen that newer model go for as low as $250 during Prime Day recently, but you’d currently be able to buy two sets of XM3s at Best Buy to match the XM4’s price as it stands today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZCCH3D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326538"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uJiSbs"&gt;Also part of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747024753714194232#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy’s three-day “Black Friday in July” sale&lt;/a&gt;, MSI’s Sword 15 gaming laptop is a couple hundred dollars off its normal price. Normally $1,200, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747024670748190489#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $1,000 now&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not a bad deal for what specs are inside, including the Intel Core i7-11800H processor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423474/nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-60fps-gaming-laptops-features-specs-performance-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nvidia’s RTX 3050 Ti graphics chip&lt;/a&gt;, a 512GB NVMe SSD, and 8GB of RAM. It has a 1080p display with a 144Hz refresh rate. The sum of its components equal a solid midrange gaming laptop that should be capable of delivering playable frame rates in many games after some tweaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mX1ul7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10665627"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vt8QaL"&gt;We featured a similar deal recently for the newly released &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD&lt;/em&gt; for the Nintendo Switch, but the cartridge version of the game &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747024806913770606#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $9 off at Best Buy right now&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, this deal doesn’t extend to the digital version, but the discount is nice if you were thinking about grabbing this game at your local Best Buy ahead of the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ted Lasso doesn’t need surprise to be good in season 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MM0cHWUBShm0GP1FiHJZshn2YLo=/186x0:5747x3707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69621972/Ted_Lasso_Photo_020112.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BaoNPq"&gt;TV’s nicest guy is back, as &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; and its eponymous, eternally optimistic American football coach-turned-English Premier League gaffer (played by a golden-hearted Jason Sudeikis) returns for a second season on Apple TV Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLyasR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; season 1 and the first episode of season 2 ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uc-Txgz3oKkkE2A9JcIgvI2BrVc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735340/Ted_Lasso_Photo_020106.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JzxbJN"&gt;The good news: the second season is off to an excellent start, picking up a few months after the crushing loss and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_and_relegation"&gt;relegation&lt;/a&gt; of the fictional Richmond team down to the second-tier Championship. But unlike season 1, the new episodes don’t have the benefit of being a pleasant surprise — season 2 has been hyped up for months, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394062/apple-tv-ted-lasso-season-2-trailer-premiere-date"&gt;including a spotlight slot&lt;/a&gt; at one of Apple’s tech events alongside a new iPhone announcement. Season 2 has &lt;em&gt;expectations&lt;/em&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vy7Yxl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Season 2 has &lt;em&gt;expectations&lt;/em&gt; now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qVqHon"&gt;Unlike the first season, which largely focused on the soccer-ignorant Ted working to win over his skeptical team, the new season has the Richmond crew already on his side, even as they still struggle to actually succeed on the pitch. And it’s that climb back to sporting success that appears to be a major point of the new season, something that even Ted’s endless enthusiasm might not be able to solve on its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1Hjuk"&gt;New in the second season is Sarah Niles (&lt;em&gt;I May Destroy You&lt;/em&gt;) as Sharon, a sports psychologist brought in to help the Richmond players, who represents a cooler, more professional take on self-improvement than Ted’s warm and fuzzy persona. It’s an interesting dynamic that should be fun to see progress throughout the season. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ExOJDi6P8NlB7OnmgLgLubq6CmU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735343/Ted_Lasso_Photo_020101.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xKaW1n"&gt;But the most encouraging thing from &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s second season is just how well the show continues to work, at least so far. The first season of the show, rather improbably based on some old NBC Sport commercials, came seemingly out of nowhere last summer, before slowly snowballing into Apple TV Plus’ most unexpected hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NuoGM"&gt;The show debuted on the service with more of a whimper than a bang, before word-of-mouth and its undeniably charming cast of underdogs managed to turn the similarly   underdog series into Apple’s flagship series, complete with a bevy of Emmy nominations and awards to go with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wEDcU"&gt;There were some concerns that &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s success could have been a flash in the pan, a combination of a highly bingeable show, Apple’s extended free trials for TV Plus, and a jaded populace just looking for something optimistic and upbeat after the relentless terribleness of 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ut9zYh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ted Lasso’s success is more than just a fad&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C1PLyS"&gt;Season 2, however, shows that &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s success is more than just a fad. The show’s brand of goodness (which continues to avoid tilting over into cloying early in the second season) is, if not always relatable, at least aspirational. The show’s cast of characters ultimately feel human, and it’s hard not to root for them to succeed, whether at soccer or at just being better people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsuUIC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s biggest challenge still lies ahead, though. The show returns for its second season today, with just a single episode, and will break the usual mold for streaming shows by debuting new episodes weekly for the next 12 weeks on Apple’s streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoHuW8"&gt;Coupled with the fact that Apple’s service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394404/apple-tv-plus-free-trial-july-2021-ted-lasso-second-season-timing"&gt;just ended its free trial&lt;/a&gt; for all of its earliest subscribers, Ted won’t have to just win over a bunch of gruff footballers — he’ll have to get viewers to shell out Apple’s $5 per month subscription until October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ffdvO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google launches Intrinsic: a new company to build software for industrial robots</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q5dKSvYCeFazZDQFsWCNB9ew51Q=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69621955/intrinsic_green_purple_center.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fM3Tak"&gt;Google’s parent-company Alphabet has a birth to announce: a new company called Intrinsic which will focus on building software for industrial robots. The subsidiary will be one of Alphabet’s “other bets” — relatively speculative firms focusing on new technology like Waymo (self-driving cars), Wing (delivery drones), and Verily (healthcare and biotech). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IOky"&gt;Details on what exactly Intrinsic is building or who its customers will be are unclear. A &lt;a href="https://blog.x.company/introducing-intrinsic-1cf35b87651"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from the company’s new CEO, Wendy Tan White, discusses Intrinsic’s ambitions in broad terms, saying it will “unlock the creative and economic potential of industrial robotics for millions more businesses, entrepreneurs, and developers” by creating software that will make industrial robots “easier to use, less costly and more flexible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Gi1jk"&gt;Robotics have been an obsession at Google for years, but the company’s efforts have been unfocused and have yet to produce any commercial hits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WToLvo"&gt;In 2013, Google went on a shopping spree for robots, buying seven companies in roughly six months, including Schaft (a Japanese firm known for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/26/5846550/google-pulls-its-all-star-robot-out-of-military-competition-to-focus"&gt;bipedal bots&lt;/a&gt;), Bot &amp;amp; Dolly (makers of &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/lX6JcybgDFo"&gt;very cool viral videos&lt;/a&gt;), and Boston Dynamics (which needs no introduction). The effort was named “Replicant” and headed by Andy Rubin, an executive who co-founded the Android mobile operating system. Over the years, though, no news emerged from Replicant, and Google either &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/8/15766434/alphabet-google-boston-dynamics-softbank-sale-acquisition-robotics"&gt;sold off&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/15/18096469/google-robotics-schaft-japanese-bipedal-shut-down"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; most of its acquisitions. Why? Partly because robots are hard to make and not very profitable. But also because of Rubin’s departure from the company in 2014 after being &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html"&gt;accused of sexual misconduct&lt;/a&gt; (which Google kept secret). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-lL5-y1RIs060Lg66xcmIYuo-xA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735338/ezgif.com_gif_maker.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google wants to use AI to teach robots how to move and work. In the video above, two Kuka industrial robotic arms assemble a box. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iASNk2"&gt;Since Replicant’s failure, the company has focused more on the software side of things, using machine learning to teach robots to manipulate objects without direct supervision. This plays to Google’s strengths and will apparently be Intrinsic’s focus going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmVQdG"&gt;“Over the last few years, our team has been exploring how to give industrial robots the ability to sense, learn, and automatically make adjustments as they’re completing tasks, so they work in a wider range of settings and applications,” writes Tan White in the blog post. “[W]e’ve been testing software that uses techniques like automated perception, deep learning, reinforcement learning, motion planning, simulation, and force control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="967EJF"&gt;More than that, we don’t really know. Though it’s worth noting it’s not the only robotics effort at Google right now. In 2019, the company made a splash in announcing its Everyday Robot project: an effort housed in the company’s tech incubator X to develop a “general-purpose learning robot.” What’s happened to this project is unclear, and clicking the link on its &lt;a href="https://x.company/projects/everyday-robots/"&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt; to “read more” only directs you to a launch blog post, unchanged since 2019. Perhaps Intrinsic will have better luck in keeping Google’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Evernote works to keep current users and tries for new ones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5vacYEO4yYT8ziM8XFvivDi8ePw=/70x0:571x334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69621828/Evernote_Logo_1200_640x334.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Evernote&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m4DOMv"&gt;It can take a lot of work for an app like &lt;a href="https://evernote.com/"&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt;, one of the first major note-taking apps to hit the market, to survive in an ever-changing and fickle marketplace. In an effort to keep its place at (or at least near) the top of its niche, Evernote has recently announced new price plans and features. Will these new features — and new fees — help it keep loyal users and encourage new ones? It’s hard to say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3eWyF"&gt;First, some personal history: I’ve been an Evernote user — well, seemingly forever. Forever when it comes to the life span of apps, anyway; I’ve had an Evernote account since May 2008, when it was about to go into open beta; I used it to make notes &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2478803/hands-on--evernote-offers-hope-for-packrats.html"&gt;for the review I was writing&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve had Evernote on my devices ever since — and although I haven’t used it nearly as much recently as I used to, I have a lot of history recorded in the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5f90Zq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I’ve been an Evernote user — well, seemingly forever&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sINz1X"&gt;Evernote has gone through some changes, some good, some not so much. In 2008, it offered what at the time was an innovative service: a place where you could type in or upload notes, organize them into folders, and try to get your online life into some kind of order. Over the years, it had added a number of good features, such as a web clipper, an improved ability to pick up text from photos, and many others. By 2011 it was &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2508496/try-to-remember%E2%80%94evernote-vs%E2%80%94springpad.html"&gt;available in two versions&lt;/a&gt;: an ad-supported free version with some limitations and a $45 / year subscription with no ads and additional features. In June 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3089500/evernote-changes-its-pricing-plans-and-users-worry.html"&gt;prices went up&lt;/a&gt;, and the free version could only be synced to two devices, a limitation that alarmed quite a few of its previously faithful users and no doubt caused a number to move to other apps. At the time, I thought seriously about moving on; but in the end, I bit the bullet and subscribed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAvFOV"&gt;By 2019, Evernote had also weathered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/16/13979778/evernote-privacy-policy-opt-out"&gt;a brief privacy upheaval&lt;/a&gt;, among other issues. I wrote, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18264368/evernote-notes-how-to-move-migrate-onenote-zoho-notebook-simplenote"&gt;an article on Evernote alternatives&lt;/a&gt;, “Evernote’s reputation has suffered due to an aging interface, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12052056/evernote-price-changes-basic-plus-premium"&gt;increased fees&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/18/evernote-just-slashed-54-jobs-or-15-percent-of-its-workforce/"&gt;a series of layoffs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://evernote.com/blog/ian-small-new-ceo/"&gt;a new CEO&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Os82eS"&gt;But despite everything, Evernote is still here, and now it has added several new features (including a long-overdue task listing) and has once again revamped its price structure. The company has apparently learned from at least some of its mistakes; a few days before the new prices went into effect, I received an email that assured me that, as a current subscriber, I was grandfathered into my subscription level and that my annual subscription price would not change. In other words, Evernote doesn’t intend to piss off its established users yet again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Evernote’s new homepage is well-designed and useful." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1UlDlC1ck6xJE0221xUu-kQm0vc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22734276/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_10.41.21_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evernote’s new homepage is well-designed and useful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hASSa4"&gt;Admittedly, many of the app’s recent changes — some of which came through earlier this year, and some of which are brand-new — are quite good ones, adding new functionality while trying to fix the perception that the application has become top-heavy. A customizable and attractive homepage now gives you a quick view of your most recent notes and can also include a scratch pad, pinned notes or notebooks, the new task listing, and a calendar. The calendar allows you to handily associate notes with dates on your Google Calendar (Outlook is next in line). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGLmgq"&gt;However, which of these features you can access depends on what type of subscription you have. Evernote now offers &lt;a href="https://evernote.com/compare-plans"&gt;four subscription levels&lt;/a&gt;: Free, Personal ($7.99 a month or $69.99 a year), Professional ($9.99 a month or $99.99 a year), or Teams ($14.99 per user per month). There is a significant difference between the free app and the Personal one — non-paying users can still only sync between two devices, cannot personalize their homepages, set due dates or reminders for tasks, or use the calendar feature. On the other hand, most of the features that an individual user would want to use are included at the Personal level; the Professional level adds more customization and other business-like upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s nice that Evernote has finally added a tasks manager..." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HecEvgA5tRL0WMwxogn02XCcxUQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22734289/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_10.38.27_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s nice that Evernote has finally added a tasks manager...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="...but you need to be at the Personal level before you can use it effectively." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X1ijDsOv146wtmXilRKqjTaVIRg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22734290/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_10.39.47_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...but you need to be at the Personal level before you can use it effectively.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wwomy6"&gt;As for me, I’m currently in the weird in-between limbo of one of Evernote’s long-term users. When Evernote’s latest changeover happened, I was at the Plus level (at an annual fee of about $38), so I still don’t have limits on how many devices I can sync, and I have a monthly upload limit of 1GB, which is more than the free version’s limit of 60MB but less than Personal’s 10GB. I also don’t have access to much of the really cool new stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZw6IH"&gt;So if you’re using the free version or, like me, are grandfathered into a less feature-filled version, is it worth the upgrade? Possibly. Evernote has a lot of competition these days. Several people I know have moved to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fonenote%2Fdigital-note-taking-app%3Fms.url%3Donenotecom%26rtc%3D1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s OneNote&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn’t have a lot of the restrictions that the free version of Evernote has. Free apps like &lt;a href="https://www.icloud.com/notes"&gt;Apple Notes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://keep.google.com/"&gt;Google Keep&lt;/a&gt; have gotten a lot more useful over the years and might be good enough now for even some power users. There are also other interesting apps out there with vastly different formats that allow you to enter text and collect other types of data. (For example, I’ve been doing a lot of experimenting with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21261811/note-taking-app-notion-free-plan-personal-use-unlimited-blocks"&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt; lately.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RIy9t"&gt;My own decision is that, for now, I’m going to stick with Evernote (especially since I’ve just paid my annual fee), and work with the version I’ve got. It’s possible that I’ll decide eventually that I want all my notes and schedules and tasks integrated into one package, and will yield to Evernote’s frequent hints to upgrade. However, it’s more possible that I will continue to be happy using Evernote for some things and Notion (or another app) for others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y96mIo"&gt;Whether I would do the same were I not already heavily invested in Evernote is a question that’s hard to answer. I still really like the app — I like its flexibility, its ability to save articles and sites on the fly, and its excellent search engine. But the free version remains unusable for anyone with more than a single computer and a phone, and with other alternatives out there, I’m not sure I’d splurge for the annual $70 fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vi4918"&gt;As with most productivity apps, it all depends on what fits you — your needs, your working habits, and the way your brain works. If you’re looking for a way to save notes, clippings, and other data, I’d suggest you spend some time with Evernote, OneNote, &lt;a href="https://www.zoho.com/notebook/"&gt;Zoho Notebook&lt;/a&gt;, Google Keep, Apple Notes, Notion, or any of the many others that are out there, and see what suits you best. After all, that’s what free trials are for, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWIzXT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BC8pm9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Drive will let you block other users to stop potential harassment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8zRI_3V706zuixXzFquVN1CNZyo=/124x0:1476x901/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69621738/Blog_user_google_drive.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users can be blocked by right clicking on a file they’ve sent you.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xvNjbc"&gt;Google Drive is adding the ability for users to block other accounts from sharing files with them, in a move that’s designed to prevent potential harassment and spam on the platform. The feature, which is &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/07/block-shares-from-user-google-drive.html"&gt;rolling out over the next two weeks&lt;/a&gt;, also stops accounts from accessing any files you’ve shared with them in the past, and removes any of their past files from your drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbJGRf"&gt;“Drive’s sharing capabilities fuel productivity and collaboration, but bad actors can abuse tools that are meant to facilitate helpful sharing,” Google’s announcement post says. “That’s why we are creating a way to block other users.” Blocking an account in Drive will also prevent them from interacting with you &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6388749#zippy=%2Cuse-drive-to-block-an-account"&gt;across other Google services&lt;/a&gt; like Hangouts and Chat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lzaHFqkcDQMHtdljabD2c0rDJq0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735279/block_user_drive_list.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The block option as it appears in Drive’s context menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="syWyNL"&gt;The search giant announced the new feature &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/new-security-capabilities-for-google-workspace"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt;. It came after a &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/google-drive-harassment-remove-shared"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;highlighted an instance where a user was unable to remove a shared folder from an abusive ex-partner from their Drive. Because the folder contained innocuous photographs, Drive’s existing “report as abuse” feature wasn’t an appropriate response, and the service’s design made it difficult to permanently remove the files otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHrGIV"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/10613533"&gt;Google’s support page&lt;/a&gt;, the option to block a user will appear if you right-click a file they’ve shared with you in Drive. There’s also an option to unblock users later if you change your mind. It’s an important admission that sharing features can easily be abused by bad actors, even when they’re a part of a service that’s not a traditional social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0kruU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use the Green Screen effect on TikTok </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The TikTok music note logo against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/51y2KwuzxSmlgPbWSqaCGdMQoB4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69621591/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EiXu4T"&gt;Green screens used to be reserved for those with access to, well, a green screen. This method has been around for a long time: allowing creators to superimpose a photo or video onto a background in a film or video. Traditionally, that means using a setup that has a large sheet of (usually) green material behind the subject. The solid color makes it easy to digitally remove that color in post-production and add whatever image or video should be there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tiHGcQ"&gt;Now the idea of green screens has gone digital as a way to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21173608/zoom-video-conference-how-to-virtual-background-greenscreen"&gt;hide backgrounds in meetings&lt;/a&gt; or to create fun videos on social media. TikTok has taken this idea and run with it by creating an effect within the app that does basically the same thing. While not as polished as a traditional green screen, it still gets the job done and allows the creator to remain on-screen while showing the audience an image in the background of the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJrlyC"&gt;The effect is a great way to spice up a video and provide an interesting visual. I use it regularly on &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@verge?"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s TikTok&lt;/a&gt; so the audience can see whatever object or topic I’m discussing. Even though I usually rely on the basic green screen option, which adds a photo to the background, there are plenty of different effects to choose from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPkkKz"&gt;Here’s how you can do it in TikTok: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="szxdyH"&gt;Tap the + icon in the bottom center of the screen to create a new video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PAjHcF"&gt;Click “Effects” in the bottom left corner. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZuJgfE"&gt;Choose “Green Screen” from the menu. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WbhXph"&gt;Browse all of the Green Screen effects and decide which one best suits what you want to do with your video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HhdS2PPfMFWwVtuwieZfSypJVns=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733102/IMG_8204.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are a lot of different Green Screen effects to choose from.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xoloqhSj1sCXnf5atSAH_y7bwKU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733109/IMG_8205.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whatever image you choose will become the background.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QVDP0Q"&gt;The most common effects used are the simplest: they add a photo or video to the background that stays in place as the subject moves around the frame. But there are others that you can try that get pretty creative. You can add an image as a sticker that can be resized and moved around, or you can superimpose an image over your clothing to change your look. There’s even a feature to add parts of your face to a photo just in case, say, you want to pretend your dog can talk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xv8Kup"&gt;The options are limitless once you use a little imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xp29ZPXSmiXT_EKiMlla9CBpyvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733122/IMG_8210.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turn your pet into a terrifying creature using the face green screen effect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1s-jThhWpinQ86akGDST1Kiip2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733129/IMG_8211.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Change your outfit up using a photo or design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
