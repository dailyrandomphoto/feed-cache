    <title>Robinhood has to pay a trader around $30K for restricting trades on certain stocks  </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fEAMVf"&gt;Jose Batista, a retail investor, was awarded almost $30,000 from Robinhood after filing a complaint using the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s (or FINRA’s) arbitration service. His case may end up being an example for other retail traders who are still upset at the trading platform’s actions in January of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tm1fHo"&gt;On January 28th, Batista was planning on selling his stock in Koss and Express — but  Robinhood &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys"&gt;had placed trading restrictions on them&lt;/a&gt;, limiting the amount of shares its users could buy. This meant that Batista had to watch helplessly as the prices of his stock fell to nearly half of what they were the day before the restrictions were put in place, &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-27-year-old-truck-driver-just-became-robinhoods-first-big-headache-of-2022-11641856157"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MarketWatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Seeing it plummeting and plummeting, I felt horrible, and then I felt stuck,” &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7n78q/robinhood-trader-wins-dollar30000-in-first-of-its-kind-payout-following-gamestop-mania"&gt;Batista told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DPx4ZE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Robinhood’s decision to freeze and restrict stock trading led to dozens of lawsuits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F9wA2U"&gt;Robinhood’s restrictions were thanks to the rush of trades happening around GameStop’s stock, which were in part driven by retail investors. In January 2021, the company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248775/gamestop-stock-price-rise-bloomberg-wallstreetbets-subreddit"&gt;hyped up by users of the WallStreetBets subreddit&lt;/a&gt;, and its stock rocketed up in value. This eventually lead to temporary &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244900/game-stop-stock-halted-trading-volatility"&gt;market-wide trading halts&lt;/a&gt; and even seemingly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252864/wallstreetbets-stocks-memes-broker-outages-limits-amc-gamestop"&gt;caused technical difficulties at several brokerages&lt;/a&gt;. That included Robinhood, which restricted trades on not just GameStop but other stocks such as AMC, Blackberry, Koss, and Express.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Es7KWy"&gt;The trading restrictions meant Robinhood users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;couldn’t buy any shares of the main meme stocks&lt;/a&gt;. It also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys"&gt;heavily limited&lt;/a&gt; the number of shares its users could buy in other companies — at one point, users could only buy shares of Express if they owned less than five already. For Koss, you were only allowed to buy a single share. The freeze attracted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22254656/robinhood-gamestop-stonks-trade-freeze-class-action-lawsuits"&gt;dozens of user lawsuits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"&gt;review bombs&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254584/gamestop-robinhood-short-reddit-wallstreetbets-aoc-ted-cruz"&gt;attention from lawmakers&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the other lawsuits and investigations haven’t ended up going anywhere, though, according to &lt;em&gt;MarketWatch&lt;/em&gt; and Batista’s lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKkKMH"&gt;The arbitrator &lt;a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/aao_documents/21-01206.pdf"&gt;doesn’t give a rationale&lt;/a&gt; for Batista’s win. However, Batista’s lawyer &lt;a href="https://www.iorioaltamirano.com/blog/read-more-about-iorio-altamirano-llps-historic-arbitration-award-against-robinhood-for-january-2021-trading-restrictions/"&gt;wrote a post&lt;/a&gt; theorizing about why they were successful where others had failed: because the case focused on “Robinhood’s inadequate liquidity management practices and monitoring of its counterparty risk.” The post also says that they “attacked, head-on, the notion that Robinhood’s customer agreement gives it unfettered right to restrict trading for any reason, at any time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GZ6dZL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Other spurned traders may use this case as a template&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Enwu8U"&gt;To other traders, the case could represent blood in the water. While arbitration decisions don’t set legal precedent, meaning that another arbitrator could rule a different way in an almost identical case, Batista’s lawyer calls for other Robinhood customers to contact the firm. A &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/s0z2vb/apparently_someone_successfully_sued_robinhood/"&gt;few threads&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/s0z8v3/a_27yearold_truck_driver_just_became_robinhoods/"&gt;stock-related subreddits&lt;/a&gt; have already pointed out the possibility that the case could be used as an example to try and get a payout from Robinhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HmMF5"&gt;In addition to the $29,460.77 in damages Batista will receive, Robinhood will also be on the hook for a few more grand: the arbitrator ordered it to pay almost a year’s interest on the money. Robinhood &lt;a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/aao_documents/21-01206.pdf"&gt;will also have to pay filing&lt;/a&gt; and some other fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8Q9oL"&gt;Robinhood, the parent company of the two entities named in the dispute, declined to provide an on-the-record response for this story. Those two entities are Robinhood Securities and Robinhood Financial. Both are members of FINRA, though the parent company is not — so the ruling applies to those two legal entities within Robinhood itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vwn3fS"&gt;While GameStop’s stock led to the trade restrictions, it’s not what Batista filed his complaint about. Batista &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; own GameStop shares at the time but had no plans of selling them, according to &lt;em&gt;MarketWatch&lt;/em&gt;. Some Redditors have urged him to put his winnings back into GameStop, but he instead plans on investing the money into his trucking business and using it to pay for childcare, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7n78q/robinhood-trader-wins-dollar30000-in-first-of-its-kind-payout-following-gamestop-mania"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wj8TOI"&gt;For Batista, it seems like a happy end to the saga — maybe his story will be adapted as part of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22268952/gamestop-stock-stonks-reddit-wallstreetbets-movies-tv-shows-hbo-netflix"&gt;bajillion movies, documentaries, and TV shows&lt;/a&gt; that are supposedly in the works about the GameStop / WallStreetBets bonanza.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Expanse season 6 makes me worry about the future of touchscreens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E1ek5119IWooU2vgpfF0H4nfhu8=/9x0:2121x1408/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70384249/the_expanse_season_6_epsiode_2_roci_crew.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt; I hope the future can do better&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="SH0ZsY"&gt;As we hurtle towards &lt;em&gt;The Expanse’s&lt;/em&gt; sixth and final episode of its sixth and final season — airing this Friday, January 14th — I can’t stop thinking about one thing: how many of this season’s pivotal moments revolved around pressing the wrong button on a touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGOoes"&gt;“If it comes across that the touchscreen is the hero of the show, then we will have truly failed,” says showrunner Naren Shankar, telling me he objects to my entire line of questioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYWtYC"&gt;I wouldn’t say they failed! I enjoyed the whole season, even if it felt a little... &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/24/22851119/the-expanse-season-6-final-amazon-x-ray"&gt;cramped&lt;/a&gt;. I’m excited for &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22826567/the-expanse-telltale-series-announcement-in-development-camina-drummer"&gt;the game&lt;/a&gt;, too. But it’s been 15 years since Steve Jobs &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnrJzXM7a6o"&gt;introduced the first iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m kind of hoping touchscreens don’t &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; trip us up in another 300 years or so. Sadly, like much of the excellent series, it’s all too plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWqKmK"&gt;I spoke to Shankar and authors / writers / showrunners Ty Franck and Daniel Abraham about those user interfaces last month. Also, I badgered them about whether and how &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt; might return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LfZVF"&gt;But first, you probably want to know what the heck I’m talking about re: touchscreens. And that requires spoilers.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RczgY2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoiler warning: this story contains huge spoilers for The Expanse season 6, episodes 1-5. If you’re caught up, you’re good; I won’t mention episode 6 at all. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YCbJt2"&gt;1) Those buttons are right next to each other&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="OFbtTI"&gt;At the end of &lt;em&gt;The Expanse &lt;/em&gt;season 5, Camina Drummer and her Belter crew are on the run, having defected from Marco Inaros and his Free Navy. He effectively forced them to join or die, but they decided not to become his guns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9EVCZ"&gt;They are tired. Frazzled. So fatigued that in the midst of a carefully planned ambush necessary to escape the Free Navy’s clutches, Michio stabs &lt;em&gt;the wrong touchscreen button. &lt;/em&gt;Not just any wrong button, either: instead of blowing the enemy to scrap, it sends out a signal that reveals their exact position. “What did you do?” Drummer screams.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8DdxKOgIJwXKSohp_I8WwWLedN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23164113/wrong_button.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe don’t put buttons right next to each other when one of them will kill you? Then again, Belters jury-rig everything, so I suppose it’s not too surprising they carelessly bound this macro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nBH9FB"&gt;This single action sets up the entire chain of events for Drummer’s crew right through episode 5. Critically low on supplies (they had to blow up two salvageable ships to save themselves, using physical buttons, I might add) and after deciding they need to offload the mentally weary Michio after the touchscreen debacle, they find themselves making an uneasy alliance with another Belter captain. He leads them to exactly what Drummer needs to undermine Marco Inaros’ credibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVXfTK"&gt;I’m totally fine with this plot-wise, even though I am the kind of person who would never, ever trust myself to stab a touchscreen in a moving vehicle. (Volume dials, please!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4zYkFU"&gt;2) Touchscreen drone controls&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/htVO6UbNpaJQgSJ8YeJRC2K-DrI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23164337/expanse_touchscreen_drone_controls.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2FrMNj"&gt;We now know the mysterious new world Laconia, accessible from our solar system via the Ring Gate, is home to intelligent lifeforms with the power to repair things... and perhaps even people. By the beginning of episode 5, the “Dogs” appear to have helped precocious little girl Cara bring her brother back from the dead — one of the biggest revelations about what humanity might be capable of in &lt;em&gt;The Expanse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQRacV"&gt;What gave her the idea to drag her brother’s corpse into the wilderness? Way back in episode 2, she was flying a drone with touchscreen controls (already a bad idea if you ask me!), pushes the joystick the wrong direction without looking at the drone’s surroundings, and it hits a tree branch and crashes into the ground. But when she returns in episode 3, she finds the Dogs have fixed her drone (as well as an alien chick she’d befriended and accidentally killed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ni0SA2"&gt;Come on, &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21009994/skydio-2-review-self-flying-autonomous-drone-camera-crash-proof-price"&gt;we already had self-flying drones&lt;/a&gt; that could have dodged that branch in 2019, much less 2350. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EEGUd8"&gt;3) The dud torpedo&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kk3wLoRRmc9H4mpuPL9HQ7xL-B0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23164562/holden_wrist_touchscreen_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holden’s a pro with the wrist computer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gdk7bF"&gt;This one’s 100 percent intentional. At the end of episode 3, The Rocinante has miraculously slipped out of Marco Inaros’ clutches (thanks to a combination of superior firepower, piloting, and luck) and is ready to deliver a killing blow... but after they fire a nuclear torpedo, Holden swiftly and secretly disables the nuke part from his touchscreen wrist computer to avoid killing Naomi’s son. The torpedo doesn’t explode, temporarily convincing everyone that it was a dud — except both the ship’s computer and the eventually recovered torpedo keep a record of Holden’s authorization in their logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WWVf9"&gt;You can argue whether Holden made the right choice or not, and in general, I love how &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;’s interfaces automatically surface the controls their owners might use next, like quickly opening, locking, and unlocking doors aboard a ship. But once again, it’s a pivotal moment where pressing one button on a touchscreen instead of another has lasting repercussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="52Eksk"&gt;Bonus: Holden’s hammer&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bNA3Kg-j3DXdHwB9Ko7hwzAyQaY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23166514/expanse_holden_hammer.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m not sure if it’s technically a pry bar or a nail puller he’s holding, but either way it’s tiny and probably not the real reason the engine stops? Probably.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BNYIjD"&gt;Twenty-five minutes into episode 1, shortly after Michio’s touchscreen button fail, Holden is standing on an asteroid that’s been outfitted with its own engine so the Free Navy can fire it at Earth. Suddenly, that engine starts to fire up... and with no time to react, Holden just smashes the damn thing with a pry bar till it stops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="msSZOI"&gt;What The Expanse’s writers had to say&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="V25ARW"&gt;So I asked the authors and showrunners: &lt;strong&gt;how, exactly, did user interfaces hurt you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZA9DWA"&gt;“I did almost 10 years of frontline tech support; user interfaces and I are going to die with our teeth in each other’s necks,” replies Daniel Abraham. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWAdPf"&gt;“And I’m going to take issue with the question,” says Naren Shankar (as I’ve already mentioned). “Yes, all of them involve buttons,” he admits, “but the scene is about the emotional decision to push a button.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="oqwwKB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10976337"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zi3c83"&gt;“What we should have done was go back and have a bunch of those switches,” Abraham jokes. “The old toggle switches and everything,” agrees Ty Franck. “I wish we had a lot more of those buttons in the show.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VCeXY"&gt;“But to be more serious for a second, all of those moments that you cite are quite emotionally motivated, extremely in two of the cases [...] That’s how they fly the ship. Sometimes they do some things by talking to it, that doesn’t mean it’s always a voice-to-text parser,” adds Shankar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjmk4M"&gt;“Except in the Solomon Epstein one we did, that was totally the fault of the voice parser,” says Franck, I think, though I’ve started to lose track as they’re talking over each other. He’s referencing how &lt;a href="https://expanse.fandom.com/wiki/Paradigm_Shift"&gt;season 2, episode 6&lt;/a&gt; flashes back to how an engineer accidentally invented long-range space travel and dies because he can’t turn the engine off; he disabled his crappy voice parser before launch, and the g-forces are too strong for him to reach the other controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOM88R"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do touchscreens mean to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQIrHg"&gt;“It’s kind of the same question as ‘why do we use guns instead of laser blasters or something like that?’” says Abraham. “There’s kind of a technological endpoint you can reach where something works well, and then you kind of stick with it. We have cartridge guns in The Expanse because they work really well; they’re kind of the sharks of personal weaponry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xv1FbI"&gt;“What we’re positing here is that these touchscreens and these kinds of interfaces are robust and work well in these kinds of conditions, where jacking into your brain, maybe not so much? Speech, yelling commands to the ship is cool, but it’s kind of a shitty interface in practice,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84cofL"&gt;“Humans interact with the world with their fingertips. There’s millions of years of evolution behind that — our fingers are connected to our brains differently than any other part of us,” Franck chimes in. “When we want to accomplish a thing, our first instinct is to reach out and touch something and manipulate it with their fingers ... so when I see something where people are no longer using their hands to do work, it feels false to me, it’s ignoring the realities of what humans do as biological entities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="chSgu9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we’ve reached for a Wikipedia level of plausibility”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jwGaQs"&gt;All that said, &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;’s authors and showrunners caution that they’re not trying to predict the future. “Science fiction is about the age in which it’s written.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;We’ve been trying to keep what we’ve done plausible, but I don’t know if we’re really aiming to say how a fusion drive will really work, how stealth technology will really work. I’ve always said we’ve reached for a Wikipedia level of plausibility,” says Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Want the ‘TLDR’ on a site’s terms of service? There’s a bill for that</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3MVElN"&gt;Democrats and Republicans are getting behind a new bill, introduced Thursday, that would force tech companies to simplify the language in their terms of service agreements, making it easier for consumers to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhRbZA"&gt;The Terms-of-service Labeling, Design and Readability Act – &lt;a href="https://trahan.house.gov/uploadedfiles/tldr_act.pdf"&gt;or TLDR for short&lt;/a&gt; – would require websites to provide a “summary statement” for users before they opt in to a terms of service agreement. The statement would summarize the legal jargon into something more easily understood by the average user, along with disclosing any recent data breaches (from the three years) and the types of sensitive data the site may collect. The summary &lt;a href="https://trahan.house.gov/uploadedfiles/tldr_act_one-pager.pdf"&gt;would also explain&lt;/a&gt; “whether a consumer can delete their data, and if so, provide instructions on how.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ynKda"&gt;“For far too long, blanket terms of service agreements have forced consumers to either ‘agree’ to all of a company’s conditions or lose access to a website or app entirely,” Rep. Lori Trahan (D-MA), one of the bill’s lead sponsors, said in a statement on Thursday. “No negotiation, no alternative, and no real choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ps8BqL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No negotiation, no alternative, and no real choice.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rgavg6"&gt;This bipartisan push for greater transparency into tech comes after Facebook faced months of criticism from lawmakers over how the company may harm users. Specifically, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807909/frances-haugen-congress-testify-section-230-facebook-whistleblower"&gt;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testified&lt;/a&gt; before Congress &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721229/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-instagram-oversight-board"&gt;multiple times&lt;/a&gt;, outlining a series of leaks she released after leaving the social media company. Lawmakers used these disclosures as a means of demanding more transparency from the embattled social media company and others, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747330/snap-tiktok-youtube-facebook-papers-blumenthal-coppa-kids-child-safety"&gt;like Snap, TikTok, and YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNBIeA"&gt;It’s unclear if lawmakers have received any additional internal reports, like those concerned with mental health, from any large tech companies, as of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0veuP"&gt;While the TLDR Act applies to most large websites and apps, like Facebook and Twitter, it exempts some small businesses. The Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general would be the main enforcers of the law, and they would be authorized to seek civil action against sites that break it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1m4za1"&gt;“Users should not have to comb through pages of legal jargon in a website’s terms of services to know how their data will be used,” said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA). “Requiring companies to provide an easy-to-understand summary of their terms should be mandatory and is long overdue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fiCGJC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWsXSr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The real beauty of Wordle is how its emoji results tell a story</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New York City Entertainment Industry Slows During Coronavirus Surge" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/joaQ7gKoOLGfDaQYAXrO2ZMw8DA=/1820x1772:7418x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70383991/1364329843.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oCYxMS"&gt;Did you struggle with &lt;a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; today? I sure as hell did, racking up my second ever failure since I started playing the game at the beginning of the year. I was annoyed at myself more than the puzzle and eased that frustration by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jjvincent/status/1481580704441978887"&gt;sharing my results on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9k7lQ"&gt;As I did, I realized why the game’s auto-generated grids of emoji are so brilliant. It’s not just that they’re social (though that certainly helps), nor is it that they’re intriguing (there’s no link to the game and no explanation for the uninitiated as to what the emoji mean). No, it’s because each grid tells a story with wonderful concision. With just 30 squares and three colors, &lt;em&gt;Wordle’s&lt;/em&gt; emoji results convey narratives of luck, frustration, perseverance, and failure; each grid a miniature story, like a landscape painted in a matchbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmqWCb"&gt;Okay, okay, I get it — this sounds a little over the top! But take a look below at my failed result from today. You can see I get off to a good start, scoring two correct letters in the correct positions immediately. Then I try again, and, okay, I don’t get any more hits, but I’ve still got that solid foundation. Another try: nada. Two more: still nothing! Then the sixth and final guess, annnnd crash: I fail completely, those two unbroken lines of green emoji forming a comedic anticlimax, like a pair of skidmarks disappearing over the edge of a cliff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLf4DH"&gt;At least, that’s how I see it. In my head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jtsnqv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;had an absolute mare &lt;br&gt;Wordle 208 X/6&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ⬜⬜ ⬜&lt;br&gt; ⬜⬜ ⬜&lt;br&gt; ⬜⬜ ⬜&lt;br&gt; ⬜⬜ ⬜&lt;br&gt; ⬜⬜ ⬜&lt;br&gt; ⬜⬜ ⬜&lt;/p&gt;— James Vincent (@jjvincent) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jjvincent/status/1481580704441978887?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kgWhrk"&gt;To rationalize this a bit more, I think &lt;em&gt;Wordle’s&lt;/em&gt; emoji results work particularly well as story-telling devices for two reasons. The first is that they’re chronological. Like panels in a cartoon, you read the emoji as a narrative, each line — each guess — building on the one before. Unlike a video game high score or a finished crossword puzzle, these aren’t just trophies of skill but replays of the entire game. You know that if someone got all green on their second guess, then their win was more luck than skill. But if you see them battling through grey and yellow squares down to the sixth line, you know that win took &lt;em&gt;guts&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeYUvQ"&gt;The second reason is that each grid is something of a &lt;em&gt;roman à clef&lt;/em&gt;. By this, I mean that if you’ve played the game in question, you’ll recognize what letters the player got right and wrong, allowing you to flesh out the story in your head (and perhaps compare it to your own). That’s where the social element comes back again (as well as Wordle’s puzzle-a-day mechanic): it encourages you to play the game yourself and so better decipher your friends’ results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVOihM"&gt;The only downside of this system is that the results — like all emoji — are not particularly friendly to people using a screen reader. Instead of offering a visual snapshot, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/annaecook/status/1478409873645731840"&gt;they become a robotic dirge&lt;/a&gt; of [Green square] [Three wide large square] [Yellow square] and so on, like a tar pit of emoji description. (The best way around this, I’ve learned only recently, is to take a screenshot of the results and then add a description to the alt text.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dLZeFi"&gt;Of course, the popularity of &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; is more or less guaranteed to flame out any day now. And when that happens, all those grids of emoji will return to their natural, mute state; no longer signifying stories of grit and triumph but becoming once more, just colored squares. It’s the only proper ending to viral fame: all those moments lost, like emoji in the timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Baby Shark is the first YouTube video to surpass 10 billion views</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D8E_0SBxYFEVw5RhBo9NqfQmq6s=/12x0:1389x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70383939/Baby_Shark_Dance____babyshark_Most_Viewed_Video___Animal_Songs___PINKFONG_Songs_for_Children_0_18_screenshot__1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Pinkfong&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kxYgKE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w"&gt;“Baby Shark”&lt;/a&gt; became the most-viewed YouTube video of all time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546350/baby-shark-youtube-video-most-popular-despacito-masha"&gt;in November 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and just over a year later, it has achieved another huge milestone: it has become the first YouTube video to surpass 10 billion views. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ik1Wh2"&gt;“Baby Shark” is a cultural touchstone at this point. I remember singing it at summer camps as a kid growing up, and given the record-breaking popularity of the music video (which was created by the entertainment company Pinkfong), it seems I’m not the only person who will never forget this song. (I’ve been idly tapping my foot to the beat in my head the entire time I’ve been writing this post.) But the song’s impact doesn’t stop with the earworm hit. There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10518284/"&gt;a Baby Shark show on Nickelodeon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/baby-shark-movie-1235063576/"&gt;a Baby Shark movie&lt;/a&gt;, and yes, as you may have feared, &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pinkfong-unveils-baby-sharks-first-ever-nft-collection-on-makersplace-301433995.html"&gt;Baby Shark NFTs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4aMFUd"&gt;If you’re curious what the other top-viewed YouTube videos are, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-viewed_YouTube_videos"&gt;Wikipedia looks to have a comprehensive list&lt;/a&gt;. The second most-viewed as of this writing is Luis Fonsi’s “Despacito,” which held the crown before “Baby Shark” did, though, with 7.7 billion views, it has a long way to go to try and catch the shark. (And I hope that by mentioning another extremely catchy song, I got “Baby Shark” out of your head for the day.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eternals’ awful sex scene is kind of clever the second time around</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qiv7_etqBK2w-2Yx1YGvByv4ecg=/988x121:6031x3483/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70383847/SLH_09385_RC.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i1gq6x"&gt;Marvel’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759203/eternals-review-marvel-studios-chloe-zhao-gemma-chan-richard-madden"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;from director Chloé Zhao was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/21/17888042/the-eternals-director-marvel-chloe-zhao"&gt;a film of many firsts for the studio&lt;/a&gt;, but it would be a bit inaccurate to say that it featured the MCU’s first sex scene, as a lot of people &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/eternals-sex-scene-richard-madden-gemma-chan-marvel-1235105274/"&gt;seem to think it did&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Daredevil &lt;/em&gt;and the rest of the Netflix / Marvel gang spent seasons getting it in over in their neck of the cinematic universe, and those shows very much laid some groundwork for &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;’ much-tamer take on superpowered sex. &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;’ sex scene might not technically be Marvel’s first, or particularly “fun” to watch, but it’s one of the movie’s more clever ways of stating the obvious about how its story is going to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLUMBd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This essay contains spoilers for Marvel’s Eternals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtpvty"&gt;Throughout &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;, an emotionally-inert foray into the cosmic origins of Marvel’s cinematic universe, there are multiple moments meant to show you how the Eternals themselves grew to love and identify with humanity during the thousands of years they spent living on Earth in varying degrees of secrecy. With there only being but so many Deviants — cosmically-empowered monsters — around for the Eternals to hunt down over the millennia, it doesn’t take long in the grand scheme of Earth’s history for the Eternals to find themselves with enough downtime to develop interests in… &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; things like reading, farming, picking up new languages. You know, human stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bsGf7X1p8OKU4PKEKdtF4Et1HQw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23166247/SLH_25812_RC.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ikaris and Sersi sharing a moment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRzBPP"&gt;In addition to those kinds of activities, though, a few of &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;’ heroes also find themselves gravitating toward and wanting to know one another in the biblical sense, an idea the film explores in particular with Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Ikaris (Richard Madden). While &lt;em&gt;Eternals &lt;/em&gt;doesn’t explicitly say that romance and physical intimacy were things the Eternals learned about by watching humans, Sersi and Ikaris’ much-buzzed-about sex scene more than makes that seem like it might have been the case given how awkward the moment is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4sha9"&gt;Soon after the Eternals are first led to believe that they’re finally being given the freedom to pursue their own dreams, Ikaris, the team’s flying brick with laser vision, musters up to courage to tell Sersi, a soft-spoken mediator with transmutation powers, that he’s deeply in love with her, always has been, and always will be. Though the Eternals are alien beings with their own ways of life, Seri and Ikaris consummate their love in the most human of ways as the pair venture off together in early the film and end up naked on a sandy dune locked in what’s best described as perfunctory sexual congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQjyDn"&gt;Even though Ikaris and Sersi’s relationship plays a major role in how &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;’ story unfolds, Madden and Chan’s lack of on-screen chemistry makes the characters’ interpersonal dynamics one of the least compelling aspects of the film, which is a wonder considering how important the scene was to Zhao and how &lt;em&gt;much &lt;/em&gt;genuine on-screen chemistry there is between other Eternals like Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) and Druig (Barry Keoghan), and Thena (Angelina Jolie) and Gilgamesh (Don Lee).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ztb0mI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The pair end up locked in what’s best described as perfunctory sexual congress&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7lRpVe"&gt;By the time that &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;’ shifts its focus to the present day, when the Eternals are brought back out of hiding by the Deviants’ sudden reappearance, the world’s a drastically different place, and most of the Eternals have become different people. Where Sersi and the others all manage to find happiness in their new lives and letting their past selves go, Ikaris remains steadfast in his commitment to their &lt;em&gt;true &lt;/em&gt;mission, which only he and Prime Eternal Ajak (Salma Hayek) are privy to at first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkhmFD"&gt;Because &lt;em&gt;Eternals &lt;/em&gt;is such a busy film, some of its ideas, like how power and authority are balanced on the actual team, get a bit muddled, but when a dying Ajak chooses Sersi to become the new Prime Eternal, the story’s brushing up against the broadside of something interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/esDx5U4gUNF3mA-z0TTbr8QGjeI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23166111/SLH_33814_RC.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Marvel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Makkari and Druig playing it cool while other people are around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1rN2dG"&gt;Though neither Sersi nor Ikaris can initially understand why Ajak would choose her to be the next Prime Eternal, her reasoning’s pretty easy to grasp just from watching any of &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;’ trailers. He’s a superstrong living weapon whose gaze literally burns holes through things, whereas she’s a creator who expresses reverence and love for the material world while showing off her superhuman mastery over its constituent elements. It’s in moments where Sersi begins to piece together how and why she’s the new Prime Eternal that &lt;em&gt;Eternals &lt;/em&gt;feels as if it’s the most confident in its ability to bring something slightly new to the pantheon of Marvel’s big-screen spectacles: a feature about a woman getting a promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FJtCw"&gt;Much like Zack Snyder’s &lt;em&gt;Justice League &lt;/em&gt;before it, &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;’ family drama briefly turns brutal as everyone comes together to fight one of their own. But unlike the amnesiac Superman, Ikaris emerges from his battle with the other Eternals definitively marked as the villain of the movie who’s willing to put the entire Earth in danger in order to complete their mission. As the world teeters on the brink of destruction in &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; final act, Sersi and Ikaris are left seeming as if they’re about to tearfully fight to the death, and the movie&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;cuts to a montage in an attempt to make you feel what they’re feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="ks3YhM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The two come across more as Very Good Friends, not people who’ve seen each other naked&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Mn79Pl"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;’ defense, flashbacks to a sex scene during a big superhero fight might not play all that well with audiences, which is likely why it doesn’t pop up again on screen as Ikaris and Sersi reflect on all the history they share. It does feel telling, though, that the two come across more as Very Good Friends rather than people who’ve seen each other naked as they fight over the fate of the Earth. By the time &lt;em&gt;Eternals &lt;/em&gt;gets to this part of its story, the movie’s already so mired in barely explained cosmic lore and aggressive special effects that none of its emotional beats really work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2vbld"&gt;What does work, especially when you go back and watch &lt;em&gt;Eternals &lt;/em&gt;more closely, is the idea that Sersi knew on some level that her romantic entanglement with Ikaris wouldn’t last. In a movie with so many moving parts, that sort of detail’s something you really have to &lt;em&gt;look &lt;/em&gt;for, but with &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; now streaming on Disney Plus for everyone, going back to pinpoint the moment when Sersi &lt;em&gt;knew &lt;/em&gt;just got much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 and Xbox Series X will be available at 3PM ET today for Walmart Plus subscribers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hlNr08zeaUX12iagwr-22yVLtwI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70379557/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4C9oZp"&gt;In case you hadn’t noticed, it’s becoming ever-so-slightly less of a maddening exercise to get your hands on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. Granted, it’s still harder than it should be, but recent retailer restocks have taken longer to sell out than they used to. So, here’s hoping that you’re able to purchase whichever console you want &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fearlyaccess&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;during today’s restock at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is specifically for paid Walmart Plus subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJbH1G"&gt;Starting at 3PM ET / 12PM PT today, January 13th, Walmart will offer the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 PS5 with a disc drive&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383%3Fathbdg%3DL1100&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99 PS5 console that can only play digital titles&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X-Video-Game-Console-Black%2F443574645%3Fathbdg%3DL1100&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. These consoles will be available to non-trial Walmart Plus members, meaning you actually have to opt-in to pay Walmart for the service to get access (&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Faccount%2Fplus%2Foverview&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here’s where you can sign up for Walmart Plus&lt;/a&gt;). Though, Walmart is calling these “early access” deals, perhaps suggesting that they’ll open up to non-Plus customers after a window of time. In the past, the window of exclusivity has been three hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEO0nO"&gt;To ease the checkout process, make sure you have your shipping and payment info ready to go ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="GyhutA"&gt;Some essentials for PS5 owners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gahs20"&gt;In case you plan to get lucky with buying a console today, there are several excellent games and accessories that we recommend. Starting with games, head over to this list to see the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22825859/ps5-best-games-playstation-5-sony-2021"&gt;PS5’s best games of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="potP0F"&gt;Getting an Xbox Series X? Check out these add-ons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3yJrjt"&gt;If you’re on team Xbox, you may already know about Game Pass Ultimate, which gives you discounts and access to an ever-expanding catalog of Game Pass games, along with online multiplayer. You may never need to pay full price for a game for your new console. Though, whether you do want to pay full price or you just need some ideas on what to play, check out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22825913/xbox-series-x-s-best-games-microsoft-2021"&gt;Xbox’s best games of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best budget laptop of 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Cheap Laptop 2022: HP Envy x360 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/91Ojp27YU24CRpqeGNGMFxMlSuQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807794/mchin_200705_4086_0001.0.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best cheap laptops under $800 from HP, Lenovo, and more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="ItC6sO"&gt;The best cheap laptops are getting better and better for less than $800. The question to ask is: what’s most important, and what are you willing to sacrifice? Even the best cheap laptops aren’t perfect in every area — they have some strengths but cut corners to achieve their price tags. You can almost certainly find a budget laptop with a touchscreen, a premium-looking chassis, an HDMI port, a backlit keyboard, or stylus support, but you may need to consider which of those features you want the most, and which you can go without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqLems"&gt;Our pick for the best cheap laptop of 2022 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;, running Windows 10. We feel that the Envy has build quality, performance, and battery life that surpass those of many premium laptops, as well as those priced under $800. But we’ve tested dozens of systems below $800, and we’ve got a number of additional models on this list from Lenovo, Acer, Samsung, HP, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVG16P"&gt;Other best cheap laptops of 2022 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these laptops also appear on our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptop&lt;/a&gt; lists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPoJxi"&gt;Many of our picks for the best cheap laptop of 2022 are currently Chromebooks. We believe that Chromebooks are, in many cases, the best-value option for shoppers seeking a laptop under $500 and tend to offer better specs, features, and build quality than most Windows laptops at that price point. We hope to add more Windows laptops under $500 to this page in the future and are keeping a close eye on those releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best cheap laptop ofof 2022&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="r62WQ4"&gt;HP’s Envy x360 13, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeBestLaptop101521&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-envy-x360-laptop-13z-ay000-8lz58av-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $860&lt;/a&gt; is the best budget laptop you can buy under $800. With a high-quality and sturdy convertible build, it looks like a device that should cost twice its price. It has plenty of other great features as well, including a really excellent keyboard and a bright, colorful screen. It’s also exceptional on the inside. Thanks to its AMD Ryzen processor, the system delivers all-day battery life and very smooth performance — it can even handle some light gaming. (Intel options are available as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ox216u"&gt;We have some minor complaints about the Envy, of course. The screen is 16:9, which is a cramped aspect ratio for multitasking. Our test unit had a somewhat limited port selection (notably, missing Thunderbolt and HDMI support) and came with some bloatware preinstalled. But none of these are deal-breakers at the Envy’s price point. Overall, budget shoppers will want for very little with this machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best laptop under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hyeIry"&gt;If you’re looking for an absurdly cheap Chromebook that absolutely gets the job done, you should definitely be looking at the $260 Lenovo Chromebook Duet. The Duet is a 10-inch aluminum alloy Chrome OS tablet that comes with a kickstand and keyboard cover. It looks sturdy and classy, and it can easily function as either a tablet or a PC. But you’re not compromising &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;much on performance for this device’s tiny size; as long as you’re not running dozens of tabs and apps, you should be fine. And we got over 11 hours of battery life in our testing, making it one of the longest-lasting Chromebooks we’ve seen in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHlVCe"&gt;The main thing to know about the Chromebook Duet is that the screen is quite small — just 10.1 inches. That’s a fine size for a young student (especially with the touch capability) and for an adult’s secondary device for note-taking, Netflixing, and the like, but it’s not an ideal size for a primary work device unless you’re fine with quite a bit of squinting. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the clamshell Chromebook to buy, and one of the best cheap laptops under $800.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best budget laptop with Chrome OS &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="N34v09"&gt;If you’d prefer a more traditional Chromebook with a clamshell form factor, the $329 Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is an affordable option that’s all-around excellent. It has a gorgeous 3:2 display that delivers a sharp picture and bright, vibrant colors with plenty of vertical space. The screen alone would make the Chromebook Spin 713 a standout, but it has a number of other strengths as well, including a great keyboard, all-day battery life, and a comprehensive port selection, including an HDMI, in addition to USB-C, USB-A, and a microSD slot. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 is the best cheap laptop with a built-in stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SSaLnR"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best cheap laptop with a stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iQA7Ph"&gt;If you like the Duet’s size and detachable form factor but are willing to spend on something a bit more upscale, you may find the Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 to be a better choice. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, kickstand, and detachable screen. But the CM3’s kickstand folds multiple ways: you can crease it lengthwise to stand the tablet up like a laptop or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. Plus, it comes with a built-in USI stylus and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. Battery life was also quite impressive: we averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUYikQ"&gt;Where the CM3 lags a bit behind the Duet (and other cheap laptops you may try) is the power. Its MediaTek processor can be a bit sluggish compared to more pricier offerings. But the CM3 still offers a surprising number of perks for its sub-$400 price and makes a great student driver or secondary device. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best laptop under $800&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="o8zBHM"&gt;If you’re looking for a budget Windows laptop that’s thinner and lighter than the Envy x360 while delivering similar category-topping performance, the $669 HP Pavilion Aero 13 is a good choice for you. It has a powerful eight-core Ryzen processor, which is one of the fastest processors for thin and light laptops that you can get. Not only does it perform well, but it’s also unbelievably light at just 2.1 pounds, and it comes with a blindingly bright 16:10 screen. It’s a standout in battery life, too — I averaged almost 11 hours of continuous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOWROI"&gt;HP did have to cut a few corners to achieve those benefits at this price point. The audio on our model wasn’t great, and the device shipped with some cheap bloatware installed. But the Pavilion Aero 13 is excellent in almost every other way, and it won’t disappoint if you’re looking for a functional, cheap Windows PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="pT23AG"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable Chromebook that stands out from the crowd, the $549 Galaxy Chromebook 2 should be on your list. It comes in a bold “fiesta red” color (as well as a regular gray, if you prefer to blend in). It’s a touchscreen convertible with stylus support (though the stylus isn’t included). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QIDME"&gt;On top of the design, the Galaxy Chromebook 2 includes an excellent QLED panel, which is one of the best displays we’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. You also get a solid keyboard, decent battery life (we averaged 7 hours and 21 minutes of continuous work), and a port selection that includes two USB-C ports, a microSD slot, and a headphone jack. It’s easily one of the best Chromebooks you can buy and one of the best cheap laptops as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best cheap laptop for Surface fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9t4Ji3"&gt;The $399 Surface Go 2 is a 10.5-inch tablet that’s about the size of a regular iPad. You’ll have to buy the keyboard cover separately, but the overall package is still quite affordable if you’re buying a lower-priced model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hPLGr"&gt;You can configure the Surface Go 2 with a Pentium Gold or Core m3 processor. Those aren’t the fanciest or most powerful processors, but the system should still be adequate for your streaming and browsing needs, especially if you only need it to do one task at a time. It can run any Windows app, it’s easy to carry around, and it makes a solid secondary computer. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Swift 3 is one of the best college laptops you can buy, and one of the best cheap laptops under $800.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cIbAld"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21377208/acer-swift-3-review-2020-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Acer Swift 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best student laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DeUYiZ"&gt;Many of the best cheap laptops might be good choices for high school and college students, but the Acer Swift 3’s exceptionally durable build makes it an excellent choice for backpack-battering and dining hall spills. Its 14-inch screen also gives you more room for homework multitasking than some of the 13-inch machines here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVxnSd"&gt;But the highlight of the Swift 3 is its Ryzen 4000 processors. We tested a model with a Ryzen 7 4700U, which did an excellent job handling our daily multitasking workload, and delivered seven-hour battery life as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWSkuR"&gt;On the outside, the Swift 3 isn’t the thinnest or most beautiful laptop you can buy, but it’s a solid performer in most areas. It has all kinds of ports, including USB-C, USB-A, and an HDMI. The backlit keyboard has a nice click to it and has a reliable integrated fingerprint reader as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XUPL4K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351151"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Best Cheap Laptop 2022: Lenovo Yoga C740" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4kRdC1NMAi2vFVZ2UX_r7zJ9lYs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19768316/awhite_20200304_3921_0087.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Avery White for The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lenovo Yoga C740 is a sturdy aluminum laptop for any use case, making it one of the best cheap laptops under $800.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m9IrEq"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21174917/lenovo-yoga-c740-review-laptop-specs-features-price-2-in-1-convertible"&gt;Lenovo Yoga C740&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;A cheap laptop with standout build&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HqEdaD"&gt;The Yoga C740 is as straightforward as a laptop can get. It has a sturdy aluminum build and perfectly fine 10th Gen Intel processors. We were pleasantly surprised by the device’s audio — the upward-firing speakers on the sides of the keyboard deliver a nice surround-sound experience. The keyboard and touchpad are both quite comfortable to use. There’s not much to complain about and not much to enthusiastically praise — if you’re looking for a sub-$800 Windows laptop with a well-made aluminum chassis and a sturdy frame, you’re looking for the Yoga. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGHm6c"&gt;The C740 is a year old now, but that means you can get it at very affordable prices. We’re looking forward to reviewing its successor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373719/lenovo-yoga-7i-6-convertible-laptops-intel-amd-processors-windows"&gt;Yoga 7i&lt;/a&gt;, shortly in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gap is launching NFT hoodie art that unlocks physical clothing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4_9C6Mu0tAes1-BM_SJ815ecnfE=/0x0:1600x1067/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70383670/gap_hoodie_nft_collection_frank_ape.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Gap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gHKtoG"&gt;Gap is selling &lt;a href="https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/articles/2022-1/01/gap-launches-gamified-collectible-nft-experience-t"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, following other clothing retailers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22822143/adidas-nft-launch-into-the-metaverse-price-release-date"&gt;Adidas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22833369/nike-rtfkt-nft-sneaker-shoe-metaverse-company"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22800985/macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-nfts-auction"&gt;Macy’s&lt;/a&gt; that in recent months have jumped into the NFT space. The NFTs are built on the Tezos blockchain, which &lt;a href="https://tezos.com/carbon/"&gt;touts itself&lt;/a&gt; as a more energy-efficient option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wj9bRV"&gt;The NFTs come in the form of a series of digital hoodie art, with different levels of rarity at different price points. Common level pieces starting at roughly $8.30, or 2 tez, are on sale today. Rare, epic, and one-of-a-kind tiers will roll out over the next few weeks. Gap is partnering with artist Brandon Sines, creator of the Frank Ape cartoon character, on the designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yv7x69"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The gamified experience comes out to around $500.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrZ6TW"&gt;For shoppers who’d prefer to buy something wearable, look no further than the epic level NFTs, priced at around $415 (100 tez), which include digital art by Sines and a physical Gap x Frank Ape sweatshirt. But first, customers will need to purchase four common and two rare NFTs (priced at 6 tez, or roughly $24.90) to get the chance to buy an epic one, &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/90285/the-gap-tezos-nfts-physical-apparel-perks"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Decrypt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Gap says the “gamified experience” will encourage fans to collect hoodie art leading up to the epic level. In this case, the gamified experience comes out to around $500. If you’re not too picky about your clothing, Gap also has a 50 percent off sale right now that brings the price of a men’s hoodie to about $25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4oCqD"&gt;Gap has scaled back its physical presence over the past few years, retreating from the shopping malls it was once a mainstay in. In October 2020, the company announced it would close &lt;a href="https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/news/responds/gap-stores-update"&gt;350 Gap and Banana Republic stores&lt;/a&gt; in North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="av20ev"&gt;Though the NFT-ification is noteworthy, this isn’t the first time Gap has rolled out a special edition drop. The company saw success and buzz around the Yeezy Gap Hoodie in September, which Gap says resulted in the most sales of an item in a single day. The company said &lt;a href="https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/articles/2021/11/gap-inc-reports-third-quarter-results"&gt;70 percent of shoppers&lt;/a&gt; were new to Gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PpbOCw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4IppS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2021 was hot as hell, NASA confirms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BD_V0ox8DMQ99jjSzxBqUAqk9KA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70383386/GettyImages_1235294004.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trees charred by wildfires on the outskirts of Lytton, British Columbia, on September 1, 2021. Lytton, located 250kms (155 miles) northeast of Vancouver, gained international attention for setting a new Canadian heat record of 49.6 degrees Celsius (121.3 Fahrenheit) before being ravaged days later by a fire that killed at least two residents.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cole Burston/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o3fPPM"&gt;The last eight years have been the eight hottest years on record, NASA and the National Oceanic Administration (NOAA) confirmed today. 2021 ranks as the sixth hottest year on record, the agencies said, as global average temperatures trend upward. Rankings aside, there were plenty of red flags throughout 2021 to show us how remarkable the year was for temperature extremes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEsqtU"&gt;“The fact is that we’ve now kind of moved into a new regime ... this is likely the warmest decade in many, many hundreds, maybe 1000s of years,” says Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. “There’s enough change that it’s having impacts locally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zTQ1r"&gt;In North America, those local impacts included epically bad summer heat, even for typically cool regions. In late June and early July, the Pacific Northwestern US and Western Canada struggled with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602208/june-heatwave-most-extreme-summer-record-north-america"&gt;record-smashing&lt;/a&gt; temperatures that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22559961/heat-roads-washington-oregon-climate-infrastructure"&gt;buckled&lt;/a&gt; roads and melted &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/29/1011269025/photos-the-pacific-northwest-heatwave-is-melting-power-cables-and-buckling-roads"&gt;power cables&lt;/a&gt;.  In the desert further south, California’s Death Valley reached a blazing 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54.4 degrees Celsius) in July, potentially breaking the world record for the hottest temperature ever recorded on the planet — for the second year in a row. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eqr2vP"&gt;Across the Atlantic, Europe experienced sweltering heat, too. A reading of 119.8 degrees Fahrenheit (48.8 degrees Celsius) &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/mediterranean-gripped-extreme-heat-new-reported-temperature-record"&gt;in Sicily&lt;/a&gt; might have broken the European record for maximum temperature. (The World Meteorological Organization is still &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/wmo-recognizes-new-arctic-temperature-record-of-38%E2%81%B0c"&gt;working&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21395621/hottest-temperatures-verification-research-death-valley-wmo-record"&gt;vet those records&lt;/a&gt;.) All told, July 2021 was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623843/july-2021-hottest-month-recorded"&gt;hottest month humans have ever recorded&lt;/a&gt;, according to NOAA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0HpFZ7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Record-smashing temperatures that buckled roads and melted power cables&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QPt5MA"&gt;More than a discomfort, the heat took a serious toll on communities. Emergency department visits spiked in the Pacific Northwest as a result of the extreme heat wave, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580120/emergency-department-visits-spiked-june-heat-wave-us-northwest"&gt;CDC reported&lt;/a&gt;. Further north, an inferno all but &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/world/canada/canadian-wildfire-british-columbia.html"&gt;wiped out the small town&lt;/a&gt; of Lytton, British Columbia soon after it recorded Canada’s highest temperature on record. The event stood out as one of the most shocking of 2021 for Schmidt. “The scale of human tragedy there, you know, even if people don’t die, that’s a community destroyed,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dERM3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/11/oceans-hottest-temperatures-research-climate-crisis"&gt;Heat trapped in the world’s oceans&lt;/a&gt; also reached record levels in 2021, according to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00376-022-1461-3"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published this week. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882502/marine-heatwaves-oceans-united-nations-ipcc-report-climate-change"&gt;Ocean heatwaves&lt;/a&gt; are likely twice as common now as they were in the early 1980s, and they can be devastating for marine life and coastal communities. They kill coral, take a toll on fishing and crabbing industries, and can even make droughts worse onshore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkAyFF"&gt;Temperatures might have been even hotter in 2021, were it not for a La Niña event. La Niña is a &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ninonina.html"&gt;recurring climate phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; defined by cooler-than-average waters in the eastern equatorial Pacific, which has predictable effects on weather patterns worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94E50n"&gt;Earlier this week, the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service released its own &lt;a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-globally-seven-hottest-years-record-were-last-seven"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; on global temperature records, which vary slightly from NASA and NOAA because the agencies use somewhat &lt;a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/earthmatters/2015/01/21/why-so-many-global-temperature-records/"&gt;different methods&lt;/a&gt; to make their calculations. Copernicus determined that 2021 was fifth warmest year on record. It also confirmed that the world has warmed by more than a degree Celsius since the preindustrial era, a result of greenhouse gases released by burning fossil fuels. Experts are urging a transition to clean energy because global warming needs to stay well below two degrees Celsius to prevent catastrophic climate change — as this year’s heat extremes illustrate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1zCV7"&gt;“We are unfortunately, reaping what we have sown,” Schmidt says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUi9Pb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwQl15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
