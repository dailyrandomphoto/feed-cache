    <title>Apple debuts new trailer for The Morning Show’s second season ahead of September premiere</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ghQgHq"&gt;Apple has shared &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qZWPTsR-Wc"&gt;a new trailer for the second season of &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of its premier series for Apple TV Plus. The new 10-episode season debuts on September 17th, with new episodes hitting every Friday after. The show once again has an all-star cast, headed up by Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXTNtN"&gt;Here’s Apple’s summary for the new season:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="FWagLm"&gt;Picking up after the explosive events of season one, season two finds “The Morning Show” team emerging from the wreckage of Alex (Aniston) and Bradley’s (Witherspoon) actions, to a new UBA and a world in flux, where identity is everything and the chasm between who we present as and who we really are comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="X20sDO"&gt;Steve Carell also returns, and there are a number of new actors in the second season. One is Hasan Minhaj, who plays a new member of the eponymous “The Morning Show.” (&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reported on Minhaj joining the cast &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564529/hasan-minhaj-the-morning-show-apple-tv-plus"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt; following the cancellation of his &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/patriot-act-with-hasan-minhaj-canceled-at-netflix-4047572/"&gt;Netflix comedy / news talk show&lt;/a&gt;.) Will Arnett also makes a surprise appearance in the trailer — his casting wasn’t previously known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NdzczH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Morning Show explores abuses of power, but not really","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942618/the-morning-show-apple-tv-plus-review-jennifer-anniston-reese-witherspoon"},{"title":"Hasan Minhaj joins The Morning Show following Netflix’s cancellation of Patriot Act","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564529/hasan-minhaj-the-morning-show-apple-tv-plus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FEwwlK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says it has pay equity, but an informal employee survey suggests otherwise</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FSFK27wYEtHQCq6saovGyjrJ9qI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764124/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KXgRUx"&gt;An early analysis of the informal Apple pay equity survey shows a six percent wage gap between the salaries of men and women, according to software engineer Cher Scarlett. It’s similar to the gender wage gap in San Francisco, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhired.com%2Fh%2Fwage-inequality-report%2F2021%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22633141%2Fapple-pay-equity-survey-results-wage-gap" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which hovers around five percent&lt;/a&gt;, but disappointing for a company that claims people of all genders “earn the same when engaging in similar work with comparable experience and performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgWsrH"&gt;The results are not scientific — employees opted into the survey and only 2,000 people responded (out of the &lt;a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/_10-K-2020-(As-Filed).pdf"&gt;147,000 employees&lt;/a&gt; Apple estimated in 2020)  — but they point to why some employees are suspicious of the company’s claim that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12371204/apple-diversity-report-pay-gap-hiring-equal-pay"&gt;it fixed its pay equity problem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOHxCk"&gt;“We know pay equity was a problem in the past and Apple did something to fix it, but we’re having this conversation again because we’re seeing gaps in certain areas of the company and we want to know what Apple will do to prevent it from happening year-over-year,” Scarlett says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWuHQm"&gt;A small group of Apple employees, including Scarlett and members of the data analysis organization, will present the results to Apple’s people team this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVXR64"&gt;Scarlett also says she found that there were far fewer women, non-binary, and non-white people in senior positions at the company — or in technical roles, which are typically among the highest paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bdfPUh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Honestly, without seeing the data team analyze the salaries, the most disturbing thing I noticed about this data is  the disparity between the gender demographics between white and non-white respondents. Out of nearly 2,000 people... it's alarming. &lt;a href="https://t.co/idvfVhQDD3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/idvfVhQDD3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cher Scarlett (@cherthedev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1426434491069861895?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nfoiAx"&gt;“These charts suggest that white men have much more opportunities to advance within the company, and are more likely to be working in technical roles than less represented demographics,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1426664223053008896"&gt;she wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwQIhH"&gt;Scarlett knows the survey isn’t conclusive. “We’re not trying to draw definitive conclusions, we’re trying to get some insight because we’ve had none,” she explains. “What we actually want is for Apple to do a third-party investigation into salary data, or an audit that we have insight into.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fq1Uf1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was granted access to the survey data, which offers evidence of a salary gap among the respondents. We analyzed the survey data by isolating the approximately 1,400 technical roles, then grouping them by job level, gender, and race&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;We then found the median salaries for the job level as a whole, as well as the race and gender breakdowns within that job level. We went with the median value to smooth out any skewing that could come from outliers (which can easily crop up in user-provided data). The approach did not take into account things like college degrees or years of experience. We chose not to look at the non-technical respondents, as there were only around 520. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BNxksb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re trying to get some insight because we’ve had none”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NBIA0M"&gt;Scarlett pushed back on the idea that there weren’t enough non-technical responses to merit analysis, noting that it might be harder for those employees to find out about the survey in the first place. “It’s easy to fall into the idea that the sample size is small so it should be set aside,” she says. “But the fact is I don’t work in retail and the places where I post mostly go to people in the software organization. So retail and support responses come in organically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hwz51J"&gt;Among the survey respondents in the data given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the median pay for men in mid-level technical roles was 6.25 percent higher than the median pay of women, while the median pay for white employees in mid-level technical roles was 5.06 percent higher than that of non-white employees. This sample was 944 white men out of 1,408 total respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHg50D"&gt;The median number of stock grants (restricted stock units) for non-white workers in entry-level and mid-level technical roles was roughly 11 percent lower than the median number of RSUs for white workers among survey respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRmIgu"&gt;Higher levels of the engineering organization show a partial reversal in this trend. The median pay for women in principal engineering roles is 1.2 percent higher than the median pay of men among survey respondents — but Scarlett is wary of the results. “Men in those high roles are less likely to respond to the survey because they’re the highest paid in the company, outside of leadership,” she says. There were far fewer respondents in this category than for mid-level technical roles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LbZifW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The median pay for men in mid-level technical roles was 6.25 percent higher than the median pay of women&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="37Qfl8"&gt;Scarlett started the survey after Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;shut down previous attempts for employees to gather pay data&lt;/a&gt;. “I don’t think anyone is going into this saying there for sure is a wage gap, whether that’s gender or race or disability,” she told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a previous interview. “But it is concerning to everyone that every single time someone tries to create more transparency, Apple shuts it down.” The company reportedly told employees that the previous surveys contained personally identifiable information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LoZjGr"&gt;One Apple employee who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; said an Apple director discouraged employees from taking the survey during an all-hands meeting last week. “A lot of us had the same thought that what he was saying was not great, it felt antiquated,” the source said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iY72dN"&gt;In 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/27/technology/apple-shareholders-show-their-support-for-tim-cook.html"&gt;Tim Cook told shareholders&lt;/a&gt; that women at Apple made 99.6 cents on the dollar compared to men, and underrepresented minorities made 99.7 cents on the dollar compared to white employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpzfV5"&gt;The company later said it fixed the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWPMl0"&gt;In response to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Apple spokesperson Rachel Tulley sent the company’s already public statement on pay equity: “Apple has a firm and long‑standing commitment to pay equity. Globally, employees of all genders earn the same when engaging in similar work with comparable experience and performance. In the United States, the same is true for employees of all races and ethnicities. We don’t ask for salary history during the recruiting process. Our recruiters base offers on Apple employees in similar roles. And every year, we examine the compensation employees receive and ensure that we maintain pay equity.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Shang-Chi made me excited about the Marvel Cinematic Universe again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Actor Simu Liu in a fighting pose." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xazLP4DwX3YbLvwTG22pgZieHQU=/884x0:3458x1716/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764072/BUS3520_cmp_lum_v0045.1069_R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Simu Liu takes on a whole lot of bad guys on a bus. | Courtesy of Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;I’m ready for Shang-Chi to meet Thor&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ji3EwO"&gt;For two hours &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; is a charming, family-friendly action-adventure movie about learning to grow up, learning to grieve, and learning to flex ab muscles so the light hits them &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; right. Then, as every movie set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is wont to do, it reminds us it’s part of a large fabric and its characters are destined to join forces with the likes of Captain Marvel, Thor, and Doctor Strange. And instead of being exhausted, I was elated. This movie helped me overcome my MCU fatigue, and — unlike every other Marvel flick since the Snap — actually set out to tell a new story absent of the baggage of Iron Man and the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DINpa1"&gt;It helped that it’s just a really fun film, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHzmM2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; stars Simu Liu, who came to fame as the lovable, buff son in the Canadian sitcom &lt;em&gt;Kim’s Convenience&lt;/em&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt;, he’s again playing a charming guy with more abs than career drive. But after more than a decade of super capable Marvel superheroes, it’s refreshing to have a guy who’s content to just park cars and stay out all night drinking cheap booze and singing karaoke with his best friend. The best friend, in this case, is Katy, a completely normal woman with zero ties to the larger Marvel universe. Awkwafina minimizes the appropriative accent that brought her fame to make Katy a compelling human anchor for the otherworldly adventures the film takes its hero on. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tony Leung as Wenwu and Fala Chen as Jiang Li in a combative embrace." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OrxEMkMPgpgFKGTBp6Zd-eGjiik=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800295/WML3070_cmp_scn_v0011.1002_R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;While &lt;/em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;em&gt; is a very Marvel movie, and thus pretty sexless, it cannot contain Tony Leung. He missed every Disney memo to smolder less.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dytTMO"&gt;Well, one of two anchors really. Tony Leung, one of the biggest stars to ever come out of Hong Kong, makes his American film debut in &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; as Shang’s father, Wenwu. Wenwu, besides being the titular character’s dad, is also the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; leader of the MCU’s Ten Rings, the terrorist organization that played a major role in &lt;em&gt;Iron Man 3&lt;/em&gt;. Leung is one of the greatest actors working today and immediately elevates what could have been a rote role. He’s suave and menacing as the ageless leader of a group of assassins who run a chunk of the world from the shadows, but he’s tragic and affecting as Shang’s distant dad who has spent more than a decade abandoning his children and mourning his wife. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVikGv"&gt;The grief these characters share is ultimately what &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; is about. The two men, and Shang’s younger sister Xialing (played by a wonderfully droll Meng’er Zhang), were once harmed by the loss of Shang and Xialing’s mother and they spend the film trying to reckon with that grief more than a decade after her loss. It gives &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; a surprisingly effective emotional core, which is good because the plot is fairly thin beyond the familial drama. This isn’t &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; with intricately plotted reveals and Marvel-y twists. It’s a film about a dad and his kids learning to grieve.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Awkwafina as Katy, and Simu Liu as Shang, stare in open mouthed shock at something out of frame as Ronny Chieng as Jon Jon embraces them both while looking amused." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TgEIVwkoE443udEvQXp_pN7V8qo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800302/SBT_15765_C.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Jasin Boland&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Katy and Shang getting ushered into a much more Marvel-y world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k1b0Le"&gt;But, you know, it’s still Marvel, so all that learning to process grief happens in between the best action in a Marvel film since &lt;em&gt;Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;. This is director Destin Daniel Cretton’s first action film, and you would not believe it with how confidently he shoots this movie. He holds the camera steady so the fast-moving and fantastically choreographed fights are easy to see. It feels like you’re watching a Hong Kong action film from 1991 — in the best way possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gbCma"&gt;The only time the fights drag are when CGI enters the picture, and like &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22555587/black-widow-review-disney-plus-marvel"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, the CGI seems to get in the way, feeling goofy and looking silly after we just watched Shang-Chi battle ninjas across the sides of buildings. Marvel’s come to be emblematic of a kind of glossy modern action aesthetic that leans on cartoonish CGI when practical would have done it better, but &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; is the first time I felt truly disappointed by its appearance instead of just a little annoyed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Xialing, Shang, and Katy look at something awkwardly in the distance." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMNQxO1LlwvK9mbrT4L1t9qGPDo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800322/SBT_24518_R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Jasin Boland&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xialing, Shang, and Katy are just some kids trying to grieve and / or help their loved ones grieve while getting embroiled in interdimensional wars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ef87s3"&gt;Thankfully, the CGI only infects small chunks of the film, and while it does contribute to the worst of the Disney / Marvel excesses of the finale, it's used sparingly enough that you can make peace with it. The film has a great cast, anchored by some real heavyweight actors (Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung act opposite each other for the first time since 1993’s &lt;em&gt;Butterfly and Sword&lt;/em&gt;), sharp action, and more heart than I’ve seen in years from something out of the MCU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nqn2nD"&gt;Which brings me back to actually being excited about the MCU again. Shang and Katy feel like real, normal people (or as normal as a former child assassin and his bestie can be) thrust into a much larger world of gods and monsters and interdimensional wars. &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; is the first film of Phase 4 of the MCU to not feel like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22561250/black-widow-marvel-endgame-thor-age-of-ultron"&gt;a denouement for &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; And like &lt;em&gt;WandaVision and Loki&lt;/em&gt;, it cracks open a much, much larger world and gives us a glimpse of where the next big Avengers team-up could take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnBGUt"&gt;But where &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; were about some of the most powerful characters in the Marvel universe, &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; is about a guy who can fight really well but would probably rather be doing some karaoke or earning enough to pay his rent. &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; establishes Shang as the heart of whatever this eventual new team will be and finally moves the Marvel Cinematic Universe out from the shadow of Avengers who have come and gone before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqZQPH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; will be in theaters only on September 3rd. Unlike &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, it will not have a dual release on Disney Plus Premiere Access. That is a bummer because this film deserves to be seen and audiences should feel safe while watching it.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="MSCHF “Famous Mouse” token" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2gOpCq2qlPvaYe6S7vwIgKemwGQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800386/famous_mouse.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: MSCHF&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSCHF “Famous Mouse” token&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="slf48h"&gt;Mickey Mouse is set to enter the public domain in 2024, at which point MSCHF could make a Mickey Mouse artwork. Today, in 2021, we cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7LH5h"&gt;Instead, we are making and selling the idea of a MSCHF “Famous Mouse” artwork now, that will not exist–even as a design–until 2024. If you purchase this artwork, we give you a temporary token with a unique code that can be redeemed for the actual piece in 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dmWaCz"&gt;Instead of waiting a few more years for copyrights on works from 1923 to expire, MSCHF is taking a decidedly modern approach and selling the idea for its artwork now, tied to a token that buyers can redeem in 2024. The name is still copyrighted so for now this is just a “Famous Mouse,” find out more &lt;a href="https://mschfxfamousmouse.com/faq/"&gt;in the FAQ here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4l6hQL"&gt;The tokens will ship in a “plastic slab case” with a sticker covering the code. Buyers are free to sell or trade their codes, and whoever has one can redeem it in 2024, assuming Mickey Mouse &lt;a href="https://blog.jipel.law.nyu.edu/2019/12/in-2024-mickey-mouse-will-finally-enter-the-public-domain-sort-of/"&gt;actually enters the public domain&lt;/a&gt;. As MSCHF points out, “It is entirely possible that Disney will lobby for changes to U.S. copyright law in order to further hoard their IP. After all, what is the law compared to the power of a U.S. corporation?”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is giving customers a free year of Apple TV Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hiC77TNwBUp-4F-OVSyfPk0hggo=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69763688/Ted_Lasso_Photo_020106.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0n2u1d"&gt;T-Mobile has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Ft-mobile-apple-tv-on-us&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced a new promotional perk&lt;/a&gt; for its customers: starting on August 25th, both new and existing subscribers to its Magenta and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;Magenta Max&lt;/a&gt; plans can get a year’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-tv-plus-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscription to Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGx288"&gt;The deal applies to virtually any of T-Mobile’s post-paid customers that it classifies as part of those plans, including its Magenta 55 Plus, Magenta Military, Magenta First Responders, Sprint Unlimited Plus, Sprint Premium, and T-Mobile for Business plans. Better yet, the deal isn’t just for newcomers to T-Mobile; it seems that anyone subscribing to those plans can get the free year of Apple TV Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tew1Ky"&gt;Customers under T-Mobile’s Magenta, Magenta Max, and T-Mobile for Business can find the offer listed under their rate plan details on T-Mobile’s website or app to get the free year, while customers who are still under Sprint’s umbrella will have to go to T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-tv-plus-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;promotional site&lt;/a&gt; and apply the code 2021APPLETVP1 to get the offer. (Regular T-Mobile customers can do that, too, should they prefer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nGr6x0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Watch ‘Foundation’ for free&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKhcRS"&gt;T-Mobile also notes that the free 12 months on offer here will seemingly apply even if you’ve had a subscription or trial to Apple TV Plus before, meaning that customers can stack the deal with other free trials, like the three months of service that come with the purchase of a new Apple device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96944Y"&gt;The freebie also comes as T-Mobile is reckoning with its recent massive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633853/tmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc"&gt;data breach&lt;/a&gt;, which exposed data for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;millions of its customers&lt;/a&gt;, including first and last names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver’s license / ID numbers, phone numbers, and IMEI / IMSI information for 7.8 million postpaid customers. Additionally, T-Mobile says that data on over 40 million “former or prospective customers” was compromised in the breach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6kuAz"&gt;And while it’s certainly a nice bonus for customers, it’s likely that a few months of &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;will not make up for having to deal with the ramifications of having that much personal data leaked. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Richard Branson’s satellite launch firm, Virgin Orbit, to go public via SPAC merger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Spaceport Cornwall Opens Exhibition On Satellites At Newquay Airport" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CrAzwtZg39_mbQZwyLfON1EDCWQ=/0x0:5327x3551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69763558/1333540386.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TfvqEz"&gt;Richard Branson’s Virgin Orbit, a satellite-launching spinoff of the billionaire founder’s space tourism firm, is going public through a merger with a shell company, the firm announced on Monday. The company will be valued at $3.2 billion and includes an investment from Boeing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bulDnU"&gt;Virgin Orbit plans to merge with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt; (also known as a SPAC), NextGen Acquisition Corp. II around the end of 2021. It will be listed on NASDAQ under the ticker “VORB.” The deal will bring Virgin Orbit $483 million in new capital — $383 million stored in NextGen and $100 million from another round of funding. Investors in that round include Boeing, Virgin said, but it’s unclear how much they pitched in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLhaNb"&gt;The $483 million will help Virgin Orbit ramp up “rocket manufacturing to meet customer demand, and to fund growth in its space solutions business and Virgin Orbit’s ongoing product development initiatives,” the company said in a press release. “Our success in launch has driven the business forward, and now we expect this investment will enable us to build on our R&amp;amp;D efforts and our incredible team,” Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-AEROSPACE-VIRGIN-ORBIT" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gLCnJ3JtENB9XTvkGj_BBasx4YE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691005/1230643749.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P9c5Z2"&gt;That Virgin Orbit would go public has been sort of an open secret for months, mainly after &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-12/branson-targets-new-space-spac-to-take-virgin-orbit-public"&gt;reports emerged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/branson-plots-3bn-spac-merger-to-launch-virgin-orbit-onto-stock-market-12330845"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that the company was shopping for a SPAC with which to merge to go public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCcTrP"&gt;Virgin Orbit, founded in 2017, launches a small rocket called LauncherOne from the underwing of a modified Boeing 747, named Cosmic Girl. It uses a so-called “air launch” method that the company touts as being more reliable and quicker for getting satellites to space than the more common methods of launching rockets vertically from the ground. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22221212/virgin-orbit-rocket-test-launch-satellites-nasa-branson"&gt;reached orbit for the first time&lt;/a&gt; in January and deployed ten satellites, and later launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557103/watch-virgin-orbit-launch-debut-commercial-mission-richard-branson"&gt;first commercial mission&lt;/a&gt; in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D5eyNw"&gt;The launch industry has been racing to NASDAQ ever since Virgin Galactic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936896/virgin-galactic-public-offering-nyse-spce-space-tourism"&gt;Branson’s space tourism firm, went public in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Small launch firm Astra went public through a SPAC in June, becoming the first company of its kind to do so. Rocket Lab, another small launch company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306971/rocket-lab-neutron-public-spac"&gt;plans to do the same&lt;/a&gt; and begin trading on NASDAQ on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine gets full FDA approval  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vaccine Mandates For Kids Is Next Big Back-To-School Fight" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/htBgOtKfd6Ox0dLJnnT04Ic-OHo=/0x0:5280x3520/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69763296/1234462203.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h6zBmZ"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;granted full approval&lt;/a&gt; to the Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, another landmark in the historic immunization campaign. The vaccine was previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22158608/fda-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-authorized-emergency-use"&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; to people over the age of 12 in the United States under an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22189236/fda-approval-authorization-difference-clearance-vaccines"&gt;emergency use authorization&lt;/a&gt;. Now, it’s officially licensed in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06KGpd"&gt;With full approval, Pfizer and BioNTech can directly market the shot to consumers. The vaccine will be marketed under the name Comirnaty to people over 16. It will still be available to people 12-15 years old under an emergency use authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSeH0j"&gt;“The FDA’s approval of this vaccine is a milestone as we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic,” acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a statement. “While this and other vaccines have met the FDA’s rigorous, scientific standards for emergency use authorization, as the first FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine, the public can be very confident that this vaccine meets the high standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality the FDA requires of an approved product.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XacCgw"&gt;The approval may push more companies and schools to mandate vaccinations. While it’s legal for them to require vaccinations under an emergency authorization, some have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/us/colleges-vaccinations-enrollment.html"&gt;been reluctant&lt;/a&gt; to do so. Public health officials hope that full approval may encourage more people to get vaccinated. “Today’s milestone puts us one step closer to altering the course of this pandemic in the U.S.,” Woodcock said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VI86vD"&gt;The companies needed to provide six months of safety and efficacy data on their vaccine to the FDA in order to submit their application for what’s called a Biological License. The agency only asked companies to collect &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download"&gt;two months&lt;/a&gt; of data before applying for an emergency use authorization. The shortened timeline allowed the agency to sidestep some of the more lengthy regulatory steps and get vaccines to people quickly during the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgCShz"&gt;This approval is based on mountains of data, including a clinical trial that looked at 20,000 patients who received the vaccine, and 20,000 people who received a placebo. That trial found that the vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598151/pfizer-covid-vaccine-efficacy-drop-booster"&gt;91 percent effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing symptomatic COVID after six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gyzy9C"&gt;“Our scientific and medical experts conducted an incredibly thorough and thoughtful evaluation of this vaccine,” Peter Marks, director of FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research said in a statement. As part of the evaluation, the agency reviewed hundreds of thousands of pages of data, conducted new analyses of the vaccines’ effectiveness, and inspected manufacturing facilities, Marks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Baol4h"&gt;FDA approval may help some people who were on the fence about getting vaccinated feel more comfortable taking the shot. One &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-may-2021/"&gt;May survey&lt;/a&gt; found that one-third of unvaccinated adults would be more likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine that was fully approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0ccM0"&gt;Now that one COVID-19 vaccine has full approval, other pharmaceutical companies will not be able to ask the FDA for new emergency use authorizations. Emergency authorizations can only be issued for drugs or vaccines when there are no approved options available — now that the Pfizer / BioNTech shot is licensed, that’s no longer the case. If AstraZeneca, for example, wanted to make its shot available in the US, it would have to start with the longer formal approval process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNExtg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jxWquB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose’s QC35 II wireless headphones are $100 off at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bose QC35" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_W2a0myee91gszcuQyY_CIjmssE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69763269/bose1_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UDaTXS"&gt;The Bose QuietComfort 35 Series II, often referred to in shorthand as the QC35 II, are just about the cheapest they’ve ever sold for today. &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13112648?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fbose-quietcomfort-wireless-headphones-12" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot has new, black-colored units with a one-year Bose warranty for $195&lt;/a&gt;. According to pricing data from CamelCamelCamel, this is $5 cheaper than the previous best price on record. These aren’t the latest noise-canceling headphones to hit the market. They released in late 2017, and the reasons they’re still popular are because of their solid sound quality, comfort, a dedicated voice assistant button, and an effective noise cancellation effect. One thing you might not like about them, though, is that they recharge via a Micro USB port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3uzUI"&gt;A new set of Bose headphones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583264/bose-quietcomfort-45-headphones-qc45-fcc-filing-leak"&gt;appeared in an FCC filing recently&lt;/a&gt;, a possible hint that the QC45s might be releasing sooner than later. They’ll almost certainly be an improvement in many ways over the QC35 II, but they’ll likely be much pricier than today’s deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="vLVp3v"&gt;Apple’s clear case for the iPhone XR is, frankly, a terrible value for the $40 or so that the company usually charges for it. So, if you have an iPhone XR and want a durable case with simple styling, I’m encouraging you to instead &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749902636215052284" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;consider Best Buy’s deal&lt;/a&gt; on the case. It’s going for just $14, so you could even buy two of them, in case one should degrade over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pU1IHH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10714816"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rY20hi"&gt;It wasn’t too long ago when finding a webcam selling for a reasonable rate was out of the question. If you want a basic webcam that offers 720p resolution at 30 frames per second, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-C505-Webcam-720p-Long-Range/dp/B08BNJPVXG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s C505 is selling for its lowest price today at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, costing $40 instead of $55. Given these specs, don’t expect remarkable fidelity, but it should be good enough if you just need an affordable webcam for jumping into some face-to-face meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="9n9NRd"&gt;Last week, we featured a $100 off deal on Apple’s latest iPad Mini from 2019. Your chances of finding that deal increased over the weekend, as Best Buy started honoring this deal. You can get $100 off each model, whether it’s limited to Wi-Fi or you want an LTE-enabled model. The price starts at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749903282026194249" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 for the 64GB Wi-Fi model&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749903296052984453" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$430 for the 64GB LTE version&lt;/a&gt;. Does this recent price drop mean that a new iPad Mini is around the corner? I wish that we knew!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="p6R8mq"&gt;Other deals you might be interested in&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Kindle-Paperwhite-Waterproof-Storage/dp/B07CXG6C9W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The ad-supported Kindle Paperwhite e-reader with 8GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; is still $80 at Amazon, down from $130.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Wifi-System-Router-Replacement/dp/B08GG9CMLR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A three-pack of Google Wifi mesh Wi-Fi routers&lt;/a&gt; is just $150 at Amazon. With the cost for one router set to $91, getting three of them for $150 is a great value.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jLywiT"&gt;Four years after news broke &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15745990/cowboy-bebop-live-action-series"&gt;that work had begun on a live-action adaptation&lt;/a&gt; of beloved sci-fi anime &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, the series finally has a release date. Netflix announced today that &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; will come in for a landing on November 19th, and here are some new photos to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F05jUt"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18115752/cowboy-bebop-netflix-live-action-series-announced"&gt;Netflix confirmed it was working on &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the streaming service has been decidedly tight-lipped on details. It announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295535/netflix-cowboy-bebop-john-cho-spike-live-action-series"&gt;the show’s cast in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and, earlier this year, that original composer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22463620/netflix-live-action-cowboy-bebop-release-date-john-cho"&gt;Yoko Kanno would return to the live-action series&lt;/a&gt;. But there still hasn’t been an official trailer or a casting announcement for series regular “Radical Edward.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6mLyON"&gt;Now at least Netflix is sharing photos of the cast — John Cho as Spike Spiegel, Mustafa Shakir as Jet Black, and Daniella Pineda as Faye Valentine — featuring what look to be final costumes and sets for the series. You can see a few choice selections above, along with a whole gallery below. Feel free to pair them with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Hj6hPqKiS4"&gt;Kanno’s score from the original series&lt;/a&gt; for the full effect.&lt;/p&gt;
