    <title>TikTok is making young teens’ accounts more private by default</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UA9m-N0G5IAAhvFuBgxOS2f1UQ4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68659863/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uzKahB"&gt;When a young teenager signs up for TikTok, their account will now be more private by default. TikTok &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/strengthening-privacy-and-safety-for-youth"&gt;said today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s updating the default settings for users aged 13 to 15, limiting who can see and comment on their videos. Only users who they add as friends will be able to view their videos, and their account won’t be suggested to other users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pU0MVn"&gt;TikTok will also completely disable the option to let anyone comment on these users’ videos, even if they make their account public. Users between 13 and 15 will only be able to allow their friends to comment on their videos, or they can turn off comments altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tVUQQN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TikTok has been gradually adding more privacy controls and restrictions for younger users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LLmNLn"&gt;The app’s Duet and Stitch features, which allow users to repost and respond to another person’s video, will be disabled for videos posed by users under 16. The ability to download videos of users under that age is also being disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="txQVZg"&gt;For users between 16 and 17, TikTok is disabling the ability to download their videos by default and restricting the Duet and Stitch features to just their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvHFpi"&gt;The suite of tweaks should add up to a TikTok that’s more protective of its youngest users. Those users can still, by and large, use TikTok the way anyone else can, but the app is doing more to shield those users and their videos from the community at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1EpPs8"&gt;TikTok has been gradually adding more privacy controls for teenagers’ accounts over the past year. In 2020, the app started allowing parents to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222817/tiktok-family-pairing-linked-accounts"&gt;remotely set restrictions on a child’s account&lt;/a&gt; and later began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570244/tiktok-parental-controls-family-pairing-private-accounts-search-limits"&gt;allowing parents to tweak their kid’s privacy settings&lt;/a&gt;, too. TikTok also previously disabled direct messaging for users under 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXaG1D"&gt;This is all a substantial turnaround from how TikTok’s predecessor handled kids’ accounts. TikTok had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/27/18243312/tiktok-ftc-fine-musically-children-coppa-age-gate"&gt;pay $5.7 million in 2019&lt;/a&gt; to settle allegations that the older app, Musical.ly, failed to gain parental approval for kids under 13. TikTok now has a separate app experience called “TikTok for Younger Users” that just shows curated videos.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sure enough, EVGA and Zotac have raised prices on the Nvidia RTX 3080 and beyond</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sEn7yvPMObuEyI8hrM8QYfmNbWI=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68659851/evga_geforce_rtx_3080.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FzAUbf"&gt;Nvidia and AMD &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;addressed the great GPU shortage today&lt;/a&gt;, revealing it may take many months before you’ll easily find a card like the RTX 3080 on shelves. They &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; say how much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217206/nvidia-amd-gpu-trump-tax-china-tariff-exemption-expire"&gt;a renewed Trump import tax on graphics cards&lt;/a&gt; might impact their prices — but now, Nvidia partners EVGA and Zotac may have done that for us &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XABjgg"&gt;Both graphics card manufacturers have now raised their prices across the board, with EVGA following Asus’s lead by &lt;a href="https://www.evga.com/products/productlist.aspx?type=0&amp;amp;family=GeForce+30+Series+Family"&gt;openly admitting at the top of its website&lt;/a&gt; that it’s making these adjustments. Zotac, on the other hand, appears to have quietly raised prices not once, but twice in recent weeks — and thanks to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, we can show you how both company’s prices have changed (at their own stores, anyhow).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bTWCnh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.evga.com/products/productlist.aspx?type=0&amp;amp;family=GeForce+30+Series+Family"&gt;Current EVGA prices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uBbgIn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201120182414/https://www.evga.com/products/productlist.aspx?type=0&amp;amp;family=GeForce+30+Series+Family"&gt;Previous EVGA prices (November 20th)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EByd2a"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zotacstore.com/us/graphics-cards/geforce-rtx-30-series"&gt;Current Zotac prices &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="txD6Ai"&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210103220750/https://www.zotacstore.com/us/"&gt;Previous Zotac prices (January 3rd)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Df9q7y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201218011510/https://www.zotacstore.com/us/graphics-cards/geforce-rtx-30-series"&gt;Previous Zotac prices (December 18th)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="4tgbLM"&gt;Here’s EVGA’s statement, just for posterity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WFNsqS"&gt;Due to ongoing events, EVGA has made price adjustments on the GeForce RTX 30 Series products. This change was necessary due to several factors and will be effective January 11, 2021. EVGA has worked to reduce and minimize these costs as much as possible. For those who are currently in the EVGA.com Notify Queue system or Step-Up Queue, EVGA will honor the original MSRP pricing through April 16th, 2021 if your purchase position is processed before this date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TY6o45"&gt;Like EVGA suggests, its price hikes aren’t that drastic — only a $70 increase on most cards, and it’s nice that they’re honoring their trade-up program for a few months. The RTX 3060 Ti is just $460, the same a friend of mine recently paid at a Central Computers store for that exact card in the SF Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0ESnwt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10281420"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v6NnYY"&gt;Zotac, on the other hand, has raised the price of even its most basic cards by $90-$100, and far more than that for the RTX 3090: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fGPoK2"&gt;from $440 to $500 and now $530 for an RTX 3060 Ti&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DTAcvX"&gt;from $540 to $600 and now $640 for an RTX 3070&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GnT2HI"&gt;from $750 to $780 and now $840 for an RTX 3080&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sSfUXi"&gt;from $1550 to $1580 and now $1900 for an RTX 3090&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="fUVbxd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10281428"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xV2cGk"&gt;None of this matters unless you can find one, of course. For that, again, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;here’s the latest guidance we have from AMD and Nvidia.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube deletes Trump video and suspends new uploads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Trump Addresses Protesters In D.C. Via Video Statement" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tTw6ygpH_9tv0WhCLhmaP3rrY_g=/0x1:5636x3758/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68659544/1230456036.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Joshua Roberts/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7Ciqck"&gt;YouTube has removed a new video uploaded to President Trump’s account for violating the company’s content policies on inciting violence. The account has also been issued a “strike” and is unable to upload new content for at least a week. It’s presently unclear exactly which video prompted the action on Trump’s account, or what the offending material was. YouTube declined to provide specific details on the video’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxvsBW"&gt;“After careful review, and in light of concerns about the ongoing potential for violence, we removed new content uploaded to the Donald J. Trump channel and issued a strike for violating our policies for inciting violence.” YouTube says in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “As a result, in accordance with our long-standing strikes system, the channel is now prevented from uploading new videos or livestreams for a minimum of seven days — which may be extended.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bF7l8u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube is also disabling comments on the channel&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yp5NgS"&gt;YouTube also removed content from the White House’s official channel. Two videos that were on the White House’s official YouTube page earlier today — one where Trump was speaking to reporters, and another where he was making remarks at the border wall — have since been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJuZ9m"&gt;YouTube is also indefinitely disabling comments on Trump’s videos due to “ongoing concerns about violence,” which it says it’s done in the past to other channels with “safety concerns found in the comments section.” A second strike on the account would incur another mandatory two-week suspension, while a third strike would result in a permanent ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ToOi2"&gt;Previously, YouTube removed one of Trump’s videos that addressed a mob attack on the Capitol and also contained widespread misinformation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217743/trump-capitol-attack-youtube-video-removed-twitter-facebook-moderation"&gt;about the election results&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube instituted a new policy in December prohibiting content of any kind designed to spread misinformation about the outcome of the 2020 election by promoting false theories about fraudulent votes or other unverified claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzwiKc"&gt;YouTube isn’t the only company taking a harsher stance against President Trump after yesterday’s attack and in the lead up to President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration. Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned the president outright&lt;/a&gt; last week. Facebook initially prevented Trump from posting to Facebook and Instagram for 24 hours, before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced even stricter measures&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday morning that include indefinitely suspending his account for at least the next weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Authorities have taken down the dark web’s largest illegal marketplace</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aKm3-a3-U7K4V4aN_iRuRTwMEGc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68659053/acastro_170621_1777_0006_fin.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pz8ozm"&gt;DarkMarket, reportedly the world’s largest dark web marketplace, &lt;a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/darkmarket-worlds-largest-illegal-dark-web-marketplace-taken-down"&gt;has been taken offline&lt;/a&gt; by a Europol-coordinated international operation, according to authorities (via &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-internets-biggest-darknet-just-got-taken-down-1846044148"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt; German law enforcement arrested the Australian man believed to be the operator of the illegal site, and seized 20 servers that hosted it, bringing an end to what had become a hotbed of illegal activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEFkd4"&gt;Before its closure, DarkMarket hosted close to 500,000 users and had facilitated over 320,000 transactions, according to Europol. The dark web marketplace traded everything from drugs and counterfeit money to stolen credit card details and malware. Per Europol’s estimate, the site traded the equivalent of €140 million in today’s money, in a mix of bitcoin and monero. European authorities plan to use seized DarkMarket servers from Ukraine and Moldova to investigate the buyers and sellers who used the site for criminal transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXIW8G"&gt;DarkMarket was uncovered as part of a larger investigation into web-hosting company Cyberbunker, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jan/13/australian-man-arrested-in-germany-over-worlds-largest-darknet-marketplace"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Cyberbunker (which is actually located in a former NATO bunker) housed servers for both The Pirate Bay and WikiLeaks in the past, and if this DarkMarket case is any example, seems to be a valuable starting point for future investigations into other illegal sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcE0ZR"&gt;The last several years have seen a vise-like grip tighten around dark internet venues like DarkMarket. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/3/18528211/wall-street-market-silkkitie-valhalla-dark-web-takedown-police-germany"&gt;Wall Street Market&lt;/a&gt;, another dark web marketplace, met a similar end in 2020 during a European investigation and other sites &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21403362/empire-market-dark-web-drug-marketplace-police-shutdown-silk-road-alphabay"&gt;like Empire Market&lt;/a&gt; have disappeared entirely, whether out of fear of prosecution or the operators cutting their losses and taking the money. Whatever advantage sites like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/14/15975140/alphabay-dark-web-drug-marketplace-police-shutdown-silk-road"&gt;Alphabay&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/2/4794780/fbi-seizes-underground-drug-market-silk-road-owner-indicted-in-new"&gt;The Silk Road&lt;/a&gt; had years ago seems to have disappeared as government agencies have gotten more aggressive in hunting down these marketplaces and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/17/18226718/alphabay-takedown-drug-marketplace-federal-arrest"&gt;more capable of understanding how they work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this report that uses GPS to prove Parler users stormed the Capitol</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Parler logo seen in front of..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4XLZc_8zIB8ZCyRuNyC_D72RUaQ=/0x163:4216x2974/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658995/1230527893.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zIpMGT"&gt;You should &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/parler-users-breached-deep-inside-u-s-capitol-building-1846042905?rev=1610480731991"&gt;go read this &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224689/parler-posts-gps-data-archived-independent-researchers-amazon-apple-google-capitol"&gt;Parler’s leaked GPS data&lt;/a&gt; to show that its users were among the mob that stormed the Capitol last Wednesday. The report comes in the wake of the social network’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223956/parler-ceo-john-matze-lawyers-vendors-abandoning"&gt;near-complete removal from the Internet&lt;/a&gt;, and is a good read for anyone who’s been following the story. The reporters, Dell Cameron and Dhruv Mehrotra, had to sift through tons of posts to build a map of the riot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YMnG5x"&gt;Gizmodo has mapped nearly 70,000 geo-located Parler posts and on Tuesday isolated hundreds published on January 6 near the Capitol where a mob of pro-Trump supporters had hoped to overturn a democratic election and keep their president in power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RCOHeB"&gt;When Parler went down, a researcher was able to exploit &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/parler-hack-data-public-posts-images-video/"&gt;some terrible security practices&lt;/a&gt; to download almost all its data — including videos that contained tagged GPS locations. This is how &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; tracked the mob’s movement: from a Trump rally held earlier in the day to, eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217601/congress-capitol-building-takeover-coup-photos-pro-trump-mob"&gt;inside the nation’s Capitol building&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COijLr"&gt;Since the Capitol riot, almost every company that Parler works with has dropped them as a client, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;Amazon, which hosted the site’s data&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, which hosted the app on their stores. The companies banned the site because of claims that it held calls for violence against the US government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTNSY7"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo’s&lt;/em&gt; report doesn’t show how wide-spread the problem was on the site, it certainly shows that that Parler was actively used by people who took place in the attack. It goes into detail about what the mob did, and how the GPS data shows certain moments that have been burned into many of our memories, so &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/parler-users-breached-deep-inside-u-s-capitol-building-1846042905?rev=1610480731991"&gt;it’s well worth the read&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="WdhVgK"&gt;Nvidia’s new RTX 3080, 3070, 3060 Ti and 3090 and the AMD RX 6800 and 6800 XT are all incredibly hard to find, selling out instantly whenever they appear, due to an incredible level of demand that makes these GPUs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;worth many hundreds of dollars more than MSRP&lt;/a&gt;. A Trump tax and surging cryptocurrency prices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217206/nvidia-amd-gpu-trump-tax-china-tariff-exemption-expire"&gt;may be about to make them even more expensive, too&lt;/a&gt;. Many older graphics cards are sold out online as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XspOJm"&gt;This week, Nvidia and AMD finally have some updates — and it’s bittersweet news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V8ryaZ"&gt;On the plus side, AMD tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it expects to sell more of its own reference design RX 6800, 6800 XT and RX 6900 XT cards on its own website in the first quarter of 2021 at their sticker prices, which should mean $579, $649 and $999 instead of inflated ones. But AMD is only committing to make them available “to as many gamers as possible,” which may not reassure buyers &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/amds-radeon-rx-6800-cards-sell-out-instantly-sparking-cries-of-paper-launch"&gt;who felt AMD had a paper launch to begin with&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GnCLw"&gt;Nvidia, meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4398578-nvidia-corporation-nvda-presents-19th-annual-j-p-morgan-tech-auto-forum-conference-transcript"&gt;is now saying&lt;/a&gt; that supplies of its GPUs to both consumers and partners  “will likely remain lean through Q1,” and we’re not even talking about the first quarter of the year — Nvidia’s fiscal Q1 doesn’t end&lt;em&gt; until late April&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;That’s an awfully long wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ewaPiu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The true price of a PlayStation 5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"},{"title":"Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"},{"title":"Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21534142/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-review"},{"title":"Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21726429/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-review"},{"title":"AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21571414/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review"},{"title":"AMD Radeon RX 6800 review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="g0Fq6r"&gt;Again, it’s demand, not just supply constraints, that are keeping graphics cards out of our hands. Nvidia tells us that since launch, its $499-and-up RTX 30-series GPUs have sold almost twice as much as the RTX 20-series did after the same amount of time. (The RTX 30-series is a much bigger upgrade than the previous gen was, mind you — there weren’t a lot of games that took advantage of Nvidia’s ray tracing at the time, and people’s GTX 10-series cards were still holding up just fine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPvvEd"&gt;Nvidia does at least seem to think crypto miners aren’t snapping up all the cards quite yet, despite the sky-high prices we’ve recently seen for Bitcoin and Ethereum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UYmew"&gt;“If crypto demand begins or if we see a meaningful amount,” said CFO Colette Kress &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4398578-nvidia-corporation-nvda-presents-19th-annual-j-p-morgan-tech-auto-forum-conference-transcript"&gt;at a recent investor conference&lt;/a&gt;, “we can also use that opportunity to restart the CMP product line to address ongoing mining demand.” CMP refers to Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/us/Graphics-Card/GV-NP106D5-6G-rev-11-12-13"&gt;dedicated crypto mining GPUs&lt;/a&gt;, which strip away the video ports miners don’t need because they aren’t driving graphics to a monitor, making them them more profitable for Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B5ppHa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Only Asus has admitted to higher GPU prices so far&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6uB41J"&gt;As far as whether &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217206/nvidia-amd-gpu-trump-tax-china-tariff-exemption-expire"&gt;Trump’s taxes&lt;/a&gt; might impact the price of graphics cards, Nvidia isn’t saying much — but AMD CEO Lisa Su claims the company is trying its best to keep prices down. Here’s a quote &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16409/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-interview-on-2021-demand-supply-tariffs-xilinx-and-epyc"&gt;transcribed by AnandTech&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="uPYXzN"&gt;We knew about the expiration of some tariff policies, and in advance worked towards a more flexible supply chain as it relates to AMD. We are committed to keeping GPU pricing as close to our suggested retail pricing as much as possible, because it’s the only way to be fair to the users. Normally when we have GPU launches, our own branded cards are available initially but then fade away for our partners to pick up. This time around we’re not phasing out our RX 6000 series, enabling us to sell direct to customers as low as possible. We’re encouraging partners to do the same. Not only tariffs, but the COVID environment has increased shipping and freight costs, which are hard to avoid. As we get into a more normal environment, this should improve. This also matters for our planned graphics updates through the first half of the year, as we have a lot of product coming to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xfrMLa"&gt;That sounds good, but it’s still fairly noncommittal — and feels like a step back from &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-expects-aibs-to-sell-radeon-rx-6800-series-at-msrp-in-4-to-8-weeks"&gt;what AMD told &lt;em&gt;Hardware Unboxed&lt;/em&gt; in November&lt;/a&gt;, about how partners should be able to sell the RX 6800 XT at its original $649 MSRP within eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IA4R40"&gt;During their back-to-back CES 2021 keynotes today, AMD praised how its new graphics cards gave the company “leadership at the high end” and noted that “many gamers are excited about the Radeon RX 6000 series,” while Nvidia acknowledged that “these products have been hard to find, and we want to thank you for your patience as we continue to work hard to catch up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDN4uG"&gt;It’s going to be a wait, and you shouldn’t be surprised if Nvidia’s just-announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226546/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-specs-price-release-date"&gt;$329 GeForce RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt; is hell to buy, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/10/29/21539965/nvidia-rtx-3070-preorders-sold-out-micro-center-best-buy-newegg"&gt;just like its predecessors&lt;/a&gt;. Like many have asked: why can’t we just buy one and they ship it when it’s ready?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IaPQPa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The gaming industry keeps failing miserably at selling its most important products","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ushZvs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:48 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added AMD CEO Lisa Su’s thoughts on Trump’s tariffs and pricing, thanks to AnandTech.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Galaxy S21 Ultra may be the next big gadget to come in brown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n_w7UJ-kedwkqSE56U1tVZV7bxE=/0x0:720x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658892/ErjR_QYXcAMdE1r.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra lineup.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Roland Quandt &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349058979578654725" target="_blank"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YtPDA9"&gt;Samsung’s next top-of-the-line smartphone may come in brown, according to leaked &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349057583638839304"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349058979578654725"&gt;renders&lt;/a&gt; of the entire Galaxy S21 lineup shared by &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; writer Roland Quandt, and I have to say that it’s giving me some &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2011/fond-memories-microsoft-zune-brown/"&gt;serious Microsoft Zune vibes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULPFtC"&gt;The phone won’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; come in brown, though — it appears there are five colors planned for Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra, including that brown, and you can see all of them at the top of this post and pictured below. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DazcvkXo4koT1qgPJigV-Oc21_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22231665/ErjQbLTXUAI_3Ww.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Roland Quandt &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349057583638839304" target="_blank"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another render of the S21 Ultra lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P7Zd81"&gt;Other notable phones have been brown-&lt;em&gt;ish&lt;/em&gt;. I’d argue that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/19/16323570/apple-new-iphone-8-review-plus-2017"&gt;the gold iPhone 8’s aluminum&lt;/a&gt; could look like a very light brown in the right light, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17871816/apple-iphone-xs-max-review-camera-processor-battery-price"&gt;gold iPhone XS’s back&lt;/a&gt; has some brown tones. Samsung edged toward brown with the “Mystic Bronze” color offered on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333566/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5g-announced-price-release-date-1449-99"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 5G&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Galaxy Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; (though that color also has a lot of pink, in my eyes). But unlike those recent iPhones and Samsung phones, the S21 Ultra’s brown can’t be mistaken for a gold or a bronze — it’s a dark, earthy brown, and I kinda like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPxMv3"&gt;Samsung is also expected to announce two versions of the non-Ultra S21: the Galaxy S21 and a larger Galaxy S21 Plus. Each of those models will come in slightly different sets of colors, based on the renders shared by Quandt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5NV8v"&gt;The S21 may come in four colors, including a white and a lighter black that seem to be S21 exclusives. (The white is my personal favorite of all of the phones.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uH4_b0-BxkKAXXq6tJ1jU_wG700=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22231619/ErjR_QcXIAQxpu3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Roland Quandt &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349058979578654725" target="_blank"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ElYPMH"&gt;And it seems the larger S21 Plus could come in five colors, including a vibrant red, a darker black, and a blue-ish white that appear to be exclusive to the S21 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/it5FRQ3b2AXEL7gtf2AG_SR1K-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22231623/ErjQbLVXIAIUOju.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Roland Quandt &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349057583638839304" target="_blank"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Plus lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dKvgWj"&gt;Colors aren’t the only things that have leaked about the S21 lineup, though — we’ve rounded up everything else we think we know about the phones (and a couple other products Samsung may announce on Thursday) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22220913/samsung-unpacked-event-date-time-galaxy-s21-phones-earbuds"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glI2Az"&gt;Samsung’s next Unpacked event kicks off Thursday morning at 10AM ET, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;will be covering all of the news from the show.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this NYT story about losing $220 million in bitcoin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="bitcoin strength in numbers 1020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bm1P_8jADe9zYCrvuv7ATOvifL0=/1x0:1020x679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658418/20130520-07511828--btc.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZYsYyB"&gt;There aren’t many good ways to lose $220 million, but &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html"&gt;this &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; highlights a particularly egregious one — losing millions of dollars in bitcoin because you forgot the password to your digital wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZMyTe"&gt;Stefan Thomas’ 7,002 bitcoin (worth roughly $220 million) are locked away in an IronKey hard drive, according to &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;’s Nathaniel Popper. The problem is he can’t remember the password, and he’s just two failed password attempts closer to losing them forever due to IronKey’s strict security protocols. There is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1348999856111591424"&gt;the possibility of paying someone to crack the drive&lt;/a&gt;, but Thomas would have to have the time and money to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFzWFX"&gt;It’s a darkly comedic scenario, and Popper’s story hits all of the cryptocurrency classics to help explain it. There’s mention of the volatile nature of bitcoin’s value and the currency’s mysterious creator, but what the article makes staggeringly clear is how common losing bitcoin actually is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5sn9X"&gt;Two other people get singled out in Thomas’ story of woe, but it’s a surprisingly common tale. Of the 18.5 million bitcoin currently in existence, roughly 20 percent (around $140 billion) are lost in inaccessible wallets, Popper writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmPE0y"&gt;There have been other high-value wallets locked out in the past, with contents ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/i-forgot-my-pin-an-epic-tale-of-losing-dollar30000-in-bitcoin/"&gt;$30,000&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/quest-to-liberate-bitcoin-from-old-zip-file/"&gt;$300,000&lt;/a&gt;, but Thomas’ story is a reminder of how persistent this problem is among bitcoin users and how expensive it has become. The secure and decentralized nature of bitcoin is great — until it collides with simple human forgetfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xgGmb"&gt;You can read the whole story &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and appreciate just how much &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude"&gt;schadenfreude&lt;/a&gt; bitcoin continues to generate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD will let consumers buy the Threadripper Pro directly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ewUyXFbhAjVTw85ZzpCkdPSZAEo=/173x0:1073x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658343/489185_threadripper_pro_chip_1920x600.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: AMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JmM3g8"&gt;If you’ve yearned for the power of the Threadripper Pro, but &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/first-tests-amds-ryzen-threadripper-pro-new-muscle-in-workstation-cpus"&gt;haven’t wanted to buy a ThinkStation&lt;/a&gt;, you’re in luck: starting in March, AMD will begin selling the CPUs directly to consumers, ending Lenovo’s exclusive access to the processor line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5DRq7"&gt;While the vanilla Threadripper seems like the peak of computing power to many (myself included), &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16396/the-amd-wrx80-chipset-a-few-boards-for-3rd-gen-threadripper-pro"&gt;there are certain benefits the Pro line offers&lt;/a&gt; that would be seriously beneficial to those who need them: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rulfnL"&gt;Memory channels are doubled, from four to eight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5drrJ9"&gt;PCI-E lanes are doubled, from 64 to 128&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QRsVtF"&gt;Memory capacity is expanded from 256GB to 2TB (!!!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="GE6WXD"&gt;To sum up those massive numbers into a more real-world picture, the Threadripper Pro allows users to work with larger datasets due to its expanded memory capacity. It also allows double the expansion for users who need tons of graphics or networking cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VpGknQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO processors will now be directly available to consumers starting in March 2021!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boasting up to 64 cores, 128 PCIe 4.0 lanes, and 8 channels of memory, Threadripper PRO is the world’s fastest workstation processor: &lt;a href="https://t.co/MKtJBTJT0A"&gt;https://t.co/MKtJBTJT0A&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/cj1SorEKUY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cj1SorEKUY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— AMD Ryzen (@AMDRyzen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AMDRyzen/status/1349093643840323584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="on5bVD"&gt;Of course, all of these features mean nothing without motherboards that can support them — after all, what would be the point of 128 PCI-E lanes if the motherboard only had 4 PCI-E 16x slots? &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16396/the-amd-wrx80-chipset-a-few-boards-for-3rd-gen-threadripper-pro"&gt;This &lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; points out three motherboards that should be coming to support the CPUs, but it’s not likely that we’ll see the same amount of variety and choice that we do with consumer motherboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6jEIc"&gt;There’s no word yet on pricing, but regular Threadripper CPUs aren’t exactly cheap. Still, if you need the capabilities of this kind of CPU, you’re probably making some money using it (hence the “pro” moniker), and these chips offer some features, like 64 threads and PCI-E gen 4, to workstation users that Intel simply doesn’t provide outside its server products.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US to require negative test from international travelers</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G4q1cQ"&gt;Anyone traveling to the United States on an international flight will have to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test within three days before&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the trip, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0112-negative-covid-19-air-passengers.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday. The order will go into effect on January 26th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pb16i5"&gt;The sweeping requirement comes a few weeks after the CDC mandated that anyone flying in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/25/22199682/covid-test-uk-travelers-us-cdc-virus-mutation"&gt;from the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; must receive a negative test result within the 72 hours prior to their flight. That order was based on concerns about a more contagious coronavirus variant spreading through the UK. That variant is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206522/coronavirus-test-variant-contagious-uk-gene"&gt;already present&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e64LzS"&gt;Testing “can make travel safer, healthier, and more responsible by reducing spread on planes, in airports, and at destinations,” even though it doesn’t eliminate all risk of COVID-19 spread, CDC Director Robert Redfield said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0112-negative-covid-19-air-passengers.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsJ911"&gt;US airlines &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-transportation-officials-airlines-spar-with-cdc-over-testing-vs-quarantines-for-international-flights-11603996361?mod=article_inline"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; that this type of program should replace travel bans and other restrictions that are now in place. People who are not citizens or permanent residents are currently &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/from-other-countries.html"&gt;not allowed to travel&lt;/a&gt; into the US if they’ve been in countries including China and the UK in the 14 days before their trip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMEbDM"&gt;“We believe a well-planned program focused on increasing testing of travelers to the United States will further these objectives in a much more effective way than the blanket travel restrictions currently in place,” Nick Calio, chief executive of Airlines for America, a trade group, said &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2021/01/05/airlines-testing-international-covid-flights/"&gt;in a letter&lt;/a&gt; to Vice President Mike Pence earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRtrJa"&gt;Testing might catch some travelers infected with the coronavirus, but it’s not a perfect system: someone might test negative the day before a trip, and then develop symptoms or contract the virus on their way to the airport. COVID-19 is also already spreading at record levels within the US. An average of around 250,000 cases are reported each day. &lt;/p&gt;
