    <title>Google opens up Android Auto’s beta testing program  </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E2eXTW"&gt;Google is launching a new &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/androidauto/answer/10961485"&gt;beta tester program for Android Auto&lt;/a&gt;, giving users the chance to get early access to features if they’re prepared to put up with the potential instability of unfinished software. Android Auto has had a testing program, but attempting to sign up for it has shown a message warning that the program had reached its “maximum number of testers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kYgUT"&gt;“As a beta tester, you can help us build a better version of Android Auto. You can test how well new features work with your specific phone and vehicle in your part of the world,” Google says. “When you share your feedback, we’ll use it to help plan improvements for future releases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZLNvhJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You can help us build a better version of Android Auto”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O4UluO"&gt;The announcement of the new beta program comes as Android Auto has just gone through one of its biggest expansions in years when it launched in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150166/android-auto-expands-countries-europe-africa-asia"&gt;dozens of new countries&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2020. Its wireless connectivity feature also recently got a big boost with news that any Android 11 phone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21377399/google-android-auto-android-11-wireless-phone-support"&gt;would be able to connect wirelessly&lt;/a&gt; to compatible vehicles.   Considering these enhancements, it’s not surprising that Google needs more beta testers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4lkrP8"&gt;To sign up, Google says you can head over to the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.projection.gearhead/"&gt;opt-in page&lt;/a&gt;, where there’ll be an option to “Become a tester.” Once signed up, the beta version of Android Auto can be downloaded from the Play Store. If the bugginess gets too much, Google says the link to opt out is &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.projection.gearhead/join"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;. Just remember to uninstall the beta app and re-download the stable version from the Play Store to leave the beta.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Wear OS 3 plans mean Android users should wait to buy a smartwatch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IdLQw53urY4_0NY58lzPjBBf_Bs=/127x0:1450x882/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617560/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_2.31.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ByVX0L"&gt;Google has finally given its new, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;unified smartwatch platform&lt;/a&gt; a name — and it’s an obvious one: Wear OS 3. That little detail was part of what may be a more contentious set of information about which current Wear OS smartwatches will be updated, when those updates will come, and what those updates will entail. On all three of those fronts, it’s not very good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpESVb"&gt;Google says that Wear OS 3 updates will start rolling out to a limited set of smartwatches in the “second half of 2022.” That’s quite a long way away, especially since we’re expecting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;first Wear OS 3 watches to be announced&lt;/a&gt; next month at Samsung’s Unpacked event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ew1vVq"&gt;Currently, the list of watches that could get the update “include Mobvoi’s TicWatch Pro 3 GPS, TicWatch Pro 3 Cellular/LTE, TicWatch E3 and follow on TicWatch devices, as well as Fossil Group’s new generation of devices launching later this year,” according to Google’s post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHqFY1"&gt;That leaves a lot of Wear OS watches out, including everything from Fossil and its associated brands. And that list also leaves all of Samsung’s Tizen-based watches out. They’re currently the best option for most Android users, but they now appear to officially have an expiration date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpM8gN"&gt;There’s no other way to put this: for Android users, it’s not a good idea to buy a smartwatch right now. Everything that’s available today either won’t be updated or won’t receive an update until late 2022. It’s the clearest and most direct example of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect"&gt;Osborne effect&lt;/a&gt; in recent memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yu7qvl"&gt;And to be even blunter, it may not be a good idea to buy watches that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; on that list, as there are further complications with that update. Google says that “in some limited cases, the user experience may be impacted” but declined to elaborate further right now. That could mean a lot of things, but a common experience with any computer is new operating systems feeling slow on older hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSeJl8"&gt;In an emailed statement, a spokesperson promised that Google would “provide more details in advance of the update so users can make an informed decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gj0eTA"&gt;Additionally, upgrading to Wear OS 3 will require a full factory reset, wiping any settings and data you might have on the watch. Most of that should be backed up to your phone regardless as Wear OS apps usually aren’t fully self-contained on the watch, but it’s still likely to be a hassle. And you likely won’t be able to just hit a restore button after the update to bring back your old watch settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2brmOO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Installing the update will require resetting the watch to factory state&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cIa2fZ"&gt;Google at least recognizes that many watch owners will not want to go through all that hassle, so it is offering a way to decline the update but still receive security patches. The company promises to continue to support the current version of Wear OS with updates and will offer security updates for “two years from device launch.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x84qui"&gt;The blog post is likely meant to get the bad news out of the way early so that the decks are cleared for Samsung’s Galaxy smartwatch announcements — not to mention rumors of a Google Pixel watch that may also be in the wings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGdh1z"&gt;After so many years of languishing, the next version of Wear OS will have a lot to prove. Although it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;announced this past May at Google I/O&lt;/a&gt;, we still don’t have a full picture of how it will actually work in real use. We know that it takes some elements from Samsung’s Tizen platform — like watchfaces — but that generally it’s more Wear OS than Tizen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pMZGz"&gt;What we have seen of Wear OS 3 so far is promising. Google says it will be faster than current smartwatches while also offering longer battery life. It should also offer a standalone Google Maps app, offline Spotify music, and integrated Fitbit activity tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jw5snE"&gt;All of which means that if you’re an Android user who wants a smartwatch, the best option you have right now is to simply wait until new Wear OS 3 watches are launched and reviewed. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Faraday Future just became a publicly traded company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fqXlWWHC1ThRp38XLAA2Smp3FS8=/0x0:4096x2731/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617501/E66OtTIWYAAXyHC.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nasdaq&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="23OMrb"&gt;Electric vehicle startup Faraday future is a publicly traded company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIyIrj"&gt;It’s okay, I’ll give you a moment. I’ve been reporting on Faraday Future &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18088438/faraday-future-electric-cars-ev-news-layoffs-bankruptcy"&gt;for four years&lt;/a&gt; and it has even stunned me a few times in recent weeks. But it’s true: today, the startup’s shares began trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange, and a fresh $1 billion was dumped into its battered war chest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvPK66"&gt;Electric vehicle companies are going public left and right thanks to the rise in popularity of special purpose acquisition companies (which you can read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;a great explanation of here&lt;/a&gt;). So are companies that supply some of the new technologies that make EVs possible, like lithium-ion battery manufacturers, as well as others in related industries, like autonomous vehicle startups and makers of lidar sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RuCRge"&gt;But none of those companies flirted with oblivion as much Faraday Future. Guided by the whims of exuberant billionaire founder Jia Yueting, a man who self-exiled from China to escape a colossal amount of debt, Faraday Future walked right up to the brink over the last few years and somehow lived to tell the tale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="WcVoyf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10368711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q23NpP"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;happened along the way. After it was founded in 2014, Faraday Future was mistaken as a secret front operation for Apple’s self-driving car project. It debuted a static concept car at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/5/10713718/faraday-future-vpa-iphone-comparison"&gt;announcing its intentions to be as disruptive as the iPhone&lt;/a&gt; (after Jia compared Apple to Hitler — no, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/27/8298999/apple-hitler-china-letv-jia-yueting"&gt;really&lt;/a&gt;). It returned to the trade show the following year and debuted a &lt;em&gt;real &lt;/em&gt;electric vehicle only to have &lt;a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/25921-faraday-future-ff91-robot-valet"&gt;all sorts&lt;/a&gt; of things &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA18oyyG-xg"&gt;go wrong&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/faraday-future-hit-with-1-8-million-lawsuit-over-ces-d-1791529037"&gt;stiffed the company that helped put on the event&lt;/a&gt;. It announced a $1 billion factory in the Nevada desert that never got built (after passing up existing options, including the factory in Illinois that Rivian now occupies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQKLck"&gt;Then the real trouble started. Jia’s profligate spending — he poured $900 million of his own money, much of it drawn from loans he never repaid in China, into Faraday Future by 2017 — had helped the startup amass a nearly 1,500-person workforce and design a ludicrously expensive technological marvel of an electric SUV. But he had trouble bringing on other investors. He balked at the idea of giving up any control over the company, and that scared off anyone with deep enough pockets to pony up the kind of capital required to build a factory and make a car at scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uWzkdi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data="{&amp;quot;stories&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Inside Faraday Future's financial house of cards&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting&amp;quot;}]}"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="osaj11"&gt;So in late 2017, Faraday Future was running ragged. It had just a few million dollars in its bank accounts. Fed up with Jia, executives that were hired away from Tesla and Apple and other big companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/10/16633542/faraday-future-stefan-krause-resignation-bmw-trouble"&gt;started to flee&lt;/a&gt;. The chief financial officer who was brought in to save the company left late that year after Jia refused his proposal to restructure Faraday Future in bankruptcy. (That executive, along with a few others who left Faraday Future, went on to found the company that is now Canoo.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vScFHu"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;financial house of cards&lt;/a&gt; that Jia had built Faraday Future out of looked ready to collapse. Then, at the end of 2017, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/20/16801846/faraday-future-funding-investment-payroll-jia-yueting-ceo"&gt;company got a mysterious lifeline&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17242406/faraday-future-china-investment"&gt;reported in April 2018&lt;/a&gt;, the money came from Chinese real estate conglomerate Evergrande through a series of offshore shell companies. Evergrande pledged $2 billion in total — with $800 million up front and the rest to come in installments. Faraday Future was saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHVqIi"&gt;Until it wasn’t. Jia spent through that money faster than Evergrande expected. Evergrande agreed to give Faraday Future an advance on the remaining investment but only &lt;em&gt;if &lt;/em&gt;Jia gave up some control. Jia technically did this, but he merely transferred his controlling shares to the daughter of his right-hand woman, Faraday Future VP Chaoying Deng (who I covered in this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;2017 investigation&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVnqMz"&gt;Evergrande was displeased with this. The two sides spent months fighting in a Hong Kong court over the disagreement. Meanwhile, Faraday Future was basically out of money again. It furloughed hundreds of employees, then laid many of them off. Most of the top executives who had held on finally left, including Jia’s last &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18040936/faraday-future-founder-resigns-employee-furlough-shutdown"&gt;remaining co-founder&lt;/a&gt;. Faraday Future eventually settled with Evergrande at the end of 2018 and spent much of 2019 in a sort of hibernation, though it took a few more drastic measures to generate cash to keep the lights on, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18269081/faraday-future-sold-headquarters-la-leasing-ev-electric-car"&gt;selling its own headquarters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5kq19"&gt;In early 2019, Faraday Future made a few decisions that are arguably the reason it survived long enough to take advantage of the SPAC boom and become a public company. First, it started working with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18524108/faraday-future-bankruptcy-expert-birch-lake-loan"&gt;a restructuring firm run by a bankruptcy guru&lt;/a&gt;. Working with this firm, Faraday Future convinced the many suppliers that were owed money to exchange their claims for pieces of a trust that would pay out if and when the startup raised money. It also helped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22380333/faraday-future-spac-psac-ipo-public-investigation-ffie"&gt;refinance some of the startup’s debt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wI1bme"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Faraday Future’s still haunted by the past of its billionaire founder","url":"https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/10/30/20879811/faraday-future-ceo-founder-jia-yueting-carsten-breitfeld-bankruptcy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zoGqXX"&gt;Then, it hired another former BMW executive, Carsten Breitfeld, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/10/30/20879811/faraday-future-ceo-founder-jia-yueting-carsten-breitfeld-bankruptcy"&gt;used to run the BMW i8 program&lt;/a&gt;. Breitfeld became CEO (as well as a sort of adult in the room) and has been the face of the startup’s fundraising efforts ever since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sZKIm"&gt;Lastly, Jia filed for personal bankruptcy to settle $3.6 billion of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21268043/court-jia-yueting-faraday-future-bankruptcy-plan"&gt;his personal debt in China&lt;/a&gt;. The way this was done was crucial to Faraday Future’s current fortunes. Jia placed nearly all of his controlling stake in the startup in a trust that his own creditors now own pieces of — much like the way Faraday Future settled its debts with suppliers. That means he no longer has the same kind of dictatorial control over the company that he once enjoyed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5lacD"&gt;Faraday Future survived 2020 thanks in part to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21228241/faraday-future-loan-ev-startup-sba-ppp-workhorse-lucid-motors-rivian"&gt;$9 million loan from the Paycheck Protection Program&lt;/a&gt; and finished the year with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22380333/faraday-future-spac-psac-ipo-public-investigation-ffie"&gt;just $1 million in the bank&lt;/a&gt;. But by that time it had already been in talks with Property Solutions Acquisition Corp., a SPAC that had originally set out to merge with a company in the real estate sector. They &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22247942/faraday-future-spac-merger-public-psac-property-solutions-nasdaq"&gt;announced the merger in January 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jC7BuT"&gt;Now that Faraday Future is listed on the Nasdaq, the startup says it will take a year to get its electric SUV into production. The company has grand plans beyond that — it’s still trying to be that major disruptor that it claimed to be at CES 2016 — but it won’t be able to take a crack at them until it gets its first car out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVwl5z"&gt;Or, perhaps, it will. Faraday Future has survived so many brushes with death to date, and the financial markets are currently so receptive to young electric vehicle startups with no revenue, that it’s actually kind of hard to imagine how things could go really wrong in the near-term. But if there’s one lesson to be learned from Faraday Future’s first seven years, it’s that you should always expect the unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter may be adding voice effects to Spaces</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter may be introducing voice effects to Spaces | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ksH0UZ"&gt;Twitter may be adding voice effects to its audio chat platform Spaces, a post from Twitter sleuth &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1418012132621254659?s=20"&gt;Jane Manchum Wong suggests&lt;/a&gt;. Wong tweeted that her research found Twitter is working on something called Voice Transformer, that will allow users to change their voice pitch or add echo effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ppJ1Ry"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter is working on Voice Transformer for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TwitterSpaces&lt;/a&gt; which changes your voice pitch or adds echo to your audio &lt;a href="https://t.co/EgSvherbnL"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EgSvherbnL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1418012132621254659?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OPOvmH"&gt;Twitter began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294481/twitter-audio-tweets-now-available-iphone-ios"&gt;rolling out Spaces&lt;/a&gt; in its iOS app to a limited group of people in June 2020. It added an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309629/twitter-launches-spaces-android-ios-audio-clubhouse"&gt;Android app in March&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22363221/twitter-spaces-desktop-web-browsers-clubhouse"&gt;desktop version&lt;/a&gt; in April (which Wong also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1377751312457027585?s=20"&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEPE2h"&gt;Sound effects may sound like a minor feature, but it could make the app more accessible. The pitch control in particular could prove hugely useful to people who are &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/glkk8x/too_selfconscious_to_do_voice_chat_in_games/"&gt;self-conscious&lt;/a&gt; about how their voices sound in online forums, and for women subjected to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-018-9962-0"&gt;voice-related harassment&lt;/a&gt; or who deal with the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/07/23/425608745/from-upspeak-to-vocal-fry-are-we-policing-young-womens-voices"&gt;over-policing of their vocal styles&lt;/a&gt;. And for people who prefer to remain anonymous on Twitter, this could be a way to disguise their voices but still participate in Spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ph97EM"&gt;Twitter didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Thursday, but Wong’s research is typically solid. For instance, she &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399984/twitter-tip-button-jar-great-tweets-profiles"&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; Twitter’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;Tip Jar&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/15/22437690/twitter-blue-subscription-service-299-undo-tweets"&gt;Twitter Blue&lt;/a&gt;, its subscription service, ahead of their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22464291/twitter-blue-subscription-service-canada-australia-undo-reader-mode"&gt;official launches&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DeepMind creates ‘transformative’ map of human proteins drawn by artificial intelligence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WMj-4__bq1nvpl3eLjUrlYT5_og=/0x0:2130x1420/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617091/VRG_ILLO_1777_AK_body_data.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ana Kova&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9XQjNZ"&gt;AI research lab DeepMind has created the most comprehensive map of human proteins to date using artificial intelligence. The company, a subsidiary of Google-parent Alphabet, is releasing the data for free, with some scientists comparing the potential impact of the work to that of the Human Genome Project, an international effort to map every human gene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySGTnQ"&gt;Proteins are long, complex molecules that perform numerous tasks in the body, from building tissue to fighting disease. Their purpose is dictated by their structure, which folds like origami into complex and irregular shapes. Understanding how a protein folds helps explain its function, which in turn helps scientists with a range of tasks — from pursuing fundamental research on how the body works, to designing new medicines and treatments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HQvlck"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the culmination of the entire 10-year-plus lifetime of DeepMind”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="csojN7"&gt;Previously, determining the structure of a protein relied on expensive and time-consuming experiments. But last year DeepMind showed it can produce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754310/deepmind-alphafold-ai-protein-folding-casp-competition"&gt;accurate predictions of a protein’s structure&lt;/a&gt; using AI software called AlphaFold. Now, the company is releasing hundreds of thousands of predictions made by the program to the public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRDcPO"&gt;“I see this as the culmination of the entire 10-year-plus lifetime of DeepMind,” company CEO and co-founder Demis Hassabis told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “From the beginning, this is what we set out to do: to make breakthroughs in AI, test that on games like Go and Atari, [and] apply that to real-world problems, to see if we can accelerate scientific breakthroughs and use those to benefit humanity.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A gif of two rotating protein fold models made up of curls and swirling lines. AlphaFold’s predictions are overlayed on the models, with 90.7 GDT accuracy on the left and 93.3 GDT accuracy on the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MLV4q-2KKwiqnXtDBpqLL6LTmY0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22132319/AlphaFold_prediction_comparisons.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DeepMind&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two examples of protein structures predicted by AlphaFold (in blue) compared with experimental results (in green). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P5XTtl"&gt;There are currently around 180,000 protein structures available in the public domain, each produced by experimental methods and accessible through the Protein Data Bank. DeepMind is releasing predictions for the structure of some 350,000 proteins across 20 different organisms, including animals like mice and fruit flies, and bacteria like &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. (There is some overlap between DeepMind’s data and pre-existing protein structures, but exactly how much is difficult to quantify because of the nature of the models.) Most significantly, the release includes predictions for 98 percent of all human proteins, around 20,000 different structures, which are collectively known as the human proteome. It isn’t the &lt;a href="https://swissmodel.expasy.org/repository/species/9606"&gt;first public dataset of human proteins&lt;/a&gt;, but it is the most comprehensive and accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1w6mgd"&gt;If they want, scientists can download the entire human proteome for themselves, says AlphaFold’s technical lead John Jumper. “There is a HumanProteome.zip effectively, I think it’s about 50 gigabytes in size,” Jumper tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “You can put it on a flash drive if you want, though it wouldn’t do you much good without a computer for analysis!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="723JoI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“anyone can use it for anything”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6uYU5C"&gt;After launching this first tranche of data, DeepMind plans to keep adding to the store of proteins, which will be maintained by Europe’s flagship life sciences lab, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL). By the end of the year, DeepMind hopes to release predictions for 100 million protein structures, a dataset that will be “transformative for our understanding of how life works,” according to Edith Heard, director general of the EMBL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlVKPJ"&gt;The data will be free in perpetuity for both scientific and commercial researchers, says Hassabis. “Anyone can use it for anything,” the DeepMind CEO noted at a press briefing. “They just need to credit the people involved in the citation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="QYoV0b"&gt;The benefits of protein folding&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="DbHqxJ"&gt;Understanding a protein’s structure is useful for scientists across a range of fields. The information can help design new medicines, synthesize novel enzymes that break down waste materials, and create crops that are resistant to viruses or extreme weather. Already, DeepMind’s protein predictions are being used &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind-alphafold-protein-diseases"&gt;for medical research&lt;/a&gt;, including studying &lt;a href="https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/computational-predictions-of-protein-structures-associated-with-COVID-19"&gt;the workings of SARS-CoV-2&lt;/a&gt;, the virus that causes COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bnGAKr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it will definitely have a huge impact for the scientific community”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gjWQXb"&gt;New data will speed these efforts, but scientists note it will still take a lot of time to turn this information into real-world results. “I don’t think it’s going to be something that changes the way patients are treated within the year, but it will definitely have a huge impact for the scientific community,” Marcelo C. Sousa, a professor at the University of Colorado’s biochemistry department, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38aIMk"&gt;Scientists will have to get used to having such information at their fingertips, says DeepMind senior research scientist Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool. “As a biologist, I can confirm we have no playbook for looking at even 20,000 structures, so this [amount of data] is hugely unexpected,” Tunyasuvunakool told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. “&lt;/em&gt;To be analyzing hundreds of thousands of structures — it’s crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ix7s1l"&gt;Notably, though, DeepMind’s software produces &lt;em&gt;predictions&lt;/em&gt; of protein structures rather than experimentally determined models, which means that in some cases further work will be needed to verify the structure. DeepMind says it spent a lot of time building accuracy metrics into its AlphaFold software, which ranks how confident it is for each prediction. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_8UQ_Dm92B1eSO4NQ58Rb3prFLQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22732723/Proteins.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DeepMind&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Example protein structures predicted by AlphaFold&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BXCQ7n"&gt;Predictions of protein structures are still hugely useful, though. Determining a protein’s structure through experimental methods is expensive, time-consuming, and relies on a lot of trial and error. That means even a low-confidence prediction can save scientists years of work by pointing them in the right direction for research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Kpof6"&gt;Helen Walden, a professor of structural biology at the University of Glasgow, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that DeepMind’s data will “significantly ease” research bottlenecks, but that “the laborious, resource-draining work of doing the biochemistry and biological evaluation of, for example, drug functions” will remain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iM9Bq2"&gt;Sousa, who has previously used data from AlphaFold in his work, says for scientists the impact will be felt immediately. “In our collaboration we had with DeepMind, we had a dataset with a protein sample we’d had for 10 years, and we’d never got to the point of developing a model that fit,” he says. “DeepMind agreed to provide us with a structure, and they were able to solve the problem in 15 minutes after we’d been sitting on it for 10 years.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8hMn9y"&gt;Why protein folding is so difficult &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="a3NLUw"&gt;Proteins are constructed from chains of amino acids, which come in 20 different varieties in the human body. As any individual protein can be comprised of hundreds of individual amino acids, each of which can fold and twist in different directions, it means a molecule’s final structure has an incredibly large number of possible configurations. One &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110523080407/http://www-miller.ch.cam.ac.uk/levinthal/levinthal.html"&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; is that the typical protein can be folded in 10^300 ways — that’s a 1 followed by 300 zeroes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pcbicz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Protein folding has been a “grand challenge” of biology for decades&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IxJYVc"&gt;Because proteins are too small to examine with microscopes, scientists have had to indirectly determine their structure using expensive and complicated methods like nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray crystallography. The idea of determining the structure of a protein simply by reading a list of its constituent amino acids has been long theorized but difficult to achieve, leading many to describe it as a “grand challenge” of biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="poxrzP"&gt;In recent years, though, computational methods — particularly those using artificial intelligence — have suggested such analysis is possible. With these techniques, AI systems are trained on datasets of known protein structures and use this information to create their own predictions. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dfU3PBLX7QvyJvFBgNCjnlp0YQk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22732721/Median_Free_Modelling_Accuracy.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DeepMind&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DeepMind’s AlphaFold software has significantly increased the accuracy of computational protein-folding, as shown by its performance in the CASP competition. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9XWGHy"&gt;Many groups have been working on this problem for years, but DeepMind’s deep bench of AI talent and access to computing resources allowed it to accelerate progress dramatically. Last year, the company competed in an international protein-folding competition known as CASP and blew away the competition. Its results &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4"&gt;were so accurate&lt;/a&gt; that computational biologist John Moult, one of CASP’s co-founders, said that “in some sense the problem [of protein folding] is solved.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhMVmC"&gt;DeepMind’s AlphaFold program has been upgraded since last year’s CASP competition and is now 16 times faster. “We can fold an average protein in a matter of minutes, most cases seconds,” says Hassabis. The company also &lt;a href="https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/alphafold"&gt;released the underlying code&lt;/a&gt; for AlphaFold last week as open-source, allowing others to build on its work in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LpjXe"&gt;Liam McGuffin, a professor at Reading University who developed some of the UK’s leading protein-folding software, praised the technical brilliance of AlphaFold, but also noted that the program’s success relied on decades of prior research and public data. “DeepMind has vast resources to keep this database up to date and they are better placed to do this than any single academic group,” McGuffin told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I think academics would have got there in the end, but it would have been slower because we’re not as well resourced.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="M5Bl9c"&gt;Why does DeepMind care? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dmKdXE"&gt;Many scientists &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke to noted the generosity of DeepMind in releasing this data for free. After all, the lab is owned by Google-parent Alphabet, which has been pouring huge amounts of resources into commercial healthcare projects. DeepMind itself &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/17/deepmind-lost-649-million-and-alphabet-waived-a-1point5-billion-debt-.html#:~:text=Tech-,DeepMind%20A.I.,billion%20debt%20waived%20by%20Alphabet&amp;amp;text=The%20London%2Dheadquartered%20AI%20lab,U.K.'s%20Companies%20House%20registry."&gt;loses a lot of money&lt;/a&gt; each year, and there have been &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/deep-confusion-tensions-lingered-within-google-over-deepmind"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-unit-deepmind-triedand-failedto-win-ai-autonomy-from-parent-11621592951"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2019/03/01/deepmind-and-google-the-battle-to-control-artificial-intelligence"&gt;of tensions&lt;/a&gt; between the company and its parent firm over issues like research autonomy and commercial viability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAUHyQ"&gt;Hassabis, though, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company always planned to make this information freely available, and that doing so is a fulfillment of DeepMind’s founding ethos. He stresses that DeepMind’s work is used in lots of places at Google — “almost anything you use, there’s some of our technology that’s part of that under the hood” — but that the company’s primary goal has always been fundamental research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7kd7ns"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s many ways value can be attained.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lV8aar"&gt;“The agreement when we got acquired is that we are here primarily to advance the state of AGI and AI technologies and then use that to accelerate scientific breakthroughs,” says Hassabis. “[Alphabet] has plenty of divisions focused on making money,” he adds, noting that DeepMind’s focus on research “brings all sorts of benefits, in terms of prestige and goodwill for the scientific community. There’s many ways value can be attained.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="il68TS"&gt;Hassabis predicts that AlphaFold is a sign of things to come — a project that shows the huge potential of artificial intelligence to handle messy problems like human biology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDuzQ5"&gt;“I think we’re at a really exciting moment,” he says. “In the next decade, we, and others in the AI field, are hoping to produce amazing breakthroughs that will genuinely accelerate solutions to the really big problems we have here on Earth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cfGwWs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Framework Laptop review: pick your ports</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The value of this laptop hinges on future support&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="B2qeVe"&gt;There are a lot of 13-inch and 14-inch laptops out there, but very few offer much in the way of user-upgradability. Framework, a San Francisco-based startup, sees an opening in the market there. The new 13.5-inch Framework laptop allows customers to upgrade and replace not only internal parts (RAM, battery, storage), but also external components (the keyboard, bezels, and ports).   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sm9p18"&gt;If you’re very particular about your specs, you can also order a &lt;a href="https://frame.work/products/laptop-diy-edition/configuration/edit"&gt;“DIY edition,”&lt;/a&gt; including parts of your choosing, and assemble the laptop yourself. I suspect most people will go for one of the three pre-built systems that Framework has on offer, which can then be tweaked as needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0iqE6"&gt;Outside of its customizability, the Framework is a fairly standard productivity ultraportable. It’s a bit smaller than an M1 MacBook Pro, at 2.87 pounds and 0.62 inches thick. The chassis incorporates recycled materials. There’s a decently bright 3:2 display (with no touch option as of now), and a usable keyboard and touchpad. You’ll get decent performance from Intel’s 11th Gen processors, and okay (but unexciting) battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMGJrD"&gt;In other words, upgradability is the reason to buy the Framework laptop — there’s not much else to discuss here. And while it looks like a good package from where I’m standing, much of its value proposition hinges on whether the company lives up to its promise of supporting the device for years to come.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SG3LDX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10662592"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ROAgiV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10662603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cqb6QB"&gt;The pre-built systems should cover most use cases. I tested the base model, which costs $999 and includes a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of memory, 256GB of storage, and Windows 10 Home. The $1,399 Performance model has a Core i7-1165G7, 16GB of memory, and 512GB of storage, while the Professional model asks $1,999 for a Core i7-1185G7, 32GB of memory, and 1TB of storage, as well as Windows 10 Pro and vPro. Note that the latter two models aren’t shipping until August, while the base model won’t arrive until September — you can preorder all three now with a $100 deposit. DIY kits start at $749, and pricing varies based on the components you select. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3k9m7"&gt;The most unique benefit the Framework offers is the opportunity to customize ports. The chassis has four bays, but you can order as many expansion cards as you want, including USB-C, USB-A, microSD, HDMI, DP, and storage expansion (250GB or 1TB). Framework says more options are coming. I stuck in a USB-A, a USB-C, an HDMI, and some extra storage, and it was a very easy task. The cards are essentially dongles — they slide right in, and you can swap them while the computer’s on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8V0fm"&gt;I was also able to swap out the black bezels on the model I was sent for some white ones. This took about 10 seconds. The top and side bezels attach to the chassis via magnets, and there are strips of adhesive along the bottom edge, so it’s just a matter of pulling one frame off and sticking another on — you can do it while the laptop’s running. (Framework claims that the adhesive is reusable, so you can swap bezels back and forth.) You can also replace the keyboard, touchpad, and fingerprint reader, both individually and as a sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Framework laptop open, outdoors, on a red tablecloth with a garden and the wall of a house in the background. The screen displays a mountainous landscape." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KSauiRpoU5t3CDpg9LxSLUxHn9c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22728997/mchin_210720_4671_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the black bezel — you can put white ones on, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ml9HoN"&gt;Then, you can pop the keyboard off to tinker with the internal components — &lt;a href="https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Mainboard+Replacement/79?lang=en"&gt;even the mainboard&lt;/a&gt;. This is easy enough to do, but one annoyance is that the chassis is held together with T5 screws, which won’t play nice with a standard Phillips screwdriver. (Framework says this is because the T5 avoids stripping issues that can come up with Phillips screws.) If you don’t already have a kit with a T5 screwdriver, you’d better make sure you don’t lose the tool that Framework sends with the laptop (and it’s small — I’m sure I would lose it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gkqn6d"&gt;In theory, all of these replacement parts will be available on a centralized marketplace that’s also open to third-party manufacturers. Each of the various components has a QR code on it that, when scanned, will pull up a purchase page for the part’s replacement. This marketplace isn’t live yet, so I can’t speak to what’s actually going to be available there — Framework says it’ll be up in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PwBaK"&gt;That sort of underscores a theme of this review, which is that so much of this laptop’s value hinges on what its promised ecosystem and support network will actually look like. There are &lt;a href="https://guides.frame.work/c/Framework_Laptop"&gt;a few guides&lt;/a&gt; on Framework’s website — for setting up the pre-builts and the DIY kit, replacing the bezels, replacing the keyboard, and replacing the mainboard — but some processes that people will likely want are still missing as of this writing. There’s no guide to replacing the memory, for example (you have to find that in the mainboard replacement guide). Framework says that’s coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOZ9vQ"&gt;I also haven’t been able to find a list of supported parts, or a list of each screw and its size, which could make losing a screw a nightmare. Framework says the former list is coming soon, and that it will add screw specifications to its repair guides “as we go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a USB-C inside each enclosure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The fingerprint sensor on the Framework Laptop on top of a red tablecloth." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/47-q9kl94YEQ38U18o7MWDqGS1s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729000/mchin_210720_4671_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fingerprint sensor is in a convenient location,  but it was a bit finicky and sometimes had trouble reading my finger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="UTKGrA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10662627"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="48LzQb"&gt;The Framework’s build quality is a bit below that of top contenders at this price point; you’re paying a bit extra for the Framework’s futureproofing promise. The whole thing has a plasticky feel — it’s not cheap, but it feels closer to Acer Aspire than it is to Dell XPS. And there’s some flimsiness. Specifically, there’s a bit of flex in the keyboard and a whole bunch in the screen. (I was actually worried about snapping the latter and didn’t torque it as much as I could have.) And while I was never worried that the magnetic bezels were going to fall off, they’re not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; hard to pull loose, and I could definitely see them snagging on things or accumulating debris underneath. I do like that recycled material is being used here, including 50 percent PCR aluminum in the enclosure, “an average of” 30 percent PCR plastics, and 80 percent PCR packaging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bw9l7i"&gt;Another thing to call out is the 3:2 display. It’s one of the few parts of this laptop that can’t currently be upgraded; you’re stuck with a 2256 x 1504 non-touch panel. It reached 391 nits of brightness in my testing, which is quite good, and generally delivered a sharp picture — and the 3:2 aspect ratio provides a lot more vertical space than the 16:9 panels you’ll find on many 13-inch notebooks. It is quite glossy, though, and kicks back a bit more glare than I’m used to seeing from panels in this price range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Framework Laptop in a garden on top of a red tablecloth, facing away from the camera, open, angled to the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rysXDO637k5qfi2B2gJ4iy-WXkc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729002/mchin_210720_4671_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See? It looks fine. Like, it’s fine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RH1yzD"&gt;I’ll run through the rest of the laptop; the takeaway again is that reparability is the Framework’s only real calling card. The keyboard is nicely backlit, with almost no bleed, and comfortable with 1.5mm of travel. There’s a 1080p webcam with a physical shutter — its picture is an improvement over traditional 720p laptop fare. But neither is so astonishingly good that I’d buy the Framework just to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WoaxJl"&gt;Performance-wise, the base model was fine. The bottom sometimes got toasty under my load of around a dozen Chrome tabs and apps, but it was never uncomfortable to use on my lap. Fans were occasionally audible, but mostly silent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uqkl44"&gt;All three processor options come with Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics — there’s no GPU option. The integrated GPU isn’t enough to run highly demanding games, but it should do a good job with &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; and such. I got some lightweight photo editing done with no problem, though it wasn’t quite as snappy as I’ve seen on Core i7 machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="scypTb"&gt;Battery life was similarly acceptable but unremarkable. I averaged around six hours and 12 minutes of continuous work use with the screen at 200 nits of brightness. You can get much more from these specs: we saw seven to eight hours from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309005/microsoft-surface-pro-7-plus-review"&gt;Surface Pro 7 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Pro-7-for-Business%2F8P43N3K93409%3Fcrosssellid%3Dfbt-w1b%26selectedColor%3D86888a%26preview%3D%26previewModes%3D%26%3Focid%3DAID2200057_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%28ir__hcqj2eimmgkfqklvhybzgeuzq32xuarqlpwmp0xd00%29%287593%29%281243925%29%28nOD_rLJHOac-EjIVgOwsJ97kSdtLFdWT_A%29%28%29%26ranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DnOD%252frLJHOac%26ranSiteID%3DnOD_rLJHOac-EjIVgOwsJ97kSdtLFdWT_A%26epi%3DnOD_rLJHOac-EjIVgOwsJ97kSdtLFdWT_A%26irgwc%3D1%26irclickid%3D_hcqj2eimmgkfqklvhybzgeuzq32xuarqlpwmp0xd00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 more&lt;/a&gt; for a Core i5 model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Rtg0ca"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is a laptop that DIY computing enthusiasts have been waiting for&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="47HHVN"&gt;First and foremost: it’s admirable what Framework is trying to do. This is a laptop that DIY computing enthusiasts have been waiting for. And there’s certainly a lot here that’s promising. The ports and bezels are easy to swap, even if you’ve never upgraded a computer before — and that’s a legitimately unique feature. Plus, the fact that RAM isn’t soldered, in a chassis of this size, is an upgradability victory in itself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42F5Ya"&gt;But this community has been burned before. From &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21051879/intel-pc-nuc-9-extreme-ghost-canyon-element-hands-on-teardown-ces-2020"&gt;Intel’s Ghost Canyon NUC&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited"&gt;Alienware’s Area-51m&lt;/a&gt;, the virtual graveyard is littered with promised modular computers that never panned out because the company stopped making hardware for them. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522265/dell-alienware-area-51m-r1-gaming-laptop-upgradeability-unprecedented-lawsuit-claims-misleading"&gt;Dell was recently sued&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly promising that the Area-51m R1 could be upgraded to future Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs, which did not end up being the case. This kind of device is hard to make and even harder to support over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lurx4B"&gt;I asked Framework how many generations of Intel CPUs it was committed to supporting, and the company didn’t give a direct answer. A spokesperson stated, “We’ve been evaluating upcoming silicon roadmaps, and don’t see anything that makes us concerned about compatibility with our current chassis. We will continue to support the existing chassis for the forseeable future.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d71YCE"&gt;Sure. But until I actually have an Alder Lake mainboard in my hands, I’m hesitant to get too excited. Whether the Framework is a good purchase will depend on whether the company is actually able to forge ahead with this chassis — how long it continues releasing new modules, and whether it’s able to build a robust library of supporting materials. It’ll also depend on how good the promised marketplace is, and how robust the component selections are. Those are the real benefits of this device. Without them, the Framework is mostly an unremarkable laptop with lots of QR codes. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pebble’s hardware buttons couldn’t save smartwatches from touchscreens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q1nrwID6Tv6YfldnTeSfDbVKg0c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617057/akrales_210716_4656_0050.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="86pJHa"&gt;Touchscreens have taken over smartwatches. But it didn’t have to be this way. For a few short years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/28/3924904/pebble-smartwatch-review"&gt;Pebble showed a different way forward&lt;/a&gt; with a purely hardware-based user interface that reigned supreme, until it — like the rest of the company — was left behind by the rest of the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2mU9x"&gt;Virtually every smartwatch today relies on a mixture of touchscreens and hardware buttons — from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; and its digital crown to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368752/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Samsung’s rotating bezels&lt;/a&gt;. Even Fitbit’s most basic trackers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21199567/fitbit-charge-4-tracker-gps-nfc-spotify-sp02-announcement-price"&gt;like the Charge&lt;/a&gt; feature touchscreens to supplement physical buttons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HH1Koj"&gt;But Pebble held out. From the time it helped pioneer the concept of modern smartwatches in 2013 to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/7/13867158/fitbit-buys-pebble-smartwatch-acquisition-deal"&gt;eventual purchase and shutdown in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, the Pebble could only ever be controlled by pushing physical buttons. It traded more advanced functionality in the long run for a more user-friendly experience. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DQjkja7_SnFYkQrmSohLPXzgdJg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726445/akrales_210716_4656_0040.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AEAjs6"&gt;It’s not even that the buttons on the Pebble were particularly enjoyable to use, mechanically speaking. The original Kickstarter-famous model’s buttons were plastic-y and mushy, with a tiny center button that could be easily lost between the other two. And while the final Pebble watch — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/27/8661863/pebble-time-review-wearable-smartwatch"&gt;the more polished Pebble Time&lt;/a&gt; — would improve on things with clicker buttons and a refined design, it’s hard to laud its buttons as anything beyond “functional.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="asnLgJ"&gt;Overall, though, the Pebble’s design made it a joy to use. I fondly remember dismissing errant notifications with a quick button press and flipping through songs on a crowded bus or while skiing and wearing bulky gloves. The relatively simple nature of its input method also meant that the Pebble’s software was similarly streamlined, cutting down cumbersome menus in favor of simpler displays. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cDkIhrl64NH_fLXnoaCshPz-ToA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726442/akrales_210716_4656_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MDJgGs"&gt;The Pebble’s idea of how smartwatches should be controlled was rooted in how analog ones worked. You didn’t want to block the dial because the whole point of a watch is to be able to see the time. It’s a fact that makes touchscreen smartwatches an inherent paradox: watches are nicer to wear when they’re smaller, but touchscreens are nicer to use when they’re bigger. But the Pebble sidestepped that entirely by taking after a regular watch and only using case-mounted buttons to control it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4bgRS2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tiny touchscreens aren’t particularly enjoyable to use&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9Y3MPT"&gt;It’s undeniable that those tiny touchscreens aren’t particularly enjoyable to use. Apple spent years trying to figure out how to make text input work on the Apple Watch, simply because the postage stamp-sized display just doesn’t work well for fitting an entire keyboard. And of course, there’s the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nosy-apple-watch-users-discover-another-way-to-go-hands-free-1451077454"&gt;infamous “nose tap” maneuver&lt;/a&gt; for when you desperately need to dismiss a notification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6EV8E"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/27/16936922/pebble-smartwatch-hardware-button-physical-controls"&gt;Pebble’s simple hardware buttons&lt;/a&gt; offered new, useful ways to interact with my phone on the go. Conversely, an Apple Watch is just as difficult as a phone to use when my hands are wet or while wearing gloves. The benefit is just a screen that’s slightly easier to see since it’s on my wrist, not in my pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjBtQn"&gt;This really gets to the heart of the shift away from buttons: smartwatches have grown in scope. Today’s watches aren’t companion gadgets to smartphones; they’re full-blown miniature smartphones in their own right, complete with cellular data, GPS, and app stores. And while that may be a good thing for smartwatches as viable hardware platforms, it does mean that some things — like exclusively physical buttons or the entire Pebble platform — will inevitably get left behind. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rF6WAHeo0GvC4YhVowzS1xluMqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726444/akrales_210716_4656_0036.jpg"&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz says it will go all-electric in 2030, but with a major caveat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mercedes-Benz AG Auto Showroom Ahead of Earnings" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P2I82PYCwGH_2hVIUiQVMGUpMgk=/0x0:6397x4265/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617022/1234068952.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="soXUpq"&gt;Mercedes-Benz says it will go all-electric by 2030, but with conditions. The German automaker says it will only sell electric vehicles “where market conditions allow,” implying that Mercedes may still sell gas-powered vehicles after 2030 in countries that lack consumer demand for EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNdLjC"&gt;The company made the announcement during an EV strategy update Thursday morning, the latest in a series of automaker events to declare a major pivot to electric powertrains. But while other car companies have similarly promised to shift to all-EV production, Mercedes is notable by hedging its promise on external factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zpxrU6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Other major automakers have included similar caveats&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OCKtiK"&gt;Other major automakers have included similar caveats. GM, for example, said it would be carbon neutral by 2040, but wouldn’t commit to ending the sale of gas-powered vehicles by that date. And GM’s top executives described the goal of eliminating tailpipe emissions from its new light-duty vehicles by 2035 as “an aspiration” rather than a certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBtn4w"&gt;Still, Mercedes says it will commit €40 billion ($47 billion) to the electrification of its lineup by 2030. “We are convinced, we can do it with strong profitability, and we believe that focus on electrical is the right way to build a successful future and to enhance the value of Mercedes Benz,” said Ola Källenius, chairman of Daimler and head of Mercedes-Benz.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4HRS7H-W2SBiNMRR57jMrb2RqoQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733021/eqxx.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lzgcwf"&gt;From 2022, Mercedes says it will offer a fully electric model in every segment, and from 2025 every model sold will be offered with a pure-electric model. Mercedes will also launch three bespoke new EV architectures for use across its entire portfolio: MB.EA for midsized and large passenger cars, AMG.EA for performance models, and Van.EA for commercial vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2ZJLRi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company hinted at some of the new products that will be coming soon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3kCBO0"&gt;The company hinted at some of the new products that will be coming soon, including electric versions of Mercedes-Benz’s G-class wagons and AMG high-performance vehicles. Executives also teased the forthcoming long-range, high-powered Vision EQXX concept car, which it will reveal next year. With the EQXX, Mercedes is targeting 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) of range, and a consumption rating of more than six miles per kWh, which would make it one of the longest range EVs on the market if achieved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2A5hB3"&gt;With regard to its supply chain, the company will build eight gigafactory battery plants, including one in the US, with the aim of building out its battery cell capacity to 200GWh. And Mercedes announced the acquisition of Yasa, a UK-based EV motor manufacturer, to help speed up its production plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1K3TJ"&gt;Mercedes isn’t alone in charting out its all-electric (or mostly all-electric) future. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287284/ford-electric-vehicles-ev-europe-2030"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568625/stellantis-jeep-dodge-ev-day-shark-drone-autonomous"&gt;Stellantis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308851/volvo-electric-cars-only-2030-online-sales"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462504/bmw-i4-ev-price-specs-photos-release-date"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; have made similar promises about transitioning to mostly selling EVs. These announcements come as major governments push to put restrictions on the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles. The European Union, China, and California have all said they would ban the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus’ capable Nord 2 made better by midrange price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F2W5lNlzw3BMBuy6VTfnQgOJ3hQ=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617009/Many_OnePlus_Nord_2s_having_fun.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qwsZhO"&gt;OnePlus has officially announced the Nord 2, a successor to last year’s excellent midrange debut. Like the original, the Nord 2 is releasing in Europe and India, and there are no plans for a US release. In Europe and the UK, prices start at £399 / €399 for its 8GB RAM / 128GB storage model, rising to £469 / €499 for a 12GB RAM / 256GB version (about $550 and $645, respectively). In the UK, preorders open on July 22nd from OnePlus.com and Amazon, and the phone goes on general sale on July 28th. You can read my first-hand impressions of the phone over in my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22350856"&gt;full review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="doHCw5"&gt;OnePlus being OnePlus means we already had a good idea of what to expect from the Nord 2 before today. But now we know that in addition to its 50-megapixel main camera, the phone also has an 8-megapixel ultrawide and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor on its rear. Round the front, there’s a 32-megapixel selfie camera, although there’s no secondary ultrawide selfie camera like last year’s Nord. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jI19GFzBN9gvbX1OxAD4l8E1w2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22731129/Nord_2_Haze_Blue_07.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nord 2 in blue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hC6Eax"&gt;Like the original Nord, the Nord 2 has a 1080p 90Hz OLED display, but on this year’s model it’s ever so slightly smaller at 6.43-inches (compared to 6.44-inches). In Europe, the phone is available in blue and gray, while an additional green color will be available in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukdGY2"&gt;Internally, alongside the &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/nord-2-and-its-mediatek-dimensity-1200-ai-chipset-your-questions-answered.1464619/"&gt;MediaTek 1200-AI processor&lt;/a&gt; that OnePlus revealed earlier this month, in Europe the Nord 2 will be available with either 8 or 12GB of RAM, paired with 128 or 256GB of storage, respectively. There’s also a (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnePlus_IN/status/1417490218521964552"&gt;pre-announced)&lt;/a&gt; 4,500mAh battery with Warp Charge 65 fast charging, which OnePlus claims should be able to charge the phone to 100 percent in under 35 minutes. It’s 5G-compatible (sub-6GHz only) and includes dual-SIM support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGUOFV"&gt;The Nord 2 runs OxygenOS 11.3 out of the box, which &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-nord-2-oliver-zhang-interaction/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers &lt;/em&gt;has reported&lt;/a&gt; is the first version of the software to reflect the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;merger with Oppo’s ColorOS&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus is promising two years of Android updates and three years of security updates for the Nord 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FU1goy"&gt;As well as the Nord 2, OnePlus also used its event today to announce a new pair of true wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22351408"&gt;OnePlus Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which go on sale next month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Buds Pro announced, coming September 1st for $150</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y7PwfH"&gt;OnePlus today announced its third set of true wireless earbuds, the OnePlus Buds Pro. Dubbed as the company’s “most advanced listening device” yet, the new earbuds are debuting alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22350856"&gt;Nord 2 smartphone&lt;/a&gt;. They go on sale in the US and Canada on September 1st for $149.99 and come in either white or matte black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xzx4P2"&gt;The shape of the earbuds is rather AirPods Pro-esque, though OnePlus has gone with a shiny chrome stem that looks quite eye-catching. After last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435637/us-cbp-counterfeit-airpods-oneplus-buds-mixup"&gt;awkward situation at the US border&lt;/a&gt;, the company has good reason to go for a more visually distinct design. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tboq5ZvimntBiEBnivFoqAxkkJk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22732933/Case_and_earbuds_white.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="redoTC"&gt;The OnePlus Buds Pro feature what the company describes as “smart adaptive noise cancellation,” which means they’ll automatically adjust how much NC is applied based on your environment. “Each earbud features a three-mic setup that actively filters out noise levels of up to 40dB as needed in order to deliver a much more comfortable and tailored listening experience, as opposed to conventional ANC systems with fixed levels of noise cancellation,” the company wrote in its press release. The earbuds also support Dolby Atmos audio. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E-6etDIHcH3TE3cqiXP7EQ2W5ew=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22732934/Lifestyle_matte_black_case_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ioDKJZ"&gt;OnePlus is pointing to endurance as another strength, with the OnePlus Buds Pro able to stretch to a total of 38 hours of listening time when you include case recharges. On a single charge, you’ll get five hours with ANC enabled and seven hours with it off. Those are both more average numbers that are in line with the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QxUQO4"&gt;The company’s Warp Charge wired charging is supported; a 10-minute recharge is supposedly good for 10 hours of listening, and you can also juice them up on any Qi wireless charger. The earbuds feature Bluetooth 5.2 and carry over the low-latency gaming mode from the company’s previous buds. &lt;/p&gt;
