    <title>Google’s new floodlight camera is bright but not beautiful</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Speedy smart alerts and good lighting control make up for an odd design&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="fGKUq1"&gt;If you’re going to install one outdoor security camera at your home, a floodlight camera is the best option. You get lights and a camera in one unit to capture all the action and you don’t have to mess with charging batteries or drilling holes through your walls for power cables — a floodlight cam can go wherever you have existing outdoor lighting. It’s a win-win smart home device. The only downsides are a high upfront price and a more involved installation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXREl7"&gt;Unfortunately, the new &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_cam_floodlight?hl=en-US"&gt;Google Nest Cam with floodlight &lt;/a&gt;($280) doesn’t solve either of these issues, being one of the more expensive floodlight cams and having the oddest design and installation process. But, despite these failings, it’s an excellent floodlight camera and has several benefits over the competition — which is multiplying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZ96pU"&gt;These benefits include a built-in battery backup for if the power goes out, intelligent motion sensing so the floodlights aren’t always going off when a moth flies by, and on-device processing that translates to much speedier alerts — crucial for a security camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RZowP9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10861576"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Eqiai"&gt;The Nest Cam with floodlight is functionally a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710545/nest-doorbell-battery-cam-battery-test-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Google Nest Cam (indoor/outdoor) &lt;/a&gt;magnetically attached to two, high-powered 2,400 lumen-producing, motion-sensing lights. It has all the same camera specs — 1080p HD video with night vision, a 130-degree diagonal field of view, two-way audio, IP54 weather resistance, and a built-in battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2wa0M"&gt;It can also record up to three hours of event-based video clips for free and has free smart alerts for motion, people, vehicles, and animals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uaClrs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A siren is the one missing feature on the Nest Cam&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DAxJcy"&gt;The specs are comparable to the competition, although it’s the narrowest field of view by 10 degrees. Ring offers 140 degrees in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371015/ring-floodlight-cam-wired-pro-video-doorbell-4-price-features"&gt;Floodlight Cam Plus &lt;/a&gt;($180), and Eufy’s $300 option has a 360-degree rotating camera and 2K video, which is the same resolution Arlo offers in its battery Flood Cam Pro 3 ($250) that can be powered with an AC adaptor. The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22770834/wyze-floodlight-cam-big-field-view-small-price"&gt;Wyze Floodlight Cam&lt;/a&gt; has the option of two cameras, so you can survey two angles over 130 degrees each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RW2Ad5MPTYvEKwnktxfuoxxqUMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23000207/jtuohy_211011_4869_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Cam with floodlight is the same camera as the Google Nest Cam. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/scMqz1W8GtH0QtmMvV9SIKZur98=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23000212/jtuohy_211011_4869_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It attaches magnetically and is then hardwired in via a short magnetic cable. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v5IscR"&gt;A siren is the one missing feature on the Nest Cam that’s found on all the competition. If you pay for Nest Aware, you do get the option to call 911 directly from the app, but the lack of a loud alarm to scare off a potential intruder is a big omission here. Additionally, both Eufy and Wyze have the option of onboard storage, so you don’t need to pay for a cloud subscription to view recorded video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkZ9dk"&gt;With the Google Nest Cam, a Nest Aware subscription (starting at $6 a month) is essential if you’re planning to use this camera as a security device. While you get three hours of event-triggered recordings for free, that’s not going to do much good if there’s someone creeping around your property at 1 a.m. but you don’t see the alert until you wake up at 6 a.m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZULvN"&gt;A subscription adds 30 or 60 days of event-based recordings, 24/7 continuous recording, the excellent Familiar Faces feature, and sound alerts — although only for carbon monoxide and smoke alarms, which is less useful for an outdoor camera. I do miss the “dog barking” and “people talking” alerts that came on the older Nest IQ cams. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sGAkez7_Kp5OV1lJvB8ZFRYqrs4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23000220/jtuohy_211108_4869_0015.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Nest Cam is designed to be installed on a wall rather than under an eave. But even with this slightly odd setup, it worked well as a security camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5R59Xw"&gt;My colleague Dan Seifert &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710545/nest-doorbell-battery-cam-battery-test-review-price-specs-features"&gt;reviewed the Google Nest Cam&lt;/a&gt;, and his thoughts apply here — this is a good camera with decent video quality. Still, it’s not as great as the Nest IQ cameras were, whose 4K sensors and longer digital zoom made it easier to hone in on details such as a name badge or license plate. The camera also can’t automatically zoom and pan as its predecessors could (and the Arlo can), a handy feature for an outdoor security camera as it can track someone further around your property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xO4jKE"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Google Nest Cam with floodlight test footage day|104815" data-volume-uuid="ae8ebd178" data-volume-id="104815" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="true" id="volume-placement-4" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daytime footage is good enough to identify people but if you zoom in it gets pixelated quickly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XbPiu0"&gt;But when paired with the floodlights, the Google Nest Cam gets a clearer picture at night — the added lumens allowing for full-color night vision. While this doesn’t help with distance, it does provide more detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUAA3i"&gt;Google has also implemented the lighting control nicely, giving you as much control over the floodlights as you get with any other smart light. You can turn them on and off and dim or brighten them with voice control or in the Google Home app. You can also add them into a Routine, so they can come on when you leave and turn off when you arrive home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrQsnE"&gt;These are security lights, though, so even on the dimmest setting, they’re still bright, and I wouldn’t plan on using them as outdoor accent lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qk2N4F"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Google Nest Cam with floodlight test footage night|104816" data-volume-uuid="9ae8a7517" data-volume-id="104816" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="true" id="volume-placement-191" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nighttime footage is crisp and clear (up to 20 feet) and when the floodlights kick on (triggered by person detection in this clip) you get full color.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Eubnkb"&gt;There’s also plenty of control for deciding what triggers the lights and when. You can choose one or more from motion, live viewing, and any camera event (such as people, animals, vehicles) to activate the lights at night, and there are four daylight sensing options to determine how dark it has to be before they come on. There’s also a setting for how long the lights stay on once activated, from 10 seconds up to five minutes. In the Home app you can also turn them on or off like regular lights, with no timeout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="njUrOp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s plenty of control for deciding what triggers the lights and when.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GvQPno"&gt;These options significantly cut down how often I lit up the side of my house where I placed the camera. I set it to turn on only when it saw a person and created an activity zone to cut out my neighbors’ pathway, which is adjacent to mine. Compared to the Ring Floodlight Camera installed on the other side of my house (which also has person detection), it turned on much less frequently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N9ZAvlppYdAYaO8NAKctZJR_H5o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23009968/689F7521_A79B_4DBA_94BC_D4F0226AD34C.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Cam’s two floodlights are controlled in the Google Home app in the same way as other smart lighting options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S7SJpj36oSxnEDcM0yYXOkxr-xc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23010496/64205C35_3119_49F9_B225_3FD88ABF0EC8.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The option to create activity zones paired with smart motion alerts prevents the floodlights from activating too often.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EW7YT5"&gt;I have two main issues with this camera: the Google Home app and the design. I’ll start with the app. The Home app does some things well — including lighting control, and it’s great that the floodlight is set up just like any other light in the app. But it’s not good for viewing or managing security cameras; specifically, the timeline view is clunky, and the route into viewing events is convoluted (although I do like the mini GIFs you get when you eventually land on the Full History page). The old Nest app is much better, but Google is moving away from it, and frustratingly, you can only use this Nest camera in the Google app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XI7SsR"&gt;Case in point, there are no controls for the floodlights in the camera portion of the app. You can choose what turns them on in the camera settings, but you can’t adjust brightness, turn them on or off, or dim them there. Instead, you have to navigate over to the main Google Home control page — about six taps away — to do any of this. This feels like an oversight and is a frustrating user experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGyhLn"&gt;As for design, Google over-thought this one. A floodlight camera is a simple concept: lights with a camera in the middle. Most of those on the market today look remarkably similar, but the Nest Cam with floodlight has a base that’s almost a foot long. This means if you’re installing on the side of your house on a wall, the camera extends outwards farther than others do — giving the motion sensor beneath it and the camera itself a better view. But if you install it under an eave — where all my existing floodlight wiring is (and I am not alone here) — you end up with a very long, ungainly looking device dangling off the side of your house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/axd4a500VUX_7NRHZVTIgon89_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006576/jtuohy_211111_4869_0017.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An awkward design makes the Google Nest Cam tricky for an under-the-eave installation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LbFMHQ"&gt;Installing the floodlight was also tricky, mainly because of this awkward positioning. Attaching the wiring was similar to any floodlight device; you need to hardwire it to your houses’ electrical wiring using a standard outdoor junction box (and if you’re not comfortable with wiring, especially while on the top of a ladder, I would highly recommend paying for a professional to install it — Nest offers this for $179). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrUSfA"&gt;The problem came with getting the right angle for the camera. Because we had to install it essentially upside down, the very short wire that attaches the Google Nest Cam to the floodlights left little room for maneuverability. I couldn’t angle it high enough to capture the whole area I wanted to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JG6cIX"&gt;Thankfully, the lights themselves have a lot more flexibility, and you can rotate them fully back and forth, and easily position them to cast the light where you want it and not into your neighbors’ window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQPZ0o"&gt;Awkward design aside, the Google Nest Cam with floodlight performed very well in my testing. The lights respond accurately to the different motion events — only turning on for people, animals, or motion when those were selected. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G1wAPngoiOVInQrlExaqWH61szo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23000215/jtuohy_211108_4869_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The power cable, motion sensor, and microphone visible here are designed to go under the camera, but when mounting under an eave they sit sideways. The power cable also prevents the camera from being positioned higher on the magnetic mount.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qcEun9"&gt;The lights also responded instantly to general motion events as those use the motion sensor on the floodlight. The smart motion activations (for people and animal) depend on the camera seeing the person or animal first, so they took a second or two longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajP7LM"&gt;Alerts also came through on my iPhone 13 much faster than those on the Ring floodlight camera I’m also testing, likely due to the Nest’s on-device processing. However, Nest’s Familiar Faces feature still needs some work, telling me at one point it had spotted me outside, when it was actually the rather burly Comcast tech out there working with my connections.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIv7cK"&gt;If you are invested in the Google Home ecosystem, the Google Nest Cam with floodlight is your best option if you have the wiring in place. It’s a better choice than the battery Nest Cam and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21048999/arlo-pro-3-floodlight-security-camera-ces-2020"&gt;Arlo Floodlight Pro 3&lt;/a&gt;, the only other floodlight camera that’s fully integrated with the Google Home app (where you can view footage in the app and on a Nest smart display). The Arlo has a similar price and can be installed without wires if that’s an issue, but the lighting isn’t as flexible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="lsVIik"&gt;None of the new Nest Cams, which include an indoor/outdoor battery cam, indoor wired cam and doorbell cam, work with any other smart ecosystem. So, if you are running an Amazon Alexa or Apple HomeKit smart home, you should look at Ring, Eufy, Arlo or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273479/netatmo-outdoor-security-camera-siren-robbery-launch-price"&gt;Netatmo’s Smart Outdoor Camera&lt;/a&gt;. These all work with Alexa, and the Netatmo and Arlo also work with HomeKit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="lus84t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10861947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The White House allegedly challenged Intel’s plans to increase chip production in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i5adaZG6iYkB9t6VbEhWLFdQ0VM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70138888/acastro_180529_1777_intel_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1KaS2N"&gt;Intel’s efforts to speed up chip production in China have reportedly been contested by the Biden administration, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-13/white-house-spurns-intel-plan-to-boost-chip-production-in-china"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Sources close to the situation told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that Intel proposed making silicon wafers in a Chengdu, China factory, which could start production towards the end of 2022. However, Intel’s plans were “strongly discouraged” by White House officials due to potential security issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuAMHT"&gt;Since Intel needs to secure funding from the government in order to ramp up production, the administration’s opinion holds some weight on Intel’s path forward. As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, Intel said it currently has “no plans” to produce silicon wafers in China after discussing it with government officials, and that it will instead consider “other solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2TK9nu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Biden administration remains skeptical about China’s use of technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="diogu6"&gt;“Intel and the Biden administration share a goal to address the ongoing industrywide shortage of microchips, and we have explored a number of approaches with the U.S. government,” Intel said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. One of these approaches may be to invest in factories to manufacture silicon wafers in the US and Europe, in line with the administration’s goals of manufacturing essential components within the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV8uf5"&gt;The Biden administration remains skeptical about China’s use of technology. Biden recently expanded on existing policies from the Trump era that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17686310/huawei-zte-us-government-contractor-ban-trump"&gt;places restrictions on the government’s use of China-based brands&lt;/a&gt; Huawei and ZTE, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308477/fcc-huawei-zte-ban-universal-service-fund-national-security-threat-risk"&gt;labels both companies as threats to national security&lt;/a&gt;. Biden’s newly-signed legislation blocks the two brands &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/biden-signs-legislation-tighten-us-restrictions-huawei-zte-2021-11-11/"&gt;from obtaining licenses from the Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, Biden previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740155/commerce-departments-new-rule-hacking-tools-china-russia"&gt;put restrictions on the sale of hacking tools&lt;/a&gt; to China and also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22516719/biden-executive-order-american-investment-chinese-firms-huawei-zte"&gt;banned US investment in Chinese surveillance companies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MeHNs2"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; seems to be seeping into more areas of technology every day. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/13/22780037/tesla-reportedly-shipping-cars-without-usb-ports"&gt;Teslas reportedly shipping without USB ports&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765709/bmw-chip-shortage-touchscreen-car-suv-manufacturing"&gt;newer BMWs coming without touchscreens&lt;/a&gt;, and cuts in production for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759377/nintendo-making-20-percent-fewer-switches-chip-shortage"&gt;Switch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22775829/sony-ps5-supply-chip-shortage-forecast-cut"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723209/apple-iphone-13-chip-shortage-manufacturing-report"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, it’s starting to look like Intel’s prediction might be right; we may not see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739192/intel-chip-shortage-q3-2021-earning-laptop-revenue"&gt;the end of the chip shortage until 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OXuKe5"&gt;At high-profile climate negotiations in Glasgow, rich nations stuck poor nations with a big bill. Wealthy countries responsible for the most planet-heating pollution have reneged on commitments to help developing nations adapt to a warming world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJbdvl"&gt;That means delegates and activists from the places most vulnerable to climate change will wind up paying the price back home after leaving the United Nations climate summit that closes today. They’ll need to scrounge together funds for new infrastructure that can safeguard them from rising sea levels, devastating droughts, or monstrous storms — or suffer the losses of living without it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="o5CryH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are failing people”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BGdJrV"&gt;“We are failing people,” says Harjeet Singh, a senior advisor on climate impacts for the Climate Action Network International, a group of more than 1,500 NGOs across the world. “We are failing people who expect so much from their leaders, from this process.  And what we are suffering around the world is because of 30 years of inaction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNaw7h"&gt;A big goal going into the Glasgow summit, called COP26, was to get wealthy nations to fulfill an old promise. They agreed 12 years ago during another climate conference in Copenhagen that by 2020, they would funnel $100 billion a year to climate action in developing nations. That hasn’t happened, the final text of Glasgow agreements notes “with deep regret.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VrfFzI"&gt;Early on in negotiations, a bloc of negotiators from Africa and about two dozen other developing nations called on affluent countries to provide at least &lt;a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2021/11/08/developing-countries-put-number-post-2025-climate-finance-needs-1-3trn-year/"&gt;$1.3 trillion&lt;/a&gt; a year for climate mitigation and adaptation by 2030. Others asked for &lt;a href="https://unfccc-cop26.streamworld.de/webcast/bangladesh-cvf-press-conference-on-the-500-billion"&gt;$500 billion&lt;/a&gt; over five years, and that half of finance go towards adaptation. Ultimately, a &lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/documents/311127"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; was struck at the summit to at least double finance specifically for adaptation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bf7Bu0"&gt;Rich countries have, so far, only shelled out about &lt;a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/adaptation-gap-report-2021"&gt;$80 billion&lt;/a&gt; a year in climate finance. And just a &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/env/climate-finance-provided-and-mobilised-by-developed-countries-aggregate-trends-updated-with-2019-data-03590fb7-en.htm"&gt;quarter&lt;/a&gt; of finance flows into efforts to adapt to climate change. Historically, most money has flowed into helping developing nations cut greenhouse gas emissions through things like switching to renewable energy or promoting energy efficiency. That’s important, of course. But with climate change already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;supercharging storms, wildfires, droughts&lt;/a&gt;, and other disasters, finding ways to adapt is becoming more urgent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxlrEB"&gt;“The reality is that the genie’s already out of the bottle,” says Saliha Dobardzic, a senior climate change specialist with the Adaptation Fund, which is administered through the World Bank and gives climate grants to developing nations. The fund, which pre-dates the $100 billion climate finance target, raised a record &lt;a href="https://www.adaptation-fund.org/adaptation-fund-raises-record-us-356-million-in-new-pledges-at-cop26-for-its-concrete-actions-to-most-vulnerable/"&gt;$356 million&lt;/a&gt; in new pledges during COP26. “Climate change impacts are being seen and experienced everywhere to some degree — and coping and living and adapting to that requires resources.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KCYmZ7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The genie’s already out of the bottle”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1vS7Ji"&gt;Adaptation might look like homes retrofitted to better weather the next storm, raising them above floodwaters or insulating them from the elements. It might include early warning systems in places that didn’t have them so that residents have more time to prepare or flee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qelFp8"&gt;Forecasting can also help farmers continue feeding their communities. Singh has worked with farmers in the Gambia and India to adapt farming practices to more unpredictable weather. When rains come late, for instance, farmers might turn to seeds that can grow in a shorter time span. And they turn to crops that retain more moisture in the soil. “Those kinds of things are happening, but what is needed now is money to scale up those options,” Singh says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g07k8G"&gt;The money it will actually take to prepare developing nations for the consequences of climate change is between five to 10 times greater than the public finance that’s currently available, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/adaptation-gap-report-2021"&gt;United Nations report&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this month. And those costs are expected to balloon. The price tag for developing countries to adapt to climate change could reach 300 billion a year by the end of the decade, the UN report says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eWResZ"&gt;Developing countries are paying for a problem that was passed onto them, for the most part, by wealthier nations. China’s currently the biggest climate polluter, followed by the US. But historically, the US has released almost twice as much carbon dioxide pollution as China &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/24/18512804/climate-change-united-states-china-emissions"&gt;since the start of the industrial revolution&lt;/a&gt;. Small developing nations on the front lines of climate change are responsible for a much smaller slice of emissions. On a per-capita basis in 2018, the average American was responsible for almost &lt;a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?end=2018&amp;amp;locations=S2-US&amp;amp;start=1960&amp;amp;view=chart"&gt;10 times as much&lt;/a&gt; heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions as a person living on a small island state in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNTZFn"&gt;“Quite clearly, the advanced economies in the global North are the ones who have caused most of what we are experiencing in terms of climate change,” says Henry Neufeldt, chief editor of the UN adaptation report. “Developing nations deserve to receive support.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mScelG"&gt;To make things worse, negotiators also fell short on another key goal in Glasgow. Countries’ plans to slash greenhouse gas pollution, so far, still aren’t good enough to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, a threshold &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;considered critical&lt;/a&gt; for staving off catastrophic climate impacts. To do that, global greenhouse gas emissions would need to drop nearly in half (compared to 2010 levels) by the end of the decade. Countries were expected to come to Glasgow with ramped-up plans to cut down their emissions. Counting all those up, global emissions are still &lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/message_to_parties_and_observers_on_ndc_numbers.pdf"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to rise above 2010 levels this decade, albeit not as steeply as they would have without those new commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JydoWk"&gt;That failure to cut emissions makes adaptation even harder. Considering current emissions reductions commitments, the world is &lt;a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-do-cop26-promises-keep-global-warming-below-2c"&gt;heading towards&lt;/a&gt; a future where more than &lt;a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2865/a-degree-of-concern-why-global-temperatures-matter/"&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the world’s coastlines experience sea level rise greater than two-thirds of a foot. When seawater creeps onshore, it floods peoples’ homes — sometimes permanently. It contaminates sources of fresh drinking water. And it allows dangerous wave surges to do more damage to communities when cyclones hit. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qs10yr"&gt;Samoa, a small island nation where 70 percent of the population lives within just 1 km of the coast, received an &lt;a href="https://www.adaptation-fund.org/project/enhancing-resilience-of-samoas-coastal-communities-to-climate-change/"&gt;$8.7 million grant&lt;/a&gt; in 2012 from the Adaptation Fund to cope with some of those impacts. The initiative led to new seawalls to guard against encroaching water — as well as more roads to make it easier for people to evacuate inland when cyclones hit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vu3dE9"&gt;Still, there’s more work to do. Many of the initiatives’ targets were “too ambitious,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.adaptation-fund.org/projects-document-view?URL=en/360761632165938755/51-Final-Report-AF-Samoa-05-with-signature-audit-trail.pdf"&gt;2018 evaluation report&lt;/a&gt;. An initial target was to build or improve 80 km (roughly 50 miles) of coastal roads, but the budget ended up only being enough for 30 km of roads at a cost of about $3 million. What’s more worrying is that those roads still face an uncertain future as climate change worsens storms, flooding, and coastal erosion. The roads will likely still need to be climate-proofed with updated construction standards, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmgiKQ"&gt;The Samoa project also resulted in a “&lt;a href="https://www.adaptation-undp.org/projects/af-samoa"&gt;handbook&lt;/a&gt;” to guide potential relocation from hazard zones in the future. Being forced to abandon their homes is a worst-case climate scenario for many communities on small island nations that are losing land to the sea. They’ve pushed for finance for efforts to not only adapt but recoup losses from permanent climate damage. For those people who face the prospect of losing everything to climate-fueled disasters, Singh says, “it’s about the support to restart and rebuild my life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RZqfR"&gt;The Alliance of Small Island States at COP26 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AOSISChair/status/1458689527116185602?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=181589086&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_Nk2D1tkCH77AJin1nkmh_hgftCIthM44L1W5EuqSgVLcgrQenxGfRzP5iUdntrMDByX37c1dBYnasubtvqy_UFsxwjUhD_MV5auf8AyA-1W6x15I&amp;amp;utm_content=181589086&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; creating a standalone process for financing “loss and damage.” That was ultimately removed from the decision text (although Scotland pledged independently to give &lt;a href="https://www.gov.scot/news/scotland-to-boost-climate-funding/"&gt;£2 million&lt;/a&gt;). Formalizing funding for loss and damage is something that wealthy nations have shot down since the adoption of the landmark Paris climate agreement in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z6rGkB"&gt;“Rich countries continue to block and ignore the needs of vulnerable people who are suffering now,” Singh says. “People are losing homes now, they need support now.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla has reportedly been shipping out some cars without USB ports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ySYljk82KZG743BWd2S_HLVQNY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70138334/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U4JJQw"&gt;Some Tesla customers have noticed that their newly-purchased Model 3s and Model Ys have missing USB ports, an issue first spotted by &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/11/12/new-teslas-delivered-with-surprise-missing-usb-ports-due-to-parts-shortages/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla has reportedly been telling customers that the chip shortage is behind the lack of ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eW6mCF"&gt;As noted by &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;, the issue didn’t seem to start cropping up until November 11th, and only seems to be affecting Model 3s and Model Ys. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/qsnp5p/new_m3sprobably_other_models_as_well_are_coming/"&gt;Recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/qryiy6/missing_usb_ports/"&gt;buyers&lt;/a&gt; have turned to Reddit to voice their concerns about the missing ports, noting that the USB-C ports on the center console and near the rear seats are missing — many also claim that their EV’s wireless charger also isn’t working (via &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q9KrLN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Users will have to deal with driving a pricey battery-on-wheels that can’t even charge their own devices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W2RUDi"&gt;To make matters worse, some buyers also allege that Tesla didn’t even tell them that their car wouldn’t come with USB ports, &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt; notes. For some, it wasn’t until they saw others’ reports or received their car did they realize the USB ports were missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQNPqv"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;, users who managed to get in touch with Tesla say that the ports may be available this December, and they can then make an appointment to get them installed. But that’s probably not a guarantee that the parts will even be available at that time. So for now, users will have to deal with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/24/22743398/tesla-quietly-raises-prices-electric-vehicles-model-x"&gt;driving a pricey battery-on-wheels&lt;/a&gt; that can’t even charge their own devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PRTR5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;The chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; has branched out into many areas of technology, and the automotive industry isn’t an exception. Some of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765709/bmw-chip-shortage-touchscreen-car-suv-manufacturing"&gt;BMW’s newer models won’t come with a touchscreen&lt;/a&gt;, and buyers likely won’t ever be able to get one installed at a later date. Even GM has been negatively affected by the shortage, as it already had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575836/gm-wireless-charging-cadillac-chevy-tahoe-chip-shortage"&gt;drop wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331766/gm-pickups-semiconductor-shortage-fuel-economy-emissions"&gt;ditch its fuel management module&lt;/a&gt; in some of its newer vehicles. It even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701086/cadillac-super-cruise-2022-escalade-semiconductor-shortage"&gt;axed Cadillac’s hands-free Super Cruise&lt;/a&gt; feature due to the shortage. With all that said, now might not be the best time to buy a new car.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another Samsung Galaxy S21 FE leak shows the device from more angles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3NaqK2p2ft8k-U4f1A1Gb8vy1uo=/0x529:1414x1472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70138065/galaxy_s21_fe_leak_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Coinbrs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AtVCeW"&gt;The yet-to-be-announced Samsung Galaxy S21 Fan Edition (FE) has become the victim of another leak, according to a report by &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-fully-revealed-thanks-to-leaked-marketing-materials/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Just like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"&gt;S20 FE predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, which serves as the affordable counterpart to the S20, the S21 FE is supposed to be the budget-friendly alternative to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;the flagship S21&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o9zcu9CiIyr6FSkjlQdZclyZA00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23011950/samsung_galaxy_s21_fe_games.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Coinbrs&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hR73vs"&gt;Marketing images leaked by &lt;a href="https://coinbrs.com/news/coinbrs-exclusive-samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-5g-revealed-in-full-glory-all-official-images-specs/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coinbrs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; show several images of the device, and it, unsurprisingly, closely resembles the S21. The images show us much of what we saw in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651847/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-fan-edition-leaked-manual-specs-features"&gt;S21 FE’s user manual that was previously leaked&lt;/a&gt; in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUGTso"&gt;As noted by &lt;em&gt;Coinbrs&lt;/em&gt;, the device will reportedly have three cameras on its rear: a main 64MP sensor, a depth sensor, and an ultra-wide-angle sensor. On the front, it’s said to have a hole-punch notch housing a 32MP selfie camera, along with an in-display fingerprint scanner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4szWc"&gt;When compared to the S21 base model’s 6.2-inch display, the S21 FE is rumored to have a slightly bigger screen than its premium counterpart, sporting a 6.4-inch FHD+ 120Hz AMOLED display. &lt;em&gt;Coinbrs&lt;/em&gt; says that it may also have a larger 4,500mAh battery that supports 15W fast charging — a small upgrade from the S21’s 4,000mAh battery. In terms of processing power, &lt;em&gt;Coinbrs&lt;/em&gt; expects it to either come with the Snapdragon 888 or the Exynos 2100 chip depending on the market, as well as up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4wt66"&gt;In June, we weren’t sure there was going to be an S21 FE at all — the ongoing chip shortage spurred &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532816/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-production-reportedly-halted"&gt;rumors that Samsung may be halting the phone’s production&lt;/a&gt;. The S21 FE still hasn’t been officially confirmed by Samsung, but &lt;em&gt;Coinbrs&lt;/em&gt; claims that the company will officially reveal the phone on January 4th.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="bOy1co"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22739195/remastered-grand-theft-auto-trilogy-release-date-november-11th-gta3-vice-city-san-andreas"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; became unavailable on the Rockstar Games store the same day it launched. &lt;em&gt;The Trilogy&lt;/em&gt;, which comes packaged with the remastered versions of &lt;em&gt;GTA III&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;GTA: Vice City&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;GTA: San Andreas&lt;/em&gt;, was supposed to be playable on November 11th, but due to maintenance and other issues, it’s been anything but that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ee7Nzq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Rockstar Games Launcher is now online, but GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition is unavailable to play or purchase as we remove files unintentionally included in these versions. We're sorry for the disruption and hope to have correct ones up soon. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NiMNXUKCVh"&gt;https://t.co/NiMNXUKCVh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rockstar Support (@RockstarSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarSupport/status/1459311246789038089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="geoHpt"&gt;Rockstar Support sent out a tweet saying that the remastered bundle is currently “unavailable to play or purchase,” while it takes out “files unintentionally included in these versions.” It doesn’t tell us what type of files it's removing, or provide an estimated time frame of when the game might come back online, only noting that it hopes to replace the incorrect files “soon.” And as for anyone who managed to snag copies of the games before it was taken down, Rockstar has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlangerOfTowels/status/1459345764644110342"&gt;barred them from playing&lt;/a&gt;. Rockstar also took down the older versions of the games from its store — along with Steam — prior to the release of the remastered trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0JNvM"&gt;Unfortunately, the launch of the three remastered games has been nothing but tumultuous. The Rockstar Games Launcher went down for “maintenance” on Thursday, making not only the remastered trilogy unplayable, but also rendered Rockstar’s entire lineup of games, its store, downloads, and cloud system unusable for over a day. Rockstar finally restored service to its Games Launcher and other services last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcZRb1"&gt;So far, early reviews of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22739195/remastered-grand-theft-auto-trilogy-release-date-november-11th-gta3-vice-city-san-andreas"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GTA: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aren’t looking promising. &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gta-trilogy-definitive-edition-is-a-mess/"&gt;Reviewers are finding the game&lt;/a&gt; filled with glitches and bugs, mainly affecting the game’s graphics. Some users have posted their experience on Twitter, and it doesn’t look pretty — from a rainstorm with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JankyNedelko/status/1458945407397081098?s=20"&gt;blinding white droplets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RerezTV/status/1458876324920102915"&gt;blatant spelling errors&lt;/a&gt;, to just all-around &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VinePotato/status/1458561236237496328"&gt;funky-looking characters&lt;/a&gt;, the game has some serious quirks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGsaJN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Rockstar Games with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back. Despite not being available on PC, the games are still available for purchase on the &lt;a href="https://store.rockstargames.com/en/game/buy-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition"&gt;Rockstar Games Store&lt;/a&gt; for PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X/S, as well as the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The early Black Friday tech deals are coming on strong</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cZ0b-Y4m-krCrmzIYS74qXVckdI=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70137531/VRG_Illo_4859_GG_Main_lede.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="saqVkI"&gt;You made it to the weekend. Good job. In exchange for making it to arguably the best time of the week, we owe you some deals. That’s just how it works. Below, you’ll find a potent mixture of this week’s best tech deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoC7qL"&gt;Before we get started, however, a little bit of housekeeping. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"&gt;We published a massive holiday gift guide this week&lt;/a&gt;. Its art (by &lt;a href="https://www.richardparrydesign.com/store"&gt;Richard Parry&lt;/a&gt;) is so good that I’ve attached it above for you to peep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qi775u"&gt;As we get closer to the holidays, you might want to subscribe to our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re not the kind of person who checks deals every single day, we think you’ll appreciate our bi-weekly dispatch filled with the best deals we’ve seen during the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGqXhR"&gt;We also want to remind you that our sister site, &lt;em&gt;The Strategist,&lt;/em&gt; whips up a great newsletter filled with other kinds of deals, shopping advice, and exclusives that you might want to have shipped to your inbox. If you’re interested — and you should be —&lt;a href="https://nymag.com/strategist/newsletter/"&gt; you can sign up right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="x5Hsy0"&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y53nZZLH59Xl8UsLsNFj5wefzeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21935903/dseifert-nest-audio-4225-1.0.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DDgvxp"&gt;The capable Nest Audio smart speaker is back down to $60&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AVBlS0"&gt;Google’s Nest Audio is the successor to the original Google Home from 2016. A lot has changed since then, and the Nest Audio features a better design and audio performance than its predecessor, along with the opportunity for stereo pairing. The reason I’m writing about it here, of course, is because it’s currently cheaper than usual. Normally $100, you can pick one up from a variety of retailers, like &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfZfC8wHORV?u1=vergedeals111321%20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-audio-smart-speaker%2F-%2FA-81539079&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals111321%20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, for just $60 right now. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dPUn63"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503894"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qMGdzM"&gt;Additionally, we’ve pulled together some other Google Nest deals that you might be interested in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/11/2/22757318/google-nest-smart-home-audio-speaker-assistant-video-doorbell-home-hub-cam-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Also, if you’ve had your eye on the latest Google Nest Learning Thermostat, &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle%2Dnest%2Dlearning%2Dthermostat%2D3rd%2Dgeneration&amp;amp;afftrack=Vergenewsletter111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers can get it for $70 off at Wellbots&lt;/a&gt; through December 1st. Just use promo code &lt;strong&gt;THEVERGENEST &lt;/strong&gt;to get it for $179 at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="laRL6h"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8m2yph"&gt;The second-gen AirPods are an insta-buy at $89 from Walmart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fic1CC"&gt;Whether you need an easy gift for someone close to you or you’d like to treat yourself, Walmart’s deal on Apple’s second-gen AirPods with the wired charging case cannot be beat. Most retailers sell them for around $110 to $120, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeNewsletterDeals111221%20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but you can snag them online right now for just $89&lt;/a&gt;. This is a killer deal for iPhone or iPad users. The more Apple devices you use, the more you’ll get out of these AirPods, since they can seamlessly pair with any modern Apple device you’re signed into with your Apple ID. If that was’t enough, they also offer great battery life and solid sound. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="540bfF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="VETqSD"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bose&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bOxSEN"&gt;Bose is hosting a refurbished sale on its best headphones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RUqzxZ"&gt;The Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are currently available through &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDeals111321/https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones_outlet/noise-cancelling-headphones-700-fr.html#v=noise_cancelling_headphones_700_fr_black%20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose’s refurbished outlet for just $250&lt;/a&gt;. These normally sell for between $350 and $400 depending on the color you want. I know, reading “refurbished” can feel icky sometimes, but Bose says that these “occasionally have minor, nearly imperceptible blemishes” and goes as far as guaranteeing them with a one-year warranty and a 90-day trial. It’s a good deal in our book, especially for a pair of over-ear headphones that offer multipoint pairing and superb noise cancellation. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="MvwGmV"&gt;Fully’s excellent Jarvis standing desk and other products are 15 percent off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="w1teDF"&gt;If your home office is in need of an ergonomic overhaul, check out the sitewide, 15 percent discount Fully is offering on its products right now. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeDeals111321&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Fstanding-desks%2Fjarvis%2Fjarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fully makes the Jarvis standing desk&lt;/a&gt;, which a handful of &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffers own (and adore). Even if you don’t want to plop down the cash on a desk, you can still kit out your current space &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeDeals111321&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2F%23fully-favorites%20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with clever accessories at a discount&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4ucMio"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10852598"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vBEAZu"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lrRhtL"&gt;Amazon and Target are offering “buy two, get one free” on games, books, and more&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9Hx5e8"&gt;For the last deal, you should check out the ongoing promotion currently happening at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/promotion/psp/A2NEKY0JEA1965?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;amp;tag=vergenewsletter-20&amp;amp;linkId=7d3ea0c0c66c0835e1f67d4e15fb9a4d&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl%20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fbuy-2-get-1-free-mix-match%2F-%2FN-93tfbZ54jft&amp;amp;subid1=VergeNewsletterDeals111221%20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which will net you a free item of your choosing when you buy two others. Each retailer has its own respective list of qualifying goodies, but each of them have some of the newest releases in the world of gaming, movies, books, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bgjkB"&gt;At Amazon, you can get games like the new &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy,&lt;/em&gt; and catch up on the &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;hype with Frank Herbert’s original novel. Target seems to offer a wider swath of gaming releases, both new and a little older. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt; is on its list, too, along with several first-party Sony titles for the PlayStation 4 (&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man, The Last of Us Part Two&lt;/em&gt;) and PlayStation 5 (&lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;). People who enjoy board games may find something appealing here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DAlyIo"&gt;
&lt;p id="KnLTyQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: The Verge Deals newsletter on November 10th listed the Keychron Q1 as a 65 percent layout mechanical keyboard. The Keychron Q1 has a 75 percent layout. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s favorite unrealistic gift wishes for 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z06SE9yDqCm8M7RfQSvsRXcKOxA=/0x177:1060x884/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70137371/watch2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TCtA4y"&gt;Let’s face it — somewhere inside us all is a greedy five-year-old who wants that wonderful, beautiful, fascinating toy that seems completely out of reach. But what that toy is depends very much on who we are. So, just out of curiosity, we asked the staff of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to tell us something that they would love to get for the holidays — if money (and opportunity) was no object. (And the rule was that idealistic longings like world peace or the end of the pandemic didn’t count — for this once, we were not going for idealism.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZjy35"&gt;So let’s see what hidden longings lie in the hearts of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s staff...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6Yg5D8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;amp;website_id=0f9b0f6f-13ac-4498-8e0f-b3beae765e07&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F140110%2Fgarmin-inreach-mini%3FCAWELAID%3D120217890005027527&amp;amp;ctc=VergeFavoriteUnrealisticGifts111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Garmin inReach Mini&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZasMt5"&gt;There’s something magical about getting lost in the woods and having to find your way out with just a map and a compass, especially if it’s a relatively safe environment where you’re not &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;far away from help. However, telling your spouse or parent about these wandering exploits can elicit annoyed questions like “What if you broke your arm again?” and “What if you get lost on one of the long wilderness trips you’re planning?” and “You’re not doing any more backpacking until you get a satellite communicator!” (You, like me, may have noticed that the last one is not a question.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ls2ucA"&gt;What I’m saying is that I wish someone would get me a Garmin inReach Mini, a $350 GPS / tracker / personal locator beacon. That feels brutally expensive for a gadget that, hopefully, I won’t ever actually need (especially when I could spend that money on a custom quilt to make nights more comfortable). But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22649340/apple-iphone-13-satellite-connectivity-emergency"&gt;until my phone can actually contact people from the wilderness&lt;/a&gt;, having some sort of satellite communicator is a necessity for my loved ones’ peace of mind. I just don’t think I can bring myself to pay for it, despite how useful being able to access maps, texts, and weather without cell service would be. &lt;em&gt;— Mitchell Clark, news writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y5qrCp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10861275"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CB6R8G"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5IskUw"&gt;Anechoic chamber&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EPXQxB"&gt;Several years ago, I learned about anechoic chambers, which are soundproof rooms that also absorb internal echoes. (You can find articles about them with titles like &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20121022-the-quietest-place-on-earth"&gt;“The quietest place on Earth.”&lt;/a&gt;) They seem wonderfully weird — like “hear your own internal organs” weird, although I think the claim they &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/earths-quietest-place-will-drive-you-crazy-in-45-minutes-180948160/?no-ist"&gt;drive you insane&lt;/a&gt; after 45 minutes is an urban legend — and I’ve wanted to visit one for ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THQLvO"&gt;As far as I can tell, public rentals are fairly rare, though, and &lt;a href="https://cooper.edu/engineering/vibration-and-acoustics"&gt;New York City’s only chamber&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t list the option. My best bet might be a &lt;a href="https://www.orfieldlabs.com/architecture/tour-video-tour-hold"&gt;$250 minimum tour at Orfield Laboratories&lt;/a&gt;, which would require also paying for a trip to Minnesota. So I’m not really &lt;em&gt;*hoping*&lt;/em&gt; I’ll get this for the holidays, especially not during the pandemic. But it’s fun to dream about. &lt;em&gt;— Adi Robertson, senior reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="sDjBqo"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kKXnmc"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2Fp%2F690885&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22777116%2Fholiday-gifts-wishes-favorite-expensive" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TacX Neo Bike Smart Trainer&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro%2F12.9-inch-display-2tb-space-gray-wifi&amp;amp;subid1=VergeFavoriteUnrealisticGifts111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mZbjCU"&gt;I’m a fairly avid cyclist. Let me rephrase that: cycling is the only form of exercise I don’t absolutely detest. I know I should be taking better care of my body, but during the winter months, I have absolutely no desire to get on a bike, let alone go outside. Even if there isn’t snow on the ground, biking in cold weather involves more layers than I care to count, not to mention occasionally covering my feet in foil like a baked potato so they don’t get frostbite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="claCAs"&gt;I currently get around this utterly ridiculous process by using a $60 bike trainer I purchased off Amazon, but if anyone wanted to spoil me this holiday, they could chip in for a Tacx NEO bike smart trainer. And while we’re at it, go ahead and buy a decked-out iPad Pro so I can catch up on my stories while working out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8ijYj"&gt;This entirely excessive bike trainer provides data readouts for your speed, cadence, and power via a built-in LED screen, can adjust resistance on the fly, and even has built-in fans that adjust their speed based on how fast you’re moving, which is an absolute godsend when biking indoors. All of these integrated meters and measurements are definitely more important to people who are legitimately training in the off-season, but I’m just interested that they can help me level up in &lt;a href="https://www.zwift.com/"&gt;Zwift&lt;/a&gt;, my current favorite app for gamifying my workouts. I currently use a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wahoo-Cycling-Cadence-Sensor-Bluetooth/dp/B01E0YRQIA?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wahoo speed and cadence sensor&lt;/a&gt; that is zip-tied to my bike to get the same, albeit less accurate, effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xC2E5f"&gt;As for the iPad Pro, this is a definite indulgence on my part. As someone that would be using this almost exclusively for media consumption, much of the functionality of this overpowered tablet would be lost on me, but since the bike trainer comes with a tablet stand, I may as well set it up with a tablet that would pay my rent for a month. &lt;em&gt;— Alice Newcome-Beill, commerce writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ZhH4m0"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VTwxmQ"&gt;World travel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CBYLEJ"&gt;I have been wanting to travel the world for years, but I haven’t visited as many places as I’d like to yet because 1) there was kind of a pandemic going on, and 2) it’s also kind of expensive. However, if money was no object, I would love somebody to gift me one of those &lt;a href="https://www.staralliance.com/en/book-fly"&gt;around-the-world travel tickets&lt;/a&gt; that go for $10,000 so I could wander the streets of Rome, Lima, Cairo, Beijing — gosh, I could go on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qoWeU8"&gt;And hey, if we were really allowed to dream it up here, I’d love one of those &lt;a href="https://www.vikingcruises.com/expeditions/cruise-destinations/antarctica/antarctic-explorer/index.html"&gt;$15,000 cruises to Antarctica&lt;/a&gt; as well! I’ve always been curious what life is like in one of the most isolated places in the world, and that’s been on my bucket list since I was about 10 years old. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to find myself a rich friend. &lt;em&gt;— Sheena Vasani, commerce writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="0cKDXn"&gt;My wife and I are about to move to a new place, and while we are already budgeting for responsible big-ticket items like a couch and a desk, I cannot wait until we are able to spring for an LG C1 OLED TV so that I can make games on my PS5 and Xbox Series X look even better. The TVs don’t come cheap — a 65-inch model is currently $1,800 at Best Buy — but they’re loaded with features, including support for 4K resolutions, 120Hz refresh rates, and Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync. It would be a major upgrade from the 21.5-inch computer monitor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310104/remote-work-desk-home-set-up-jay-peters-macbook-xbox" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;I use for gaming now&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ll be having my eye on one until I can finally spend the money. &lt;em&gt;— Jay Peters, news writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Ra7nBZ"&gt;I don’t know what I would &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; with the $1,000 Lego Star Wars Ultimate Millennium Falcon — once I’d built it and marveled at my handiwork, of course. It’s not like I’ve got a place to store a Lego set that big. Unlike, say, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Barracuda-Building-Shipwreck-Birthday/dp/B084ZQVZHY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a reconfigurable pirate ship / island&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345026/lego-space-shuttle-nasa-discovery-columbia-hubble-telescope" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a space shuttle&lt;/a&gt;, the UCS Falcon is so big it’d probably be unwieldy to whisk it around a room playing Lego with my daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apAxCH"&gt;Nor do I expect anyone to ever buy it for me, particularly now that its original, already extravagant $800 price tag has gone up by a full fifth (when you can buy it at all). But it would make for an incredible &lt;s&gt;afternoon week&lt;/s&gt; fortnight of building, and I’d love to spend time doing that with a friend or two. — &lt;em&gt;Sean Hollister, senior reports editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="vAjdSL"&gt;I’m by no means a professional, but I’ve been ice skating consistently since I was nine. This past year, with all the rink closures, has been the longest time I’ve been off-ice in, maybe, forever. Unlike others who took up running or indoor cycling during the lockdown, I only took some virtual ballet classes at home and swam laps in our building’s pool, so I am far from being in skating shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGa3fi"&gt;Unfortunately, there is really no substitution for the lateral movements and agility I get from exercising on a slippery surface: most gym equipment only trains forward motions and movements. As an adult, it’s hard to find indoor ice time that fits with a busy work schedule, and outdoor rinks are very sensitive to our unpredictable winters in the Northeast. Short of blanketing my entire apartment in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.purehockey.com%2Fproduct%2Fhockeyshot-synthetic-ice-revolution-tiles-10-pack%2Fitm%2F37356-2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22777116%2Fholiday-gifts-wishes-favorite-expensive" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;synthetic ice tiles and skating inside my home&lt;/a&gt; — which would be a dream come true but would also wreck my expensive blades — the next best thing is to get a sliding board like the one from Brrrn to rebuild my skating muscles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApLSkj"&gt;The Brrrn sliding board doesn’t look like much for a $300 piece of exercise equipment. It’s basically a shiny strip of board with adjustable wooden stops on both ends that prevent you from sliding off the slippery surface. You need to wear these booties over your sneakers so you can exercise safely on the board and spray the board with polishing spray to maintain the slick surface. Thanks to its compactness, I can easily slide the board from under the couch to in front of my television for a quick sliding session. This way, I’ll have no excuse but to get back into skating shape to enjoy my favorite sport again. — &lt;em&gt;Gloria Sin, reviewer (mobile)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="gwoEXa"&gt;OK, so if we’re really going for a “money no object” gift idea, then I’d have to pick Sennheiser’s $1,600 HD 800 S headphones. Yes, that’s too much to ever consider spending on a pair of headphones, and it’s an even more extravagant purchase considering their open-back design would make them inappropriate for listening in all but the quietest of home environments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tn8OhL"&gt;But goddamnit, it’d just be nice to be able to sit back at my desk at home and know that I’m listening to music in the highest possible quality, without having to make any compromises for size or noise isolation. I’ll stick with the wireless noise-canceling headphones for commuting and true wireless headphones for exercising. But if we’re just talking about having a pair of headphones for home listening? It’s gotta be the HD 800 S for me, please. &lt;em&gt;— Jon Porter, reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="XeBows"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dpkE7A"&gt;Tattoos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="y6pwLr"&gt;If my family and friends truly loved me, and I mean this in all seriousness, someone would gift me $5,000 for more tattoos. I’ve got somewhere around a dozen tattoos now, but the artists I go to are not cheap — and rightfully so. I’m not even sure if $5,000 is a good estimate for the designs I want, but it’s a start! If it’s any consolation for my loved ones, they’ll be remembered fondly for the rest of my life every time I look at the ink. That, and maybe our &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@verge?lang=en" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;followers on TikTok&lt;/a&gt; would think I look cool. &lt;em&gt;— Kaitlin Hatton, social media manager, e-commerce&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Q3bi2t"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6pE6xh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop.hodinkee.com/collections/unimatic/products/unimatic-watch-kit-u1-hgmt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Unimatic Modello Uno U1-HGMT Limited Edition watch for Hodinkee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s3Qvd2"&gt;I’m a bit of a wristwatch enthusiast. Not a snob by any stretch, but I do have that unexplainable love for timepieces you wear on your wrist. I use an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, but nothing about it gets me going like an analog watch — whether it’s quartz, mechanical, solar, cheap, expensive, or whatever. I love and appreciate so many watches that offer anything unique or authentic in their story, design, engineering, and general enjoyment, and you’ll never catch me not wearing one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CaaWk0"&gt;While I have a sensible and modest collection of watches, ranging from a $9 Casio and sub-$200 Seiko to a $600 G-Shock, I’ve recently become a bit obsessed with a slightly pricier watch that can’t even be bought anymore. The &lt;a href="https://shop.hodinkee.com/collections/unimatic/products/unimatic-watch-kit-u1-hgmt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Unimatic Modello Uno U1-HGMT Limited Edition for Hodinkee&lt;/a&gt; is a watch made by a small Italian company that features a GMT complication and a monochromatic sensibility that speaks to me. I have wanted a GMT watch for a while, pretending I’m some kind of jet-setting traveler, but the most notable ones out there are usually super-expensive options from the likes of Rolex, Tudor, Breitling, etc. Many of them are a bit too posh for me, even if I do love a Tudor Black Bay GMT. But the Unimatic struck me in a unique way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U4gx82"&gt;It’s not every day you see a mechanical watch from &lt;a href="https://www.unimaticwatches.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a small independent brand that’s made in Italy&lt;/a&gt;, and you don’t always see a design quite like this. Maybe it’s my Italian-American heritage or my obsession with all things black and gray, but if this limited edition of 500 watches was not sold out, I’d be looking to splurge and spend the $1,395 in hopes of it being a forever companion — even if I had to be cliche and “gift” it to myself as a wedding present to go along with my &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; forever-companion. So I choose this as my favorite gift to get for the holidays, money no option. It fits my exact style, and I wouldn’t feel like I have to apologize for it like I would something crazy-expensive like an &lt;a href="https://www.audemarspiguet.com/com/en/collections/royal-oak.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Audemars Piguet Royal Oak &lt;/a&gt;(which I also secretly fawn over). I’d even take a used one with a little wear-and-tear since the edition is sold out. A watch should have a story that makes you love it and also be able to share stories of its own.  &lt;em&gt;— Antonio G. Di Benedetto, commerce writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZHvQgx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10861700"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fxWQwi"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nSVoEB"&gt;2TB Seagate storage expansion Card for Xbox Series X|S&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LKPRfT"&gt;If my Secret Santa wants to be really generous, then I have an idea. I can’t justify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738266/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-512gb-2tb-storage-expansion-cards-release-date-pricing" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spending $399 on a 2TB expansion drive for my Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, especially after I already bought a 1TB card earlier this year.... and an Xbox mini-fridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yQp7G"&gt;New-gen games are taking up ridiculous amounts of space, and waiting for a title to download seems like an entirely unfair punishment for failing to set priorities for the games I keep around. Will adding more storage make me better at the one game I actually play or help me dig through a backlog of games that has only grown longer during the pandemic? I mean, maybe? How will I know if I don’t try?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhTC65"&gt;Sure, I could delete any of the Game Pass games I’ll never actually play and free up some of the nearly 2TB of storage that’s already inside my monolithic console, but you could also mind your business. Unless, of course, you want to buy me an overpriced peripheral that I absolutely don’t need — then go ahead, get involved. (The 2TB drive will be available in December.)  &lt;em&gt;— Richard Lawler, senior news editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="cYSiIy"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0vVDlh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M22XVR2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zeiss 10x42 Victory SF binoculars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CgutAD"&gt;Life during the pandemic has been surprisingly hectic, so much so that I’ve neglected one of my favorite outdoor activities — birdwatching. You’d think that driving to a park and watching the activity of these feathered dinosaur descendants would be just the thing for a brief respite from the cares of the week, but for some reason, I haven’t been able to push myself out to any of my formerly favorite haunts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ntQq1"&gt;Perhaps part of the reason is that my binoculars are, well, pretty much shot. They weren’t very high-end to begin with, and the last time I looked through them, the lenses were so grainy and out of sync that they were less useful than just squinting at the bird I was trying to identify. So I’m in line for a new pair — but even the less expensive binoculars tend to be, well, not cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T16Yt1"&gt;Binoculars are very individual — you really have to try them out in order to decide which work for you — so I can’t really say which I’d like the most. I have some in mind in the mid-$200 range (such as the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YLTG7DA/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Athlon Optics Midas&lt;/a&gt; that were &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-binoculars/"&gt;recommended by Wirecutter&lt;/a&gt;), but if money were no object, I’d be trying out the $2,750 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M22XVR2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zeiss Victory SF&lt;/a&gt; binocs. Zeiss is famous for its optics, and having a pair of those hanging from my neck would be a real treat. &lt;em&gt;— Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6ivPVl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10861851"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9iOD48"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch4VSY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7wUTL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam Deck: Five big things we learned from Valve’s developer summit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ahrsCSpl8owL09zX3z49lICb94k=/48x0:1271x815/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70136394/steam_deck_developer_summit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Purp.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XSFmdY"&gt;On Friday, PC gaming giant Valve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776897/valve-steam-deck-developer-conference-amd-apu"&gt;invited the developer community&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;, a $400 handheld gaming PC with a comparatively powerful AMD chip. It’s akin to the Nintendo Switch of gaming PCs, and there’s a lot we already knew about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping"&gt;delayed handheld&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;its announcement&lt;/a&gt;, our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;trip to Valve’s headquarters&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713075/valve-steam-deck-teardown-repair-open"&gt;an official teardown&lt;/a&gt;. But today, we learned even more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJL2HI"&gt;Here are the highlights — unless, of course, you’d like to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6CUQeHIxDA"&gt;watch Valve’s entire livestream&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SteamworksDev/videos"&gt;breakout sessions&lt;/a&gt; for yourself. That’s fine too! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7nEJlm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aerith lives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R4kjq2oamtRtoC1Jr9leF5c78lM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23010966/chrome_23TO2cUhXJ.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iUYIUn"&gt;The AMD chip inside the Steam Deck has a name: it’s the Aerith SOC, a clear reference to the famous &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerith_Gainsborough"&gt;Aerith from &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;It’s an APU with a power envelope of between 4 and 15 watts, and it contains both an 4-core, 8-thread AMD Zen 2 CPU that runs between 2.4-3.5GHz, and 8 AMD RDNA 2 compute units worth of graphics clocked between 1 and 1.6GHz, for a total of 1.6 teraflops of raw graphical compute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6Fgpr"&gt;Here’s the Steam Deck’s entire block diagram, so you can see how the whole system comes together around that chip:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wPgTKVmvi7GntyHT_5qWM3GYiIg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23010880/chrome_TLfpafLS3X.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5FLrE9"&gt;It interfaces with 16GB of unified LPDDR5 memory, with a total of 88GB/s of bandwidth. While there’s only 1GB of dedicated video memory, Valve says the GPU can access up to 8GB of that shared memory as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kX7uPT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you’re in Florida in July, you may run out of thermal headroom”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4i2y8O"&gt;Valve says the chip’s designed to run continually and consistently at its quoted clockspeeds: “The performance your game gets in the first ten seconds is likely to be the same performance you get two hours from now, or even indefinitely if you’re plugged into the wall,” says Valve’s Yazan Aldehayyat, adding that the system’s designed to perform the same docked, undocked, charging or not, even while downloading games or at an elevated temperature. “If you’re in Florida in July, you may run out of thermal headroom,” he says, but even then Valve says it’ll try to throttle downloads and transfer speeds before it throttles your game performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvPPKX"&gt;Valve does warn that developers may need to avoid pushing the GPU too hard if they want longer battery life. “We didn’t place any artificial limits on how much power the APU can consume.” As one specific tactic, Valve’s suggesting that games cap their framerate to save battery. That could make a big difference: “You can play &lt;em&gt;Portal 2 &lt;/em&gt;for four hours on this thing. If you limit it to 30 FPS, you’re going to be playing for 5-6 hours,” &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-valve-faq-big-questions-answered"&gt;Valve told &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOIX73"&gt;Another optimization: Valve revealed today that developers can upload versions of their games with lower-fidelity texture packages to Steam’s Depot to improve performance and reduce the amount of storage and time it takes a user to download a game. That’s similar to Microsoft’s Smart Delivery system for the Xbox One, Xbox One X and Xbox Series X/S, which routes the proper version of a game to each console. (But where Xbox developers are likely targeting 1080p, 1440p and near-4K respectively, the portable Steam Deck runs at 720p and 800p resolution.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QX7TQR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designed to dock and stream&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tkoo4Dn4FDuNkTfknVhqH8HMZj0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23010965/chrome_TeXCstTWuk.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VwAcLu"&gt;With a 45-watt power supply, Valve says the Steam Deck can charge and play at the same time, and power 7.5-watt worth of external peripherals. The USB-C port also offers external display support for up to two 4K monitors at 60Hz (using Display Stream Compression), and Valve says it’ll offer USB 3 Gen 2 “if you opt for half the display bandwidth.” The optional dock (which has yet to be pictured or go on preorder) will also offer Gigabit Ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyOIAQ"&gt;And if you opt to play on a TV or monitor, you’ll probably be happy to hear the first full confirmation that Valve is supporting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545441/amd-dlss-fidelityfx-super-resolution-fsr-supersampling-tests-benchmarks"&gt;AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR)&lt;/a&gt; upscaling with the Steam Deck. In fact, AMD representatives on the stream confirmed that not only does the Steam Deck work with FSR in games that support it — potentially making them look a bit better on the big screen — but that the Steam Deck will natively support FSR at an operating system level with a future update. AMD says it’s working on drivers that will enable &lt;a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/streamlining-render-passes"&gt;the recently announced Vulkan Dynamic Rendering&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYWARa"&gt;There’s no USB 4 or Intel-proprietary Thunderbolt here, obviously, and you’re only getting 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) instead of Wi-Fi 6 or 6E, but Valve says the Deck is optimized for “reliability and robustness even in congested environments.” That way, Valve can offer a “first-class Remote Play experience” to beam games from their desktop PC to the Deck inside their own homes, while using less battery than games natively running on the Deck’s hardware itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kfgiwe"&gt;Valve did an great job with Wi-Fi engineering when it built &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/19/18103672/valve-discontinues-steam-link-streaming-set-top-box"&gt;the Steam Link HDMI puck&lt;/a&gt;, so I’m excited to test that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vnk9uF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scant slowdown over SD (and eMMC)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6blqfI"&gt;The entry level $400 Steam Deck only comes with 64GB of comparatively slow eMMC storage and a microSD card slot for expansion — you’ll have to pay notably more for the faster models with NVMe SSDs, and even then they’ll be fairly easy to fill with a decent-sized Steam library of games so SD cards may come into play there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IGNrjH"&gt;But today, Valve assured developers that eMMC and SD aren’t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much slower: roughly 12 percent and 18 percent slower respectively when it comes to loading games. (Yes, the Y-axes are either mislabeled or don’t line up with the bar graphs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TypOgG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Valve says games 64GB eMMC Steam Deck might be 12 percent slower at loading a game and 25 percent slower booting, compared to the NVMe model. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;18 percent slower loading a game from SD card. &lt;a href="https://t.co/X6HfKusY2X"&gt;pic.twitter.com/X6HfKusY2X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1459257145237540864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pla1Ih"&gt;Boot times are 25 percent slower, but I suppose we’ll have to see how long they are in reality — Valve didn’t specify an actual number of minutes or seconds it takes for the Steam Deck to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="q5OevW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valve’s changing how cloud saves work so you can pick up and play&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2zbDD9"&gt;But Valve is also thinking of the Steam Deck as an always-on device, one where you won’t always &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to boot and launch games from scratch: there’s a suspend and resume feature built into the Steam Deck that should let you quickly pause games like you do on a Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MtknXYMT7MxFic3cd-KJiuujKlg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23011029/chrome_U7BMoOov6t.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R7upgN"&gt;Valve’s changing how Steam’s cloud save system works as a result: Where today’s Steam generally syncs your cloud saves &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you’ve quit out of a game, the company’s offering new cloud APIs so developers can get their games to sync in the background at the time you suspend the title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pAtHk"&gt;Theoretically, that could also mean you could pause a game you’re playing on the Steam Deck and quickly pick it up on your desktop PC, or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="cm0zOl"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;There’s a white Steam Deck right out of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, but you can’t have it&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Valve’s Greg Coomer picks up a white Steam Deck prototype and shows it off. It’s got an Aperture logo on the back." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rewNBzu2KshOwnvT4fPMcFget-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23010853/white_steam_deck_valve_prototype_aperture_portal.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not for sale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0bBe8F"&gt;During the entire Steam Deck presentation, the backgrounds were &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1459258255260094468"&gt;filled with intriguing hints at Valve’s prototyping process&lt;/a&gt;, and many onlookers noticed a &lt;em&gt;white Steam Deck&lt;/em&gt; among them — one straight out of Valve’s hit game &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; right down to the Aperture logo around back. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xyecde0Qe2uDFHMhS9wbaRNNISQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23011042/chrome_oPvnvcwcLG.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FyAgAi"&gt;Unfortunately, it’s not for sale: “This is a prototype only. We love it too, but we’re not able to bring it to market at the same time we’re shipping the Steam Deck,” said Valve’s Greg Coomer, adding that the company intends to “look at other color options in the future, but that’s really down the road.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="19E5Uc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other tidbits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NC8sNy"&gt;Here are some other random things we learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="666akN"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;It’s not made for VR. &lt;/strong&gt;“We definitely didn’t design and build the device for VR,” says Valve’s Lawrence Yang, while admitting that gamers will almost certainly try anyhow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="r7MChd"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;There are still no plans for 5G or LTE configurations&lt;/strong&gt;. You can tether it to a phone, Valve says. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="54sob0"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Valve is working to bring the Steam Deck to Japan and Australia in particular.&lt;/strong&gt; Other territories as well. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QEpZLN"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Steam Deck has factory calibrated audio. &lt;/strong&gt;“Every single Steam Deck has been calibrated at the factory for best performance” and includes a dedicated amp and DSP for the stereo speakers. It supports multichannel audio over HDMI (via USB-C). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DoTXGF"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Once Big Picture Mode on desktop Steam gets replaced by the Deck UI, it’ll get updated more often. &lt;/strong&gt;There’s no timeframe yet for the switchover, but it’s good news for uniformity. “We can add new features to Steam and you’ll see them almost immediately on Deck.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nUkiTb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valve will share keyboard APIs with multiple IMEs, multiple languages, and emojis. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="z8ti2I"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We got our first look (I think!) at the Steam Deck notifications center and the new controller configurator to map your games to Steam Deck’s controls. &lt;/strong&gt;More of that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NG_Uus8HIA"&gt;in this session&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lzl4KD"&gt;In fact, we’ll leave you with whole bunch of Steam Deck user interface screenshots — we haven’t seen much of this before now. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y_a7bhi-4gYPXSJ1xyg8kbZNQgE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23011055/chrome_g3xH5fE9JG.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The controller configurator lets you map and bind the Steam Deck’s considerable array of controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GOQj5GAVqNZSymIggUh14-dBSRA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23011056/chrome_FXQAJ6FYDF.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’ll look the same across Steam desktop and Deck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dV2Q2pb0SjcgghHMPQWx7lcEUMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23011059/chrome_HGtpWA91Zb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notifications will have a dedicated button on Deck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p id="AsWVXq"&gt;Regardless of which brand you prefer, we’ve compiled some of the best deals on wireless earbuds available right now, some of which are featured in our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;best early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, if you want to do more research before making a buying decision, we also encourage you to read our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which can help you determine which pair of earbuds are right for you. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c27rNd"&gt;Apple AirPods deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2vr3VH"&gt;If you own an iPhone or multiple Apple products, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; are likely the best true wireless earbuds on the market for you. Unlike the base AirPods, the Pro variant offer better sound quality and feature active noise cancellation, not to mention seamless integration with iOS and a MagSafe-compatible charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMREv"&gt;The AirPods Pro tend to go on sale frequently, and we often see them drop to as low as $200. Right now, for instance, you can get a new pair for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$190 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPY6Vk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9766m"&gt;Alternatively, you can buy a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;second-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt; — now the entry-level model — with either a wired or wireless charging case. The base AirPods normally retail for $160, but currently, you can get the version with the wired charging case for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/994132/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$89 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DcXNMK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eJgls2"&gt;If you prefer a little more convenience, you can also get a new pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods with a Qi-compatible wireless charging case&lt;/a&gt; for a few dollars more. At their regular price of $200, they aren’t as good of a value, but you’ll rarely find yourself paying the usual price. At the moment, you can get them for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$160 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1066108/9383?subId1=VergeDeals&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HGCqrw"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5RLzc"&gt;Samsung has a few different wireless earbuds to choose from, including its latest flagship wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds include active noise cancellation and some of the best sound quality of any Samsung earbuds to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyxi2K"&gt;Right now Amazon is offering the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B08MWZHHKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro for more than $50 off&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to around $150 — nearly an all-time low — in select colorways. They’re also available in all three color configurations for $150 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWifJWOA7P" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYRiPIEn1F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="x23GrZ"&gt;Samsung released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; — a good-sounding pair of earbuds with active noise cancellation, wireless charging, and a subtle design — back in August, and we’re already starting to see some discounts at retailers like Woot and Amazon. Right now, for instance, you can get them at &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-13140759?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds2-true-wireless-anc-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot for $100&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Wireless-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Lightweight/dp/B0942DM32W/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for just shy $130&lt;/a&gt;, their lowest price to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Eo52gY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10707231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jQroWm"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; were our top pick last year for the best wireless earbuds overall, but have since been discontinued with the arrival of the Galaxy Buds 2. A successor to the original Galaxy Buds, the Plus model extends the battery life by up to 11 hours and, unlike AirPods, comes in an assortment of colors. Right now, you can buy the Galaxy Buds Plus in black for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Cosmic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F255407922" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$79 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lowest price we’ve seen in the last several months and likely one of the last major discounts we’ll see before the earbuds become unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MjZMZR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mPBmzD"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; are some of the more unconventional wireless earbuds on the market right now, but don’t let their bean-shaped design fool you. The Buds Live is a good option if you want earbuds that produce powerful sound and showcase marathon battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52C6bu"&gt;Right now, you can purchase a pair of the Galaxy Buds Live in a multitude of colors for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B658NP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds-live-mystic-black%2F-%2FA-80785946%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestWirelessHeadphoneDeal110521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, a roughly $70 discount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="HggHzb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; are the true wireless headphones to beat, and improve on their excellent predecessor in several ways. Sony’s latest earbuds include better battery life and noise cancellation, as well as superior sound quality and IPX4 water resistance. Normally $280, they’re currently receiving a small discount at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM4-Industry-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B094C4VDJZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743035238017039291" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsony-wf-1000xm4-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-earbuds-silver%2F-%2FA-82691014%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df_free_online%26CPNG%3DElectronics%26adgroup%3D8-7%26clkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestWirelessHeadphoneDeal110521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, bringing them down to around $248. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lZIzyj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600158"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UMsK59"&gt;Sony WF-1000XM3 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="haWqZJ"&gt;The predecessor to the WF-1000XM4, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WF-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt;, remain a terrific pair of earbuds that routinely go on sale. Like the most recent model, the WF-1000XM3 feature phenomenal sound quality and considerable battery life, a small feat for a pair of true wireless earbuds. They also manage to deliver noise cancellation in a sleek, copper-adorned package, one that’s both attractive and professional. Unfortunately, Sony’s last-gen WF-1000XM3 are only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM3-Industry-Canceling-Wireless/dp/B07T81554H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747336499962657708#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; right now for around $200, their typical asking price and a far cry from the best price we’ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside id="9wJvFX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="1TXXf4"&gt;Other true wireless earbuds deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="58GOfq"&gt;Compared to the competition, Jabra’s wireless earbuds have a rare feature that has yet to become standard in the true wireless earbud market: the ability to connect to two devices concurrently. Ideally, this is great for users who switch between two devices often (like, say, a phone and a laptop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="P0sP2n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Jabra overhauls true wireless earbuds lineup with three new models","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649800/jabra-elite-7-pro-active-3-features-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vJ5wIC"&gt;Last year, Jabra released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are the highest-tier model in Jabra’s lineup. They offer more advanced noise cancellation than the 75t, however, they also feature less bass and an inferior fit. You can currently buy the Jabra Elite 85t for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfDfB2WVItB#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, their best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L8bJWl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10355180"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LacpUE"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt; are also a good option for wireless earbuds that have multi-point Bluetooth connectivity. The Jabra 75t are currently selling for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfDfEmv2ecW" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-75t-Earbuds-Comfortable/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and they remain a solid alternative if you don’t want to buy AirPods. However, the current sale on the aforementioned Elite 85t brings them down to the same price, so we’d recommend waiting for a more substantial sale before picking up the 75t — which is likely to happen, given Jabra intends to phase them out by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OvElfP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqq7gj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Fit Pro&lt;/a&gt; are the latest fitness earbuds from Apple, and offer a sportier design and better sound than the Airpod Pro, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt; by Chris Welch. Sadly, these shiny new earbuds are currently only available for their full price of $200. As soon as we see a price break on these, we’ll be sure to let you know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OvwTzC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10844241"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ3wLT"&gt;If you’re currently in the market for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for your workouts, you also can’t go wrong with the predecessor to the Studio Buds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds have an over-ear hook that keeps them in place while exercising; they’re also IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about ruining them should your workout get intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aryAiB"&gt;Currently, there are a few different discounts available for the Powerbeats Pro. The lowest we see right now is at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B088KTR418/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/2rKXO0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which are selling the earphones in a handful of colorways for just under $150.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0RcdxX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="11vDvx"&gt;Like their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937559/amazon-echo-buds-wireless-earbuds-review-features-bose-noise-reduction-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; are a great value. Amazon’s latest true wireless earbuds offer improved comfort and better noise cancellation, along with a terrific passthrough mode that ensures you can always hear what’s going on around you. The $120 earbuds also feature hands-free Alexa support and sound that’s remarkably satisfying, with more bass than the AirPods Pro and an appropriate amount of restraint when it comes to the high end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cb3iGA"&gt;The second-gen Amazon Echo Buds are often discounted at most retailers. Currently, however, you can only get the latest Echo Buds with either the wired or wireless charging case at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Buds/dp/B085WV7635?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYSsVV4J8B" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $120, the full retail price. The same goes for the version with the wireless charging case, which are available for $140 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085WTWYS4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWiFOTCoYJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. However, we should note that &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Buds/dp/B085WV7635?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon offers an additional 25 percent discount&lt;/a&gt; if you trade in select devices.&lt;/p&gt;
