  &lt;p&gt;Shop our curated guide for everyone in your life&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="SxVkbR"&gt;Finding the perfect gift for everyone special in your life can be, frankly, a nightmare. Some people are easy to shop for, but others in your family or social spheres might be less forthcoming about their desires. You could do the leg work of asking what might make them a happy camper over the holidays, but who has time for that? That’s a rhetorical question. No one has time for that, except for us.&lt;/p&gt;

There are gifts for gamers, aspiring podcast hosts, parents, board game connoisseurs, musicians, and much more.

    <title>Nintendo’s early Black Friday deals on games and consoles kick off November 21st</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ykzben2yN8aOyP3FXzVopn-nsOQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70111479/jbareham_180301_2346_nintendo_switch_0014.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pwlpf2"&gt;Nintendo has shared the slate of early &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; deals it’ll offer starting on Sunday, November 21st. Like last year, the main attraction is the standard Nintendo Switch console that includes &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe &lt;/em&gt;and a three-month individual membership to Nintendo Switch Online. It all costs $299.99. Nintendo didn’t share whether the Switch console included is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20802539/nintendo-switch-v2-new-updated-battery-console-how-to-buy"&gt;the V2 model&lt;/a&gt; with improved battery life, but l&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/22/21564016/nintendo-switch-black-friday-mario-kart-8-online-bundle-best-buy-deal"&gt;ast year’s Black Friday promotion&lt;/a&gt; included the V2. Still, we’ve reached out to Nintendo for confirmation. We’ll also be on the lookout for which retailers will offer this holiday bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zr5KG5"&gt;Several games will receive $20 discounts, including ones that don’t commonly see such a big price drop. Those include &lt;em&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Astral Chain&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Paper Mario: The Origami King&lt;/em&gt;. In addition to those, several other must-haves are being knocked down to $40 (usually $60).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDJbdv"&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="s551V2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tRrUiL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DASe5n"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Splatoon 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iBEu4I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Maker 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lDBXRt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kirby Star Allies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zvsOof"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rfZYqB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dd0jD5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astral Chain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="dZXTGz"&gt;(Keep an eye out in case the digital versions of the games above are the same price as the physical version. If that’s the case, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-128GB-MicroSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GY8NHF2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you might need a bigger microSD card&lt;/a&gt; to store more games on.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVcW2P"&gt;You can also get big discounts on more interactive experiences for Switch, including &lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt; for just $55 (usually $80) and &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit&lt;/em&gt; for $60 (usually $100). These are the biggest discounts yet for either of these titles. Keep in mind that all of these deals will end on the following Saturday, November 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5WjekK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="A4vsCV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus is upgrading Marvel movies to IMAX aspect ratio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NYgdE9SUS24S1Snuf5lT5Al7rSA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70111209/IEDS003_Content_EAR_Assets_1920x1080_V4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Lne3ft"&gt;Disney and IMAX have announced a collaboration that will see several Marvel movies presented in IMAX’s Expanded Aspect Ratio format on Disney Plus. 13 MCU movies in total will be upgraded to IMAX Enhanced on November 12th, including &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt;, which is making its debut on the service that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjbTMM"&gt;While IMAX traditionally uses a squarer 1.43:1 format, Expanded Aspect Ratio is 1.90:1, which is relatively close to the 16:9 ratio of TVs. Marvel movies are generally presented in wider, letterboxed aspect ratios, but many of them feature some 1.90:1 sequences captured with IMAX-certified cameras for a taller picture in IMAX theaters. &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Infinity War&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Endgame, &lt;/em&gt;meanwhile, were shot entirely in the format.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gr9Jts6vJYfK-XeyYmFwcMWv2jE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22987907/bwimax.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8ERLp6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, for example, has 22 minutes of IMAX Expanded Aspect Ratio footage, so those scenes will fill up more of your TV screen when you watch them on Disney Plus. In other words, the black bars will be smaller. The IMAX Enhanced designation will eventually involve more features, like DTS surround sound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkgLpE"&gt;Here’s the full list of MCU movies that will be certified as IMAX Enhanced on November 12th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="d4Fmzk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ant-Man and the Wasp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PJVhyN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Z7aTFE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avengers: Infinity War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rZ2ds7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VKqNNM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yyf7bC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain America: Civil War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FaPLJt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Kn3adO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BMTv5U"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iron Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HdBflR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YaXxKX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wLpcW3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BnFuLG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk, world’s richest edgelord, responds to billionaire tax with another stupid tweet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/opYNus1fbpwECLr24oTgx7GGQXI=/219x97:792x479/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70110857/elon_musk_edge_lord.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elon Musk responds to US Senator Ron Wyden on his plans to tax billionaires. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ocKwEC"&gt;Is it fair that the world’s richest people &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/08/richest-25-americans-jeff-bezos-elon-musk-tax"&gt;pay so little in tax&lt;/a&gt;? That in a time of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/22/wealth-gap-widening-for-more-than-70-per-cent-of-global-population-researchers-find"&gt;extreme inequality&lt;/a&gt;, those that have so much contribute so little in proportion to their vast wealth? These are the questions motivating US Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, who’s been calling for new taxes on billionaires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NiCIZi"&gt;Is it fair that the democracy I live in might have some demands of me? How can I prove that I’m super edgy and totally unfazed by the prospect of paying more tax? These are the questions apparently motivating Elon Musk, who replied to a tweet from Wyden by asking why the senator looks like he’s just orgasmed in his profile picture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sAhjPG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Why does ur pp look like u just came?&lt;/p&gt;— Lorde Edge (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457497438474981384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TV3LKW"&gt;Musk’s crude tweet caps a particularly interesting weekend for the world’s richest man, who  didn’t seem to get the answer he wanted when polling the internet on the issue of wealth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPA9Pt"&gt;On Saturday, Musk asked his 63 million Twitter followers whether or not he should sell 10 percent of his Tesla stock. The question is important, because without selling stock, Musk isn’t actually taxed on the main source of his vast fortune (he owns around 17 percent of Tesla stock, currently worth around $200 billion). This is the situation that Wyden and other politicians wanted to change with a plan to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-billionaires-income-tax-would-work-1163532520"&gt;annually tax&lt;/a&gt; unsold assets like stocks belonging to the United States’ wealthiest citizens — around 700 billionaires (though Wyden’s proposals have &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/38770267-8fed-49a9-a85a-1b9cc2e45d60"&gt;already been rejected&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGlu8O"&gt;As Musk put it in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457067398712942592"&gt;separate tweet&lt;/a&gt;: “I do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere. I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1FutP8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I will abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes&lt;/p&gt;— Lorde Edge (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457066048944066565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l6tAGM"&gt;Musk’s Twitter followers were clear, though: Elon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/7/22768364/elon-musk-poll-twitter-tesla-10-percent-billionaires-capital-gains-tax"&gt;&lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; sell his stock&lt;/a&gt;, with 57.9 percent of 3.5 million participants voting “yes” on the poll. In other words: Musk should be paying more in tax than he does already. (Interestingly, due to how Musk’s Tesla stock options are structured, he’s likely due a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/08/business/elon-musk-twitter-poll.html"&gt;sizable tax bill&lt;/a&gt; regardless of the outcome of any Twitter poll.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRpoxE"&gt;Musk, who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457066048944066565"&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; to “abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes,” hasn’t commented directly on the poll’s outcome. Instead, he chose to fire off his tweet to Wyden after the senator pointed out that “whether or not the world’s wealthiest man pays any taxes at all shouldn’t depend on the results of a Twitter poll.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAdUsV"&gt;It was this shocking suggestion — that questions of great public import, like billionaires’ tax rates, might be settled &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of Musk’s Twitter feed — that apparently proved too much for Elon to bear. Presumably, though, he’s too busy preparing the necessary paperwork to follow through on his promise and sell his stock to come up with a more articulate reply.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Metal Gear games are temporarily disappearing from digital stores </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YvbxV_0BM9d4WWMAaRtZjPTqlc4=/0x60:1440x1020/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70110721/mgs2_screenshot_06.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: Metal Gear Solid 2&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8np3SJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&lt;/em&gt; are disappearing from digital storefronts today, while Konami renews the licenses for the “historical archive footage” they contain, &lt;a href="https://www.konami.com/mg/jp/info/874/"&gt;their publisher has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Although the removals are temporary, Konami’s statement doesn’t give a timeline for when the games might return to affected storefronts. “We sincerely ask for your patience and understanding as we work towards making these products available for purchase once again,” the publisher said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBFQjh"&gt;The removals affect various digital re-releases of the two games, which originally came out in 2001 and 2004. These include the PS3, Xbox 360, PlayStation Vita, and Nvidia Shield TV remasters of both games, the Nintendo 3DS version of &lt;em&gt;MGS3&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455139/metal-gear-solid-games-classics-pc-gog"&gt;GOG re-release of &lt;em&gt;MGS2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The games’ &lt;em&gt;HD Collection&lt;/em&gt; is also disappearing from the PlayStation Now streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RJHH5C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We sincerely ask for your patience and understanding as we work towards making these products available for purchase once again”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oev8H2"&gt;While Konami hasn’t provided details on which historical footage is the problem, both &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;3&lt;/em&gt; use real-world footage in lengthy cutscenes to weave their stories together with 20th century historical events. This footage plays a significant role in establishing the atmosphere of both games, so it’s reassuring that Konami is going down the route of renewing licenses for the footage rather than attempting to strip it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEdX35"&gt;Other games hit by similar licensing issues haven’t been so lucky. In 2012 &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2012/11/16/3652910/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-pulled-from-digital-pc-stores-due-to"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City &lt;/em&gt;was pulled from digital stores on PC&lt;/a&gt; over music licensing issues, and when it returned there were reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/games/GTA-Vice-City-Back-Steam-Nearly-10-Songs-Removed-50206.html"&gt;10 songs missing from its soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;. It was a similar story with the 2010 re-release of &lt;em&gt;Crazy Taxi&lt;/em&gt; on PS3 and Xbox 360, which &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/11/crazy-taxi-on-psn-xbla-when-the-music-stops/"&gt;lacked the music and real-world brands&lt;/a&gt; of the original.&lt;/p&gt;

For new and eligible returning subscribers, one month of Disney Plus will cost just $2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCiAtt"&gt;The offer is one of several promotions the service has announced as part of its anticipated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686598/disney-plus-day-shang-chi-streaming-free"&gt;Disney Plus Day&lt;/a&gt; event taking place November 12th. In addition to offering a month of its service to eligible users for dirt cheap, subscribers can take advantage of special perks at its parks on Disney Plus Day. The perks include early entry to parks 30 minutes before opening at the Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort, as well as free Disney PhotoPass photo downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69B6gH"&gt;On the retail front, new merch will hit ShopDisney from across Disney franchises, including Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars. Disney Plus subscribers can also take advantage of free shipping in the US and Europe from November 12th to November 14th. Disney &lt;a href="https://books.disney.com/"&gt;ebooks&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, will be discounted to just $1 through November 17th. And the company is teaming up with Target to offer special giveaways when subscribers sign up in-store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SroxE2"&gt;Disney is also partnering with Funko for 10 percent off Disney Plus products with the code DISNEYPLUSDAY. (The same code can be used at WizKids for a 5-percent discount on Disney products, which will ship with a Marvel-themed gift, from November 8th through November 14th.) Plus, New Star Wars Funko products will be made available at BringHometheBounty.com beginning at 6AM PT on November 12th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1H0b0"&gt;In addition, participating AMC theaters will screen surprise Disney movies from November 12th through November 14th for $5 per ticket. You won’t know what you’re seeing until the show begins, and each screening will include a surprise short. Special concessions and a Disney Plus poster are included with the ticket price. More than &lt;a href="https://www.amctheatres.com/disney-plus-day-surprise-screenings-weekend"&gt;200 AMC theaters&lt;/a&gt; will be participating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUXBmc"&gt;Lastly, it wouldn’t be an event in 2021 with some kind of NFT shenanigans, would it? Disney is partnering with VeVe to offer special NFTs of golden statues of characters from across the Disney family of brands and franchises, including &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;. The NFT series launches November 7th, and an “ultra-rare” collectible will become available on Disney Plus Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JlIpT"&gt;Following the one-month $2 promotional pricing, Disney Plus will cost its regular $8 per month. So if you plan to swipe the service on the cheap and then bail, remember to set a reminder to cancel your subscription before it quadruples in price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: The Power of the Dog, Moonfall, Morbius, The Book of Boba Fett and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EGCInu9HhH3vpe3xK88Xo-R2W_U=/164x0:1517x902/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70109429/benedict_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Benedict Cumberbatch stars in The Power of the Dog, coming to Netflix December 1st. | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRDPo0CHrko&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cuZnlN"&gt;I have noticed this irritating thing where more and more trailers have a scene to introduce the trailer. It is already an introduction! You are wasting precious seconds telling me what I’m about to see instead of just showing me! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="osY1WB"&gt;OK end rant. I finished my (late) binge of &lt;em&gt;Maid&lt;/em&gt; on Netflix and am now really interested to read the book. It may have been one of the most realistic descriptions of poverty I’ve ever seen, where even the smallest setback can have a devastating effect, and you’re painfully aware of every penny you earn and where it’s going to go before you even get paid. Also &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt; finally had a good, return-to-form episode with Ruthless Cory, Spiraling Chip, and Awful Alex each at their peak. The best scene, though, belonged to Mia (Karen Pittman) as she tried to make sense of the episode’s big event on a personal level. More of her, please, show (although with two episodes left in the season and Alex just back from Italy and breathing on and hugging everyone... maybe not?). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPTZRQ"&gt;This week’s trailers: The baddies take center stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="coIN3K"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g6CkLl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LRDPo0CHrko?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BxDyAV"&gt;The Power of the Dog&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FXtWWN"&gt;Benedict Cumberbatch plays a mean cattle rancher who bullies his brother, his sister-in-law, and her son in this absolutely gorgeous-looking movie directed by Academy Award winner Jane Campion which is based on the 1967 novel of the same name by Thomas Savage. The movie is already generating (I know, but it &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/movies/2022-oscar-contenders.html?searchResultPosition=1"&gt;really is&lt;/a&gt;) Oscar buzz for Cumberbatch and for Kirsten Dunst. Along with Cumberbatch, Dunst, Jesse Plemons, and Kodi Smit-McPhee star in &lt;em&gt;The Power of the Dog&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters on November 17th and Netflix on December 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="26KQJH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P55rbK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rOJ1cw6mohw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="RFRKiI"&gt;The Book of Boba Fett &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5Rvf3z"&gt;“Every galaxy has an underworld” is this series’ tagline and hell yeah it does let’s go. The &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;long&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;-awaited series on the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars &lt;/em&gt;movies’ most popular villain (note that the first thing we hear in the trailer is: “I am not a bounty hunter”) is almost here, and this first trailer should do plenty to whet fans’ appetites. We got our first look at the series in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuXMQQHr8A&amp;amp;ab_channel=StarWarsCoffee"&gt;post-credit scene&lt;/a&gt; from the finale of the second season of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;, where Fett kills Bib Fortuna and takes the throne once occupied by his late employer Jabba the Hutt. The loyal Fennec Shand sits at his side. The new trailer shows Fett trying to negotiate with some of Jabba’s former associates: “Jabba ruled with fear. I intend to rule with respect.” Bring on the wretched hive of scum and villainy! Temuera Morrison and Ming-Na Wen star in &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to Disney Plus on December 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keim8k"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="afXIdW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xx97DuHGr2o?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fIxrGU"&gt;Moonfall &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7MXe4N"&gt;Maybe this movie will be good! Big, loud, disaster &lt;a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/roland-emmerich"&gt;movies directed by Roland Emmerich&lt;/a&gt; are ... well they are big and loud and usually very popular. The premise here is that the guys on the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969 found something sinister that has been kept hidden for 50 years but now it’s like, out? And the moon is going to … fall? And also it’s hollow and there is something in there? Anyway it will all be Very Bad for Earth and, the Only One Who Can Save Us All is Halle Berry (that tracks, actually). She stars along with Patrick Wilson, John Bradley, and Donald Sutherland (who is apparently playing The Voice of Doom) in &lt;em&gt;Moonfall&lt;/em&gt;, which hits theaters February 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sDxru7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oZ6iiRrz1SY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="U1ikfn"&gt;Morbius&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1hKUKc"&gt;Maybe &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; movie will be good! It’s been almost two years since we last saw a trailer for this movie about a lesser-known Spiderman antihero and I think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21062568/morbius-trailer-jared-leto-marvel-sony-pictures-venom-michael-keaton-vulture"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt; of the first trailer back in January 2020 holds up pretty well. Dr. Michael Morbius has a blood ailment he has to find a cure for and accidentally turns himself into a sort-of vampire with perfect abs “and some form of bat radar” (literally a quote from the trailer) and he can also sort of fly, plus he needs to drink blood. OK, cool. Jared Leto, Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Al Madrigal, and Tyrese Gibson star in Morbius, which comes to theaters in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IsgIqX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is also a new trailer&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqqAWMIIAQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=SonyPicturesEntertainment"&gt;Resident Evil: Raccoon City&lt;/a&gt; which I will link here but decided not to embed because it’s pretty gruesome throughout. It comes to theaters November 24th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google explains why the Pixel 6’s fingerprint scanner may be sluggish</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Pixel 6" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/60P-QuB0BsysdDpovEEVCaBlJFE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70109224/pixel6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MzeGYN"&gt;There’s a lot to rave about with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;the Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but their fingerprint scanners are not among those things. Since the Pixel 6 release in October, &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/opinion/google-pixel-6-fingerprint-sensor-is-the-weakest-part-of-a-killer-android-phone"&gt;users have been complaining&lt;/a&gt; about its sluggish, unreliable fingerprint scanner that makes the phone a hassle to unlock. Google has finally responded to those complaints, and while it provided an explanation, it didn’t really offer any solid solution (via &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-slow-fingerprint-sensor-195023475.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wMFFdB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're sorry for the hassle. The Pixel 6 fingerprint sensor utilizes enhanced security algorithms. In some instances, these added protections can take longer to verify or require more direct contact with the sensor. Try troubleshooting steps: &lt;a href="https://t.co/uTbifE5Uyo"&gt;https://t.co/uTbifE5Uyo&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks. ^Levi&lt;/p&gt;— Made By Google (@madebygoogle) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1457043416139898881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qr3erX"&gt;In a reply on Twitter, Google attributes the issue to the “enhanced security algorithms” that the Pixel 6’s fingerprint scanner uses. Google says that these security measures can make your fingerprint “take longer to verify or require more direct contact with the sensor.” It then provides a link to a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6285273"&gt;Google support page&lt;/a&gt; that really doesn’t offer much help, besides suggesting to ensure your fingers are clean and that you’re using a finger that you’ve registered with the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAQi4k"&gt;Replies from other Twitter users suggest that it may be a hardware issue. The Pixel 6 uses an under-the-screen optical fingerprint scanner instead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223494/qualcomm-ultrasonic-fingerprint-reader-samsung-galaxy-s21-announcement"&gt;a fast ultrasonic one&lt;/a&gt; like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt;, which some users say could be the reason behind the sensor’s poor performance. But as noted by &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/qoayk3/made_by_google_the_pixel_6_fingerprint_sensor/"&gt;other users on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; say that the optical fingerprint scanner works fine on their OnePlus phones, possibly indicating a software issue specific to the Pixel 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pj9cqD"&gt;For now, it looks like there’s no clear solution to the Pixel 6’s finicky fingerprint scanner, and Google’s answer is vague at best. There’s no telling whether Google can patch the issue in a software update, or if the scanner’s so-called “enhanced” security system really is picky when it comes to prints. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Google with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HgkZVa"&gt;Until Google decides to resurrect face unlock, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20919390/google-pixel-4-face-unlock-eyes-closed-privacy-eye-contact"&gt;which had its own security flaws&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll just have to resort to typing in your PIN. Otherwise, the Pixel 6 will test your patience as you try to scan your fingerprint over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xfcEGg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are bigger, better, and smarter","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>SpaceX Crew-3 launch delayed again, this time to November 10th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4FpIRwmZL9nF5w2sU4GTJT0zQuI=/339x0:4116x2518/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70109011/51634067771_6e46bf9d92_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA / Joel Kowsky&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HsxmOa"&gt;The SpaceX Crew-3 mission to the International Space Station has been delayed again, this time to November 10th at 9:03PM ET, &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2021/11/07/nasa-spacex-adjust-crew-2-station-departure-date/"&gt;NASA said Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. Although NASA had originally planned to have a changing of the guard with the Crew-2 astronauts greeting the Crew-3 team before Crew-2 departed, the space agency has decided to return the Crew 2 to Earth first, pushing that mission from Sunday to Monday, November 8th at 2:05PM ET, because of weather concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmpd0O"&gt;Wednesday so far has an 80 percent chance of favorable weather for liftoff, SpaceX noted in a tweet on Sunday. If all goes to plan the craft will take off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and dock with the ISS at about 7:10PM ET on November 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IFkpwZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Following Crew-2’s return to Earth, Falcon 9 will launch Dragon’s third long-duration crew mission to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Space_Station?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Space_Station&lt;/a&gt; as soon as Wednesday, November 10; weather forecast is 80% favorable for liftoff &lt;a href="https://t.co/xOFGVw3fOP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/xOFGVw3fOP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— SpaceX (@SpaceX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1457375316003880963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BFPCCc"&gt;After it was originally scheduled for an October 31st launch, the Crew-3 has seen several delays, for weather concerns, and once for a “minor medical issue” with one of the crew members. . Four astronauts—NASA’s Thomas Marshburn, Raja Chari, and Kayla Barron, and the European Space Agency’s Matthias Maurer— will travel aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft to begin a six-month stay in orbit on the ISS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHPU31"&gt;Crew-3 is the third operational crewed flight for SpaceX as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, which uses private craft to bring NASA astronauts to and from the ISS. If it ever launches, it will be the fifth time Space X has sent people to orbit aboard its Crew Dragon; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/30/21269703/spacex-launch-crew-dragon-nasa-orbit-successful"&gt;SpaceX launched two NASA astronauts to the ISS&lt;/a&gt; in May 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcT0EO"&gt;NASA’s livestream coverage of the launch will be available &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive"&gt;on the agency’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2yAe7n"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4ra4r"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhlgyT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk polls his Twitter followers, and a majority votes he should sell 10 percent of his Tesla stock </title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Elon Musk polled his Twitter followers | Photo by PATRICK PLEUL/POOL/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JchOSd"&gt;Tesla CEO and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22163361/elon-musk-billionaire-richest-world-jeff-bezos-tesla-stock-spacex"&gt;wealthiest&lt;/a&gt; person in the world Elon Musk tweeted out a poll Saturday, asking his Twitter followers whether he should sell 10 percent of his stock in the automaker, ostensibly to pay more tax. When the poll closed Sunday afternoon, 57.9 percent of more than 3.5 million participants had voted “yes,” and 42.1 percent voted “no.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="coNDYE"&gt;“Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock,” Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457066048944066565?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Saturday. He said in a subsequent tweet that he’d abide by the results of the poll “whichever way it goes.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I will abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457066048944066565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QPNAbf"&gt;Musk had been a vocal critic of a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-billionaires-income-tax-would-work-11635325201?mod=article_inline"&gt;proposal to tax unrealized gains&lt;/a&gt; on publicly traded assets for some of the wealthiest Americans. Under the &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Billionaires%20Income%20Tax%20-%20One%20Pager.pdf"&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon), if assets increased in value, even if the person didn’t sell the assets, the person would have to pay taxes on the unrealized gain. It would basically end the tax loophole that lets billionaires defer capital gains taxes indefinitely, while still being able to borrow against that wealth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMidhq"&gt;“Eventually, they run out of other people’s money and then they come for you,” Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1452792781726961668"&gt;tweeted in October&lt;/a&gt;, in response to a tweet expressing concerns about the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYvF1I"&gt;Wyden responded to Musk’s idea, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1457110175932846080?s=20"&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday: “Whether or not the world’s wealthiest man pays any taxes at all shouldn’t depend on the results of a Twitter poll, It’s time for the Billionaires Income Tax.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1PfxF"&gt;Saturday was also not the first time Musk has floated the idea of selling off some Tesla stock. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZP67-DECVw&amp;amp;ab_channel=Recode"&gt;Musk told journalist Kara Swisher at Code Conference&lt;/a&gt; in September that he planned to sell a big chunk of his Tesla stock options before they expired. “I have a bunch of [stock] options that are expiring early next year, so that’s a huge block of options we’ll sell in Q4,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="updX0c"&gt;(On Monday morning, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/07/elon-musk-faces-a-15-billion-tax-bill-which-is-likely-the-real-reason-hes-selling-stock.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; noted&lt;/a&gt; that Musk was granted 22.8 million shares in 2012 that are due to expire in August 2022. To exercise the grant he’ll have to pay a tax bill of about $15 billion at today’s market price — Twitter poll or not.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zgStLl"&gt;Swisher asked if he was surprised by how much Tesla’s stock had gone up. “I have gone on record and said I think [Tesla’s] stock price is too high, in my opinion,” Musk added later. “What am I supposed to do? I’m not the one making it go up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTbnZh"&gt;ProPublica journalist &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eisingerj/status/1457099957635272707?s=21"&gt;Jesse Eisinger pointed out on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that the third tweet in Musk’s Saturday thread — “Note, I do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere. I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock”— appeared to confirm the news site’s reporting on how &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax"&gt;the ultra-wealthy avoid paying income taxes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QHjEBm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Note, I do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere. I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457067398712942592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QheKCL"&gt;“Thank you for confirming our story: That for the ultra wealthy income taxes are essentially voluntary,” Eisinger tweeted, noting that Musk had previously called the story “misleading.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIjOQY"&gt;As of Sunday afternoon, Musk had not commented on the poll results. We’ll update this post if he does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBAtbo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: November 7th, 2:37PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds final result of Musk’s Twitter poll&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BX83u4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 8th, 6:53AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added 2012 stock grant from CNBC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
