    <title>Halo Infinite is getting better Battle Pass progression later this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A50wvRCkP5eE5HZCF0drb4EN1yk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158973/HaloInfinite_RXJtJxSVSl.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="urkns2"&gt;If you’re still stuck on level 1 of the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass, fear not, as 343 Industries is making some much-needed changes to progression later this week. “To address the feedback on Battle Pass progression we will be making targeted tunings to our model later this week,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Unyshek/status/1461124062021763072"&gt;says &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; community manager John Junyszek&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qTANV"&gt;The existing &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass makes it difficult to level up, as you’re limited to completing daily or weekly challenges instead of earning XP for every game you play. While that isn’t changing yet, 343 Industries is adding “Play 1 game” challenges “to help make sure you consistently progress through the Battle Pass by playing matches the way you want,” according to Junyszek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3HF7SN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To address the feedback on Battle Pass progression we will be making targeted tunings to our model later this week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To start, we'll be adding "Play 1 Game" challenges to help make sure you consistently progress through the Battle Pass by playing matches the way you want.&lt;/p&gt;— John Junyszek (@Unyshek) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Unyshek/status/1461124062021763072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yId2pq"&gt;343 Industries will also be removing some weekly challenges and fixing bugs with others, but these changes do have a small price. “When we make this update, we’ll need to reset your challenges, including your progress towards weekly ones,” explains Junyszek. “To make up for this reset, we’ll be granting this week’s Ultimate Reward, the Sigil Mark VII Visor, to everyone who logs in from November 23rd to November 30th.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhuQBV"&gt;XP boosts will also now double in duration, lasting for an hour instead of 30 minutes, which will help for longer Big Team Battles games. We may even see further changes to the XP and progression systems in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;in the future, too. “We’ll be watching these changes closely to make sure they have the positive impact we all want on your progression,” says Junyszek. “This is only our first step - we are committed to continue evolving these systems but it will take time.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The XP boost changes should help during Big Team Battles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UBbrpz"&gt;Criticism around the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass progression has been getting increasingly louder across the community of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; fans this week after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782786/halo-infinite-multiplayer-available-download-launch"&gt;surprise early release of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. While multiplayer previews over the summer felt like an exciting return to form, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22725770/halo-infinite-multiplayer-preview"&gt;we had concerns around the Battle Pass progression&lt;/a&gt; and XP systems. 343 Industries still went ahead with the same systems, despite concerns from many during the technical previews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3uFn2"&gt;It’s encouraging to see quick changes, though. This opening &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; season will last until May, which is double the three months that had originally been promised. That extra time could be why 343 Industries kept the slow Battle Pass progression in the first place, but we’ll have to check out the changes later this week to see if they make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify launches lyrics feature globally for free and paying users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Spotify Stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/exXtCaChxrUyyxsLMKiYH1unUEI=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158957/acastro_180213_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YEAnqG"&gt;Today, Spotify is finally rolling out its &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-11-18/you-can-now-find-the-lyrics-to-your-favorite-songs-in-spotify-heres-how/"&gt;real-time lyrics feature globally&lt;/a&gt;, after previously only offering it in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307984/spotify-real-time-lyrics-26-markets-musixmatch-genius-apple-music-karaoke"&gt;limited selection of countries&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3S2No"&gt;The lyrics themselves are provided by Musixmatch, which claims to &lt;a href="https://about.musixmatch.com/press"&gt;offer lyrics&lt;/a&gt; for “over 8 million” titles. and will be accessible on basically every platform where Spotify has an app. This includes iOS, Android, desktop computers, gaming consoles, and smart TVs. The feature is available to both free and premium listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYNrcO"&gt;As well as using the lyrics to sing along yourself, there’s also a social element which allows you to share lyrics to social media. Spotify says the feature will be available across the “majority” of its music library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANfx4V"&gt;Here’s how to access the lyrics (and share them) as per Spotify’s instructions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FH7wet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the Spotify mobile app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4cTCiu"&gt;Tap on the “Now Playing View” on a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23MrNs"&gt;While listening, swipe up from the bottom of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrGvtb"&gt;You’ll see track lyrics that scroll in real time as the song is playing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rKYKC"&gt;To share, simply tap the “Share” button at the bottom of the lyrics screen and then select the lyrics you want to share — and where you want to share it — via third-party platforms.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2efwpu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the Spotify desktop app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYmPaQ"&gt;From the “Now Playing” bar, click on the microphone icon while a song is playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iBJ9c"&gt;Voila! You’ll see track lyrics that scroll in real time while the song plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwQZTP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the SpotifyTV app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8Y2PP"&gt;Open the “Now Playing View” on a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zow6SJ"&gt;Navigate to the right corner to the “lyrics button” and select if you want to enable Lyrics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1sj3t"&gt;Once enabled, you’ll see the lyrics in the “Now Playing” View.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fkfXUq"&gt;Spotify’s history with lyrics is complicated. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/26/8113061/spotify-lyrics-feature-desktop-app"&gt;previously worked with Musixmatch&lt;/a&gt; to display song lyrics until &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/lyrics-spotify-musixmatch-gone-for-now/"&gt;parting ways with the company in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, it’s offered a “Behind the Lyrics” feature thanks to a partnership with Genius. It’s an interesting feature that offers background information on songs, but it’s less useful for karaoke sessions. Although it’s offered lyrics in some markets, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/29/13103812/spotify-japan-available-lyrics-feature"&gt;like Japan&lt;/a&gt;, the feature hasn’t received a widespread launch in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307984/spotify-real-time-lyrics-26-markets-musixmatch-genius-apple-music-karaoke"&gt;western markets like the US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxJ0Ly"&gt;With the introduction of the new lyrics feature, Spotify &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/spotify-finally-rolls-out-real-time-lyrics-to-global-users/"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it’s discontinuing its “Behind the Lyrics” feature.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zipline starts first commercial US drone deliveries with Walmart partnership in Arkansas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r0dSR7gTgReSxvgUCfJvSWdpCBM=/0x0:5097x3398/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158855/Zip_launch.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6uZY56"&gt;Walmart and drone delivery company Zipline are launching a delivery service in Pea Ridge, Arkansas — the first commercial drone delivery service offered by Zipline in the US. Customers will be able to choose from “thousands of products,” though are restricted to health and wellness items like “over the counter allergy medicine, bandages, ibuprofen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKt9H0"&gt;The project’s launch shows there’s continuing belief in the potential of drones to perform commercial deliveries. But the technology’s slow rate of adoption (Walmart first tested drone deliveries &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/26/9617600/walmart-drones-amazon-faa-test"&gt;back in 2015&lt;/a&gt;) and the lack of large-scale implementations (the Pea Ridge service only covers a 50-mile radius) also shows there are plenty of questions to be answered if drone deliveries are to become commonplace for regular consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="L28I8e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Vaccines make sense for drone deliveries — do diapers?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pT03z2"&gt;To date, Zipline has mostly proven its mettle in healthcare, delivering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21270351/zipline-drones-novant-health-medical-center-hospital-supplies-ppe"&gt;medical supplies in North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/13/13267868/zipline-drone-delivery-rwanda-blood-launch"&gt;blood in Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320965/drone-delivery-vaccine-ghana-zipline-cold-chain-storage"&gt;COVID-19 vaccines in Ghana&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the economics of deliveries are better suited to the expenses of the technology. Vaccines and blood samples are small, valuable, and benefit greatly from speedy delivery. Walmart is Zipline’s first commercial partner, and it’s not clear if the economics of drone delivery are as convincing for customers who want on-demand diapers and non-prescription medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k4e1FK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10872508"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QxsIha"&gt;For Walmart, drones may help it plug gaps in its delivery network, particularly in rural communities that aren’t well served by traditional infrastructure. Drones, of course, don’t need roads or highways, and Zipline’s aircraft make delivery by parachute, avoiding the need for customers to have designated landing zones. (This is one of the challenges that has &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/amazon-drone-delivery-prime-air"&gt;reportedly stymied&lt;/a&gt; Amazon’s drone delivery ambitions.) There are other hurdles, of course, including regulatory ones, though Zipline was granted a waiver of certain FAA restrictions on drones &lt;a href="https://cei.org/blog/regulatory-waiver-clears-the-sky-for-private-partnership-innovation-and-competition/"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, which cleared the way for the Walmart partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sA5dfM"&gt;Residents in Pea Ridge, Arkansas who want to test out the drone delivery service will need to download Zipline’s app to do so. There they can place an order and pay for their items if they’re “eligible,” though we’re not quite sure what is meant by this term. Zipline told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that access will start with “a hand-selected group of recipients,” and that following the launch, “Zipline and Walmart will quickly work to expand to additional customers in the broader NWA region, subject to FAA approvals.” But that doesn’t offer much help. It seems drone deliveries are still not arriving as fast as hoped. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google explains the tradeoffs that led to Pixel 6’s slow charging complaints</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y-SLEVmDHLuPox9gnq9NbQxpBXY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158791/bfarsace_211014_4802_0054.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mjwG1g"&gt;Google has responded to allegations that the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro don’t charge as fast as some have expected, confirming that their charging speeds are a deliberate tradeoff for better battery life. It follows a &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-6-charging-test-3051231/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which found that the phones’ maximum power draw was around 22W, well short of the 30W that Google’s latest USB-C charging brick is technically capable of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmwxTl"&gt;Writing in a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/135906719/how-charging-works-on-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro?hl=en"&gt;community support post&lt;/a&gt;, a spokesperson for Google confirmed that the maximum power draw of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are 21W and 23W respectively when used with its 30W USB-C charging brick. They added that charging speeds also decrease as the phones’ batteries fill up to preserve their longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4eX0u"&gt;In their post, they note that these figures are the inevitable results of battery tradeoffs. “A battery can be designed for high energy density, or for fast charging power capability, which requires trading off capacity to minimize battery degradation,” says the spokesperson. In other words, a phone can offer long battery life, or fast charging, but it can’t do both at the same time. So, Google prioritized a longer battery life and designed the phones to draw a more modest amount of power when charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z48O3T"&gt;This tracks with what we observed in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;review of the two phones&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="y76nAZ"&gt;”Even if you do use a powerful enough charger, neither phone charges particularly quickly. Google aggressively slows down charging once it’s past 80 percent to preserve the battery cells’ longevity, and since these batteries are so large, getting to a full charge can take a long time. Fortunately, thanks to the long battery life, you will likely only have to charge when you’re sleeping anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GsXJTf"&gt;Although &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7158570?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-pro"&gt;Google’s support documents&lt;/a&gt; never explicitly state the charging speeds of the new phones, their compatibility with Google’s 30W charging brick (sold separately) was taken by many to mean that their real-world maximum charging speeds would approach the 30W level, and would be far faster than the 18W charging supported by the Pixel 5. But in reality, &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;’s report&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that the actual power draw of both phones peaks at 22W and averages around 13W over the course of a full cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPs3ml"&gt;The effect of this is that the phones charge far slower than you might expect, with &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; finding that the Pixel 6 Pro takes almost two hours to reach a full charge. That’s 49 minutes slower than Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra, which has a similarly-sized battery but is only advertised with 25W fast charging speeds. In fact, Google’s power draw is so conservative that its 30W charger only fully charges a Pixel 6 Pro 10 minutes faster than its old 18W charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GaRag0"&gt;Google never claimed that the phones charge at 30W. Instead, it advertised the amount of time it takes to get from 0 to 50 and 80 percent when charged using its 30W charger — 30 minutes and around an hour, respectively. This is in line with what &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; found in its tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPR1Xz"&gt;As well as charging speeds, Google also recently clarified that the seemingly sluggish performance of the phones’ fingerprint scanner is because of their “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/7/22768853/google-explains-pixel-6-fingerprint-scanner-unreliable"&gt;enhanced security algorithms.&lt;/a&gt;” It later released an update containing “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787537/google-pixel-6-pro-update-fingerprint-scanner-slow"&gt;some fingerprint sensor performance improvements&lt;/a&gt;,” although the improvements it delivered appeared to be minimal in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is celebrating 20 years of Xbox in secret style</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N8n3Bg"&gt;Microsoft has been having a hell of a time celebrating 20 years of Xbox this week, adding 76 new games to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782746/microsoft-xbox-backward-compatibility-76-new-games"&gt;the Xbox backward compatibility library&lt;/a&gt;, launching a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641632/microsoft-xbox-series-x-halo-console-elite-2-controller"&gt;Halo-themed Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714394/microsoft-xbox-20th-anniversary-controller-headset-design-preorder-date"&gt;20th anniversary translucent controller&lt;/a&gt;. But, true to the company’s habit of corporate mischief, it’s also been leavening its announcements with plenty of Easter eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3HqhW"&gt;The new hardware that launched this week features the best looking Xbox Series X console and controllers we’ve seen so far, particularly the stylish &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714394/microsoft-xbox-20th-anniversary-controller-headset-design-preorder-date"&gt;translucent one&lt;/a&gt;. All of this new hardware also includes some hidden secrets, too. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/qvt8px/halo_20th_anniversary_xbox_has_a_hidden_zeta_halo/"&gt;Reddit users&lt;/a&gt; have discovered that the Halo-themed Xbox Series X console has a hidden Zeta Halo symbol on the front.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hidden Halo Zeta symbol.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H21EWe"&gt;You’ll need to shine a black or UV light on the console to actually see this little Easter egg, but it’s a neat touch for a limited edition 20th anniversary console that celebrates the launch of &lt;em&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved&lt;/em&gt; and the original Xbox in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6f9sN"&gt;That UV light will also come in handy if you’ve purchased a 20th anniversary Xbox controller. If you shine the UV light on the packaging that the controller ships with, you’ll see the original Duke controller that came with the original Xbox console in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="38qSWx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yes!!! And the new 20th anniversary Xbox controller, it has the old controller from 2001 when you shine the black light on it! &lt;a href="https://t.co/DriHhsIuen"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DriHhsIuen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Hannah (@Hannah31754354) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hannah31754354/status/1460398195121344514?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xoMOYa"&gt;The secrets don’t end there, either. If you were lucky enough to secure a Halo-themed Xbox Elite 2 controller, Microsoft has packed in a special code that lets you add a little controller charm to your guns inside &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. It’s perfect for the early &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782786/halo-infinite-multiplayer-available-download-launch"&gt;launch of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; that took place earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nu9OLS"&gt;The miniature controller will attach to your weapons in the multiplayer version of the game, bouncing around when you’re busy throwing grenades and using your melee button. If you purchase the NERF versions of the MA40 or the Bulldog SG, they also include a little charm for your weapons, and even unique weapon skins in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V7ABAg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is just the cutest thing ever!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you buy the Halo Elite Controller, you also get a little controller charm for your weapons in the game!   &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Halo?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Halo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HaloInfinite?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#HaloInfinite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HaloInfiniteMP?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#HaloInfiniteMP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Xbox&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xboxse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@XboxSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/pnuO7WsdvT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/pnuO7WsdvT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Wael (@WaelHasno) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WaelHasno/status/1460947943813431303?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xc3Dxn"&gt;Microsoft loves to hide little Xbox-related Easter eggs everywhere. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448039/20-year-old-xbox-easter-egg-developer-revealed"&gt;20-year-old Xbox Easter egg&lt;/a&gt; was discovered earlier this year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433228/microsoft-xbox-series-x-hidden-video-phil-spencer-july-2020"&gt;Xbox chief Phil Spencer hid the Xbox Series S on his shelf&lt;/a&gt; before it was officially announced. Master Chief is also hidden inside the Xbox One X riding a scorpion, or part of the fan on the Xbox Series X. We’ll keep our eyes peeled for any other 20th anniversary Xbox Easter eggs that Microsoft has hidden away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox November update brings quick controller swaps, lower latency, and accessibility tags</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D8G2dWpjhHxJwTHcByUlzkZb5rc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158728/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="takJ87"&gt;Microsoft is rolling out a new &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/11/17/november-xbox-update/?ocid=Updates_soc_omc_xbo__Photo_lrn_11.17.2"&gt;November update for Xbox&lt;/a&gt; consoles that will make it a lot easier to swap your controller between a console and a PC or laptop. Instead of having to trawl through menus to change connections, the update lets you switch between previously connected devices by simply double tapping the controller’s pair button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z6hIz2"&gt;This feature has been available on modern Xbox Series X / S controller since their launch last year, but the new firmware update brings this option to Xbox One controllers with Bluetooth support and the Xbox Elite 2 controller. However, you’ll only be able to use it to quickly switch between a Bluetooth device and an Xbox console, and not two Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Uxlb1C"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;did you know Xbox controllers have a secret button feature? It lets you quickly switch between paired devices. Here’s how it works &lt;a href="https://t.co/fjJC9Dv0kA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fjJC9Dv0kA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1438826681725247496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NShbj3"&gt;The new firmware update also adds Dynamic Latency Input (DLI) to older Xbox One controllers, which reduces the input latency on controllers connected to Xbox Series X / S consoles to make gameplay more responsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohJQfa"&gt;Alongside the controller changes, Microsoft is also improving audio output settings on all Xbox consoles. New audio options include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735389/xbox-mutes-speakers-plug-in-headphones-skip-ahead-ring"&gt;ability to mute speaker audio when a headset is attached&lt;/a&gt;, useful if you’re playing at night and don’t want to disturb family members or neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mW8sAkHDHZYGnSNrrgFHGDcjV1U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024099/02_AudioSettings_Additional_Options.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Xbox audio options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PIPrPJ"&gt;New color filters are also part of this update for Xbox Series X / S consoles, which will help players with color blindness or color vision deficiency. Microsoft is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22702660/xbox-games-accessibility-feature-tags"&gt;allowing game developers to tag their titles&lt;/a&gt; with up to 20 accessibility features which will make it a lot easier for people with disabilities to find which games support these visual, audio, and input tweaks. More than 325 games are supported right now, and filtering options will be available in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ks1OKE"&gt;This latest dashboard update also includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787396/xbox-cloud-gaming-consoles-series-x-s-one"&gt;Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) integration&lt;/a&gt;, allowing older Xbox One consoles to play Xbox Series X games. The feature requires a Game Pass Ultimate subscription and will be available in 25 regions, and a subset of Xbox owners can start trying it out with the November update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3XPmG"&gt;Microsoft’s new November Xbox update is available right now for all Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boost Mobile’s new plan offers $100 for one year of service, includes 1GB of data per month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Boost Mobile’s new logo under Dish Network." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ib4DIJ1lCUZOjL7VpQ4haHd5r7Y=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158723/boost_dish.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boost Mobile is introducing a full year of service for just $100.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Dish&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zZjSX9"&gt;Now that Boost Mobile will be on the AT&amp;amp;T network, after its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583799/dish-network-att-mvno-t-mobile-5g-4g"&gt;owner Dish signed with AT&amp;amp;T back in July 2021&lt;/a&gt;, the MVNO is changing things up with its service plans. Today, Boost is announcing the first of many so-called “Carrier Crusher” plans it will be rolling out this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D5Y8xP"&gt;If you’re paying for your unlimited cellular service plan but have been living on a Wi-Fi connection since 2020, Boost Mobile is offering an interesting proposition for new and existing customers. You can get 12 months of unlimited talk and text, plus 1GB of 4G or 5G data per month, for just $100 for the year (plus tax) from Boost. This works out to $8.33 per month (again plus tax), considerably less than even the lowest cost prepaid plans. Both current and new customers who have an active Boost phone, and can commit to using Boost for a year, will be eligible for these new plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Et0yd8"&gt;Once you reach your data cap, your speed will be throttled, but you can always &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.boostmobile.com%2Fsupport%2Ffaq%2Fplans-services%2Fdata-pack-add-on.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F22788074%2Fboost-mobile-new-plan-1gb-data-100-4g-5g-carrier" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy more Data Packs&lt;/a&gt; in the amount you need. They can be added to your plan on a as-needed basis (you have 30 days to use it up), or automatically added to your plan every month until you cancel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="7JgOfr"&gt;$5 for 1GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SKXpJR"&gt;$10 for 2GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JuPra0"&gt;$15 for 5GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7st1u0"&gt;$30 for 10GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="tTzXzd"&gt;Alternatively, if 1GB of data is not enough, and you don’t want to bother paying per gigabyte of data, then a $240 per year plan ($20 per month plus tax) with unlimited talk and text and 15GB of data per month, is also available. This way, you won’t have to worry about getting throttled anytime you watch a few 4K movie trailers by accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YMtVd"&gt;For those who prefer to pay for your cellular service each month rather than make one lump sum payment once a year, Boost Mobile is introducing two additional new plans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="D3Njvr"&gt;$25 per month with unlimited talk and text, with 5GB of high-speed data per month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TpEqxG"&gt;$15 per month with unlimited talk and text, with 2GB of high-speed data per month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="UxzVXv"&gt;With the ongoing pandemic and many of us still working from home, you might be using more Wi-Fi than cellular data these days. If you’re within Boost Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T’s coverage area and not currently tied to a plan, you might want to look at pre-paid services that might better suit your current mobile needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTvkyC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ed Sheeran is coming to Pokémon Go to serenade Squirtles in sunglasses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p9Bc2ghE8jLUqcgqzEiIFvQmJls=/0x0:767x511/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158624/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ed Sheeran (right) serenades a Squirtle with sunglasses (left). &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Niantic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9obwJE"&gt;Niantic has released details of Pokémon Go’s upcoming Ed Sheeran collaboration in a &lt;a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/ed-sheeran-collab/?hl=en"&gt;new blog post&lt;/a&gt;, a little over a day after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785361/ed-sheeran-pokemon-go-crossover"&gt;first teasing&lt;/a&gt; the surprising crossover. The event kicks off on November 22nd at 2pm ET (11am PT), and will run for a little over a week until November 30th. The main feature appears to be a performance of some sort from Ed Sheeran, though what form this will take (a pre-recorded video? A virtual Ed avatar?) isn’t at all clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vBdnO"&gt;Niantic says the performance will include songs from Sheeran’s new album, titled =&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(yes, the name of the album is the equals sign), and that it’ll be accessible from the News section of the Pokémon Go app. Right now, this section is just a news feed of announcements and blog posts, so this doesn’t offer much of a hint about what shape the performance will take. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EliX97"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;That’s not all! In celebration of Ed Sheeran’s favorite Pokémon, Squirtle wearing sunglasses will be returning to Pokémon GO!  &lt;br&gt;We might be “Thinking Out Loud,” but the thought of catching this Squirtle again feels so “Perfect” that it’s giving us “Shivers.”&lt;/p&gt;— Pokémon GO (@PokemonGoApp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonGoApp/status/1461201258522583048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BQmYtO"&gt;With the event, Niantic appears to be attempting to follow in the footsteps of Epic Games, which has offered a number of in-game music events in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; over the years from artists like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;Ariana Grande&lt;/a&gt;. Epic has cited pop culture events like these as a key part of its attempt to expand &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;from a game into a metaverse-style social space, and Niantic hasn’t been shy about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22768925/niantic-lightship-developer-platform-john-hanke-pokemon-go"&gt;its own metaverse plans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSsgoK"&gt;As well as Sheeran’s performance, the event will also include more typical Pokémon Go gameplay elements. A number of water-type pokémon and the special sunglasses-wearing variety of Squirtle will be available to catch (“Ed always chooses the water-type pokémon as his first partner” you see), and there’ll also be a branded &lt;em&gt;= &lt;/em&gt;sweatshirts you can equip your avatar with. Over the course of the week, Ed Sheeran’s song “Overpass Graffiti” will also play during the night in-game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGo0gY"&gt;In-game events like these are big business for Niantic. &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-19-pokemon-go-levelled-up-its-storytelling-at-a-memorable-go-fest"&gt;This year’s Go Fest event&lt;/a&gt;, which took place in July, reportedly brought in around $21 million in revenue over the course of two days, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower, &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-21-pokemon-go-fest-2021-earned-gbp15m-in-two-days"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mario Kart Live’s 2.0 update makes multiplayer much easier and cheaper</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r9tsMw6wUWqfpMP4c2mniP_e7Dg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158491/Switch_MarioKartLiveHomeCircuit_screen_12.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nq1snK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit&lt;/em&gt;, Nintendo’s AR-powered Mario Kart game that lets you race physical toy karts around your home with the Nintendo Switch, just got updated to version 2.0 with a much-requested feature: splitscreen local multiplayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpFAIr"&gt;Previously, multiplayer &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit&lt;/em&gt; was a complex and costly endeavor. You’d need two karts — the base game only comes with one — as well as two Nintendo Switch consoles, and the action would play out on each player’s Switch screen. With the 2.0 update, you can hook up one Switch to a TV so both players can stay on the couch as they race their karts around the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="abG3kC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit is a simple racer that can feel like magic","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21514758/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-review-nintendo-switch"},{"title":"Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit’s multiplayer is expensive and chaotic","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21526662/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-multiplayer-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KI565H"&gt;There’s also a new Relay Race mode that allows for multiplayer games with just a single kart. Between two and four players can select their own characters, with control switching between them after every lap. In addition, the update is adding a new tournament called the Luigi Cup along with three new courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBp1sw"&gt;Nintendo is further lowering the barrier to entry by including &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit&lt;/em&gt; in its Black Friday sales. The game —including one kart — will cost $59.99 from November 21st, which saves you $40 off the MSRP. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="MzUM61"&gt;I have some terrible news: Disney has confirmed you’ll never get to try the “real” retractable lightsaber &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/9/22375720/disney-parks-lightsaber-retractable-blade-rumor-patent"&gt;whose very existence&lt;/a&gt;, subsequent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418959/disney-real-lightsaber-reveal-video-star-wars-galactic-starcruiser-hotel"&gt;reveal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22380919/disney-real-lightsaber-patent-star-wars-ben-ridout"&gt;patented design&lt;/a&gt; made us giddy back in April and May of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4XGSMx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Disney’s ‘real’ lightsaber patent actually works","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22380919/disney-real-lightsaber-patent-star-wars-ben-ridout"},{"title":"Disney reveals its ‘real’ lightsaber, and it looks extremely cool","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418959/disney-real-lightsaber-reveal-video-star-wars-galactic-starcruiser-hotel"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OzgZ8b"&gt;While the incredible disappearing lightsaber replica will indeed feature at Disney’s new Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser hotel — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609764/disney-star-wars-hotel-galactic-starcruiser-pricing-2022-interactive-immersive"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Westworld-&lt;/em&gt;esque experience for the very wealthy where stays cost upwards of $4,800&lt;/a&gt; and yet is already sold out &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/disneys-ridiculous-star-wars-hotel-is-sold-out-for-4-mo-1848035173"&gt;for its first four months&lt;/a&gt; — GameSpot and &lt;em&gt;IGN &lt;/em&gt;report that Disney won’t be letting you touch that lightsaber for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QkM56m"&gt;“Unfortunately, that lightsaber isn’t for guests to use or purchase. It’s strictly for use by the performers,” &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hotel-galactic-starcruiser-preview"&gt;writes IGN&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WaXOh"&gt;“Trowbridge confirmed in a group interview that guests will never actually use that lightsaber, but that it will be part of the Galactic Starcruiser experience,” &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-playtested-disneys-immersive-star-wars-galactic-starcruiser-hotel-heres-what-we-learned/1100-6498103/"&gt;says &lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSgdmA"&gt;Damn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hBjAq"&gt;Your multi-thousand dollar ticket does include some lightsaber training, though. GameSpot continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NsAJa9"&gt;Instead, you will be given what feels like a high-end, yet slimmed-down lightsaber replica with a fixed blade. You power it up and all of the sounds and vibrations you would expect are there, but if you walk in expecting to get to play with the new one Disney has developed, let this serve as a warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TLAu0S"&gt;Here’s IGN again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZBkmuu"&gt;The session involves using the provided lightsabers to deflect laser beams fired by a wall-mounted training remote. It starts off slow, letting you get a feel for how it works, and then it ramps up to Jedi level where you’re Forced to block attacks without even seeing the lasers. The lightsaber used in this activity feels about on par with a Force FX lightsaber, though it is a tad shorter, but it’s only meant to be used for lightsaber training and won’t be available for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HCVaRu"&gt;Here’s some concept art for that and other experiences Disney wants to offer in the Galactic Starcruiser — it doesn’t appear to have let &lt;em&gt;IGN, GameSpot&lt;/em&gt; or any other outlets photograph the actual experience, though you can read more about at those source links.&lt;/p&gt;
