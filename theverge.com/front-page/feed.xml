    <title>Samsung announces the A12 and A02S, two new entry-level phones for 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WFMBQuW6lVMM-ijuRRaJ8ZeWRJE=/11x50:817x587/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67941602/galaxya12_galaxya02s.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gIhUJB"&gt;Samsung on Tuesday announced the Galaxy A12 and A02S, two new entry-level phones set to launch next year in Europe. Both offer a lower barrier to entry for anyone looking for a modern Android smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nr4Egu"&gt;The A12 is designed to be a successor to the A11, sporting a 6.8-inch HD+ display with a notch for the 8-megapixel front-facing camera, an octa-core processor, a fingerprint sensor on the side, and a 5,000mAh battery. Photos are covered by a quad-array of cameras on the back, including a 48-megapixel main sensor, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, and a pair of 2-megapixel sensors to help out with macro and depth shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cmHxdu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9670224"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ToGBaR"&gt;The A02S is slightly less impressive: it has the same display and battery but with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage (though you can expand storage with its microSD slot). The phone is also saddled with different cameras: a 13-megapixel main sensor and the same pair of 2-megapixel sensors as the A12. Costs are also cut with ports, the A02S features an older Micro USB port as opposed to the USB-C port you may have wanted. The A02S is also missing a fingerprint sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hkjf79"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9670233"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PCHH0j"&gt;Samsung recently rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21212085/samsung-galaxy-a01-a11-a21-a51-a71-5g-mid-range-android-price-release-date"&gt;5G versions of its Galaxy A line&lt;/a&gt; of phones; we covered the Galaxy A51 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"&gt;more fully in our review&lt;/a&gt;. We thought that model favored screen quality over cameras and speed — expect potentially greater trade-offs with the A12 and A02S’s even lower prices. Regardless, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/worlds-third-best-selling-galaxy-smartphone-q3-2020/"&gt;Samsung’s budget options are its bestselling phones&lt;/a&gt;, so even minor improvements to specs seem like a good move for anyone in Europe looking for their first smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ay7Izv"&gt;The A12 is currently set to start at €179 ($212) for 32GB of storage and 3GB of RAM, with 128GB and 6GB of RAM on the high end for €199 ($236). The A02S starts at €150 ($178). The A12 will be available in January 2021 and the A02S in February 2021. There are currently no announced plans for a North American release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube suspends One America News for one week after it promoted a fake COVID-19 cure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xE6W_owH8YECJHpskmTQSICxfNw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67939894/wjoel_1777_180403_youtube_005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5qMvtV"&gt;YouTube has temporarily suspended right-wing outlet One America News Network (OANN) for promoting a false COVID-19 cure. OANN’s channel will stay online, but it will be prevented from uploading new videos for a week, and it’s been removed from YouTube’s advertising partner program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3o6GzO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/youtube-temporarily-suspends-demonetizes-oann-420e8ea9-66c1-4eab-9754-6e3b708483c9.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=organic&amp;amp;utm_content=1100"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; reported the news today&lt;/a&gt;, and YouTube spokesperson Ivy Choi confirmed it to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “After careful review, we removed a video from &lt;em&gt;OANN&lt;/em&gt; and issued a strike on the channel for violating our COVID-19 misinformation policy, which prohibits content claiming there’s a guaranteed cure,” Choi says. “Additionally, due to repeated violations of our COVID-19 misinformation policy and other channel monetization policies, we’ve suspended the channel from the YouTube Partner Program and as a result, its monetization on YouTube.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOAIhv"&gt;OANN has repeatedly tested YouTube’s policies, most recently around the US presidential election. YouTube took a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551790/youtube-election-misinformation-oann-live-stream-mail-in-vote-count-ballot"&gt;more hands-off approach&lt;/a&gt; to election misinformation than Facebook and Twitter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21550180/youtube-oann-video-election-trump-misinformation-voting-final-results-facebook-twitter"&gt;allowing a video&lt;/a&gt; where OANN falsely claimed President Donald Trump won the election. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562910/youtube-2020-election-trump-misinformation-fake-news-recommendations"&gt;defended its policy&lt;/a&gt; by emphasizing that it promotes “authoritative news organizations,” a category that YouTube says doesn’t include OANN. After its COVID-19 video, OANN will have to reapply for the partner program if it wants to monetize videos, and it will receive one strike under YouTube’s three-strikes policy for termination.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These are the best Black Friday streaming deals for Hulu, Spotify, Sling TV, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6pLUS8Wza3qKSGbFT80mzPOXby0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67933948/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uL0o36"&gt;Ready to re-up your Netflix subscription for another year? What about Spotify or Apple Music? Black Friday and Cyber Monday can be the perfect opportunity to lock in your streaming services for less money than they’d usually cost. Whether you’re after music, live TV streaming, or something more niche, there are a host of offers and limited-time deals to choose between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwkXb7"&gt;Once you’re done scoping out the streaming offers, check out our big roundup of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;the best Black Friday deals you can get right now&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5Nikh8"&gt;Get Hulu for $1.99 per month for the next year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d1nRWO"&gt;Hulu’s hard-to-resist Black Friday promotion is back for another year. It lets you subscribe to the standard (with ads) plan for &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;offerid=763711.10&amp;amp;type=3&amp;amp;subid=0&amp;amp;u1=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1.99 monthly instead of the regular $5.99 rate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZbH8H"&gt;Here’s the fine print: this offer is only available for new and returning customers — and to qualify for the latter, you must have canceled the service at least three months ago. Anyone who took advantage of last year’s $1.99 promo is ineligible this time around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x5MtSU"&gt;The Hulu deal will be available starting at 12AM PT / 3AM ET on Thursday and will run until 11:59PM PT on Monday night (2:59AM ET Tuesday). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MDWN3z"&gt;Sign up for Sling TV, and get your second month for free&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pvOiY5"&gt;New customers subscribing to live TV streaming service Sling TV &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sling.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will get their second month of Sling Blue or Sling Orange (a $30 value) for free&lt;/a&gt; as part of the company’s holiday offer. If you prepay for two months of service, you can &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sling.com/pm/tivo?AID=12103878" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get a free TiVo Stream 4K&lt;/a&gt;, which is a perfectly decent Android TV streaming dongle. Sling TV is also offering a three-day free trial of the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ksXZ9A"&gt;Get four months of Tidal for 99 cents or $1.99 for Hi-Fi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XsAeBH"&gt;Tidal’s annual subscription discount is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftidal.com%2Fblackfriday&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21603508%2Fblack-friday-streaming-deals-tv-movies-subscription-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available starting on November 24th&lt;/a&gt; through December 2nd. Those who take advantage can get four months of standard Tidal Premium for 99 cents; you can also opt for the lossless HiFi service tier for $1.99. Tidal says this is a value of $39.96 (Premium) and $79.96 (HiFi). After the promotional period, you’ll be on the hook for the standard going rate of $9.99 / month for Tidal Premium or $19.99 / month for HiFi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IGhGjE"&gt;YouTube TV now comes with a free Chromecast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eseZWM"&gt;If you’ve never tried YouTube’s streaming TV service, you can now &lt;a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/"&gt;get a free Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt; (a value of $49.99) once you sign up. The rising cost of YouTube TV is frustrating, but at least now you get a complimentary gadget with your first $64.99 bill. To get the free Chromecast, you’ve got to subscribe by December 31st, and the deal is limited to one per household. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="obuFBw"&gt;Get three free months of Spotify — if you’re a new subscriber&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zqxNBk"&gt;Spotify is running a holiday promo where you can &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.com/purchase/offer/holiday-2020-trial-3m"&gt;get three months of the leading subscription music service&lt;/a&gt; before having to fork over the regular $9.99 each month. Unfortunately, the deal is aimed at those who haven’t tried Spotify Premium before. That’s a bummer for existing customers, but if you’ve managed to stay a holdout all this time, now you can get the ad-free experience at no charge for the next three months. However, you’re also eligible for the offer if you canceled your Spotify Premium subscription prior to October 17th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Failed electric jet startup Zunum sues Boeing for fraud and misuse of trade secrets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QYNw94IBBqkZwuZrDnDWavRWaYM=/2x0:2399x1598/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67933934/Download_ZA10_in_clouds_cropped.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="24UPGS"&gt;In 2017, Zunum Aero was flying high. The Kirkland, Washington-based aviation startup came out of stealth mode with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/5/15177374/zunum-aero-electric-jet-startup-stealth-boeing-jetblue"&gt;bold plans to build a fleet of 12-seat hybrid electric jets&lt;/a&gt; for short, regional hops between cities. The company, which had received millions of dollars from the venture arms of Boeing and JetBlue, said it would be ready to fly by 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHY4hp"&gt;Not long after, those dreams came crashing down to earth. In 2018, Zunum ran out of cash, forcing it to lay off nearly all of its employees and vacate its headquarters. It struggled to raise additional funds that it needed to get its plans back in motion. And now, Zunum is striking back at one of its former investors. The company filed a lawsuit in Washington Superior Court this week accusing aerospace giant Boeing of fraud, technology theft, breach of contract, and misappropriation of trade secrets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9m3Fc"&gt;Zunum said that Boeing “colluded with other key aerospace manufacturers and funders” to sabotage its efforts to raise additional cash and tried to poach Zunum’s engineers during the process. The startup claims that Boeing saw its superior technology and potential to disrupt air travel as a threat to its own dominance in the aviation world and sought to undermine it. Using its due diligence as an investor as subtext, Zunum said Boeing gained access to its business plan and proprietary technology, and “exploited” Zunum for its own benefit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fK4KMr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Boeing stole Zunum’s technology and intentionally hobbled the upstart entrant”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fh7BK6"&gt;“Boeing saw an innovative venture, with a dramatically improved path to the future, and presented itself as interested in investing and partnering with Zunum,” the company claims in court filings. “But instead, Boeing stole Zunum’s technology and intentionally hobbled the upstart entrant in order to maintain its dominant position in commercial aviation by stifling competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXKwLT"&gt;It’s rare that a startup would sue one of its investors after failing to deliver on its promises. But Zunum said its setbacks weren’t because of bad technology or a faulty business plan. Rather, the company claims it was sabotaged by Boeing, which misused its position as an investor to pillage its talent and patents before eventually scuttling the company’s ability to continue to raise money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JNtFt"&gt;Zunum also names HorizonX, Boeing’s venture capital arm, and French engine supplier Safran as co-defendants. The company is seeking compensatory and punitive damages. A spokesperson for Boeing did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZ2495"&gt;Founded by former executives from Microsoft and Google, Zunum proposed building several models of hybrid aircraft, one with a 700-mile range by 2022, and another with a 1,000-mile range by 2030. These jets wouldn’t be suitable for flights that are long-haul, cross-country, or transoceanic, but rather short, regional trips under 1,000 miles. (Think LA to San Francisco or New York to Boston.) The idea was to offer cheap flights that are low-emission and low hassle to take off and land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHHMaY"&gt;“Jet engines are efficient when they’re big and up high,” Matt Knapp, Zunum’s chief technology officer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/5/16429398/zunum-aero-hybrid-electric-jet-2022"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. “If you fly a jet engine a short distance, it’s not very efficient. So you’ve got this damned-if-you-do-damned-if-you-don’t [approach] to flying a small airplane a short distance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jr01BK"&gt;That same year, Boeing’s HorizonX and Jet Blue’s venture division agreed to invest in Zunum, instantly bolstering its credibility. The companies sank a combined combined $6.2 million into the company in Series A funding, according to a Zunum fundraising pitch obtained by the &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2019/04/10/boeing-backed-zunum-aero-outlines-aspirations-for.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Puget Sound Business Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Washington state’s Clean Energy Fund kicked in an additional $800,000 in a research-and-development grant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pi6kvg"&gt;“Zunum is reinvigorating the regional market with a solution that’s both innovative and realistic,” Logan Jones, managing director at Boeing’s HorizonX, said in a statement at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dMo7CJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;in 2018, the company was forced to cease all operations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6c98Je"&gt;But things quickly went south, and in 2018, the company was forced to cease all operations. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2019/07/02/zunum-aero-nears-zero-founders-struggle-to-raise-money-after-laying-off-staff/?sh=5c622d482d73"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the founders laid off almost all of their 70-person staff and gave up two of their facilities, one in Indianapolis and the other in Bothell, Washington. Creditors seized equipment from and changed the locks at another facility in Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDk997"&gt;Zunum puts the blame on Boeing. The Chicago-based company repeatedly reneged on promises for additional funds and dissuaded other investors from putting money in, the lawsuit alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qsq6wp"&gt;“Boeing also kept Zunum beholden to it for much-needed capital and market validation, stringing Zunum along with the prospects of an anchor investment and providing leadership on further fundraising,” the lawsuit says. “Although Zunum also sought investments elsewhere, Boeing actively interfered with and undermined those business relationships while inducing Zunum to continue its reliance on Boeing by holding out the prospect of a strategic partnership or merger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJNGHT"&gt;Zunum also accuses Boeing of copying its plans and technology that it disclosed to Boeing as an investor. After obtaining the proprietary information, the lawsuit alleges, Boeing approached Safran, the French engine supplier, with plans to build a hybrid-electric plane based on Zunum’s designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euwN05"&gt;“Zunum discovered that Boeing was secretly developing a replica prototype of Zunum’s flagship aircraft design, staffed by the very same engineers and other professionals whom Boeing had assigned to conduct extensive due diligence on Zunum, under non-disclosure and non-use obligations,” the lawsuit reads. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals on noise-canceling headphones</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WmMrK3"&gt;Noise-canceling headphones are an important piece of tech if you enjoy having zero distractions or outside noise while you jam to funky tunes or listen to podcasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wC95lA"&gt;While not as convenient as popping earbuds into your ears, noise-canceling headphones do a better job of erasing sound distractions when stacked up against popular wireless earbuds like Apple’s AirPods Pro or Jabra’s 75t. But if you prefer earbuds over headphones, we have rounded up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611428/black-friday-earbuds-deals-wireless-cyber-monday"&gt;the best wireless earbud deals this Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVgfg2"&gt;We are picking out all of the best deals going on right now on several brands that offer noise-canceling headphones. If you want more deals for other tech categories, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;check out our best Black Friday deals post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fteLe0"&gt;Sony headphones deals&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 headphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P7tphe"&gt;While these may look familiar compared to the incredible 1000XM3s, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; headphones are some of the best on the market if you want a pair of over-the-ear headphones with noise-canceling capabilities. When stacked up against their predecessors, the 1000XM4s allow users the ability to pair two devices via Bluetooth simultaneously, much like the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tCs52"&gt;These headphones released in August, but they have been frequently discounted the last several months. And right now, you can get them for $278 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863FR3S9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724683617488500643" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lowest price these headphones are right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dhOHDa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9523565"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v9UbPz"&gt;If $278 is still too much for you, but you prefer Sony as your choice of headphones, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632441/sony-xb900n-headphones-noise-canceling-bass-price"&gt;Sony’s midrange noise-canceling headphones, the XB900N&lt;/a&gt;, at a discounted price. Normally, these headphones cost $248, but you can get them for $123 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RM8WQ8G?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724683993194110376" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yzr73i"&gt;Although these headphones are not as effective at active noise cancellation as the WH-1000XM4s, the XB900N will get things a little quieter if you need peace and quiet but want to keep your budget under $200. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jwFja1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9631953"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a9Rxcr"&gt;Sony’s WH-CH710 have also seen a price cut this Black Friday. Normally, these headphones cost $200, but you can get them for just $88 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085RQYX5Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724686850701604233" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The WH-CH710s offer AI noise cancellation, which, according to Sony, means the product “constantly analyzes environmental ambient sound components, and automatically selects the most effective noise-canceling mode for users’ surroundings.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kOClzM"&gt;If you need a reliable pair of noise-canceling headphones that you will primarily use for videoconferencing or phone calls, you can’t go wrong with the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 by Bose. These headphones also allow you to connect two devices simultaneously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QORd7d"&gt;You can get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Bose’s excellent Noise Cancelling 700 Headphones&lt;/a&gt; for $299 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Cancelling-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B07X5F81JS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724689194665262520" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1475153-REG/bose_794297_0100_headphones_700_noise_cancelling.html&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__e_21333453__r_theverge.com/authors__t_w__d_#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://deals.dell.com/en-us/mpp/productdetail/6b3f&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__e_21333453__r_theverge.com/authors__t_w__d_#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X5hfVx"&gt;If you want a good pair of noise-canceling headphones and you have a higher budget to work with, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;Sennheiser’s third-generation Momentum Wireless headphones&lt;/a&gt; are one of the best options. These headphones come with adequate noise cancellation along with bass-rich and detailed sound output. These headphones are also very good for extended use even if you wear glasses, so you do not need to worry about discomfort if you want to wear these while listening to long podcast episodes or while on a long train ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5aRBA9"&gt;Normally $400, you can get these headphones for $350 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Momentum-Cancelling-Headphones-Functionality/dp/B07VW98ZKG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724685151178098131" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mqJ6ml"&gt;Speaking of headphones that offer amazing sound quality and noise cancellation, Shure’s Aonic 50 headphones are another alternative that come in an interesting build. These headphones use Bluetooth 5 Wireless technology, have a 20-hour battery life, and support advanced codecs like LDAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzgzcK"&gt;Normally, the Aonic 50s would set you back $400, but you can get them for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Cancelling-Headphones-Studio-Quality-Technology/dp/B084S1CYKF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$299 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724686048381502302" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix removes Chappelle’s Show after Dave Chappelle asked it to</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mark Twain Prize at Kennedy Center" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MAQr9qLycq9UtMcpxToO6XUCSgI=/0x0:4712x3141/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67928932/1178636491.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ibLLV0"&gt;Comedian Dave Chappelle has succeeded in getting his old sketch comedy program &lt;em&gt;Chappelle’s Show &lt;/em&gt;removed from Netflix, after requesting the streaming service do so because the original rights holder, ViacomCBS, began licensing it without his permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JZOiE"&gt;The news means Netflix subscribers will no longer have access to the show’s three seasons that originally aired on Comedy Central. Netflix first made the show available on November 1st, and it’s no longer discoverable on the platform as of Tuesday afternoon. Netflix declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qScYA8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They agreed that they would take it off their platform just so I could feel better.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hOCpWj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chappelle’s Show &lt;/em&gt;aired on ViacomCBS-owned Comedy Central from 2003 to 2006 and the program has aired in the years since on other cable networks through syndication deals. It has also been available through Comedy Central’s own website and app, but more recently on streaming services including CBS All Access (also a ViacomCBS property), HBO Max, and Netflix. Chappelle has a controversial relationship to the program, having quit it abruptly during production of its third season, and he does not own the rights to it despite it carrying his name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DH9tv1"&gt;Netflix, however, also has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/21/13702948/dave-chappelle-netflix-standup-comedy-specials"&gt;lucrative contract with Chappelle&lt;/a&gt; for comedy specials and other   programming that started back in 2016 and is worth tens of millions of dollars. &lt;em&gt;The Wrap &lt;/em&gt;reports that Chappelle’s ongoing relationship with Netflix is why the streaming service decided to honor his request and pull his old show from the platform. The show is still available on CBS All Access and HBO Max as of Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RYnMC"&gt;Chappelle initially mentioned his frustration with recent licensing deals around &lt;em&gt;Chappelle’s Show &lt;/em&gt;in his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un_VvR_WqNs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live &lt;/em&gt;monologue earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. The comedian then posted an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CH-rR9znT3g/?utm_source=ig_embed"&gt;18-minute clip of unreleased standup&lt;/a&gt;, titled “Unforgiven,” to his Instagram account earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="33FyW4"&gt;In the clip, Chappelle references his request to Netflix, saying, “I called them and I told them that this makes me feel bad. And you want to know what they did? They agreed that they would take it off their platform just so I could feel better.” He also called the decision to stream &lt;em&gt;Chappelle’s Show &lt;/em&gt;“fencing stolen goods.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0U4DQX"&gt;Here’s the segment of the Instagram video starting at roughly the 11-minute mark that pertains to the Netflix request: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rLOc56"&gt;People think I made a lot of money from ‘Chappelle’s Show. When I left that show, I never got paid. They didn’t have to pay me because I signed the contract. But is that right? I found out that these people were streaming my work and they never had to ask me or they never have to tell me. Perfectly legal because I signed the contract. But is that right? I didn’t think so either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRrnFF"&gt;That’s why I like working for Netflix. I like working for Netflix because when all those bad things happened to me, that company didn’t even exist. And when I found out they were streaming ‘Chappelle’s Show&lt;em&gt;,’&lt;/em&gt; I was furious. How could they not know? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwFJLk"&gt;So you know what I did? I called them and I told them that this makes me feel bad. And you want to know what they did? They agreed that they would take it off their platform just so I could feel better. That’s why I fuck with Netflix. Because they paid me my money, they do what they say they’re going to do, and they went above and beyond what you could expect from a businessman. They did something just because they thought that I might think that they were wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mq3DTR"&gt;And I do — I think if you are fucking streaming that show you’re fencing stolen goods. They stole that from me. They just took it. And I’m not here trying to tell you guys that I believe Comedy Central gave me a raw deal just because I’m black. I believe they gave me a raw deal because this fucking industry is a monster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Black Ops Cold War is a great game trapped inside Call of Duty</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f9N5IDxXYPQrug1VHQ-bXg9msAs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67926265/BOCW_PC_Trailer_TOUT.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a7qX8Q"&gt;At 17 years old, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;is not quite America’s longest war, but it’s close. When I went into the single-player story mode for &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I knew what to expect: a pleasing shooting gallery with familiar narrative twists (there’s always a nuke about to go off) and re-shuffled scenery (this time the walls are plastered in vintage Doritos ads). But the real twist is that I left feeling frustrated about the game it could have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pb30w8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War &lt;/em&gt;is the kernel of a thrilling and intimate spy story that’s tragically strapped on the front of a runaway train. The game begins in a neon-drenched bar in Amsterdam on New Year’s Eve 1980, where your CIA partner beckons you to quickly follow him away from the party. From the beginning, &lt;em&gt;Cold War &lt;/em&gt;is gorgeous to look at, and I was surprised so much care had been given to decorating a room that you’re expected to rush out of. Moments later, after walking a couple blocks in a beautifully rendered winter town, I found myself in a roaring gunfight with a small army of heavily armed bad guys who improbably pop out of every corner like aliens in an &lt;em&gt;Area 51 &lt;/em&gt;cabinet. That’s entirely normal stuff for &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, but as the scene faded, I wished I was back in the bar talking to New Year’s revelers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iv9fPQ"&gt;A while later in the story, after digital Ronald Reagan orders you to blow up the world to stop a nuclear weapon, you’re tasked with infiltrating Soviet-controlled East Germany. Early in the mission, as I stood on a roof with my CIA comrade and took photos of people passing through the border checkpoint, I noticed myself purposefully trying to stay on the roof as long as possible even when there was nothing left to do there. Instead of hunting down my target, I wanted to go down to the street and play a high-fidelity version of &lt;em&gt;Papers, Please&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Eventually, I advanced through the mission, expecting another bombastic firefight. But there was none. Sure, I later had to take out more than a few guards, but for a &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;level, the visit to East Germany was practically meditative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXnuva"&gt;I later met a contact in a warmly lit bar and felt excited to speak to her. Unfortunately, the conversation was cut short after a couple of dialogue choices, as two Stasi officers quickly entered and forced me to escape prematurely. A short while later, I had to sneak into the apartment of an adversary and tiptoe around his wife and child to plant a device in a briefcase. As soon as I was discovered and knocked out, I knew &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;alternate universe — the one where I imagined it was a compelling spy game based on suspense and relationships — had ended. Cue the explosions and gunfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wplfit"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cold War &lt;/em&gt;is filled with these loud tonal contrasts. A mission where you play as a mole inside of KGB headquarters felt like it was ripped straight out of &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and it’s really fun. Your American friends need to steal the identities of double agents from a bunker under the building, and the only way to get them access is to kill or frame a Russian general who holds the key. (A good sign: I replayed the level several times to try all of the different ways you could ruin the general’s day.) But almost as soon as I got my CIA contacts into the building, the shooting began. What was the point of all that delightful subterfuge if only to blow the place up and kill everyone inside? Just when I thought I was out, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;pulled me back in and set me on its narrow path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3IP9g"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;teaching is the illusion of free will, &lt;em&gt;Cold War&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;penultimate chapter is the series’s gospel. The revelation unfolds when the game starts literally telling you what to do. As your character revisits the past, a narrator starts giving verbal commands about which paths through the jungle you should choose. Though your choices are ultimately futile, you don’t have to follow orders and, in fact, the game expects you not to. (I laughed out loud when I found out there are achievements both for resisting orders and following them unquestioningly.) I’m sure the developers didn’t intend for me to linger disobediently on that roof in East Germany, but here they explicitly asked me to reject the cues they spent two decades teaching me. And so, I resisted playing &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;for as long as I could, until my character was yanked back into reality, where the story ended in a final shooting gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewagk0"&gt;Again, there’s not exactly anything &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; with that. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;is more sport than story, and that’s not a defect. I grew up playing shooters and to me they feel just like playing baseball or hockey, to the extent that the payoff is achieving flow: when your body and its task become one in the same. You don’t need a great story for that connection to feel good, and playing &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;is like doing it in the major leagues. The narrative is just scenery, and to complain that it doesn’t match the gameplay or resemble poetry misses the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KshQZ5"&gt;But as the credits rolled, I felt a strange sense of loss. &lt;em&gt;Cold War &lt;/em&gt;is a perfectly fine dose of video game pulp, but at times it teases something vastly richer. With four huge game modes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21612873/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-review-zombies-warzone-multiplayer-impressions"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; is so big and complicated now&lt;/a&gt; that it would be easy to break off the story mode and try something different without sacrificing the core game’s sales potential. Instead of chasing another nuclear threat, I would have liked if the entirety of &lt;em&gt;Cold War&lt;/em&gt; was set in East Germany and given more time to explore the treachery and horror of the Stasi. And while I admit that expecting the series to jettison its kinetic jingoism is a contrived fantasy, I can’t help but feel like there are double agents inside Treyarch, desperately trying to send a message past the guards at Activision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QH9MKl"&gt;I’ve always wondered what might have happened if the real Ronald Reagan had spent all that nuclear missile defense money on something more meaningful. Now I’m wondering what might have happened if the fake Ronald Reagan did, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity’s designers talk about following up Breath of the Wild</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rN33aOiYOr49DfjlKN3q3bgWxlg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67916620/Switch_HyruleWarriorsAgeofCalamity_screenshot_03_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wo1s54"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572264/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review-nintendo-switch-zelda-botw-prequel"&gt;which launched on the Nintendo Switch last week&lt;/a&gt;, is a curious thing: a blockbuster release that’s both a sequel &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a prequel. It’s a follow-up to  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/17/6251849/hyrule-warriors"&gt;2014’s &lt;em&gt;Hyrule Warriors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a game that mashed together the fantastical realm of Hyrule with the action-heavy gameplay of the &lt;em&gt;Dynasty Warriors&lt;/em&gt; series. But it’s also a game that takes place before the pivotal events of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, making it a key piece of lore for diehard fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JJCaB"&gt;To find out a bit more about how the game came about, and how developer Koei Tecmo partnered with the &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; team at Nintendo, I was able to ask a few questions of &lt;em&gt;Age of Calamity&lt;/em&gt; producer Yosuke Hayashi and director Ryouta Matsushita. Here’s what they had to say about making the game and why weapon durability didn’t make a comeback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmjpIS"&gt; (And if you’re looking for more &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; insight, be sure to check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/11/14881076/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-interview"&gt;our lengthy chat with the directors of &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmTMZj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did the idea of making a prequel to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; come about? What made this timeline / setting a good fit for the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyrule Warriors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-type of experience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vnbX1x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hayashi:&lt;/strong&gt; Nintendo explicitly suggested the idea of using &lt;em&gt;Dynasty Warriors&lt;/em&gt; gameplay to show the Great Calamity in &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;. We also enjoyed &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; as fans, and thought we’d be able to make a really fun game with the idea. So I don’t remember really worrying much while we were solidifying each specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4KU2s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Were there specific ways you wanted to build off of or change things from the original &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyrule Warriors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3dLTsH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hayashi:&lt;/strong&gt; Something we realized with the previous game was that we wanted to create a story that revolved more tightly around the Link, Zelda, and Ganon trio. While I’d like everyone to experience the rest of the details for themselves, I think that we were even successful in achieving that in the first &lt;em&gt;Hyrule Warriors&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7ZlYTS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We needed the complete cooperation of the ‘Zelda’ team at Nintendo.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F7HwVk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since this game is so tightly connected with&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Zelda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; lore, did it require more direct collaboration with Nintendo? How would you describe the way Koei Tecmo and Nintendo work together on a project like this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PAMAz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hayashi:&lt;/strong&gt; Previously, &lt;em&gt;Hyrule Warriors&lt;/em&gt; was a spinoff game where Koei Tecmo had a certain amount of freedom with development. However, since we’re depicting the previously unknown environment of 100 years prior to &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; here, we needed the complete cooperation of the &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; team at Nintendo. While building up the project, we got input on a variety of areas from the &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; team, including visuals, scenario, sound, and the direction of gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCIXKe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matsushita:&lt;/strong&gt; To ensure that the game inherited the worldview and tone of &lt;em&gt;BOTW&lt;/em&gt;, we asked for in-depth reviews starting from the initial design stage. Creating a world that brings together everything in &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild,&lt;/em&gt; at a high level, is impossible without this collaborative effort. For the gameplay system, we aimed to respect the gameplay of Koei Tecmo’s &lt;em&gt;Warriors&lt;/em&gt; series while incorporating new gameplay elements that lived up to the expectations of the &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; team.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FARqOadoRMFkejmzx5Olqn_aERY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22080483/Switch_HyruleWarriorsAgeofCalamity_screenshot_07_copy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mifSK3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s likely a lot of players will be coming to this game after playing &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOTW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and not necessarily &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyrule Warriors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Is this something you took into consideration? Is the game designed in a way to ease in new players?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGlVKG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hayashi:&lt;/strong&gt; Our policy in developing &lt;em&gt;Age of Calamity &lt;/em&gt;was to create a game that would be fun for &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; players. So I think that it’s fun even if you haven’t played the previous &lt;em&gt;Hyrule Warriors&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vLXyR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matsushita:&lt;/strong&gt; It is an action game where you fight enemies, but you can also use creative methods such as items or the environment, in addition to fighting techniques, to defeat powerful enemies. I think we’ve created these elements so that they have hints that are easily recognizable to fans of the &lt;em&gt;Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MM8RGL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aside from the setting, were there any elements specific from &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOTW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; that you wanted to incorporate in this game? Were there key things from &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOTW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; that just didn’t work in a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynasty Warriors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; experience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdWywE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hayashi:&lt;/strong&gt; One system that obviously doesn’t work well is weapon durability. While this was very effective in &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Age of Calamity&lt;/em&gt; assumes that you’re strengthening your weapons as you play, so we’re using a system unique to this game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cuaOO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matsushita:&lt;/strong&gt; Using limited resources, such as weapons or food, was an element unique to Link in &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;. Since this game is about a war that encompasses all of Hyrule, we needed ways to depict a different aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black Ops Cold War is four Call of Duty games all competing to take over your hard drive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GwMb961MnreQZ17Rhas59cyRKMs=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67910046/cod_black_ops_cold_war_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Activision&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The new Call of Duty is a bloated mess, even when the individual parts succeed&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="amdNMx"&gt;It’s impossible to discuss the new &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; game without mentioning its size. The sheer magnitude of the software, in total gigabytes, has become perhaps the most defining and talked-about aspect of the long-running shooter series since the reboot of &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare &lt;/em&gt;last fall and the launch of Activision’s &lt;em&gt;Warzone &lt;/em&gt;battle royale a few months later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSLjuO"&gt;And it’s only growing larger. On PS5, the latest installment, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt; coupled with &lt;em&gt;Warzone, &lt;/em&gt;exceeds 250GB. That is nearly half the available free space of the built-in solid-state drive of Sony’s new console. But that huge file size is more than just a joke: it’s indicative of the state of modern &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPxcZh"&gt;The overall bloat of the experience has become both the franchise’s central selling point and its biggest flaw. In a bid to create the do-everything shooter that can compete with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and other live service games, Activision and the many studios it tasks with making a new &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; every year have created something so monstrously all-encompassing that it is difficult to both literally and figuratively fit other games into your rotation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WZiiVf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Call of Duty’ is so large it’s hard to fit anything else into your rotation or on your hard drive&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zqU1Wh"&gt;That may be the point. I have friends who aren’t playing &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War &lt;/em&gt;and who gave up on &lt;em&gt;Warzone &lt;/em&gt;months ago because they were tired of making space for the software and no longer feel like making storage management part of their daily gaming routine. But for those who buy in and sacrifice huge chunks of their hard drive and free time in the process, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War &lt;/em&gt;has a little something for everyone — enough, at least, to keep you hooked well into next year when the next installment arrives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gfpAcx"&gt;We’re past complaining about the cyclical nature of &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;. It comes out every year, almost always breaks sales records, and keeps chugging along, unphased by real-world conflict and aimed squarely at the type of person who likes to shoot guns fast but also occasionally in slow motion. It is a video game that knows what kind of experience it is. That, in turn, makes it a product with healthy consumer demand that will likely never go away so long as the human brain keeps responding predictably to the feedback loops it creates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mU4gS8"&gt;But last year, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;became something altogether different. Activision yanked its most successful, formulaic moneymaker into the future by tying it together with a fully baked battle royale mode, &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, now one of the most popular on the market. The company promised an ever-evolving &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;that could remain a stable fixture by adding what it needed and subtracting what it didn’t as the annual cycle progresses. Now, a year later, we have &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;, the first fully realized version of this vision of a live service &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdzSeT"&gt;Understandably, it’s kind of a mess as a holistic product, but much more impressive in its individual parts. The challenge now is deciding whether this modern structure for &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;— in which it wants to be the only multiplayer game you play, like &lt;em&gt;Destiny &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; — is worth the time, effort, and storage space it will cost you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7SFoBaxYXUa6lS2wtMQh60ymIg0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22072267/cod_black_ops_cold_war_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Activision&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="RHjPSd"&gt;The campaign isn’t much of a departure from the high-octane, set piece-driven experiences we’ve seen before. But it does have enough narrative surprises and experimental sequences to satisfy the &lt;em&gt;Black Ops &lt;/em&gt;series’s history of twisty, conspiratorial storytelling. Unlike last year’s &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare &lt;/em&gt;reboot, which borrowed some of the muted and murky undertones of wartime thrillers like &lt;em&gt;Zero Dark Thirty&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War &lt;/em&gt;tries its best to blend together different pop culture elements all loosely reminiscent of a 1980s-inspired action movie. The result is about as close to a James Bond-style campaign as &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;will ever get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zz9xNc"&gt;The campaign is most enjoyable when you’re not shooting — though those moments are brief. The standout mission is a stealthy &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt;-style “choose your adventure” escapade as a KGB double agent in which you don’t fire a gun until the final sequence. It does a great job showing you the kind of game &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;could be if its designers felt compelled to commit to one theme instead of just experimenting too briefly with many. I was also disappointed to see truly savvy cryptographic puzzle-solving restricted to just a pair of optional side missions, though I applaud the developers for giving players some agency to choose which missions they played and in what order.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9rDMmJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Multiplayer is the tightest and most impressive it’s ever felt, thanks to next-gen consoles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XliXIw"&gt;But as is the case with every &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, the campaign is there to satisfy a small fraction of the game’s intended audience. Many players might never touch it. The multiplayer is what draws in millions of people each and every year, and it seems the draw, increasingly, is not in actually enjoying it so much as in debating whether it’s worthy of scorn or praise. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;fans love to have strong opinions on whether any new iteration of the series’s multiplayer can re-create the addictive allure of &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare 2&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Black Ops 1&lt;/em&gt; or whatever iteration of the game stands tall in their minds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0qcwE"&gt;I will say, as someone who has played almost every &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;entry&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for more than half of my life, that &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War &lt;/em&gt;is perhaps the tightest and most impressive the game has ever felt. Part of the reason is because it’s been optimized for the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S. I’ve greatly enjoyed the game’s multiplayer on 120Hz mode on Sony’s new console, where it feels like the smoothest and most immersive shooter I’ve ever played. I also found that the game’s more stripped-down class customization and weapon modding to be easier to digest and more accessible, meaning I’m spending less time obsessing about which attachments to use and more time just experimenting with various loadouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXs876"&gt;There is, however, quite a bit to complain about. The multiplayer contains under 30 weapons and none feel particularly interesting or all that different from one another. There are only eight multiplayer maps, some of which I hated for how convoluted and camping-friendly they are and dreaded playing on every time they’d inevitably end up in the rotation. The game also has a throwback feel to it, where your character moves slower and the time-to-kill is longer than last year’s entry. That gives it the feel of an older, stodgier shooter — much more like the &lt;em&gt;Black Ops &lt;/em&gt;games of old. The fast-reflex &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare &lt;/em&gt;camp might find that too jarring to enjoy, and I’m only now getting used to it tens of hours later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tYY2XD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It feels like all of the creative energy went into the fantastic new zombies mode&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7sZbky"&gt;Surprisingly, it feels like all of the best new ideas and creative energy in &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War &lt;/em&gt;went into the zombies mode. And that makes sense: zombies is now more of a signature pillar of the &lt;em&gt;Black Ops &lt;/em&gt;brand than any of the campaign characters or storylines. Zombies could very well be a whole game on its own, and one might wonder why Activision doesn’t spin it out already — except that it gives millions of players a strong reason (perhaps the only reason for some people) to buy a new&lt;em&gt; Black Ops &lt;/em&gt;entry when it comes out every two to three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNrpV5"&gt;The mode is fast-paced, fun, and filled with secrets to uncover and puzzles to solve. It’s perhaps the most refined modern take on the horde mode formula from a major studio I can think of. It’s likely to be the reason why so many players still keep this game installed well into next year and possibly even beyond the inevitable release of the next title in the series, which presumably will not contain a zombies mode. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="vXLzjg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; is never a commercial failure — it always sells — but that doesn’t mean the developers who make it can’t fail in their attempts to make the best experience possible. My main issue with it now is not that any one of these new modes is subpar, but that they all feel like the disjointed limbs of a Frankenstein video game. &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War &lt;/em&gt;is overflowing with content and covers seven distinct console hardware types, a PC version, and a battle royale, all of it taking up more storage space than pretty much any other game in history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqwxAv"&gt;This is supposed to be freeing — play the new &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; on any platform with any of your friends and only the game types you enjoy. And to a large extent, the cross-gen and cross-platform functions work well and Activision should be applauded for the sheer complexity of the technical feat it pulled off weaving this all together. (A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552437/call-of-duty-warzone-player-progression-weapons-cosmetics-shared-unified-black-ops-cold-war"&gt;planned &lt;em&gt;Warzone &lt;/em&gt;update next month&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled to merge the battle royale with &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;, which may not go as smoothly.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="u2YqGj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Black Ops Cold War’ makes ‘Call of Duty’ feel like a Frankenstein video game&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9U5RnG"&gt;But when I boot up &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;, I find that I’m not so much drawn to any one part of the game as I am overwhelmed by the whole package. It feels like four games all competing for my attention, not to mention all of the extra legwork figuring out who I’m playing with on which platform and whether I have the right mode installed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oFcTKO"&gt;I’ve lost count of the many times my friends and I have agreed to try something new in both last year’s &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare &lt;/em&gt;and this latest one, only for one of us to admit they didn’t have the right multiplayer pack installed or they only downloaded the zombies mode and deleted &lt;em&gt;Warzone &lt;/em&gt;to save space. So we give up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="md9wfs"&gt;It’s an exhausting affair unless you’re willing to make &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;your one and only shooter. And &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War &lt;/em&gt;just isn’t good enough to justify what it asks for in return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GcyO8i"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQDLgj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
