    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wdXD1k"&gt;Since the dawn of time (around five or six months ago), people all over the world (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cr1nge_qu33n/status/1426357270082899969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1426357270082899969%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ange_lops/status/1396335977761808385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1396335977761808385%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sknight500/status/1394666513500622851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1394666513500622851%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;the United States&lt;/a&gt;) have been puzzling over a very important question: why doesn’t the COVID-19 vaccine card fit in a wallet? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KkQUxA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I tried to figure out why the vaccine cards are too big for your wallet &lt;a href="https://t.co/3JZ7LzZ6KR"&gt;https://t.co/3JZ7LzZ6KR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Amanda Mull (@amandamull) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amandamull/status/1425092823553134593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H8lFIF"&gt;The card is too big for a standard wallet card slot and, as Amanda Mull pointed out in &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/08/covid-19-vaccine-cards-why-so-big/619707/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, still small enough that it’d be easy to lose. It’s like a reverse Goldilocks: just wrong. A handful of people speculated to Mull in August that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention might not have thought about the size of the cards all that much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNsdz3"&gt;But it turns out they were at least &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; about the size of the card, &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21074134-vaccine-card-final-release"&gt;according to emails&lt;/a&gt; obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request and sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by a reader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGbRF8"&gt;Email correspondence within the CDC shows that the agency was working on a vaccination card at the start of August 2020, months before the first COVID-19 vaccines would be authorized for use. On August 6, a staffer sent an email with a draft vaccination card attached. “Keep in mind that the card needs to be small enough to fit in a wallet,” the staffer wrote in an email. “Most cards I see are around 4” x 3.5” and are usually folded.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pX3U5CMepZgg8P6S59HkkKrVHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894528/Screen_Shot_2021_10_01_at_3.13.13_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RkPnwL"&gt;It’s important to note here that wallet-sized things are much smaller than 4” x 3.5”. Wallet-sized photos are 2.5 inches by 3.5 inches, and standard credit cards are 2.125 inches by 3.37 inches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtcxRZ"&gt;But the key bit of info comes at the end of the sentence: “usually folded.” If the cards were 4 inches wide and 3.5 inches tall, folding them in half would make them 2 inches wide and 3.5 inches tall. That’s pretty close to the size of a standard credit card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Threse"&gt;And that wasn’t even the final dimensions of the cards. The following Saturday, Operation Warp Speed, which headed the vaccine development process, asked the CDC to send over the vaccine card by the end of the day Monday. The CDC team went into overdrive to finalize the design by the deadline, and the same staffer sent over a print-ready version on Tuesday morning. In that email, the dimensions of the card were set at 4.25 inches by 3.5 inches. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C8ZkHKp-AyDTwaQanZibuG3amkk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894447/Screen_Shot_2021_10_01_at_1.31.03_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="apNhgZ"&gt;Ok, time for more math. Folding&lt;em&gt; that &lt;/em&gt;sized card in half would put the card at 2.125 inches by 3.5 inches, just about the same size as a credit card. Excellent! Perfect size to meet the goal of fitting in a wallet. All set, good to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7ZxBu"&gt;But unfortunately, this story doesn’t have a happy ending. Even if the CDC designed the card to be that size, it’s not the size the cards ended up at. My vaccine card measures in at 4 inches by 3 inches — too big to fit into a wallet. There’s nothing on the card to suggest folding it. And besides, folding it in half puts at 2 inches by 3 inches (so much math today). That’s smaller than a credit card and just small enough that it would slide down into a card slot and be difficult to dig out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRuMEs"&gt;What happened in between these emails, which promised a card that would fit in wallets, and the vaccination campaign, which gave everyone cards that don’t easily fit in wallets? That’s where things get fuzzy, and it’s a mystery I still haven’t solved. The CDC didn’t respond to a request for comment. Maybe someone just clicked the wrong button on a printer at some point. But maybe there’s a lesson here: the road to hell is paved with good intentions — and infuriatingly shaped cardstock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPLAnt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QKmxP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord is ending its Stage Discovery tool but says Stage Channels are doing well</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lnnEIoLmx9Rm2YGKXh78ky_Jmks=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69938784/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Discord is ending its Stage Discovery | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AkjTIA"&gt;Discord said Friday it’s going to sunset its Stage Discovery tool on October 4th, less than six months after it launched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uMAq3s"&gt;Rolled out in June, Stage Discovery was designed to help users find its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;social audio rooms called Stage Channels&lt;/a&gt;. It used machine learning to curate a list of channels a user might be interested in joining. Stage Channels have been a hit, Discord says, but it’s been keeping an eye on Stage Discovery to evaluate whether it’s meeting its goal of helping people find community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0FNpB"&gt;“In listening to our communities and admins directly, we’ve learned that we still have work to do in regards to server onboarding and moderation,”&lt;a href="https://discord.com/blog/whats-next-for-communities-at-discord"&gt; Discord said in a release&lt;/a&gt; announcing the decision. “We’re going to take some time to rethink the Discovery aspect of Stages and how we can better build a place that best connects people to the communities most relevant to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6kyl3T"&gt;Discord says it will continue to invest in Stage Channels, adding several new features, including the ability to schedule events, extra screening capability, and improvements to its moderation tools “to help moderators on Discord keep things orderly and foster healthy engagement within their communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2FgsP"&gt;More than a million Discord communities have run a Stage as of October 1st, the company added, using it to host ask-me-anything discussions, open-mic competitions, art conferences, and “discussions over what sorts of foods pineapple should be on” (editor note: definitely not pizza). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uOLX8w"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UC0Cebf0xv8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Twitch is testing a feature that lets viewers pay to promote streamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ysGpOLKOkck7plJr4dZnAnrWGbk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69938775/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QNKOsx"&gt;Days after announcing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700937/twitch-safety-tools-verification-phone-hate-raids"&gt;new safety tools&lt;/a&gt; designed to protect streamers against hate raids, Twitch is experimenting with a new feature that will allow users to pay money to promote a stream. Rumors have been circulating on social media that the new feature is in the works, and a Twitch spokesperson has now confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it is testing the feature with a small number of streamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8ymVA"&gt;“We are launching an experiment to a small number of growing channels that enables their communities to purchase promotions to highly visible parts of Twitch,” a Twitch spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1tv41"&gt;Twitch went into detail about the new paid boost feature during its Patch Notes program. Check out the relevant portion of the program &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1163663809?t=00h42m08s"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHVaA4"&gt;The promotion works like this. For 10 minutes during a stream, a notification will pop up informing viewers that the boost option is available. Participating viewers can then pay for a number of recommendations. In the demonstration, there are two purchase tiers: 1,000 recommendations for .99 cents and 3,000 recommendations for $2.97. These boost purchase windows occur randomly for participating streamers and can happen as often as every time a streamer goes live. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uK3ucdi-ucaQLJdUv58P3ivP1Hs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894461/ezgif.com_gif_maker.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Twitch&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A demo of the paid per boost feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TqRuWM"&gt;This boost feature is essentially a paid version of the “Boost this stream” community challenge program &lt;a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/boost-this-stream?language=en_US"&gt;already in place&lt;/a&gt;. In Boost this stream, viewers can pool channel points — essentially points a viewer earns by participating in stream activities like following and successive viewing — and use them to promote a creator throughout the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLCp61"&gt;Jacob Rosok, Twitch product manager, said this new paid program was born out of feedback from the community. He said streamers wanted more opportunities to have their stream promoted and wanted that promotion to be more impactful. That meaningfulness, then, seems to be Twitch simply giving “impact” a monetary value. The more money spent on recommendations, the more front-page exposure a streamer gets, the more “impact” a boosted stream has for its creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBhEfC"&gt;At any given time, there are hundreds of thousands of creators streaming on Twitch, all vying for more eyeballs on their stream. But the algorithm that suggests streamers to viewers tends to favor the top streamers — behemoths like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442733/amouranth-twitch-ads-suspended-indefinitely"&gt;Amouranth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/auronplay"&gt;auronplay&lt;/a&gt;, who have millions of subscribers and average tens of thousands of viewers at a time. So for smaller streamers, one of their only hopes of discoverability depends on landing on the coveted front page of Twitch. This new boost program essentially allows streamers to bypass the luck of the algorithm draw and directly pay for their time on top. Getting on the front page means more viewers. More viewers means more revenue from ads, more revenue from subscriptions, and greater appeal when applying for sponsorships that also leads to, you guessed it, more revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBVBsg"&gt;And at every level, Twitch is taking a portion of that revenue. Twitch currently takes 50 percent of a streamer’s subscription revenue (less if you’re a special partner). When a viewer buys bits to cheer with, Twitch takes a portion of that purchase, too. Twitch also takes a slice of ad revenue, but none of the money spent boosting a stream is split with the creator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vREiBu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We think that paying to help a creator grow their community will be worthwhile to their supporters.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JQd3Ch"&gt;It feels a bit like a gacha game. Sure, you can play for free (ala participate in community challenges), but to get a chance at the good stuff (ala rapid community growth), you gotta pay. And like any gacha game, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/10/30/21540515/genshin-impact-gacha-f2p-mtash-tectone-wish-giving-up-youtube-mihoyo-ps4-whales"&gt;there will inevitably be whales&lt;/a&gt;. Twitch knows that community members want to see their streamers succeed. What better way, then, to ensure that success than by simply paying for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opgFTf"&gt;“We think that paying to help a creator grow their community will be worthwhile to their supporters,” Rosok says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejQnSz"&gt;There are other ways for viewers to support streamers and for streamers to find larger audiences. Tags allow viewers to search for streams that meet their specific criteria. Raids (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22633874/how-to-stop-a-hate-raid-twitch-safety-tools"&gt;of the non-hate variety&lt;/a&gt;) share one creator’s viewers with another. Promotions during Black History Month, Pride Month, and Global Accessibility Awareness Day also push smaller streamers to the top of the front page. Rosok also emphasizes that the free community challenge version of stream boosting will remain available for people who don’t want to spend money but still want to support their streamers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhkov8"&gt;Right now, the program is only targeted to small streamers with less than 250 followers and will last the next four weeks. Twitch will share data with creators so they can measure the impact a boost has on their traffic. Twitch also stresses that this is just an experiment and that there is no guarantee the program will roll out sitewide or even in its current form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6VBX7"&gt;“This experiment is not final and will continue to evolve based on community feedback,” a Twitch spokesperson says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvdhfj"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cy9sCY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTiKiM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>South Korean ISP SK Broadband sues Netflix for millions in bandwidth usage fees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZEA7Gra71GKkSXIWGbO0pbCo7HI=/882x0:4257x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69938416/Screen_Shot_2021_10_01_at_10.16.24_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="epr73W"&gt;South Korean internet service provider SK Broadband is suing Netflix to pay for the increased network costs and bandwidth usage the streaming service’s content has drawn in South Korea, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/skorea-broadband-firm-sues-netflix-after-traffic-surge-squid-game-2021-10-01/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. The company cites &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;D.P.&lt;/em&gt;, two popular Korean Netflix dramas, as part of the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3riSO"&gt;SK Broadband’s demand for payment isn’t unfounded. A South Korean court sided with the ISP in June, &lt;a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210628000798"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Korea Herald&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting Netflix was responsible for the demands its content puts on SK. Counter to Netflix’s request that it not be charged — since customers are the ones streaming, and they already pay for it — the court said the company has “the obligation of paying the price for the services to SK Broadband.” SK estimates the cost at 27.2 billion won (around $23 million) for 2020 alone, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaAFf5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has contacted Netflix for comment. The company &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/south-korean-isp-sk-broadband-counterclaims-against-netflix-for-bandwidth-usage-fees/"&gt;shared the following statement with &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in response to SK’s demands: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UG2zOj"&gt;We will review the claim that SK Broadband has filed against us. In the meantime, we continue to seek open dialogue and explore ways of working with SK Broadband in order to ensure a seamless streaming experience for our shared customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="S47Lou"&gt;Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-korea-the-story-so-far"&gt;success in Korea&lt;/a&gt; and in popularizing Korean film and television in the US has come to a head in the last year, and particularly in the last week, thanks to the surprise hit &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/squid-game-may-end-up-netflix-biggest-show-ever-netflix-co-ceo-says/"&gt;Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said Monday&lt;/a&gt; that it was on track to be the company’s most popular show yet, and within four days of its release, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/global/asia/squid-game-director-hwang-dong-hyuk-korean-series-global-success-1235073355/"&gt;it was already number one in the US&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix’s top ten chart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZzdLT"&gt;Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/23/5439566/the-wall-street-journal-confirms-multiyear-traffic-deal-between"&gt;strikes deals with service providers like Comcast in the US&lt;/a&gt; so that its connection gets priority treatment and, ultimately, better video quality. However, Netflix is in a different position now than when it agreed to pay Comcast — it already lost in court, and SK Telecom isn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/24/5541916/netflix-deal-with-the-devil-why-reed-hastings-violated-his-principles"&gt;incentivized to make a deal while regulators consider a pending Big Cable merger&lt;/a&gt; — so even though it has more weight to throw around, it’s also already provided an example of why it might pay in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmYzTo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Disclaimer: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, which owns &lt;/em&gt;The Verge.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TeGSBJ"&gt;Google has stopped working on its Plex service, which aimed to let you do your banking through the Google Pay app. The service was supposed to let users sign up for checking or savings accounts offered by a variety of traditional banks that the user would then manage through the app. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-is-scrapping-its-plan-to-offer-bank-accounts-to-users-11633104001"&gt;According to a report by the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Google canceled the project due to a series of missed deadlines and because an executive who pushed for the project left the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAR0FW"&gt;Plex wasn’t meant to put Google in direct competition with banks, according to reports &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/next-in-googles-quest-for-consumer-dominancebanking-11573644601"&gt;that came out before&lt;/a&gt; the company revealed the program and information from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21571806/google-pay-relaunch-money-payments-finances-deals-offers-banking-plex"&gt;its official announcement&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, Google planned to partner with a variety of financial institutions that would have provided accounts without monthly or overdraft fees and without minimum balances. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22533664/digit-automatic-savings-online-bank-ai-subscription"&gt;some other online banks&lt;/a&gt;, Google’s app would have let users set things like savings targets and automatic transfers. Some of the banks Google planned to partner with included Citi and SEFCU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ezoASu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google is shifting focus to help enable banks, rather than join them in offering services&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HO7OkI"&gt;In an email on Friday, Google told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it still believes there’s demand from consumers for simpler ways to pay for things while shopping both online and in-person but that it will now be focusing on “delivering digital enablement for banks and other financial services providers rather than us serving as the provider of these services.” It’s possible, then, that we’ll see some of Plex’s features show up in Google Pay at some point — or we may just see Google continue work on its redesigned Google Pay app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hANii"&gt;While there are still other options for people who want online banks with decent apps, it’s unfortunate to see that Google’s canceled this project. Not only would it have provided more traditional banks incentive to step up their mobile app game, but a big feature like this getting axed before its release doesn’t help with Google’s reputation for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning"&gt;not sticking with products it launches&lt;/a&gt;. Still, it’s better that Google put a halt to it now if it wasn’t going to be committed to it — as a former &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/31/11340330/google-wallet-debit-card-shut-down"&gt;Google Wallet debit card&lt;/a&gt; holder, I can say from personal experience that having to deal with changing how you pay for things is way more of a pain than, say, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/10/4/20899198/google-reader-gravestone-crypt-rip-picasa-buzz-wave-orkut"&gt;having to find a new way to read RSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge shelves Nikola’s $2 billion patent lawsuit against Tesla</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NJL0E-t0SlHB36QRbcH2LjSVu4U=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69938266/nikola_anheuser_busch.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Nikola Motor Company&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4dxDW9"&gt;A federal judge has administratively closed a $2 billion patent infringement lawsuit hydrogen trucking startup Nikola filed against Tesla in 2018, essentially pulling it off the Northern District Court of California’s docket because the two companies stopped responding. Nikola has until October 6th to show cause as to why the case should continue. Otherwise, the case of Nikola v. Tesla will be dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDeNAH"&gt;Nikola “has dropped the ball, and this 2018 action is languishing without explanation or apparent good cause,” Judge James Donato wrote in an order to show cause published this week. “Consequently, the case is administratively closed. Nikola is ordered to show cause in writing by October 6, 2021, why the case should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HX11m1"&gt;Both Nikola and Tesla have apparently stopped responding to some of the court’s requests over the last few months. “On July 7, 2021, the Court asked the parties to schedule new tutorial and claim construction hearing dates. Neither side responded,” Donato wrote. “On September 2, 2021, the Court vacated further proceedings on claim construction for the lack of a response. As of the date of this order, neither party has advised the Court of proposed new hearing dates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Efy3Ms"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nikola “has dropped the ball”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="70NrAD"&gt;Michael Rhodes, an attorney representing Tesla, declined to comment. A spokesperson for Nikola declined to comment. Attorneys for Nikola did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lInzTQ"&gt;Nikola, for its part, has had to spend a lot of time and money putting out some major fires in the past year. Shortly after going public in 2020 — and almost immediately after General Motors announced a plan to take a minority stake in the startup — Nikola’s founder and former CEO Trevor Milton was accused of fraud by short-selling research firm Hindenburg Research. Among the allegations, Milton was accused of faking a video of Nikola’s truck driving down a road (it was really rolling down a hill).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEksKZ"&gt;Nikola performed its own investigation into the allegations (and found many of them to be true), but so did the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. Milton was &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-nikola-corporation-ceo-trevor-milton-charged-securities-fraud-scheme"&gt;indicted on multiple counts of fraud in July&lt;/a&gt;. He’s currently in federal custody but has maintained his innocence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Dj28c"&gt;In the original complaint filed in March 2018, Nikola accused Tesla of infringing on patents the startup had filed for its hydrogen-powered big rig. Nikola tried to make the case that Tesla’s own Tesla Semi was using the same wraparound windshield, mid-entry doors, and aerodynamic fuselage, among other details. The startup also alleged that a Tesla recruiter had tried to poach Nikola’s chief engineer, and claimed this was evidence that Tesla was interested in Nikola’s designs. By allegedly stealing the design, Nikola said Tesla was causing “confusion in the market” and that letting the infringement continue would cost the startup more than $2 billion in sales. Tesla said at the time that it was “patently obvious there is no merit” to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vHGxw"&gt;The two companies have spent much of the last three years arguing over which specific patents would make it to trial. (At one point last year, Tesla tried to argue that Nikola stole the design for its own truck &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nikola-electric-truck-tesla-claim-design-stolen/"&gt;from Croatian hypercar company Rimac&lt;/a&gt;.) In April 2020, Tesla lost a bid with the US Patent and Trademark Office to invalidate some of the patents in question. Milton &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21231758/nikola-sba-loan-pandemic-tesla-patent-lawsuit"&gt;tweeted at the time&lt;/a&gt;: “Two billion dollar lawsuit moving forward. We will defend our company’s IP no matter who it is.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAkXDv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s the deal with Seinfeld’s aspect ratio on Netflix?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-tr38QDwEA3fO4Mo3opK4T0YttM=/220x0:2194x1316/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69938051/Screen_Shot_2021_10_01_at_12.53.29_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WUsgWd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seinfeld &lt;/em&gt;has officially moved over to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652391/seinfeld-netflix-october-streaming-wars-friends-the-office#:~:text=Netflix%20will%20dish%20out%20all,on%20October%201st%20%2D%20The%20Verge"&gt;stream on Netflix today&lt;/a&gt;, with a new 4K upgrade that promises to make the show look better than ever. But while Netflix has upgraded the iconic “show about nothing” to even crisper resolution, Netflix is hewing to the same strategy that Hulu and other HD releases of the show have used: a more modern-looking 16:9 aspect, instead of offering the original 4:3 aspect ratio in which the show originally aired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lt5s2k"&gt;The aspect ratio isn’t a new problem for &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; fans, dating back to the original HD remaster that was produced in 2008 for &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-09-03-seinfeld-goes-hd-on-tbs-hd.html"&gt;TBS HD’s syndicated reruns&lt;/a&gt;, which were newly made scans of the original film (hence the ability to add back the wider frames that never made it into the initial broadcast) in widescreen to better suit modern televisions. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WVBTcGro1otdqJbzeq2DiB7t-xU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22893973/AWFNFhJ.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/seinfeld/comments/3a5r2d/comment/csa0uli/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3" target="_blank"&gt;Captainjoe201 / Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qr3AaI"&gt;But that 16:9 cut is the only one that’s been publicly released in HD; the best versions with the original 4:3 aspect ratio format are the DVD releases, meaning that &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; fans have been forced to choose for years between visual quality and aspect ratio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="72i9cY"&gt;When Netflix announced that it would be getting the rights to &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; — and upgrading the series to 4K in the process — there was some hope that the streaming service would go back to the drawing board and create a &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; 4K cut, one that rescanned the film in the highest possible quality. A new 4K scan would also have offered the opportunity to restore the 4:3 aspect ratio, offering the holy grail of &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; cuts: a high-definition version of the show, cropped as it was originally intended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeV25j"&gt;Netflix doesn’t seem to have done that, though — something that admittedly makes some sense, given the fact that such an undertaking would cost a huge amount of money on top of the already exorbitant $500 million-plus that it spent on the rights. But the service also didn’t take the chance here to at least offer the option to choose between the HD 16:9 cut and the lower-resolution 4:3 aspect ratio, which would have been a helpful compromise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1DNmfx"&gt;The 4:3 aspect ratio isn’t just about nostalgia, either. The wider aspect ratio has a real impact on things like the basic blocking of scenes: in exchange for slightly more footage of the left and right sides of the frame, the top and bottom of the frames get cut off, resulting in the occasional cropped foot or top of someone’s head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5g22wG"&gt;And much like &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; (which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20961067/simpsons-aspect-ratio-disney-plus-43-169-streaming-fxx"&gt;suffered a similar aspect ratio issue&lt;/a&gt; when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273476/simpsons-original-4-3-aspect-ratio-disney-plus-stream-how-to"&gt;first hit streaming&lt;/a&gt;), the 16:9 cut of the show also ruins some of the jokes: as one Twitter user pointed out, the pothole from the episode “The Pothole” doesn’t actually appear anymore in the widescreen version thanks to the cropping there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3uQlAi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;to emphasize, the titular pothole from the season 8 episode The Pothole is cropped out on Netflix &lt;a href="https://t.co/gH4l5V8HfS"&gt;https://t.co/gH4l5V8HfS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/6G35eZQymW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6G35eZQymW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brandon (spooky version) (@Thatoneguy64) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Thatoneguy64/status/1443961536079450117?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5Sed6"&gt;The good news is that there is some precedent for a fix: when &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; first started streaming on Disney Plus, it too was missing an option for its original aspect ratio, but the service eventually did add the option to toggle on the 4:3 aspect ratio a few months later. Which means that there’s the (admittedly unlikely) chance that Netflix — or whoever ends up with the&lt;em&gt; Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; rights next — may decide to offer a similar option sometime in the future, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple updates iOS 15 to fix the iPhone 13’s Apple Watch unlock bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have the same camera sensor as last year’s iPhone 12 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wLBCOBtLDUiA0PacI26N6Kb1-JQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69937923/vpavic_210918_4760_0703.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FE8LgD"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 13 lineup just launched last week, but some users ran into a frustrating issue where they couldn’t use their Apple Watch to unlock their new phones while wearing a face mask. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22694679/apple-fix-issue-unlock-apple-watch-feature-iphone-13"&gt;had promised&lt;/a&gt; that a fix was on the way, and it appeared earlier this week &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22699884/iphone-13-apple-watch-unlock-bug-fix-ios-15-beta"&gt;in an iOS 15.1 beta&lt;/a&gt;, but now, the fix is live for everyone as part of the iOS 15.0.1 release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64mbPr"&gt;Apple’s official patch notes also say that the update includes other bug fixes, but the company didn’t specify what those might be. The update clocks in at 553.7MB on my iPhone 12 Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ij7SMRdNePJUekUr58RvZ1-1tL8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894075/IMG_1169.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here are Apple’s iOS 15.0.1 update notes, taken from my iPhone 12 Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5vL8HJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;In April&lt;/a&gt;, Apple added the ability to use your Apple Watch to unlock a Face ID-equipped phone while wearing a mask, and it’s proved to be a handy feature as masks are still recommended in many situations due to the pandemic. With this new software update, it seems that iPhone 13 users who were affected by the bug stopping the feature from working will be able to take advantage of the convenient unlocks once more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why does Blink still exist?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S1utZfRA0JziZgj02m8ANJxXE7I=/446x376:1810x1285/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69937882/Blink_Doorbell.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring’s founder Jamie Siminoff announced a new video doorbell this week, from another company.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Blink&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="18lTbj"&gt;In December 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/12/22/16810516/amazon-blink-acquisition-smart-camera-doorbell-company"&gt;Amazon spent $90 million to acquire Blink&lt;/a&gt;, a Kickstarter-funded startup that developed a super energy-efficient chip to power its battery-operated smart home security cameras. In January 2018, Blink announced its first video doorbell. The next month, Amazon dropped a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17059664/amazon-ring-acquisition-smart-home-security-cloud-cam"&gt;cool billion on Ring&lt;/a&gt;, a smart home security camera company known for essentially inventing the video doorbell. The writing was on the wall for Blink. It seemed &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-m-a-chips/exclusive-amazon-paid-90-million-for-camera-makers-chip-technology-sources-idUSKBN1FW0BI"&gt;apparent to industry analysts&lt;/a&gt; that it had been snapped up for its innovative tech, which surely would be pumped into the bigger, badder Ring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20zGXK"&gt;Fast forward three years, and Ring’s founder, Jamie Siminoff, walks out onstage at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692147/amazon-devices-event-echo-ring-biggest-announcements"&gt;Amazon’s latest hardware bonanza event&lt;/a&gt; and announces Blink’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698612/amazon-blink-video-doorbell-outdoor-camera-floodlight-solar-panel"&gt;first-ever video doorbell&lt;/a&gt;. Ring has seven video doorbell cameras of its own you can buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uq3LoH"&gt;Huh? Hang on. Why does Blink still even exist? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZH8qX"&gt;That’s a question I’ve pondered over the last few years, as each company released new products that replicate what the other has. Ring has close to a dozen versions of indoor and outdoor security cameras (in addition to doorbells). Blink had one, now it has four, plus a doorbell. And, as of this week, both have floodlight and solar-powered camera options. These products are all designed to do the same thing: let you view live or recorded footage of action in and around your home. They both use different apps and subscription plans and neither works with the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jll6Mg"&gt;When Blink released its first wired camera, the Blink Mini — a clone of the Amazon Cloud Cam (which Amazon discontinued the month after the Mini launched) — it all began to feel frustratingly redundant. Why take a company founded on innovative battery technology and have them make a product that is the polar opposite and that Amazon already made?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lOwLJsG7grGADiedcZKAgooL1YE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22893873/Blink_Flood_Light_Cam.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Blink&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blink just announced a new accessory for its outdoor camera that turns it into a floodlight camera. Ring has two floodlight cameras. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qA5wau"&gt;The answer seems to be market segmentation; dividing your target audience into approachable groups in order to sell more things. And it’s something Amazon seems to be embracing wholeheartedly as it continues its pursuit to be all things to all people. As technologist Dave Zatz pointed out on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davezatz/status/1245786507845214209?s=12"&gt;Twitter last year&lt;/a&gt;, “Why do Whole Foods, and Amazon Pantry and Amazon Fresh all exist at the same time? … Ring could be the premium line and Blink standard.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOsfwX"&gt;“We’re trying to give options to our customers that meet their needs,” Mike Harris, the COO of both Blink and Ring (as of February 2020), told me this week. “There’s such a wide variety of people out there, and they have different wants and needs.” They also have different perceptions. The skeptic in me does wonder if all the bad publicity Ring received in the last couple of years around its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22258856/amazon-ring-partners-police-fire-security-privacy-cameras"&gt;police partnerships&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18177305/ring-employees-unencrypted-customer-video-amazon"&gt;privacy issues&lt;/a&gt; perhaps gave Blink a lifeline. Why end &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; smart home brand when &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;smart home brand is slightly tarnished? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T9dNVM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Let’s pause for a moment to compare cameras to diapers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wJwp1S"&gt;But market segmentation is a solid business strategy, especially in a highly competitive market like smart security cameras. Let’s pause for a moment to compare cameras to diapers. There are dozens of diaper brands. When you have your first baby, you buy Pampers because they’re expensive and therefore must be the best. When you’re on child number three, it’s Luvs all the way. They’re around half the price and they still hold the poop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQ33Rd"&gt;Do you stop to consider that both brands are owned by Procter &amp;amp; Gamble? Do you care? Most people probably have no idea that Blink is actually a part of Ring (Harris explained that while Blink is an independent company, it is now inside Jamie Siminoff’s organization). They just choose the camera brand that works for them — or, perhaps more accurately, the one that’s been marketed to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OZ4wV"&gt;To be fair, Ring and Blink do offer different solutions to the same problem and can suit different customers in different ways. Blink is very low cost and seems to be getting cheaper (a $49.99 doorbell is really cheap). It’s also a very basic — and therefore simple — security camera system. It has fewer features than Ring’s cameras (no person detection, for example) and poorer video quality (no HDR imaging and really bad night vision), but its app is easier to use than Ring’s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Km6X0p"&gt;The biggest difference is battery life. You can stick four of Blink’s compact, easy-to-mount, battery-powered cameras around your home with just a drill and a Wi-Fi connection in under 30 minutes, and you won’t have to worry about charging or replacing the batteries for one to two years. That’s about six times less often than you’ll be charging one of Ring’s Stick Up Cams. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6BakA8n2kpgXKlyLE_Ma0H89C00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22893902/Blink_Doorbell_on_White.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Blink&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blink’s new video doorbell runs on batteries, or can be fully wired, and is $10 cheaper than any of Ring’s offerings. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yZhYnl"&gt;Blink’s core technology revolves around a proprietary chip that can keep a camera running on two lithium AA batteries for up to two years — something no other security camera has managed to replicate. Yes, competitors’ cameras — including Ring’s — have better video quality, but that doesn’t do you any good if you don’t remember to take it down and charge it every four to six weeks. (Seriously, who has time for that? It’s my &lt;em&gt;job&lt;/em&gt;, and I don’t have time for that.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VzlGp"&gt;Blink also offers free, local storage — which puts it squarely in competition with another popular budget smart home camera company, Wyze. While Ring has introduced a local storage option with its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692073/ring-alarm-pro-amazon-event-release-date-specs-price-features'"&gt;Ring Alarm Pro&lt;/a&gt;, it’s an expensive upgrade, and you still need to pay a monthly subscription fee to Ring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUVj6z"&gt;Ring and Blink are basically siblings, and Amazon’s approach appears to be to let them fight it out and see what transpires. “The sibling description is a good one,” says Harris. “We do collaborate, we also push each other. Innovation comes from everywhere and this allows unique ideas to come out and serve the different customer bases that each brand speaks to.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8aIfX7"&gt;But this begs the question, why not pool those resources? Why not use their combined talents — the innovation and market reach of Ring and the impressive chip technology of Blink — to make the best cameras they can?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="df1zLS"&gt;Rather than produce the best of the best here, it appears Amazon has opted for conglomeration over consolidation. While that’s not always a bad thing — more choice equals more competition, lower prices, and more innovation — in the smart home in particular it’s frustrating for users. No cross-pollination between these sibling brands means you can’t use a Blink camera up in a tree to check on that wily squirrel and a Ring video doorbell to keep an eye on porch pirates, without having to use two different apps and pay two different subscription fees. Amazon makes you pick your favorite, something no parent should ever do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung seems to have pulled ads from its stock apps, as promised</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dMU5Lz"&gt;A major annoyance of using a Samsung phone is finally getting fixed, as the company seems to have finally pulled ads from some of its stock apps. One &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffer reports that they aren’t seeing ads in the Samsung Weather, Samsung Pay, and Samsung Health apps, though they said they had to force quit and reopen the Health app to remove the ad banner. &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; says that it’s seeing that &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/01/samsung-ads-apps-removed-october/"&gt;ads have been removed as well&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Dntcw"&gt;The move is expected — the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630332/samsung-ads-default-stock-apps-weather-pay-theme-confirmed"&gt;had promised in August&lt;/a&gt; that it would remove ads from apps including Samsung Weather, Samsung Pay, and Samsung Theme “later this year” — but it’s good to see that Samsung is following through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eo3Dgz"&gt;When asked for comment, Samsung didn’t confirm that the removals were effective now, pointing to the same statement about the changes it gave to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in August. However, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/01/samsung-ads-apps-removed-october/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TizenHelp&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that a Samsung employee confirmed the changes to Samsung Health in a forum post.&lt;/p&gt;
