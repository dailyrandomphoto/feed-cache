    <title>The OnePlus 9 Pro supports seriously fast 50W wireless charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dG01GnSbVB8Nosjmfthf-AFsIbo=/59x0:1942x1255/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986172/OP_charge_white.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With a new wireless charger, the OnePlus 9 Pro can charge in either portrait or landscape orientation.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OyFUhs"&gt;It’s not often that the actual spec is better than the rumor, but that’s the case here: the OnePlus 9 Pro supports 50W wireless charging — a little faster than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213390/oneplus-9-pro-45-watt-wireless-charging-reverse"&gt;45W rumor we reported on&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. We’ve been able to test drive this feature ahead of the phone’s official debut on March 23rd, and can confirm: the 9 Pro offers really, really fast wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1udiA"&gt;OnePlus claims that the phone will charge wirelessly (with the new Warp Charge 50 charger) from 1 to 100 percent in 43 minutes, and our own testing confirmed this down to the minute. That’s a big boost over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219525/oneplus-8-wireless-charger-warp-price-specs-release-date"&gt;OnePlus 8 Pro’s 30W wireless charging&lt;/a&gt;, which supplied a 50 percent charge in 30 minutes. The improvements aren’t limited to wireless charging, or the 9 Pro for that matter; the 9 and 9 Pro have 65W wired charging that takes the battery from empty to full in 29 minutes. While the base model OnePlus 9 doesn’t get those fast wireless speeds, it can be used with the new charger at up to 15W. Additionally, both the 9 and 9 Pro support standard Qi wireless charging at 15W.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6u9e5nAlDJmvfBFl4hiaOnAeuOM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22378643/OnePlus_9_Pro_Warp_Charge_50_Wireless_Dock_Dark.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Warp Charge 50 wireless charger now features a detachable cable based on user feedback.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2yw65a"&gt;Fast charging has definitely been OnePlus’ “thing” for a while, and according to Kinder Liu, COO and Head of R&amp;amp;D, it’s been a hit with customers. “Since introducing our first fast-charging technology with the OnePlus 3, we have heard a lot of positive feedback, with many OnePlus users saying it has fundamentally changed the way they charge their devices. They can simply top up for a day’s charge while getting ready in the morning instead of charging overnight.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVgrX0"&gt;The OnePlus 9-series uses a twin-cell battery design first introduced in the 8T, which is part of the 9 Pro’s formula for achieving such fast wireless charging speeds: each cell is charged at 25W simultaneously. OnePlus uses higher voltage power, which produces less heat than using higher amps, and avoids frying the phone by channeling the power through a proprietary charge pump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0CHA9M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The newly-designed charger supports charging in either horizontal or vertical orientation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AyfXvH"&gt;The 9 Pro’s twin-cell battery design also helps mitigate the heat produced by wireless charging, along with some other design tweaks to help with heat dissipation, like thicker copper foil and a larger heatsink. There’s also a key feature on the charger itself that we were grateful for in our testing: a fan. The added fan noise isn’t ideal if the charger is on your nightstand, but for the Pro 9 owner who wants to keep their nighttime charging routine, there’s support for quieter charging during bedtime mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7nG92w"&gt;The newly designed charger also includes two charging coils, making it possible to charge the phone in either horizontal or vertical orientation. That’s useful if you want to multi-task your charging time and watch a video too, which OnePlus says shouldn’t affect charging speed. We couldn’t confirm that in our initial testing, but it’s something we’ll be following up on. As for the cost of the charger, we don’t have pricing yet, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219525/oneplus-8-wireless-charger-warp-price-specs-release-date"&gt;last year’s Warp Charge 30 chargers&lt;/a&gt; didn’t come cheap — the pad version was introduced at $69.95 and the stand version for $79.95.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s Nicole Wetsman on the tools she uses for covering health news</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6EzEryuEIED3b2kjNZqnL3VO5R0=/0x485:750x985/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986194/C87392C3_0D41_4DDC_A8B0_C216575581E1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nicole Wetsman / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JhltPH"&gt;We wouldn’t have tech without science, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; wouldn’t be what it is without its team of science reporters. In this time of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132224/coronavirus-outbreak-genetic-sequencing-viral-dna-treatment-biotechnology"&gt;pandemics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316093/nasas-perseverance-rover-first-drive-mars"&gt;Mars landings&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;climate controversies&lt;/a&gt;, our skilled science team is more important than ever. We talked to Nicole Wetsman, one of our top science and health reporters, to find out how she does her job and what tools she uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zoXLfG"&gt;What is your job at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wqMK6K"&gt;I’ve always been interested in science and health, but I never wanted to work in a lab or be a doctor. Reporting on those subjects gave me a way to learn and work with those ideas. I write about science, health, and health technology for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. For the past year, that’s primarily meant covering COVID-19 — everything from testing technology to the vaccine rollout to public health data systems. I also help our video team script health-related videos and sometimes jump in as an on-camera host. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="lHqMVY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10397157"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rTLEFi"&gt;What is the process you follow when you are writing a science article?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PFQtTn"&gt;I usually start by reading through any research articles on a particular topic and then talking with scientists and other experts who work in that area. That might include people who did a study or built a new health app or people who work in fields that might apply the new innovation. Then, I organize my research, synthesize what I found, and write up a story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ufVQWR"&gt;What hardware tools do you use for your work? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7I5LxL"&gt;I’m embarrassingly low-tech for a reporter at a technology website. For the most part, I just use my &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacbook-pro-13%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22335776%2Fnicole-wetsman-verge-science-macbook-moleskine-zoom" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fairpods%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22335776%2Fnicole-wetsman-verge-science-macbook-moleskine-zoom" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fiphone-12%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22335776%2Fnicole-wetsman-verge-science-macbook-moleskine-zoom" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt; to do everything. Occasionally, I pull out a &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/1014864/1036?sharedid=VergeNicoleWestmanInterview03172021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fzof1lp.html"&gt;Zoom F1 Field Recorder&lt;/a&gt; to record voice-overs for video projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Thi1tm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10397397"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A65u0S"&gt;What software tools do you use for your work? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ugGVPR"&gt;I do most of my writing and research organization in Google Docs. I use the &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/"&gt;recording and transcription service Otter&lt;/a&gt; for interviews. It matches audio with the transcript, so I can easily go back and find whatever part of the interview I need, even if the transcription isn’t perfect. (It usually isn’t.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4rXNY"&gt;When I need to find scientific research on any topic vaguely medical, I turn to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;, a search engine housed at the National Institutes of Health. I also use &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/"&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/a&gt; to find academic research articles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KSF0yh"&gt;Are there any other tools that you use?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GqZxme"&gt;I write out my to-do lists and schedule in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.moleskine.com%2Fplanners%2Fweekly-planners%2F0102-2&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22335776%2Fnicole-wetsman-verge-science-macbook-moleskine-zoom" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Moleskine weekly planner&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only notebook I’ve found with a layout that works for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QIfwuC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10397626"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bZ5UYl"&gt;What advice do you have for people who are considering reporting as a profession?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jAuhIo"&gt;Journalism can sometimes seem like a competitive field, with reporters jockeying for scoops, intel, and access. At the core, though, it’s inherently collaborative. Working with others means benefiting from their ideas, edits, and perspectives, and it makes the final product better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="OSRzdX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10398005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aeobAX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfPzKx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMtxpW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Conspiracy theorists and white supremacists want to ‘incite fear’ by targeting cell towers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-TELECOMMUNICATION-5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M8FQvsIpSqSEX_9GGtUt6daGt3U=/96x0:3897x2534/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986019/1187777043.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0KY9Kd"&gt;Cellphone towers are being increasingly targeted by conspiracy theorists, neo-Nazis, and white supremacists who wish to “incite fear, disrupt essential services, and cause economic damage,” according to an internal New York Police Department report &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/17/5g-white-supremacists-conspiracy-theorists-critical-infrastructure/"&gt;seen by &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QS9PK"&gt;The report, issued on January 20th by the NYPD Intelligence Bureau, cites a number of recent attacks on US telecoms infrastructure, including individuals severing fiber-optic cables and removing back-up batteries from wireless sites. The sections of the report shared by &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; do not explicitly ascribe political motivations to these attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N12PmW"&gt;The most high-profile attack cited in the report is the case of Anthony Quinn Warner, who set off a bomb outside an AT&amp;amp;T building in Nashville, Tennessee on Christmas day, 2020. However, a separate report released by the FBI &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/fbi-nashville-bomber-driven-by-conspiracies-paranoia?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;amp;cmpId=google&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;this week&lt;/a&gt; said that while Warner was driven by conspiracy theories and paranoia, his attack was not necessarily inspired by any “broader ideological motive.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ENvDPY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Extremist groups want to undermine the ability of the state by targeting critical infrastructure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H9viJa"&gt;The NYPD intelligence report suggests that disparate groups see attacks on US infrastructure as an effective way to achieve their goal of “fomenting a general distrust of government.” It cites discussion in one neo-Nazi chat group where members “strongly supported exploiting civil unrest in the United States by attacking the country’s infrastructure,” including suggesting attacks on “bridges, railways and electrical grids.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2MGog"&gt;“In recent months, white supremacist extremists, neo-Nazis, far-right Telegram groups, and online conspiracy theorists have all emphasized attacking valuable critical infrastructure targets,” says the report from the NYPD Intelligence Bureau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvs6WK"&gt;In addition to the NYPD’s intelligence briefing, &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; notes that on January 5th and 6th 2021, the Department of Homeland Security issued three reports about vandalism against cell towers in New York, West Virginia, and Tennessee. An anonymous federal law enforcement official told &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; that while threats to infrastructure were not unusual, it was strange to see three grouped together in such a short time. Notably, the attacks took place the day before and the day of the US Capitol riots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64fZV6"&gt;In addition to threats posed by neo-Nazis and white supremacists, cell towers have been increasingly targeted by conspiracy theorists, both inside the US and elsewhere. Last year, there was a spate of attacks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21276912/5g-conspiracy-theories-coronavirus-uk-telecoms-engineers-attacks-abuse"&gt;against cell towers in Europe&lt;/a&gt; linked to false beliefs that new 5G equipment was spreading coronavirus among the population and weakening individuals’ immune systems. Dozens of sites were targeted by arson attacks in the UK, Netherlands, Ireland, Belgium, Sweden, Italy, and beyond. Although such attacks may have been motivated by anti-5G conspiracy theories, they had the same outcome desired by far-right groups, including disrupting the work of first responders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxEJHs"&gt;The NYPD did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;regarding the authenticity of the report seen by &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is removing any posts celebrating the Atlanta attack or the suspected shooter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R-miGHEpsbEPWafJyH5Wz2D2jQw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68985872/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EBD6oM"&gt;Facebook says it will remove any posts that celebrate the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/17/us/shooting-atlanta-acworth"&gt;recent shooting in Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; or support the suspected shooter. Eight people were killed in the attack. Seven of the victims of the shooting were women and six were of Asian descent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5nw6i"&gt;The social network has designated the shooting to be a “violating event,” a classification that it’s previously used for the US Capitol riots in January this year and the killing of two people during Black Lives Matter protests in Kenosha in August 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dbyKPn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook wants to remove content that celebrates violent acts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vNxZGQ"&gt;This classification is part of Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/policy-update-actions-against-violence-on-facebook-instagram"&gt;expanded policies&lt;/a&gt; on Dangerous Individuals and Organizations. The social network noted last August that it wanted to address movements “that, while not directly organizing violence, have celebrated violent acts.” That means removing content related to movements that “have demonstrated significant risks to public safety but do not meet the rigorous criteria to be designated as a dangerous organization and banned from having any presence on our platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhXQb9"&gt;As is common with Facebook moderation, it’s not clear exactly what criteria the company is applying. A Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it would remove content that praises, supports, or represents the shooting or the suspect, but did not offer further details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ie1LEx"&gt;Facebook also said that it had found and removed an Instagram account it believes was linked to the alleged shooter, but noted that this account had been inactive for some time. The company has also confirmed that a widely-circulated image, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/daveyalba/status/1372202957090000897"&gt;purporting to be a Facebook post from the shooter&lt;/a&gt;, is a fake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBxyB9"&gt;The social network said it would temporarily stop new accounts being registered on Facebook and Instagram using the same name as the suspected shooter, presumably to limit the creation of new hoaxes or misinformation. Facebook says it’s working with law enforcement to help their investigations into the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ryder says EV startup Chanje owes millions for undelivered vans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZHujxot8l5uTlfe9Q25d91R79tw=/375x0:2925x1700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68985114/Exterior___Rear_3_4_Downtown_edited.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mt1ETy"&gt;Truck rental company Ryder says it’s owed nearly $4 million from EV startup Chanje after it failed to deliver 100 of the 125 vans promised back in 2017, according to &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.589122/gov.uscourts.flsd.589122.1.0.pdf"&gt;a previously unreported lawsuit in Florida&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6ZDRQ"&gt;The lawsuit comes as a massive shift toward electric propulsion is underway in the commercial vehicle space, with new startups raising billions of dollars and established automakers announcing electric delivery vans and trucks at a regular clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsHqG5"&gt;Chanje emerged from stealth in 2017 and is one of a number of electric vehicle startups that have called California home. Like many of its peers, it got early attention by hiring a few former execs from Tesla, and even poached some talent from fellow startup Faraday Future. Also like many of those California EV startups, Chanje is owned by a larger Chinese automotive company — in this case one called FDG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7pshlM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Chanje said at one point it didn’t have the cash to pay Ryder back&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eXyb4y"&gt;But whereas others at the time were focused on luxury passenger cars, Chanje set out to make electric delivery vans instead. Ryder was Chanje’s first big customer, pledging to buy 125 vans back in 2017. The truck rental company agreed to pay $45,000 for each of the vehicles from Chanje, with $35,000 per vehicle up front and $10,000 per vehicle upon delivery. As such, Ryder made an initial deposit of $4,375,000 in 2017. Ryder was also supposed to be the exclusive sales and service provider for the startup’s vans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJOJgm"&gt;Ryder received 22 vehicles from Chanje by the end of 2017, but when it went to pay the $10,000 deposit on those, it mistakenly paid the full $45,000 for each, an overpayment of $770,000. That’s when the trouble started, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RzFSN"&gt;Ryder made “repeated requests” to be reimbursed for the overpayment, but Chanje told the truck rental company it did not have the cash to pay Ryder back, according to the complaint. Chanje eventually delivered three more electric vans, but never delivered the remaining 100. Ryder tried to terminate the contract and recoup the $3.5 million in deposits it paid on those vans it never got, but Chanje balked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tu2e2e"&gt;In early 2019, according to the lawsuit, Ryder got FDG to agree to loan money to Chanje to pay the $770,000 in overpayments. In late 2019, Ryder again got FDG to agree to loan money to Chanje to pay back the $3.5 million in deposits. Chanje ultimately paid Ryder back $500,000 of the overpayment money, but hasn’t paid the truck rental company another dollar since. Ryder therefore says it’s still owed $3,770,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqzUma"&gt;Ryder, Chanje, and FDG did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAzF5g"&gt;In 2018, Ryder had arranged to have FedEx lease 900 Chanje vans and buy 100 more. But as it started to fight Chanje and FDG for the money it was owed in 2019 and 2020, Ryder tried to give the electric van startup and its parent company an out. It struck an agreement with Chanje and FDG that said if they delivered at least 700 vans to FedEx, Ryder would waive the $3.5 million in deposit money. “Chanje did not meet its obligations and deliver the 700 vehicles” to FedEx, Ryder’s lawyers write. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fj17Lf"&gt;It’s unclear if Chanje delivered any vans to FedEx. FedEx also said in early 2020 that it was developing “groundbreaking charging infrastructure” with Chanje &lt;a href="https://newsroom.fedex.com/newsroom/fedex-and-chanje-to-develop-groundbreaking-charging-infrastructure/"&gt;at a few dozen stations in California&lt;/a&gt;, and the status of that project is also unclear. FedEx did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KV8mjA"&gt;Chanje has been quiet since its debut in 2017, aside from the announcements with FedEx. The startup has been sued more than once in Los Angeles Superior Court by former employees who say they’re owed tens of thousands in back pay and bonuses. Chanje has also been hit with liens from the California Secretary of State for not paying taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v54fGF"&gt;In the time since Chanje came onto the scene, commercial electric vehicle companies have taken off as governments around the world push to reduce harmful emissions. The UK’s Arrival recently went public after merging with a special purpose acquisition company, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/18/uk-electric-vehicle-maker-arrival-is-going-public-via-spac.html"&gt;raising nearly $700 million at a $5.4 billion valuation&lt;/a&gt;. General Motors even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225394/gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-ep1-ev600-ces-2021"&gt;spun out an entire business dedicated to commercial EVs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome now instantly captions audio and video on the web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YaG09nhFGqzAaatWO8xFBUwcnDo=/139x234:888x733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68984871/Screen_Shot_2021_03_17_at_4.21.12_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5UtL8v"&gt;Google is expanding its real-time caption feature, Live Captions, from Pixel phones to anyone using a Chrome browser, as first spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-chrome-live-caption-feature-rolls-out-transcribe-speech-videos/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Live Captions uses machine learning to spontaneously create captions for videos or audio where none existed before, and making the web that much more accessible for anyone who’s deaf or hard of hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1xrjd"&gt;When enabled, Live Captions automatically appear in a small, moveable box in the bottom of your browser when you’re watching or listening to a piece of content where people are talking. Words appear after a slight delay, and for fast or stuttering speech, you might spot mistakes. But in general, the feature is just as impressive as it was when it first appeared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923660/google-pixel-4-xl-review-camera-radar-face-unlock-90hz-display-telephoto"&gt;on Pixel phones in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Captions will even appear with muted audio or your volume turned down, making it a way to “read” videos or podcasts without bugging others around you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Y8co8Pyq5oIHT9uKzMkPMbKxmY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22378878/Screen_Shot_2021_03_17_at_4.35.39_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live Captions captioning audio from a podcast player&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ayaFKF"&gt;Chrome’s Live Captions worked on YouTube videos, Twitch streams, podcast players, and even music streaming services like SoundCloud in early tests run by a few of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. However, it seems that Live Captions in Chrome only work in English, which is also the case on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYfmP4"&gt;Live Captions can be enabled in the latest version of Chrome by going to Settings, then the “Advanced” section, and then “Accessibility.” (If you’re not seeing the feature, try manually updating and restarting your browser.) When you toggle them on, Chrome will quickly download some speech recognition files, and then captions should appear the next time your browser plays audio where people are talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arX95B"&gt;Live Captions were first introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18528447/google-android-q-live-caption-video-transcription-io-2019"&gt;in the Android Q beta&lt;/a&gt;, but until today, they were exclusive to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/9350862?hl=en"&gt;some Pixel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/09/16/live-captions-now-available-for-galaxy-s10-note-10-w-one-ui-2-5-update/"&gt;Samsung phones&lt;/a&gt;. Now that they’re on Chrome, Live Captions will be available to a much wider audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FW71tJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft PowerPoint can now help you practice presentations almost anywhere — no humans required</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tkrDuN_n3G_1IhMZ8t0AHar4MPg=/61x0:1936x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68984582/Screen_Shot_2021_03_17_at_2.54.00_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Presenter Coach report, telling me how I did.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F3dxi0"&gt;Microsoft’s Presenter Coach, which helps you practice presentations, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18683351/microsoft-powerpoint-presenter-coach-monitoring-feature"&gt;has been available on the web version of PowerPoint&lt;/a&gt; for a while now, but it’s finally coming to the desktop and mobile versions of the app. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fblog%2F2021%2F03%2F17%2Fimprove-your-presenting-skills-with-additional-platforms-and-new-features-for-powerpoint-presenter-coach%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, the feature will now be available on Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, and, of course, the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0pOfy"&gt;PowerPoint Presenter Coach listens to you while you practice a presentation out loud — it analyzes what you’re saying, and can warn you if you’re talking too fast or slow, using filler words like “um” or “ahh,” or just reading the words off the slide (a personal pet peeve of mine). Trying it out on both PowerPoint for Windows and iOS, it worked shockingly well, doing pretty much everything Microsoft says it should. At the end it gives you a little report, telling you what you need to practice.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z777kc"&gt;Along with the expanded availability, there are also some new ways that the feature can try to make your presentation better: it can look at body language (how close you are to the camera, if you’re making eye contact or putting things in front of your face), and warn you if you’re repeating words or saying them wrong. And yes, it still tells you not to swear in your presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hrTl1UhF5nlyjrYp-Wn5XHTgjBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22378650/Screen_Shot_2021_03_17_at_3.42.03_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PowerPoint for web (seen here) censors the profanity, but the version for Windows hilariously doesn’t.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VkF5xF"&gt;When I tried it, the feature didn’t show up in the Mac version of the app, but I was able to use it on iOS. Microsoft was not immediately available for comment about when the feature would show up on the Mac, or on whether the vocal and video analysis was done on-device or in the cloud for the desktop and mobile versions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VrwvRU"&gt;For the privacy-conscious, though, it is worth noting that when I tried it in airplane mode, it told me I had to connect to the internet to use the coaching feature. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New iPad Pros reportedly launching as soon as April, and the 12.9-inch model may have a Mini LED screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PEWN5MlqraSpp_ht-z_mzwwhUbA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68984260/bking_200321_3945_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Brennan King / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8N0Nkk"&gt;Apple is reportedly planning a number of updates to its iPad line, including new iPad Pros launching as soon as April, a new iPad mini with a larger screen, and a refresh of the base iPad, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jY2HJg"&gt;The new iPad Pros are expected to have a similar design as the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;released last March&lt;/a&gt; but have a better processor that’s “on par” with the speedy M1 chip in Apple’s newest MacBook Airs, Pros, and Mac mini, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. Both models may also have improved cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlPrXy"&gt;The 12.9-inch iPad Pro could have a Mini LED screen, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, which should offer a higher contrast ratio and be less susceptible to burn-in than OLED screens.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Hours after the &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report, reputable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo added credence to the claim saying Apple would begin mass production of Mini LED iPads in “&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-12-9-inch-mini-led-ipad-pro-production/"&gt;mid to late April&lt;/a&gt;,” as reported by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;. Kuo has said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/2/20992125/apple-mini-led-ipad-macbook-pro-2020-oled-rumor-kuo"&gt;since 2019&lt;/a&gt; that Apple has Mini LED-equipped tablets and laptops in the works, and said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452182/ipad-pro-mini-led-display-oled-contrast-burn-in-screen-technology"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s first device with the new screen technology would be a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Kuo’s latest research note issued today said that he expects a Mini LED MacBook Air by 2022 while cheaper iPads, like the iPad Air, will switch to OLED displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJV9Eq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Apple has tested its new iPad Pros with a Thunderbolt port, which would be able to transfer data faster than the USB-C port found on the iPad Pros right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LmFil"&gt;In addition to the new iPad Pros, Apple is also working on an iPad mini update with a screen that’s larger than the 7.9-inch display currently used on the company’s smallest tablet, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. Apple last refreshed the iPad mini &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt; after not updating the device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/28/9409015/apple-ipad-mini-4-review-2015"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt;. The new iPad mini could launch as soon as this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNFwec"&gt;Apple is also planning to update its cheapest iPad with a new design that’s thinner and lighter at some point this year, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. Apple last refreshed the base iPad &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUSE54"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 18th, 5:10AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added comments from Ming-Chi Kuo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LBbAJ4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Streaming HBO Max will now count toward data limits for AT&amp;T customers </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Game of Thrones" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BGJkalC2J_t1yJWMOtxoJifZMHU=/4x0:4054x2700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68984228/GOT_603_tyrion_HBO.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HCDvtc"&gt;One perk of being an AT&amp;amp;T wireless subscriber was being able to stream HBO Max without that counting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/2/21277402/hbo-max-att-data-caps-netflix-disney-plus-streaming-services-net-neutrality"&gt;toward a customer’s data cap&lt;/a&gt;. That’s no longer the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXtgc7"&gt;California’s new net neutrality law includes banning sponsored data services, known as zero-rating, which previously allowed companies like AT&amp;amp;T to cover data usage of certain platforms (like HBO Max) for customers who use other offerings like internet plans. As part of the law, internet service providers like AT&amp;amp;T won’t be able to cover bundle customers’ streaming data usage alongside no longer being able to offer paid prioritization or play down service speed questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2yJCZ"&gt;“We regret the inconvenience to customers caused by California’s new ‘net neutrality’ law,” the company &lt;a href="https://www.attpublicpolicy.com/congress/impact-of-california-net-neutrality-law-on-free-data-services/"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “Given that the Internet does not recognize state borders, the new law not only ends our ability to offer California customers such free data services but also similarly impacts our customers in states beyond California.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JUcMy"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Scott_Wiener/status/1364364559641759747"&gt;some representatives&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;) see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;this as an absolute win&lt;/a&gt;, the telecom giants like AT&amp;amp;T feel differently. The companies tried to invoke a preliminary &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22298199/california-net-neutrality-law-sb822"&gt;injunction in late February&lt;/a&gt; that would stop the bill from passing, but Judge John Mendez declined the request. AT&amp;amp;T called a state-by-state approach to net neutrality “unworkable” in the blog post today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bn5F3J"&gt;“We deliver the content and services our customers want because it’s what they demand, not because it’s mandated by regulation,” the blog post reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEnGan"&gt;For AT&amp;amp;T specifically, promising that HBO Max subscribers who are also AT&amp;amp;T wireless customers could stream without worrying about hitting their data caps is a big deal. AT&amp;amp;T bought Time Warner &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/14/17466518/att-time-warner-acquisition-closes"&gt;in 2018 for $85 billion.&lt;/a&gt; The goal was always to launch what HBO Max became and integrate that vertically with its other businesses. AT&amp;amp;T wireless customers could sign up for HBO Max and stream without worrying about data caps, which might be a selling point for some customers who are looking to switch internet service providers and want to stream all the &lt;em&gt;Friends &lt;/em&gt;in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c92zZD"&gt;As AT&amp;amp;T tries to scale HBO Max’s subscriber base, the company is looking into any opportunity to get more people to stream and for longer periods of time. With a cheaper, ad-supported tier coming in June, any little extra “offer” can help the company sign up customers and potentially convince people to spend more time watching HBO Max instead of Netflix. Not enabling this type of corporate influence, however, is something that &lt;a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/people/barbara-van-schewick"&gt;Barbara van Schewick&lt;/a&gt;, a law professor at Stanford University and the director of Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society, celebrated &lt;a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2021/03/in-a-win-open-internet-att-stops-zero-rating-its-own-video"&gt;in a blog post today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCeBqR"&gt;“People should be free to choose which videos they want to watch — whether that’s Netflix, Twitch or their local church’s Sunday service, without the company they pay to get online trying to influence their choices,” van Schewick wrote, adding that AT&amp;amp;T is “trying to score political points against state net neutrality protections by lying to the public about the law and its effects.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6YwSe"&gt;For AT&amp;amp;T customers, this means that streaming HBO Max will start counting toward your data cap. But it also means that it’s slightly more difficult for AT&amp;amp;T to influence customers into using more of their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8Hlvf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wki3p6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpSnNh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tbpqPM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UisRoq"&gt;If you’ve got a recent Canon DSLR or mirrorless camera and are interested in getting more use out of it, Canon announced today that it would soon begin selling webcam accessory kits, allowing Canon owners an easier way to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241305/canon-cameras-dslr-eos-webcam-utility-released"&gt;retool their cameras as high-quality webcams&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUFL66"&gt;Each kit has different parts, but all three packages include a USB cable to connect your camera to your desktop computer or laptop, and a battery insert and power cord so that you can continually keep your Canon camera powered with a wall outlet. It is important to note that none of these kits include a tripod to mount your camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7YKZcj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Webcams have been in high demand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jv78cf"&gt;Canon has announced three versions of its accessory kit, which are available for preorder at &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fl%2F%3Fsearchinfo%3Dcanon%2520webcam%2520kits%26sel%3DItem-Condition_New-Items&amp;amp;subid1=CanonWebcamStory03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Canon+webcam+kit&amp;amp;i=amazon-devices&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735187887684653293#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DCanon%2520webcam%2520kits%26filters%3Dfct_a_filter_by%253A07_NEW_RELEASE%252Cfct_category%253Aaccessory_kits_4969&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F17%2F22336762%2Fcanon-webcam-accessory-kits-dslr-mirrorless-cameras" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, with both retailers noting that preorders are expected to ship on March 25th. The two most affordable kits are compatible with &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Ficawcskm.html&amp;amp;subid1=CanonWebcamStory03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;EOS M cameras&lt;/a&gt; (M50, M50 Mark II &amp;amp; M200) and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/17351879635939234593donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EOS Rebel cameras&lt;/a&gt; (Rebel T3, T5, T6 &amp;amp; T7), and cost $89.99 each. The more expensive kit, which works with &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1630732-REG%2Fcanon_1425c009_eos_webcam_accessories_starter.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EOS RP cameras&lt;/a&gt;, will retail for $159.99. Alternatively, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ACK-E18-Adapter-Charger-Coupler-Replace/dp/B074K181L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a third-party charging kit&lt;/a&gt; and supply your own USB cable for less than the Canon kits cost; or if you don’t own a camera at all, you can buy a webcam starter kit for as low as $466 on &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.usa.canon.com%2Fshop%2Fen%2Fcatalog%2Fdslr-webcam-bundles#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VZaMJ"&gt;Within the past year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22173744/webcam-gadget-of-the-year-2020"&gt;webcams have been in high demand&lt;/a&gt; due to the pandemic as many people work from home or rely on videoconferencing tools to communicate. Canon, like its competitors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241305/canon-cameras-dslr-eos-webcam-utility-released"&gt;already released software&lt;/a&gt; that allowed owners to repurpose select Canon cameras as webcams to address the shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
