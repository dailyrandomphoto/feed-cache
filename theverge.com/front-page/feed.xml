    <title>Ford F-150 Lightning announcement: how to watch the electric pickup truck’s debut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQLXBw-FcFtKmBUezm5njyOyt4o=/590x0:6961x4247/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312135/Lightning_16x9.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u6tXBf"&gt;Ford is getting ready to pull the curtain back on its latest electric vehicle. The F-150 Lightning, the electric version of the automaker’s bestselling pickup truck, will take center stage at Ford’s headquarters in Dearborn, MI, at 9:30PM ET on Wednesday, May 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYskvW"&gt;Ford says there will be “30+ ways to watch across physical and digital destinations,” including live streams on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjisj5T0VqE"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1390749496494022657"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ford/posts/10159043571770049"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. The event will also be broadcast in several public locations like Times Square in New York City and Las Vegas Boulevard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B4xdiH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“30+ ways to watch across physical and digital destinations”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CZRjPe"&gt;It’s a lot of hoopla for a truck that’s been in the works for over four years and has already been seen publicly, with and without camouflage. We got our first real look at the F-150 Lightning &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442415/ford-f150-lightning-electric-pickup-truck-first-images"&gt;during President Joe Biden’s visit&lt;/a&gt; to the Ford Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Michigan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QsSUTV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yjisj5T0VqE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qmwl97"&gt;Still, most of the relevant specs are being kept under wraps (although Biden let slip that he believed the 0-60mph time to be a little more than four seconds). Details like battery size, range, trim levels, and price should be on the bill for the Wednesday evening event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAnwzh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441793/ford-f150-lightning-announcement-rumors-specs-details"&gt;Ford has a lot riding on the F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the company’s second major mass-market EV, after the Mustang Mach-E, and its first battery-powered pickup truck. Ford has said it would spend $22 billion over the next five years on electric vehicles — or a little more than half of what the company makes in revenue in one year of F-series sales. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Dark Patterns tip line lets you report evil tech company menus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xf7dkgSOnfety0SB438wexivZcY=/0x0:1221x814/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69311898/Screen_Shot_2021_05_19_at_9.40.16_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Consumer Reports&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jqIJld"&gt;If you’re ever annoyed by a website or app trying to trick you by using small text, brightly colored buttons, or tricky toggles, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CRAdvocacy/status/1395031496671567875?s=20"&gt;there’s a new tip line&lt;/a&gt; you can use to report the bad behavior, run by Consumer Reports Advocacy. The &lt;a href="https://darkpatternstipline.org"&gt;Dark Patterns Tip Line&lt;/a&gt; aims to collect various examples of dark patterns, defined by the website as “design tactics used in websites and apps to persuade you into doing things you probably would not do otherwise,” and use those examples to fight back against the companies that are behaving poorly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ek59iR"&gt;Even if you’ve never heard the term “dark pattern” before, you’ve likely come across one. Consumer Reports provides a list of examples in a tweet, and on the tip line’s site, but there are entire websites (like &lt;a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org"&gt;darkpatterns.org&lt;/a&gt;) and subreddits dedicated to showing examples from across the internet. Former president Donald Trump’s campaign &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365952/trump-dark-patterns-trick-supporters-recurring-donation-winred-gary-coby"&gt;even used them to trick supporters&lt;/a&gt; into donating way more than they intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gwHDut"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DarkPattern?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DarkPattern&lt;/a&gt; examples:&lt;br&gt;-You can’t exit an ad because the “X” is so small&lt;br&gt;-You try to buy something and a site sneaks an extra item into your cart &lt;br&gt;-You’re forced to provide your phone number to register a new account&lt;br&gt;-You’re silently charged for a subscription after a trial ends&lt;/p&gt;— Consumer Reports Advocacy (@CRAdvocacy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CRAdvocacy/status/1395031498584215556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ju2Lo"&gt;There has been some legislation around dark patterns, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333506/california-bans-dark-patterns-opt-out-selling-data"&gt;California banning ones&lt;/a&gt; that trick users into giving away private information earlier this year, but it’s still an area where government has been slow to step in. Consumer Reports hopes to, in part, use the submissions from the tip line as evidence when speaking to lawmakers. It also hopes the site will help inform consumers about how to avoid the unscrupulous designs, and hold companies accountable for their actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nk65Bt"&gt;If you want to see other people’s submissions to the tip line, you can go to its &lt;a href="https://darkpatternstipline.org/sightings"&gt;Sightings page&lt;/a&gt;, and if you have a submission yourself, you can go to &lt;a href="https://darkpatternstipline.org/report"&gt;the Report page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Colonial Pipeline CEO confirms company paid $4.4 million ransom it wasn’t supposed to pay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Colonial Pipeline Resumes Operations After Hack Causing Gas Shortages" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V82hlLH0bPQktnPPaBLn_OBbj-c=/0x0:4164x2776/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69311812/1232866318.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Drew Angerer / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3PFwWL"&gt;Colonial Pipeline CEO Joseph Blount has confirmed that his company did in fact pay $4.4 million to the hackers responsible for the ransomware attack on the pipeline system that transports around 45 percent of fuel used on the East Coast, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/colonial-pipeline-ceo-tells-why-he-paid-hackers-a-4-4-million-ransom-11621435636?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier reporting estimated Colonial Pipeline &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434381/colonial-pipeline-darkside-hacker-ransomware-ransom-oil"&gt;paid a ransom of nearly $5 million&lt;/a&gt;, news that was surprising — not for the amount of money that was paid, but because paying ransoms to cybercriminals is &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-payment/"&gt;frowned upon by law enforcement agencies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UmLYa0"&gt;The situation with Colonial Pipeline is further complicated by the fact that the Colonial Pipeline Company itself was responsible for the shutdown. Blount tells the&lt;em&gt; Journal&lt;/em&gt; that its operational systems weren’t directly impacted, but it shut down the critical energy infrastructure so that it could determine how far hackers reached into its system. Before today’s confirmation, both &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/12/politics/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-payment/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and cybersecurity reporter &lt;a href="https://zetter.substack.com/p/ransomware-infection-on-colonial"&gt;Kim Zetter&lt;/a&gt; suggested hackers specifically had access to the company’s billing system, rather than direct control over the pipeline itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXvTOu"&gt;DarkSide, the hackers responsible for the attack, were also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428996/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-apology-investigation"&gt;oddly apologetic&lt;/a&gt; that their ransomware caused so much trouble, even though they ultimately got what they wanted. “Our goal is to make money and not creating problems for society,” the group wrote in a statement. Still, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/15/colonial-pipeline-resumes-normal-operations-after-hack.html"&gt;fuel shortages&lt;/a&gt; followed, and Colonial Pipeline said it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/15/22437730/colonial-pipeline-normal-ransomware-attack-fuel"&gt;just got back to normal operations&lt;/a&gt; on May 15th. Blount tells &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;the work to rebuild its business system is ongoing, though — it’s still unable to bill customers after the outage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android phones can finally tap to pay for public transit in the SF Bay Area</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A train approaches MacArthur BART Station on Friday, November 2, 2018 in Oakland, Calif." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DVA_fv5OIgAgDSECrj-1tp6t7iQ=/0x0:2691x1794/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69311786/1298602323.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amy Osborne/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ct3tGu"&gt;In 2010, the San Francisco Bay Area introduced a single tap-to-pay NFC card for practically all its public transit — and Google introduced &lt;a href="https://www.nfcw.com/2010/12/07/35385/google-unveils-first-android-nfc-phone-but-nexus-s-is-limited-to-tag-reading-only-for-now/"&gt;the first NFC-equipped Android smartphone&lt;/a&gt;. Now, over a decade later, the two ideas are finally compatible. Today, &lt;a href="https://www.clippercard.com/ClipperWeb/google-pay"&gt;you can finally digitize a Clipper card into most Android phones&lt;/a&gt;, or buy one there to start, then tap it to ride 24 different transit systems in SF and the greater Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZ4bgQ"&gt;Apple also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386692/bart-caltrain-muni-ferry-apple-pay-clipper-card-sf-bay-area-iphone-watch"&gt;added the same functionality to iPhones and Apple Watches last month&lt;/a&gt;, and here’s how I described it at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nYXTjU"&gt;You can now use almost any recent iPhone or Apple Watch to board BART (which serves the East Bay and San Francisco), Muni (San Francisco’s bus and light rail system), Caltrain (which connects San Francisco to the peninsula and South Bay), VTA (South Bay buses and light rail), and even the ferry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLkQEk"&gt;That means travel across practically the entire urban and suburban Bay Area without pulling a wallet out of your purse or pocket — particularly since many of those vehicles also fit bikes on board. It’s not quite as significant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13401092/apple-pay-japan-suica-felica-nfc"&gt;as when Apple Pay came to Japan’s Suica in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, since that rail network spans an entire country, but it’s a big deal for tech workers and natives like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0IG1mS"&gt;With Google Pay, most NFC-equipped phones with Android 5.0 or higher are compatible — but not Motorola devices due to “inconsistent experiences” — and Samsung users will have to set Google Pay as their default wallet app, &lt;a href="https://www.clippercard.com/ClipperWeb/clipper-on-your-phone"&gt;according to this FAQ&lt;/a&gt;. It also doesn’t work for bikeshare or a few specific types of passes. Importantly, Google says if you load a Clipper card into Google Pay, you won’t be able to use the physical card anymore. Your card can only exist in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iNDfjdipMpfACDvFG5Nrjn1ockw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525014/clipper_card_google_pay.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Clipper card as it appears in Google Pay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EMI88h"&gt;While the SF Bay Area may be home to many Google (and Apple) employees, it’s just one of the metros where Google is planning to ingest these cards — Google says Chicago and Washington, DC are both coming soon, and there’s a transit shortcut on the home screen of the Google Pay app that’ll also let you pay for parking in 400 cities and transit in “70+ smaller towns and cities,” according to Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M51KOF"&gt;A Google rep also tells us that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287043/google-maps-pay-parking-public-transportation-cities"&gt;the previously announced ability to buy train tickets directly from Google Maps&lt;/a&gt; is still coming later on. That could come in handy for those who &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; regular commuters but discover that a quick public transit ride can get them from A to B. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3Jpl6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="AsWVXq"&gt;Regardless of which brand you prefer, we have compiled some of the best deals on wireless earbuds available right now. Of course, if you want to do more research before making a buying decision, we encourage you to read our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which can help you determine which pair of earbuds are best for you. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c27rNd"&gt;APPLE AIRPODS DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2vr3VH"&gt;If you own an iPhone or multiple Apple products, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; are likely the best true wireless earbuds on the market for you. Unlike the base AirPods, the Pro variant have better sound quality and feature active noise cancellation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMREv"&gt;Apple’s flagship Pro wireless earbuds tend to go on sale frequently, and we often see them drop as low as $200. You can get a new pair for $190 at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13142092?sid=VergeTrueWirelessHeadphones042921&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-airpods-pro-29%3Futm_medium%3Daffiliate" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot&lt;/a&gt;, or for $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="X9766m"&gt;Alternatively, you can buy a pair of second-generation AirPods. The entry-level model includes a wired charging case. Usually retailing for $160, you can get them for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/994132/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$113 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1003525/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740939592542498948" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="eJgls2"&gt;For a few dollars more, you can get a new pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods with a wireless charging case&lt;/a&gt;. At their regular price of $200, they aren’t as good of a value, but you’ll rarely find yourself paying the usual price.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HGCqrw"&gt;SAMSUNG GALAXY BUDS DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5RLzc"&gt;Samsung has a few different wireless earbuds to choose from, including its latest flagship wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds include active noise cancellation and the best sound quality yet for Samsung earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyxi2K"&gt;There are a couple of deals going on right now at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B08MWZHHKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds-pro-earbuds-black%2F-%2FA-82026965&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeTrueWirelessHeadphones042921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are offering the Galaxy Buds Pro for $180. Other retailers, specifically &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740939849926817180" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1614521-REG%2Fsamsung_sm_r190nzkaxar_galaxy_buds_pro_noise_canceling.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, are selling the Buds Pro as well, however, at their normal retail price ($200).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WZ42v1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aZthMF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; were our top pick last year for the best wireless earbuds overall. A successor to the original Galaxy Buds, the Plus model extends the battery life by up to 11 hours and, unlike AirPods, comes in an assortment of colors. You can buy the Galaxy Buds Plus at MSRP for $150 at places such as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KVM9VW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739163658038651288#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739163599620332399#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The Buds Live are a good option if you want earbuds that produce powerful sound and showcase marathon battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ScDytt"&gt;If you don’t mind picking up a refurbished model, you can get the Galaxy Buds Live for $80 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735168432735464332#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; right now.

&lt;h2 id="u5smDl"&gt;OTHER TRUE WIRELESS EARBUD DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="58GOfq"&gt;Compared to the competition, Jabra’s wireless earbuds have a rare feature that has yet to become standard in the true wireless earbud market: the ability to connect to two devices concurrently. Ideally, this is great for users who switch between two devices often (like, say, a phone and a laptop). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJ5wIC"&gt;Last year, Jabra released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are the highest-tier model in Jabra’s lineup. They have more advanced noise cancellation than the 75t, however, they also feature less bass and an inferior fit. If you can live with those compromises, however, you can buy the Jabra Elite 85t for $180 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740940140202691153" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-85t?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_source=cj&amp;amp;utm_campaign=100084481&amp;amp;cjevent=d1b5f6f7b81f11eb80a000a90a1c0e0c#/donotlink#100-99190700-98" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jabra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LacpUE"&gt;If the discounted, $180 price tag is still intimidating but you want a pair of Jabra earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt; are also a good option, and they see regular price cuts. We consider the Jabra 75t the best true wireless earbuds for multitaskers, and they remain a solid alternative if you don’t want to buy AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OvElfP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10369683"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqq7gj"&gt;If you are in the market for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for your workouts, you can’t go wrong with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds have an over-ear hook that keeps them in place during intense exercises. They’re also IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about ruining them should your workout get intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aryAiB"&gt;There are a few different discounts available right now for the Powerbeats Pro. The lowest we currently see is at Best Buy for $160 in either &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733773029374008951" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733773015236913845" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;yellow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EyyuGg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="11vDvx"&gt;The 2021 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; are a tremendous value at $120, however, if the price remains a factor and you don’t mind opting for their last-gen counterpart, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1512892-REG%2Famazon_b07f6vm1s3_echo_buds.html%3Fap%3Dy%26smp%3Dy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22307388%2Fwireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; is currently offering the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937559/amazon-echo-buds-wireless-earbuds-review-features-bose-noise-reduction-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Buds for $100&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>HBO Max launching ad-supported tier for $9.99 a month in June</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HBO Max logo against a dark background with white circles around it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BCL5Whl9L214QvrGc01NLPRQEKI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69311635/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sguULA"&gt;HBO Max will launch an ad-supported tier in June for $9.99 per month, offering a cheaper option than the full $14.99-per-month ad-free subscription. The news &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-max-announces-ad-supported-tier-pricing-previews-new-original-series-and-content"&gt;was announced&lt;/a&gt; during a WarnerMedia presentation for advertisers today. The price and launch date were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22408313/hbo-max-cheaper-ad-supported-tier-10-dollars-price-cut-june"&gt;rumored last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUrg8n"&gt;The streaming service, which has 64 million subscribers, has been planning an ad-supported tier as a way to reach a wider audience. The price makes it cheaper than a standard Netflix plan, though it still costs more than Disney Plus. HBO promises the “lightest ad load” in the industry, but it’ll include new ad formats such as “pause ads” that display ads while shows are paused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iujzKR"&gt;Ad-free subscribers will get access to “the full HBO Max content catalog,” but with one big exception: they won’t get access to the Warner Bros. movies that are premiering the same date on streaming as they are in theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfq1S5"&gt;The service will launch in the first week of June and will expand to 39 countries across Latin America and the Caribbean by the end of the month. In Europe, WarnerMedia plans to move HBO-branded streaming services to HBO Max by the end of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CZSYPn"&gt;If you still don’t want to pay for HBO Max, WarnerMedia is &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/tbs-and-tnt-launch-front-row-limited-commercial-interruption-programming-destination"&gt;planning one other way&lt;/a&gt; to watch some of its offerings: it’s going to air some of the streaming service’s shows on TNT and TBS starting this summer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is finally retiring Internet Explorer in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="internet explorer 9 logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gf4ElmhdEi9QH33vP2Dv-qLcb5Y=/0x0:640x427/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69311569/ie9logo.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yy9i2t"&gt;Microsoft is finally retiring Internet Explorer next year, after more than 25 years. The aging web browser has largely been unused by most consumers for years, but Microsoft is putting the final nail in the Internet Explorer coffin on June 15th, 2022, by retiring it in favor of Microsoft Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AXSW6p"&gt;“We are announcing that the future of Internet Explorer on Windows 10 is in Microsoft Edge,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/05/19/the-future-of-internet-explorer-on-windows-10-is-in-microsoft-edge/"&gt;says Sean Lyndersay&lt;/a&gt;, a Microsoft Edge program manager. “The Internet Explorer 11 desktop application will be retired and go out of support on June 15, 2022, for certain versions of Windows 10.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7Vpwq"&gt;While the Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) of Windows 10 will still include Internet Explorer next year, all consumer versions will end support of the browser. Microsoft doesn’t make it clear (and we’re checking), but it’s likely that we’ll finally see the end of Internet Explorer being bundled in Windows either in June 2022 or soon after.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A close up of an internet explorer page, 13 April 2001. AFR Picture by LOUIE DO" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hcDeQiTfX7uwQ3XezPXRvVxW_A8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525774/539719911.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internet Explorer originally launched in 1995.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BvaG0D"&gt;The alternative for most businesses will be Microsoft Edge with IE mode. Microsoft created its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18527875/microsoft-chromium-edge-new-features-build-2019"&gt;IE mode for Edge a couple of years ago&lt;/a&gt;, and it has allowed businesses to adopt the new Chromium-based browser for older legacy websites. IE mode supports older ActiveX controls and legacy sites, which are surprisingly still used by many businesses. Microsoft is promising to support this IE mode in Edge until through at least 2029.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2Sayv"&gt;The end of Internet Explorer has been a long time coming. Microsoft ended support for Internet Explorer 11 for the Microsoft Teams web app last year, and it’s planning to cut it off from accessing Microsoft 365 services later this year. Internet Explorer 11 will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21372487/microsoft-internet-explorer-11-support-end-365-legacy-edge"&gt;no longer be supported&lt;/a&gt; for Microsoft’s online services like Office 365, OneDrive, Outlook, and more on August 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNhoxi"&gt;Microsoft has also been trying to stop people from using Internet Explorer for more than five years. Microsoft Edge first appeared in 2015, and it kicked off the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8230631/microsoft-is-killing-off-the-internet-explorer-brand"&gt;end of the Internet Explorer brand&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft has since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/8/18216767/microsoft-internet-explorer-warning-compatibility-solution"&gt;labeled Internet Explorer a “compatibility solution”&lt;/a&gt; rather than a browser and encouraged businesses to stop using the aging browser in favor of Edge and its IE mode.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford F-150 Lightning: all the news about the electric pickup truck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M05kuoAxAe5w76vk5ExiZMxxYBY=/248x0:1193x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69311382/2021_f_150_reveal.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The electric version of the bestselling pickup truck is here&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="vMPVO7"&gt;Here’s everything you need to know about Ford’s new electric pickup truck, the F-150 Lightning. The automaker claims that this will be the most powerful F-150 ever made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUewwa"&gt;But when it goes into production next year, it will find itself in a suddenly very crowded market. Not only is Tesla’s polarizing Cybertruck expected to be out at the same time, but so is the GMC Hummer EV, Rivian R1T, and various other electric trucks from startups like Canoo and Lordstown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CKSwwX"&gt;The US is a country of truck drivers. These boxy rigs are equally popular among hard-hat wearers and Costco shoppers alike. And while EVs represent only 2 percent of the overall car market, the opportunity to grow is enormous, with trucks occupying a $90 billion-a-year industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWOihm"&gt;The F-series is Ford’s most popular lineup. And it’s electrification represents a huge milestone for the company, for the auto world, and for the US economy. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google made AI language the centerpiece of I/O while ignoring its troubled past at the company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4EhZY_Sr2nga1sfkcTOsM-1baRw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69311376/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kinUzi"&gt;Yesterday at Google’s I/O developer conference, the company outlined &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442328/google-io-2021-ai-language-model-lamda-pluto"&gt;ambitious plans&lt;/a&gt; for its future built on a foundation of advanced language AI. These systems, said Google CEO Sundar Pichai, will let users find information and organize their lives by having natural conversations with computers. All you need to do is speak, and the machine will answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SG1uy9"&gt;But for many in the AI community, there was a notable absence in this conversation: Google’s response to its own research examining the dangers of such systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jwU7Nk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Language models like Google’s come with a host of challenging risks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IB8ily"&gt;In December 2020 and February 2021, Google first fired Timnit Gebru and then Margaret Mitchell, co-leads of its Ethical AI team. The story of their departure is complex but was triggered by &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922"&gt;a paper the pair co-authored&lt;/a&gt; (with researchers outside Google) examining risks associated with the language models Google now presents as key to its future. As the paper and other critiques note, these AI systems are prone to a number of faults, including the generation of abusive and racist language; the encoding of racial and gender bias through speech; and a general inability to sort fact from fiction. For many in the AI world, Google’s firing of Gebru and Mitchell amounted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22370158/google-ai-ethics-timnit-gebru-margaret-mitchell-firing-reputation"&gt;censorship of their work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDRDki"&gt;For some viewers, as Pichai outlined how Google’s AI models would always be designed with “fairness, accuracy, safety, and privacy” at heart, the disparity between the company’s words and actions raised questions about its ability to safeguard this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQjWQa"&gt;“Google just featured LaMDA a new large language model at I/O,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mer__edith/status/1394740252410003458"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Meredith Whittaker, an AI fairness researcher and co-founder of the AI Now Institute. “This is an indicator of its strategic importance to the Co. Teams spend months preping these announcements. Tl;dr this plan was in place when Google fired Timnit + tried to stifle her+ research critiquing this approach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UodbE0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Google just featured LaMDA a new large language model at I/O. This is an indicator of its strategic importance to the Co. Teams spend months preping these announcements. Tl;dr this plan was in place when Google fired Timnit + tried to stifle her+ research critiquing this approach &lt;a href="https://t.co/6VObPJ1ebo"&gt;https://t.co/6VObPJ1ebo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Meredith Whittaker (@mer__edith) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mer__edith/status/1394740252410003458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IOUH0d"&gt;Gebru herself &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1394717504119971844"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “This is what is called ethics washing” — referring to the tech industry’s tendency to trumpet ethical concerns while ignoring findings that hinder companies’ ability to make a profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oy5sd5"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Emily Bender, a professor at the University of Washington who co-authored the paper with Gebru and Mitchell, said Google’s presentation didn’t in any way assuage her concerns about the company’s ability to make such technology safe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rctYLn"&gt;“From the &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; [discussing LaMDA] and given the history, I do not have confidence that Google is actually being careful about any of the risks we raised in the paper,” said Bender. “For one thing, they fired two of the authors of that paper, nominally over the paper. If the issues we raise were ones they were facing head on, then they deliberately deprived themselves of highly relevant expertise towards that task.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jr9Nsj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google needs to be clearer about how it’s tackling these dangers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XHT6g7"&gt;In its blog post on LaMDA, Google highlights a number of these issues and stresses that its work needs more development. “Language might be one of humanity’s greatest tools, but like all tools it can be misused,” writes senior research director Zoubin Ghahramani and product management VP Eli Collins. “Models trained on language can propagate that misuse — for instance, by internalizing biases, mirroring hateful speech, or replicating misleading information.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwYa1Z"&gt;But Bender says the company is obfuscating the problems and needs to be clearer about how it’s tackling them. For example, she notes that Google refers to vetting the language used to train models like LaMDA but doesn’t give any detail about what this process looks like. “I’d very much like to know about the vetting process (or lack thereof),” says Bender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYOuHV"&gt;It was only after the presentation that Google made any reference to its AI ethics unit at all, in a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-ai-chief-says-reputation-hit-to-unit-is-real-after-turmoil/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; interview&lt;/a&gt; with Google AI chief Jeff Dean. Dean noted that Google had suffered a real “reputational hit” from the firings — something &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22370158/google-ai-ethics-timnit-gebru-margaret-mitchell-firing-reputation"&gt;has previously reported&lt;/a&gt; — but that the company had to “move past” these events. “We are not shy of criticism of our own products,” Dean told &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;. “As long as it’s done with a lens towards facts and appropriate treatment of the broad set of work we’re doing in this space, but also to address some of these issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvXYry"&gt;For critics of the company, though, the conversation needs to be much more open than this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield, Neil Jones made the game he always wanted to see</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/88c4FmE85zwBKL75NRXDqmmWEig=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69311321/AKNY_SS4.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;An explosive and stylish endless runner&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="q2ig7J"&gt;Fighting for inclusion within the gaming industry had always been at the forefront of Neil Jones’ heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feR6kv"&gt;The thought of seeing protagonists in video games that looked like him was something that he felt helped elevate the gaming experience to another level, and he knew that was the case for other gamers as well. So, when it came time for Jones to come up with the concept and direction for &lt;em&gt;Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield&lt;/em&gt;, he had already decided he would draw from the idea of inclusivity as one of his many forms of inspiration. Jones set out on his lonesome to create a gaming experience and narrative that appealed to players of all backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feTnUI"&gt;“A father made a comment on Twitter about how he really enjoyed the game with his son and helping him with the hard levels in the game,” says Jones, a Black game developer and the creator of &lt;em&gt;Never Yield&lt;/em&gt;. “It gave me flashbacks to playing games with my grandma as a kid in Detroit. Growing up, I spent a lot of time outside making up random games to play with other kids who lived around me, as well. I think that’s why I love video games so much; they’re for everyone, and everyone can play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjNjnt"&gt;Born and raised in Detroit, a city with the highest percentage of African Americans in the US, Jones understands the importance of diversity, inclusivity, and representation. Before becoming a full-fledged game developer, Jones got his start working for small app-based studios, mainly specializing in making apps for cars. He also assisted smaller projects with friends, such as &lt;em&gt;Dot’s Home&lt;/em&gt;, a game that explores historical housing injustices faced by Black people, and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2016/4/20/11461312/clique-game-overview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clique&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is aptly described as a game about facing prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gkh0sU"&gt;This work experience furthered Jones’ understanding of his strengths and weaknesses in game development and helped him decide what he would do differently on his own to continue the standard of representation that he achieved through collaboration with his friends. “Representation matters to me because the more we include everyone, the more interesting stories and ideas we have to draw from,” Jones says. “That’s not only for the characters in the games but the members of the development team making the games as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="RjgR2a"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mFFD6ZPzAdQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KJ2gjo"&gt;Jones’ mindset stands in direct opposition to that of the gaming industry, which often perpetuates the racial biases that exist outside and inside of the gaming microcosm. These obstacles, unfortunately, lead to little or no Black representation in the games being made and the teams creating them, resulting in Black characters becoming mere stereotypes. Jones actively wanted to work to do his part in remedying this injustice, so when making &lt;em&gt;Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield&lt;/em&gt;, he made the conscious decision to work on the project by himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="X20Y36"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There really isn’t a team, just me.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QM3qxi"&gt;“Some of the biggest obstacles I faced as a Black developer starting out were just being taken seriously and making sure I didn’t let anyone come and try to change the vision of my game’s voice. That’s why I handled everything from even cutting all the trailers myself. There really isn’t a team, just me,” says Jones. “[With] &lt;em&gt;Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield&lt;/em&gt; in particular, I didn’t have a hard time with obstacles because I had already given up on pitching games and going that route. So, no major company ended up seeing it ‘til it was halfway done. I don’t think [these gaming companies] would have understood what I was going for without playing it anyway. But [publisher] Headup and their affiliates noticed me during this showcase I was involved in called The Mix. I wasn’t looking for a publisher, but Headup’s email stood out to me, so they ended up helping me with the game towards the end of development.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZZGoT"&gt;Much like other independent video games by Black developers, such as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kaizen_creed"&gt;&lt;em&gt;5 Force Fighters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1319850/ValiDate_Struggling_Singles_in_your_Area/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ValiDate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Jones’ creation of &lt;em&gt;Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield&lt;/em&gt; is an enormous deal. It serves as one of the latest steps in an overarching march toward a far more inclusive vision of what gaming, and the gaming industry, should be: diverse stories and narratives for a diverse base of players. And &lt;em&gt;Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield&lt;/em&gt; is hoping to be exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRbOQj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Never Yield&lt;/em&gt; is a 3D side-scrolling endless runner, or “narrative runner,” as Jones passionately calls it, where the player must jump, dash, slide, and race to complete each level. The protagonist is a young Black boy named Wally who has recovered a mysterious artifact from the heart of a Tokyo-styled Detroit that could help save the rest of humanity. Running through a multitude of culturally vibrant environments, Wally must evade obstacles and enemies hell-bent on retrieving this stolen good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A1d80oh_P6Ndm2K35_d0KWMvrak=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22511639/AKNY_SS12__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PDOMnt"&gt;“The concept of the game was always to take a cool game mechanic that’s been around for a while and mix it up a bit and really make it my own by adding a lot of styles you wouldn’t normally find in that genre. That’s why I call it a ‘narrative runner.’ The game’s setting has always been based on my weird take on Detroit, but it’s not one-to-one,” says Jones. “Also, I think the main character, Wally, stands out a lot, especially in the indie space, not just because he’s a Black main character but because his story stands out. I hope players have fun piecing together his story and what’s going on in that world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cu06hJ"&gt;Fans got a taste of his unique concept in April during the release of the game’s demo. The reaction? An overwhelming amount of anticipation, support, and love. “You are the first dev (to my knowledge) to create a game with a protagonist that looks like my babies,” @DadPadGaming said on Twitter. “Stay strong because you’re showing my kids they can be heroes. #NeverYield #RepresentationMatters.” “You’re doing amazing work! Keep representing us and killing it out here,” says another Twitter user named @L1keMike. “Ignore the haters!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LYP2TZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I wanted anyone, anywhere, to be able to play and enjoy this game.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2GKEWe"&gt;Along with his decision to create a game seeped in inclusion, Jones also ensured that this passion project would be a blast to play. Jones states that he wanted to push this particular genre forward with new and exciting gameplay elements and invite players into the genre who may be playing this type of game for the first time. “I added a lot, such as how you control the character, adding a story and cutscenes, progression, and replayability,” Jones says. “People have reached out after playing the demo and said how they don’t normally play these ‘types of games,’ referring to endless runners, but this one really drew them in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1TOEA"&gt;The culturally significant experiences that come with being Black compounded with Jones’ own unique lived experience and development skills shine throughout &lt;em&gt;Never Yield&lt;/em&gt;. These subtleties separate &lt;em&gt;Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield&lt;/em&gt; from endless runners of the past and present. It features a well-constructed soundtrack courtesy of Danime-Sama — a Black main character with a prosthetic leg doing parkour — and little to no dialogue, which purposefully shifts the player’s focus toward the design of the game’s culturally rich aesthetics and equally excellent music. “I don’t really care for a lot of dialogue. I wanted anyone, anywhere, to be able to play and enjoy this game, so I tried to do everything in animations,” he says. “My intent with making &lt;em&gt;Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield&lt;/em&gt; was to give myself an opportunity to make something dope that I would have never gotten the opportunity to do otherwise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbrNaO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield&lt;/em&gt; launches on consoles and PCs on May 19th at a turbulent time for the US. The verdict for the George Floyd case has sent shockwaves through the nation, and ignominious acts of police brutality continue to impact African Americans at a disproportionate rate. Jones understands that his game won’t solve major issues on that particular front. Still, he is hopeful that the success of this game will create a moment of solace where players become more curious and interested in exploring Black-led games and become familiar with the lives, experiences, and narratives that come along with the rich cultures of Black people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="r5CokG"&gt;“I’m not sure how or if my game will or can affect the whole industry. That also sounds like it would be a lot of pressure for me or anyone to think about. I just hope enough people buy the game so I can make more of it. If the game does well, then it shows that Black characters actually do sell well,” Jones says. “The climate is definitely wild right now. So, I hope people look at my game and realize that Black talent that’s never been given the opportunity to grow in the games industry; there are so many people that are so much better than me that were never given a chance. I hope that the next wave of Black game devs is given those chances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvOjI3"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches May 19th on the Nintendo Switch, PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, and PS5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
