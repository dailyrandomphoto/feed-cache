    <title>Twitter is now letting everyone tweet pictures in 4K on Android and iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VY-VwER3PIt-1bIIRkD8_ZY7cig=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165104/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5PsRbk"&gt;Get ready for Twitter to start looking a whole lot crisper — starting today, the company is letting all users tweet (and view) pictures in 4K on iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwChR2"&gt;Twitter’s web app already supports higher-resolution images (at up to 4096 x 4096 resolution), but the mobile apps had been limited to just half that, with a maximum resolution of 2048 x 2048. The company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;previously started testing&lt;/a&gt; the 4K image upload option for mobile users earlier this year, and it seems those tests went well, as its now rolling out the feature to all users starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VlbVFU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter tries to fix problematic image crops by not cropping pictures anymore","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="A4zU7W"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Time to Tweet those high res pics –– the option to upload and view 4K images on Android and iOS is now available for everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To start uploading and viewing images in 4K, update your high-quality image preferences in “Data usage” settings. &lt;a href="https://t.co/XDnWOji3nx"&gt;https://t.co/XDnWOji3nx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1384945690304995330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kp7iRF"&gt;In order to enable the new feature, users will have to go to the “data usage” section of the settings menu in the Twitter app and enable both “high-quality images” (for viewing 4K images) and “high-quality image uploads” (for tweeting them). Users can select whether they’d like the higher-resolution images to be enabled for both cellular and Wi-Fi, just Wi-Fi, or disabled entirely — similar options to how Twitter handles higher resolution or auto-playing video. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon One’s palm-scanning payments are coming to Whole Foods</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/llAxwqjmYI5iO1wIK8ztN7j6b10=/213x0:2403x1460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69165024/Screen_Shot_2021_04_21_at_2.41.16_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vCfg9W"&gt;Amazon One is &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-one-continues-expansion-now-available-as-a-contactless-payment-option-at-initial-whole-foods-market-store-in-seattle"&gt;expanding to its biggest area yet&lt;/a&gt;: the company is now testing its palm-scanning payment technology in Whole Foods, starting with a single store in Amazon’s home city of Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBVdiW"&gt;The company has been using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496673/amazon-one-palm-reading-vein-recognition-payments-identity-verification"&gt;Amazon One payment technology&lt;/a&gt; in its Amazon-branded stores in the Seattle area (including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493094/amazon-one-palm-recognition-hand-payments-amazon-go-store"&gt;Amazon Go&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321268/amazon-one-seattle-stores-palm-recognition-payment-technology"&gt;Amazon Books&lt;/a&gt;), but the Whole Foods rollout will make the most substantial expansion of the technology yet. The company says that thousands of customers have already signed up with Amazon One. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZYaFYi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s palm reading starts at the grocery store, but it could be so much bigger","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496673/amazon-one-palm-reading-vein-recognition-payments-identity-verification"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GPlx6n"&gt;According to an Amazon FAQ, the palm-scanning technology analyzes “the minute characteristics of your palm — both surface-area details like lines and ridges as well as subcutaneous features such as vein patterns” in order to identify a customer, allowing them to use the biometric scan as an alternative (and, theoretically, faster) method of checking out than fumbling around with a credit card or cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eSt5y"&gt;Customers will be able to register their palms at kiosks in the supported Whole Foods stores, allowing them to associate a physical credit card to that palm scan. (Amazon One users who have already registered may have to re-link their cards once to be able to use them at Whole Foods.) And of course, Amazon One users will be able to link their Prime accounts to their scans to get the subscription service’s discounts when shopping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fv4KHm"&gt;Amazon One will debut at the Madison Broadway Whole Foods in Seattle as an additional payment option for customers, with plans to expand it to seven other Whole Foods stores in the Seattle area over the next few months. Amazon hasn’t announced plans to further build out the palm-scanning payment system outside of the Seattle area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQmm7l"&gt;All of this, of course, assumes that you’re OK with Amazon building an ever-larger database of biometric information linked to its customers, something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496673/amazon-one-palm-reading-vein-recognition-payments-identity-verification"&gt;that some experts have raised concerns about&lt;/a&gt;. That’s particularly true given that Amazon’s data — unlike other biometric security systems, like Apple’s Face ID — is stored in on the cloud, rather than secured locally on a specific device. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chromebook users will soon be able to auto-caption any media playing in their browser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bO7JMaZ3Ova6imMC-CpEC5aQrXg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69164871/mchin_181029_4126_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I9y6oi"&gt;Google has announced &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebook-gets-a-little-more-helpful/"&gt;some new features&lt;/a&gt; coming to Chromebooks, including the company’s Live Captions feature that will be added to Chrome on “most” Chrome OS devices in the coming weeks. Once Live Captions are available, users can flip them on in the accessibility settings to get captions for any media with audio right inside their browser. The feature rolled out to Chrome on Windows, Mac, and Linux &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22337074/chrome-real-time-live-captions-audio-accessibility"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Kt1nQ"&gt;Google is also beefing up the Chrome OS Launcher, which lets you search for files and apps, with some new capabilities, allowing you make simple calculations and check the weather, the definition of a word, and stock prices. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BnZwiznehJdWtY7fZgREme0lLB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22460117/Launcher_inline_image_Cy9giIb.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Searching for weather in the Launcher.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GycipM"&gt;The search giant is also adding a new Diagnostics app to Chrome OS that lets you check the status of and run tests on your computer’s battery, CPU, and memory. That means that if your battery isn’t holding a charge for as long as you think it should, you can run a battery discharge test in the Diagnostics app to see if something’s wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRhYOM"&gt;The new launcher capabilities and the Diagnostics app weren’t available for a colleague of mine running Chrome OS, so they might not be rolled out widely just yet. We’ve asked Google for details about the rollout and will update if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple now lets you extend a Mac’s AppleCare Plus coverage beyond three years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s_ORDh_fFd5xujzyMXk79_D36Co=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69164763/vpavic_191118_3800_0201.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RfzyHE"&gt;Apple’s Mac computers typically come with a one-year warranty that you can optionally extend to three years by purchasing AppleCare Plus. The extended warranty also adds coverage for accidents and physical damage. But now, Apple is giving Mac customers the choice to keep AppleCare Plus going for even longer than the usual three-year limit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mxt5D7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/21/applecare-for-mac-extended-coverage/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;As noticed by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210580"&gt;a new support page&lt;/a&gt; that confirms people in the United States can convert AppleCare Plus into an indefinite annual subscription once the coverage they paid for upfront lapses. Apple says the recurring annual coverage must be purchased “within 30 days of the end date of your original coverage.” Once you’ve moved to annual billing, it renews automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AL5T5f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More peace of mind for you, more revenue for Apple&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T2Naeg"&gt;AppleCare Plus covers up to two incidents of accidental damage each year. Accident claims require a $99 deductible for a damaged display or external damage. More severe damage (like water incidents) have a deductible of $299. Either way, it’s far cheaper than paying for out-of-warranty repairs or buying a new Mac altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y61QbH"&gt;Presumably this new policy means that Apple will continue to support covered Macs for as long as it has repair parts for a given machine. Part of Apple’s terms and conditions on this says the company will automatically cancel your plan (and provide 60 days’ notice) if it doesn’t have the necessary parts anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaZ4JT"&gt;AppleCare Plus falls under Apple’s services division, so giving customers the option to stretch out their warranties means more peace of mind for them — and more revenue for Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Md6NwZ"&gt;Apple’s extended warranty for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch can also be converted into  continued monthly coverage for customers who bought upfront coverage, which normally covers those products for a total of two years. As with the Mac, the renewing coverage must be purchased within 30 days of the original coverage end date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft enables Linux GUI apps on Windows 10 for developers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nqwLizsuJPAuweze0P_p4nax7QA=/0x20:1219x833/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69164306/windowslinux.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PC7NJG"&gt;Microsoft is starting to allow Windows 10 testers to access Linux GUI apps. The first preview of support for GUI applications is available today for Windows Insiders, allowing developers to run GUI editors, tools, and applications to build and test Linux apps. It’s a significant extension for Microsoft’s Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), after the company added a full Linux kernel to Windows 10 last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4NeJF"&gt;While it has been possible to run Linux GUI apps within Windows previously using a third-party X server, official support from Microsoft means there’s also GPU hardware acceleration so apps and tools run smoothly. Audio and microphone support is also included out of the box, so Linux devs can easily test or run video players and communications apps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VL3C6C30KsPkiwyJLc9b3EzHT7c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22460021/linuxguiappswindows.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linux GUI apps running on Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nbbxu0"&gt;This is all enabled without Windows users having to use X11 forwarding and without users having to manually start an X server. Microsoft automatically starts a &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/the-initial-preview-of-gui-app-support-is-now-available-for-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-2/"&gt;companion system distro&lt;/a&gt; when you attempt to run a Linux GUI app, and it contains a Wayland, X server, pulse audio server, and everything else needed to make this work inside Windows. Once you terminate an app and WSL, then this special distro ends, too. All of these components combine to make it super easy to run Linux GUI apps alongside regular Windows apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDuZWm"&gt;Microsoft is also testing a new eco mode for the Windows Task Manager in this latest test build. It’s an experimental feature that lets you throttle process resources inside Task Manager. It’s really designed to rein in apps that suddenly start taking up lots of system resources, and it could be useful if you want to temporarily throttle back an app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z_SUo7b93WP0iaCARdiDo-IEeVg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22460025/task_manager_eco.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Eco Mode for Task Manager.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wLQmw1"&gt;If you’re interested in testing Linux GUI apps on Windows 10 or this new Task Manager feature, you’ll need to install the latest &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/04/21/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-21364/"&gt;Windows Insider build 21364&lt;/a&gt; from the Dev Channel. Be warned: these are designed as developer builds and not for machines you rely on daily.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple approved another secret gambling den, masquerading as a puzzle game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JRo5vHfFyT2XXx-D65QpbOI_JIw=/113x0:1531x945/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69164172/kosta_gambling_den_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xS4HkY"&gt;This morning, I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;how Apple’s $64 billion-a-year App Store isn’t catching incredibly obvious multimillion-dollar scams&lt;/a&gt; because the company isn’t even bothering to audit its most profitable apps for fraud, and how app developer Kosta Eleftheriou is showing the company how it’s done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Qb4Ts"&gt;But that’s not the only kind of scam Eleftheriou has been uncovering in Apple’s App Store — he has also discovered that Apple’s review teams have been approving games that transform into secret gambling dens when you access them from certain countries (or via VPN). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386533/ios-app-scam-jungle-runner-magical-forest-apple-kosta"&gt;We wrote about two of them last Thursday&lt;/a&gt; as if they were an isolated incident, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384407589539115011"&gt;he’s now found at least two more&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting this may be a trend — including a match-three puzzle game dubbed &lt;em&gt;Lucky Stars&lt;/em&gt; that turns into a casino if you open it in Russia, and a game called &lt;em&gt;Vegas Pirates&lt;/em&gt; that does the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ch7YAx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt; app pretends to be a game for kids 4+, but if you are in Russia (or use a VPN) it becomes an online casino that doesn’t even use Apple’s in-app-purchase system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleEvent?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AppleEvent&lt;/a&gt; scam of the day  &lt;a href="https://t.co/VU1XpaiILU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VU1XpaiILU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384407589539115011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="5AdBtR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The developer - “Marina Misko” - has several gambling apps, all posing as games for kids 4+  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These have been on the App Store for several months, and even had multiple updates approved by Apple! &lt;a href="https://t.co/iE8pbljeh9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iE8pbljeh9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384407629493989378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XeDpim"&gt;In some ways, they’re even more egregious examples: while it might be more shocking that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386533/ios-app-scam-jungle-runner-magical-forest-apple-kosta"&gt;a kids’ monkey-collecting-bananas game would transform into a gambling den&lt;/a&gt;, these new apps would seem to invite extra scrutiny with their gambling-oriented visuals and the fact they pretended a Russian news organization was their “developer website.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DkyAQM"&gt;

&lt;p id="IaTG06"&gt;Apple is testifying before Congress today — and in an incredibly high-profile court case against Epic Games next month — about how its App Store protects users, justifies the company’s traditional 30-percent cut (reportedly $64 billion last year alone), and shouldn’t be broken up. These kinds of discoveries are giving the company’s critics a lot of ammo.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Magic Leap CEO says second-generation headset will ship later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sUj4DTXHlGLXV93gBwjcXHFbAF0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69164124/jbareham_180717_2744_0422.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CQtiyp"&gt;Magic Leap CEO Peggy Johnson says the mixed reality headset company will be shipping limited quantities of a second-generation device at the end of this year, with broader availability in the first quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1a4H0Y"&gt;Johnson offered a timeline for the Magic Leap 2 launch in &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/magic-leap-peggy-johnson"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;She says the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/6/20998796/magic-leap-two-ar-headset-prototype-layoffs-low-sales-sundar-pichai-board"&gt;long-awaited device&lt;/a&gt; is half the size of the first-generation headset and about 20 percent lighter. It’s optimized for professional use and is designed to be wearable for long periods, and it’s supposed to double the Magic Leap One’s field of view. “For frontline workers, the product has to be something comfortable that they can wear all day long,” Johnson told &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eC5fAi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Magic Leap left the consumer market last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W9V1yB"&gt;Magic Leap has spent the past year transitioning from an all-purpose mixed reality company to a specifically business-focused one, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21274638/magic-leap-app-store-partnerships-update"&gt;following a mass layoff&lt;/a&gt; and the departure of founding CEO Rony Abovitz. Johnson, who stepped up as CEO in July 2020, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315864/magic-leap-new-ceo-microsoft-business-vp-rony-abovitz-step-down"&gt;a former Microsoft executive&lt;/a&gt; with a background in enterprise tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mnc1jk"&gt;Johnson told &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; that she sees a “massive” opportunity for enterprise AR headsets. But as&lt;em&gt; Protocol&lt;/em&gt; notes, Magic Leap will have to compete with Microsoft’s HoloLens, which has established a much clearer presence over the past few years. Microsoft was selected last month to supply the US Army &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360786/microsoft-hololens-headset-us-army-contract"&gt;with 120,000 HoloLens headsets&lt;/a&gt;, building on an earlier pilot program. (Johnson says the deal proves there’s lots of room for AR in general, not just Microsoft, to grow.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHPj6F"&gt;Magic Leap is leaving the consumer space just as Apple, Facebook, and Qualcomm — another company where Johnson once worked — are pushing products that bridge the gap between smartphones and full-fledged consumer mixed reality glasses. Apple is rumored to be unveiling a combination &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;virtual and augmented reality device&lt;/a&gt; aimed at developers, while Facebook has promised to launch “smart glasses” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;with Ray-Ban&lt;/a&gt; by the end of 2021. And Qualcomm is working with manufacturers, including Nreal and Lenovo, on “smart viewers” that can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296100/qualcomm-xr1-smart-viewer-ar-glasses-announce-lenovo-thinkreality-a3"&gt;project virtual screens into real space&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpsKxM"&gt;However, most of these companies can rely on other areas for revenue while they’re experimenting with consumer AR. Meanwhile, Johnson says she sees a more viable short-term future in areas like health care or military applications. “The devices are still getting there. They’re not quite right for consumers, but they’re perfect for the enterprise,” she told &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Hongqi S9 is the start of a new chapter in China’s automotive story</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dv07rxg71vWV1adW8HvXkLkiJoc=/18x0:1566x1032/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69164108/Screen_Shot_2021_04_21_at_10.08.33_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Silk-FAW&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aq3BDc"&gt;China’s original state-owned automaker, First Automobile Works (FAW), has &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hongqi-s-series-poised-to-capture-growing-demand-for-new-energy-sports-vehicles-301272143.html"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; the first electric vehicle that’s part of the government’s massive Belt and Road project. The Hongqi S9 is a 1,400-horsepower hybrid hypercar created in partnership with Italian engineering and design startup Silk EV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayxXkx"&gt;The car was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261795/silk-ev-faw-china-italy-electric-car-hypercar-s9-belt-road"&gt;first teased in February&lt;/a&gt;, but the two companies gave it a proper debut at Auto Shanghai 2021 this week. FAW and Silk EV are only making 99 of them and will start taking orders by the end of this year. They didn’t announce a price tag and also didn’t share many specs for the S9 (besides that the internal combustion engine will be a V8). It was designed by Walter de Silva, known for his past work with Alfa Romeo, Audi, Volkswagen, and Lamborghini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rxPERp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10458416"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eGNFDB"&gt;The S9 is meant to serve as a halo car above future fully electric vehicles that FAW will develop in China and in Italy as part of the joint venture with Silk EV — an effort &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/silk-faw-hongqi-s-series-electric-vehicle-venture-receives-strong-backing-from-consortium-of-leading-global-financial-institutions-in-china-301265438.html"&gt;that is backed by some of China’s biggest banks&lt;/a&gt;. It’s being developed under FAW’s Hongqi brand, or “red flag,” which the automaker first started using when it pretty much exclusively made cars for high-ranking Chinese government officials, including Mao Zedong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EtMAfD"&gt;FAW has said it wants to make Hongqi into China’s first global car brand. There are a number of electric vehicle startups trying to do the same thing — Xpeng has started shipping small volumes of its EVs to Europe, for instance — though they don’t have access to the same scope of resources that a state-owned automaker can tap. (FAW itself even backed one of these startups, Byton. But after Byton ran into financial trouble, FAW has since reportedly absorbed the startup, and offices in the US and Germany have been closed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9jTRR"&gt;And as part of China’s Belt and Road, which involves infrastructure projects of various sizes all across Asia, Europe, and Africa, the Silk-FAW joint venture has the benefit of becoming part of the Chinese government’s larger narrative for the initiative of creating diplomatic and economic opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C97pJQ"&gt;While Italy makes sense as a place to develop such a car, being the home of Ferrari and Lamborghini, it was also the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-china-president-idUSKCN1R40DV"&gt;first G7 nation to endorse the Belt and Road Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. So what is starting out as a curious, limited-run hypercar just may be the beginning of something much bigger with regards to China’s influence on the global market for electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This speaker uses dancing ferrofluid to visualize music</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A speaker that looks like a white cube with an illuminated glass circle in the center with a black blob inside. A hand is turning a small dial on the lower left side." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a32-TVK5oYe3yiqv4HijMBL7g-I=/128x0:1313x790/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69164095/Screen_Shot_2021_04_21_at_12.30.52_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dakd Jung’s ferrofluid speaker.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://youtu.be/pgp2sp0EB7w" target="_blank"&gt;Dakd Jung&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GaqTze"&gt;A speaker made by artist Dakd Jung, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/sound-reactive-bluetooth-speaker-uses-magnetic-ferroflu-1846729756"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, visualizes music with ferrofluid, a liquid filled with tiny magnetic particles. The ferrofluid, a viscous black blob, reacts to an electromagnetic device and dances around in sync with the sounds being played. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uzeXfp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgp2sp0EB7w?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HBNJ0E"&gt;The video shows Jung’s process for putting the speaker together: treating the glass container so the ferrofluid won’t stick, sanding the 3D-printed casing, and wiring up the electromagnetic device. The full prototype in action is a little less mesmerizing than his initial test that’s shown in the video because the blob breaks apart, but Jung says the speaker is still in development. He’s used ferrofluid in artworks before, including a &lt;a href="https://coso.tistory.com/category/Artwork/FERROR"&gt;huge ferrofluid panel&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://coso.tistory.com/category/Artwork/Pataphsical%20pond"&gt;ferrofluid “pond.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQJdGm"&gt;Ferrofluid was originally developed by NASA for moving fuel into rocket engines without the help of gravity. It didn’t work out for that purpose, but it did succeed in looking cool as hell and having other practical uses. It can be used for speaker dampers, as a lubricant in ball bearings, or as a sealant in hard drives. Some day it might even be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17449910/ferrofluid-magnetic-nanoparticles-biomedicine-nasa-invention-cancer-infections-neurons"&gt;used in biomedicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgokhX"&gt;The liquid has been used to visualize music before, like in the video below, but having it in a closed container is much more appealing because it’s a very messy substance. Plus it’s just more fun to have a lava lamp responding to your tunes than a vat of liquid chilling next to your speaker system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jztnZh"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Axwm-5zng0s?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Android 12’s third developer beta helps apps get more from cameras and haptic hardware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q0Db671QUk8cwdHrsu4mrYDocPs=/0x0:1350x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163990/android12.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0nh5eH"&gt;Android 12’s third &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12"&gt;developer preview&lt;/a&gt; has arrived, and among its host of updates are new OS-level tools to help app developers get more out of the camera and haptic hardware found in modern Android flagships. App launch animations, call notifications, and linking between apps are among the other tweaks made in this release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9ULvY"&gt;It’s a developer-focused beta, meaning much of this could change before Android 12’s full release later this year. However, it’s likely to be the last preview before Android 12 enters beta next month and receives &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371782/google-io-2021-date-announcement-virtual-online-event-date-android"&gt;an official unveiling at Google I/O&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the preview should provide some useful hints about Google’s priorities for the next major version of Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxddX7"&gt;First up, the preview gives developers more options for how to offer haptic feedback in their apps, an important development given the big strides Apple has taken with haptic feedback on its devices. Google says these new haptic feedback options should help with everything from UI events to effects in gaming. The APIs are optimized for the Pixel 4 at the moment, and Google says it’s working with other manufacturers to expand support across more devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7LRg1s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;App startup animations are getting an overhaul&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zq2Er3"&gt;There’s also better camera support for ultra high-resolution sensors, like those with Quad or Nona Bayer patterns such as the Galaxy S21 Ultra. Platform-level APIs will help developers make better use of these cameras, Google says, which should translate to better performance from third-party camera apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EiukKA"&gt;There are also a couple of tweaks to the general look and feel of Android. Call notifications are getting a new template to make them more visible, easier to understand at a glance, and more consistent with other notifications. The way Android handles links to specific apps is also changing to open your browser by default, rather than the standard app chooser dialog box. Finally, app launch animations are also getting a makeover, including new splash screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCBabi"&gt;There are also many more under-the-hood tweaks Google is making with the third developer preview, touching everything from how apps offer alarms, to machine learning and debugging options. If you’re a developer, you can grab the new preview now from &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/get"&gt;Google’s developer site&lt;/a&gt; for the Pixel 3 and newer (or else you’ll receive the new preview as an update if you’re already running the developer preview). The new preview is also available in Google’s Android emulator.&lt;/p&gt;
