    <title>Bang and Olufsen’s latest speaker disappears into your bookshelf</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VuFnBC2uAegi9TLsdcL8eDwFkh8=/0x1:1920x1281/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69129265/Beosound_Emerge_0037.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Emerge’s design was “inspired by the compact form factor of a book.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cXyBDB"&gt;Bang and Olufsen’s latest connected speaker is the Emerge. Its thin form-factor should blend right in to most bookshelves, and that’s no accident. In a press release &lt;a href="https://press.bang-olufsen.com/d/gKpSDxqk8eyT/news#/april-2021/bang-olufsen-introduces-beosound-emerge-an-incredibly-slim-yet-powerful-home-speaker"&gt;announcing the speaker&lt;/a&gt;, the company says its design was “inspired by the compact form factor of a book” with side panels that wrap around like a cover, and a logo on the front that’s meant to evoke a title printed on the spine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seJuu6"&gt;It’s a nice contrast from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/7/9470909/40000-speaker-bang-olufsen"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; of Bang and Olufsen’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/29/17795192/bang-olufsen-edge-speaker-price-release-date-ifa-2018"&gt;previous speakers&lt;/a&gt;, which have had huge, hulking form-factors that are hard to imagine in any normal home. Instead, the Emerge takes a similar approach to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726409/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-table-lamp-bookshelf-speaker-review-sound"&gt;Ikea’s Symfonisk speakers&lt;/a&gt;, which have pulled double duty as lamps or shelving to help them blend in with the rest of your furniture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ej1XNnSteAinXaMG66GaGIq6uyY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445488/Beosound_Emerge_0041.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get it? Like a title on a book spine?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jM8rD4"&gt;B&amp;amp;O says the Emerge speaker’s small form-factor shouldn’t make it a slouch in the sound quality department, however. “The vision for Beosound Emerge was to create the slimmest speaker possible that could still deliver full range, ultra-wide sound despite its size through its revolutionary driver configuration,” says the company’s head of product management Christoffer Poulsen. Internally there’s a triple-driver configuration consisting of a 4-inch woofer, a 1.45-inch mid-range, and a 0.6-inch tweeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZ5ETC"&gt;In terms of connectivity, the Emerge supports all the standards you’d expect out of a modern connected speaker. There’s Spotify Connect support, Bluetooth 5.0, Airplay 2, and Chromecast streaming, as well as a built-in microphone with Google Assistant support. Physical connections include a line-in/optical jack, Ethernet, and a USB-C port for power. And yes, you can pair two Emerge’s together to create a stereo pair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snGSOu"&gt;B&amp;amp;O says the speaker uses the same replaceable connectivity module that appeared in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22264409/bang-and-olufsen-beosound-level-modular-streaming-smart-speaker-bluetooth-airplay"&gt;recent Beosound Level&lt;/a&gt;, which will allow it to receive “new performance updates and features for years to come.” Eventually this module can be replaced if it gets outdated, B&amp;amp;O says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGB7po"&gt;The Bang and Olufsen Emerge is available in select European markets starting today, and will release globally this autumn. Pricing starts at £539 / €599 9around $717) for the black model, while the gold model which has an oak wood cover costs slightly more at £669 / €749 (around $879).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UBIzWt"&gt;We may never see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22296298/lg-rollable-denial-not-on-hold-or-cancelled"&gt;LG’s incredible rollable phone&lt;/a&gt; come to market, now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;its smartphone days are done&lt;/a&gt;, but at least the rollable TV we’ve been eagerly tracking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/9/16866060/lg-display-rollable-oled-tv-65-inch-ces-2018"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt; is finally making it to the United States. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fglobal%2Flg-signature%2Frollable-oled-tv-r&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F14%2F22384789%2Flg-rollable-tv-usa-united-states-price-release-date-availability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can now “inquire to buy” one&lt;/a&gt; at the company’s website, as spotted by &lt;a href="https://hdguru.com/lg-quietly-fielding-inquiries-in-u-s-for-rollable-oled-r-tvs/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HD Guru&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-rollable-oled-r-available-us-222137792.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98g18O"&gt;While the company doesn’t list a price, we highly doubt you’ll nab one for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21054005/lg-rollable-oled-4k-tv-shipping-price-release-date-ces-2020"&gt;the $60,000 originally promised&lt;/a&gt;; the motorized TV-in-a-box &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21524338/lg-rollable-tv-available-price-on-sale-korea"&gt;went on sale in South Korea&lt;/a&gt; last October for 100 million won, or over $89,000 in today’s US dollars. We also wouldn’t be surprised if you have to pay for more than just the TV itself, seeing how we reached the voicemail of a “custom integration specialist” when we called the provided number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijQ78S"&gt;While the rollable TV will be quite the conversation piece, you should also know it’s a couple years behind the times when it comes to certain specs and image processing. Then again, if you’re the kind of person who can afford one, you can probably retire to the bedroom when you crave more power, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/11/27/21723138/samsung-98-inch-tv-deal-sale-black-friday-8k"&gt;your 98-inch 8K set&lt;/a&gt; is no doubt ready to embrace you with every one of its 33 million pixels.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Goodbye, funky hacks: you’ll soon be able to download albums on the Spotify desktop app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/biwCHYYymRmaLMwyZlMKgHrfxxg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69127866/acastro_180213_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TI2zLe"&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-25/introducing-a-new-spotify-experience-across-desktop-app-and-web-player/"&gt;Spotify’s desktop app refresh&lt;/a&gt; seems to be rolling out to users, and it brings with it a very handy feature: album downloads. The app has supported downloading playlists to your computer for quite a while. The update should make it easier to keep your library managed if you want to keep the music going even when you’re offline. It is worth noting that this feature is limited to Premium subscribers — according to Spotify’s documentation, free users are only able to download podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PukiGg"&gt;Downloading an album works similarly to downloading a playlist: just navigate to the album’s page and press the download button. It should then be available the next time &lt;a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/listen-offline/"&gt;you go into Offline mode&lt;/a&gt;. This should make it easier to manage your offline library if you’re the type of person who’s very particular about what you want to listen to. (For example, I had a carefully curated playlist called “Downloads” that I would dump songs and albums into as a workaround to not being able to save individual things for offline listening.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pcd0e7zo3xrpiKlsp_bvUkhnkbI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444463/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now I can download individual albums and set my Downloads playlist free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zRVmau"&gt;The update also features tweaks to the look of the desktop and web player, as well as how playlist management works. It appears to be currently rolling out — some &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staff got it yesterday, others today. So if you’re not seeing it, just hang tight. You should see a screen letting you know that you’ve got the update.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A74ZJo4uGApYH1E0e467pzs6g1M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444480/image__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who doesn’t love offline use?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine pause continues as officials ask for more data  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Grubb’s Pharmacy" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y-UC2A2v8PuRvFHcyyAESVoqr8k=/0x0:4364x2909/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69127761/1232272873.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PLAw0r"&gt;Use of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine remains paused in the United States as officials gather more information about the rare clots reported in six people who got the shot. An independent advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it didn’t have enough information yet to say which groups might be at risk of the clots or to recommend who should get this vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxuo3v"&gt;“I don’t think we have enough information today,” said Grace Lee, associate chief medical officer for practice innovation at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital in California, during the committee’s meeting on Wednesday. The group will reconvene as rapidly as possible — likely next week — after gathering more data and evaluating that information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6G5E2F"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended Tuesday morning that the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381469/covid-vaccine-pause-blood-clots-johnson-fda-cdc"&gt;pause use&lt;/a&gt; of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine in light of six reports of unusual blood clots in people who got the shot. Although there is no proven relationship between the clots and the vaccine, and the events are probably rare, the agencies wanted time to investigate the reports and give doctors information on how to treat the condition. The agencies said Tuesday that they hoped to resolve the pause as quickly as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B2i8Dx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The agencies said Tuesday that they hoped to resolve the pause as quickly as possible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WVe4Dx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/14/johnson-johnson-vaccine-pause-whos-affected/"&gt;Underserved communities&lt;/a&gt; in the US are most affected by a Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson pause. The easy-to-store, one-shot vaccine was being used for homebound seniors, at pop-up clinics in rural areas, and for people experiencing homelessness. The effect of this pause on those groups was a serious topic of conversation during the meeting today. “This one and done vaccine that didn’t require the cold chain is a significant loss,” said Camille Kotton, the clinical director of transplant and immunocompromised host infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital. That group, though, might have the most challenges getting treatment for a clot if they do develop one, noted Helen Talbot, an associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9a2B3"&gt;The CDC received the six reports between March 19th and April 12th through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Unusually, all six patients had cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (a type of blood clot in the brain) in combination with low levels of platelets, a type of blood cell involved in clotting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="brVGST"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RRYHx1"&gt;The CDC was keeping a special eye out for reports of these clots because of the issues seen with the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/04/07/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-linked-to-blood-clots/"&gt;AstraZeneca vaccine&lt;/a&gt; in Europe and the United Kingdom, Tom Shimabukuro, a member of the CDC’s COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force, said during the committee meeting. “This is a really good example of how robust the US vaccine safety monitoring system is and how in this case, during a large-scale national mass vaccination program, the system worked in various functions exactly as planned,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ayk4lD"&gt;The COVID-19 working group at the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) met earlier this week to go over the reports. The six people who had clots were all young women. Even though they were rare, they occurred at a higher-than-expected rate in that group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9VQtd"&gt;Sara Oliver, an epidemic intelligence service officer at the CDC, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-04/05-COVID-Oliver-508.pdf"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; during today’s meeting that the working group noted how much we still don’t know about these clots. It’s not clear how often the combination of both the clots and low platelets would normally appear in the general population, which makes it difficult to say how far above the norm these reports are. We also don’t have a good sense of the risk factors for developing this condition. There also could still be more reports — nearly 4 million people received doses in the past two weeks, and those people are still in a window where a clot may occur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PUw8Kl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine isn’t the only shot available&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AlFICg"&gt;The group also noted that the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine isn’t the only shot available in the US. Officials aren’t seeing the same problems in people who got the Pfizer / BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. Only around 5 percent of vaccines given in the US so far were the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXQD1D"&gt;“We are very fortunate because we have multiple other alternatives in the US to end the health pandemic,” Talbot said. “We’re in a different position and can be more cautious.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2d8hb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVrUUD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 10’s Timeline feature is going away</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o-ts_3kNOlrALTUPkU-VhXmVJ1E=/16x0:2392x1584/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69127703/Screen_Shot_2021_04_14_at_5.21.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LEMbfp"&gt;Windows 10 is officially losing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/11/15610612/microsoft-windows-10-timeline-feature"&gt;once-ambitious Timeline feature&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft announced today. Timeline, first launched in 2017, was designed to make it easier for users to swap between multiple devices — transitioning seamlessly from a Windows 10 PC to an Android or iOS phone and back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87JrNs"&gt;It’s no surprise that Timeline is getting deprecated: it was a feature that heavily relied on Microsoft’s Cortana assistant, which would prompt users to resume tasks from device to device. Cortana was a particularly important part of building out the Timeline experience on iOS and Android devices, where Microsoft (obviously) had less control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uirryj"&gt;Given that Cortana’s prevalence in Windows has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349827/microsoft-cortana-shutdown-devices-ios-android"&gt;heavily diminished&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/16/20967875/microsoft-cortana-ios-android-app-removal-countries-support-document"&gt;the mobile apps completely discontinued&lt;/a&gt;, it makes sense that Microsoft would sunset Timeline as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3LIeX"&gt;The news was announced as part of the changelog for the &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/04/14/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-21359/"&gt;Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 21359&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0Kmr2M"&gt;If you have your activity history synced across your devices through your Microsoft account (MSA), you’ll no longer have the option to upload new activity in Timeline. AAD-connected accounts won’t be impacted. To view web history, Edge and other browsers have the option to look back at recent web activities. You can also view recently used files using OneDrive and Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="CquIKS"&gt;Insider build users should already see the changes once they’ve installed the new update, while users on the standard update track should see the removal of Timeline in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NUlxxV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:57PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft has changed its blog post and contacted us to say that Timeline is not actually going away, only “a capability within Timeline that is specific to roaming across devices.” But since the whole point of Timeline is roaming across devices, it still sounds like the feature as we know it is dying. We’re asking Microsoft for clarification. The company’s blog post now adds: “Note: Timeline and all your local activity history still remain on Windows 10.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="4hB9rh"&gt;Amazon, Apple, Google parent company Alphabet, and Facebook have joined hundreds of corporations, executives, and celebrities in signing a public letter today supporting voting rights and condemning legislation that would “restrict or prevent any eligible voter from having an equal and fair opportunity to cast a ballot,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/business/ceos-corporate-america-voting-rights.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50cX9m"&gt;The public letter appeared as a full-page ad in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;on Wednesday and was organized by former American Express credit card company executive Kenneth Chenault, Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier, and the Black Economic Alliance. You can see an image of the ad, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dgelles/status/1382293992705028100?s=20"&gt;shared by &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; reporter David Gelles&lt;/a&gt;, below: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The letter as it appeared in &lt;/em&gt;The New York Times&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vzXFDg"&gt;The text reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="sH9bz8"&gt;WE STAND FOR DEMOCRACY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zsTWEP"&gt;A Government of the people, by the people. A beautifully American ideal, but a reality denied to many for much of this nation’s history. As Americans we know that in our democracy we should not expect to agree on everything. However, regardless of our political affiliations, we believe the very foundation of our electoral process rests upon the ability of each of us to cast our ballots for the candidate of our choice. For American democracy to work for any of us, we must ensure the right to vote for all of us. We should feel a responsibility to defend the right to vote and to oppose any discriminatory legislation or measures that restrict or prevent any eligible voter from having an equal and fair opportunity to cast a ballot. Voting is the lifeblood of our democracy and we call upon all Americans to join us in taking a nonpartisan stand for this most basic and fundamental right of all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ePOjzB"&gt;Supporting voting rights is an unfortunately evergreen issue in the US, but this letter is particularly timely because of Georgia’s &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22352112/georgia-voting-sb-202-explained"&gt;recently passed SB 202&lt;/a&gt;. Georgia’s new bill puts more power over voter eligibility in the hands of Republican state officials and requires voters to provide personal ID when using absentee ballots, among other restrictions. The bill has been heavily criticized by activists, law experts, and other companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360514/microsoft-georgia-election-integrity-act-blog-brad-smith-voting-rights"&gt;like Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, which signed onto today’s letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKJViI"&gt;Other companies, like Coca-Cola, Delta, Home Depot, Walmart, and JP Morgan Chase declined to sign the letter, &lt;em&gt;NYT &lt;/em&gt;writes. Both Coca-Cola and Delta spoke out against the  Georgia law after being threatened with boycotts online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvuhAn"&gt;Statements like these are all fine and good, but when it comes down to it, saying you support voting rights with a national ad is the mega corporation equivalent of &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21359098/social-justice-slideshows-instagram-activism"&gt;reposting a social justice slideshow&lt;/a&gt; on your Instagram story. It can raise awareness and give people an idea of where a person or company stands, but it’s only committing to words and beliefs rather than actions. Companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, Netflix, Twitter, Facebook, and every other business signing this letter “vote” with their money. And history has shown that they’re either not willing to spend much — in the case of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21362540/racial-justice-tech-companies-donations-apple-amazon-facebook-google-microsoft"&gt;supporting racial justice&lt;/a&gt; — or have reportedly opposed stronger voter protection bills at the federal level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZeQ7O"&gt;Several of the companies that signed today’s letter (including Microsoft) are also members of the US Chamber of Congress, the trade association that &lt;a href="https://www.uschamber.com/letters-congress/us-chamber-key-vote-letter-s-1-the-the-people-act"&gt;recently urged senators&lt;/a&gt; to vote down a federal voting rights bill that passed in the House of Representatives, writes &lt;a href="https://thebrick.house/companies-signing-voting-rights-statement-are-members-of-anti-hr-1-lobbying-group/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sludge (&lt;/em&gt;part of the&lt;em&gt; Brick House &lt;/em&gt;journalism cooperative&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The bill, called the For The People Act or S.1/H.R. 1, aims to guarantee voter protections like automatic voter registration and mail-in ballots, even in states like Georgia with their own restrictive voting limitations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hegg5"&gt;Where do these companies actually stand, then? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coinbase is on the Nasdaq, in case you want to bet on cryptocurrency using dollars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B5AsioAuv4xFFq-MCKnIgxyqevg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69127478/acastro_181126_1777_bitcoin_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I1qHDV"&gt;The nice thing about Coinbase going public today is that if you want to get involved with cryptocurrency without ever leaving the almighty dollar, now you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hoyDnF"&gt;On Tuesday, Nasdaq &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coinbase-stock-price-valuation-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know-11618413312"&gt;set $250 as a reference price&lt;/a&gt; for Coinbase, though no one necessarily bought at that price because this is a direct listing. Coinbase closed trading today at $328.28, giving it a market cap of $85.8 billion, more than that of the company behind the Nasdaq exchange. It’s yet another marker for how normal cryptocurrency has become — and how much easier it is for normies to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWywO9"&gt;Recall, if you can, the early 2000s: banking crisis, panicked market, excited cypherpunks. The idea behind bitcoin was relatively simple: it emerged from a specific distrust of financial institutions. That &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166096/bitcoin-blockchain-code-currency-money-genesis-block-silk-road-mt-gox"&gt;early ethos evaporated some time ago&lt;/a&gt;, obviously — and now, the likes of Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk shill for bitcoin and have gotten their respective companies (Square, Tesla) to invest in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="APwFMW"&gt;Coinbase is part of the story, too. It’s one of the easiest ways to go from the dollar to cryptocurrency, and it’s now the largest bitcoin exchange in the US. If you were hesitant to deal with cryptocurrency itself — maybe because you were worried you’d put a wallet on a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/20/man-lost-127-million-worth-of-bitcoins-and-city-wont-let-him-look.html"&gt;hard drive and lose the hard drive&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html"&gt;forget the password&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/11/the-strange-tale-of-quadriga-gerald-cotten"&gt;something else&lt;/a&gt; — investing in Coinbase is a less risky way to get in on the trend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pnoj8V"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;BTC in 2012 was about $6. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$300k @ $6 = 50k BTC&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today 50k BTC = $3.2bn &lt;a href="https://t.co/JiOT7MXEl4"&gt;https://t.co/JiOT7MXEl4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Colin Platt (@colingplatt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/colingplatt/status/1382364944222535684?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IyT900"&gt;Maybe that’s the point. Because in theory, rather than going public on the stock market, Coinbase could have done an initial coin offering. You can productively think of an ICO as a cryptocurrency version of offering securities — the Securities and Exchange Commission &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ICO"&gt;often does&lt;/a&gt;. Had Coinbase done this, it would have offered a token that investors could have bought on cryptocurrency exchanges. That token could, in theory, substitute for stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sWJIc"&gt;But the fact that I’m writing about a direct listing tells you this didn’t happen. It’s possible that Coinbase’s investors wanted to go public rather than deal with an ICO because it’s more predictable. Maybe there were other considerations! Whatever the reason, this choice has given Coinbase a remarkable opportunity. Investors who don’t want to get involved in cryptocurrency directly but see upside potential can use their dollars to buy into Coinbase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ldxZE"&gt;It doesn’t hurt that Coinbase is profitable and &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-q1-earnings-report-monthly-active-users"&gt;just had a fabulous first quarter&lt;/a&gt;, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSlq4H"&gt;Using Coinbase as a proxy investment might also explain the valuation, which critics have suggested is too high. Some people have suggested that, as cryptocurrency matures, there will be &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/should-you-buy-coinbase-the-valuation-is-ridiculous-11618254467"&gt;less need for Coinbase’s services&lt;/a&gt;. Some say Coinbase’s fees may scare customers into &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coinbases-lofty-valuation-might-erode-as-crypto-markets-mature-11618047180"&gt;using other services&lt;/a&gt;. But if Coinbase is a proxy investment, then the underlying business isn’t all that’s going into the valuation. You might not make as much money investing in Coinbase as you could investing in bitcoin — but it might be less risky. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MyPillow CEO’s free speech social network will ban posts that take the Lord’s name in vain</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MyPillow and FrankSpeech founder Mike Lindell, seen outside the White House during the final weeks of the Trump administration." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ntspa7Np4JZ34nVlye9mwLk8PfY=/0x0:5279x3519/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69127313/1230603856.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kofcnW"&gt;After a public break with Facebook and Twitter, MyPillow founder Mike Lindell is getting close to the launch of a new conservative-focused social network, giving more detail on the project &lt;a href="https://frankspeech.com/"&gt;in a video posted online this week&lt;/a&gt;. Called simply “Frank,” the social network plans to open its doors to a limited set of users on April 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70oljN"&gt;Developed in the months since the 2020 election, Lindell &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7mw48/mike-lindell-mypillow-ceo-starting-vocl-social-network"&gt;has described the project&lt;/a&gt; as a combination of “print, radio, and TV,” offering both text posts and live stream capability. Perhaps the strangest promise is that conservative personalities will have significantly more followers on the fledgling network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQss00"&gt;“People are going to have more followers,” Lindell said in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RightWingWatch/status/1370072480233234432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1370072480233234432%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fen%2Farticle%2Fv7mw48%2Fmike-lindell-mypillow-ceo-starting-vocl-social-network"&gt;a March interview with Steve Bannon&lt;/a&gt;, “10 times more followers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CpkivG"&gt;In the more recent video, Lindell explained that the new network would still moderate against profanity and threats of violence — setting it apart from previous right-wing platforms like Parler and Gab, which prided themselves on their refusal to censor offensive speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpDveb"&gt;“You don’t get to use the four swear words: the c-word, the n-word, the f-word, or God’s name in vain,” Lindell says in the video. Instituting that policy will present a significant challenge to conventional automated moderation programs, which are adept at identifying specific strings of text but have no system to distinguish between devout and profane invocations of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49MRiE"&gt;To avoid deplatforming efforts from app stores, the Frank social network is formatted as a web app and accessed by navigating to the site from a mobile browser. This means it doesn’t have to comply with Apple and Google store guidelines, but it also severely limits the app’s functionality. The Frank site gives detailed instructions for how users can set up the Frank web app as a direct icon link (similar to an installed app) on mobile devices under both Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVOBWC"&gt;Lindell first announced the project on Bannon’s podcast in March, out of frustration with the mass deplatforming of claims that the 2020 election had been somehow stolen from Donald Trump. The new platform would avoid restrictions put in place by app stores, instead promoting “voices of free speech,” &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7mw48/mike-lindell-mypillow-ceo-starting-vocl-social-network"&gt;Lindell said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0yKOo"&gt;Despite extensive and well-funded investigations, advocates have produced no credible evidence of mass voter fraud in the 2020 election. Lindell is currently facing a $1.3 billion defamation case &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/22/dominion-sues-mypillow-ceo-mike-lindell-over-pro-trump-election-conspiracies.html"&gt;from Dominion Voting Systems&lt;/a&gt; as a result of his claims about the election.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook pulled the page for Bitche, France because it was not Nice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bCxh88mgjwGrdADd6mbVUQgoPrM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69127081/acastro_180806_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mptPQ9"&gt;A city in France has had a real rollercoaster of a week, after its Facebook page was accidentally deleted for violating the terms and conditions of the site. Of course, the city of Bitche, France (in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moselle_(department)"&gt;Moselle&lt;/a&gt; department in northeastern France) hadn’t done anything in particular to violate any of Facebook’s rules — it just sounded a whole lot like it did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ospCfs"&gt;According to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.radiomelodie.com/actu/15194-insolite-bitche-est-censure-par-facebook.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Radio Mélodie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;), Bitche’s troubles first began on March 19th, when the city’s official page — titled “&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/villefortifiee/?hc_ref=ARTnl7j6n5WTrt0WRPF2vTWSLbb7du0Cez4rcbWWyfpysKtz2neBKNcDfBywZePz5Lw&amp;amp;fref=nf&amp;amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAVBH229XvSPFmhSeyXLs484gxeF0Ebv8YECHMIols1wLBe5xny-cJLTr1ck6bTYjmuacWJ3EUJLru5BC95tXRPW8ANb7HKi8LW6F5N1QoPMjwulq8QcPtEZ9esMex0Ln7GUrNoV-NexXs6G6h1RGXv_pZfmVPaDK_FLxs2o5CYgG9kv-_fbhf9EZqEkR0SZ5fXUFjzALi3sMogOLq2VPR8yguHC7JEMmzOL4jmA-DF6UdHdlnVk_8REcK54k3WKaU8qZoNSwuQaDYwMp27mpdQwaxfG22aSdpw1xyOISVhio30ZoRSVw&amp;amp;__tn__=kC-R"&gt;Ville de Bitche,”&lt;/a&gt; which translates to the perfectly normal “City of Bitche” — was suddenly removed. Valérie Degouy, the city’s communication manager, attempted to contact Facebook to try to appeal the decision but was unsuccessful, and she eventually just made a new page titled “Mairie 57230,” after Bitche’s postal code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="efkK3M"&gt;“I tried to reach out to Facebook in every possible way, through different forms, but there’s nothing [I could] do,” Degouy said, explaining that she had already run into similar issues with the social media company when creating the page back in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1AZda"&gt;Following the viral coverage of the confusion, Facebook quickly reinstated the page on Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/bitche-facebook-france-scli-intl/index.html"&gt;telling CNN&lt;/a&gt; that it was “removed in error.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jafrc8"&gt;This kind of content moderation mix-up has been an issue on the internet for about as long as spam and profanity filters have been around. It even has a name: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scunthorpe_problem"&gt;the Scunthorpe problem&lt;/a&gt;, after a similar incident in 1996 that saw AOL censor the name of the British town of Scunthrope due to filters confused over an unintentional profanity found within the name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9KY5T"&gt;And while, yes, this is objectively funny, there are larger implications here. Another town in the region — Rohrbach-lès-Bitche — has preemptively changed the name of its Facebook page to ensure that it won’t be accidentally caught up in Facebook’s profanity filter. A Facebook page to be able to communicate with residents and tourists is too important of a thing to not have in 2021, but due to Facebook’s broken content filters, towns are forced to change their digital identity to simply stay online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RDBCkB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Towns are renaming themselves online to stop their Facebook pages from getting taken down. The entire world will one day be governed by Facebook's content moderation standards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Scunthorpe problem redux: the town of Bitche hits a snag)&lt;a href="https://t.co/kgObaNYteP"&gt;https://t.co/kgObaNYteP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— evelyn douek (@evelyndouek) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evelyndouek/status/1382322668238729219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="phMyRY"&gt;For its part, the city leadership seems to be taking the removal in good stride. A &lt;a href="http://www.ville-bitche.fr/site/medias/_pdfs/actualite/Communique_de_presse_Facebook_Ville_de_Bitche_republiee.pdf"&gt;statement posted&lt;/a&gt; by Benoît Kieffer, the mayor of Bitche, to both the reinstated Facebook page and Bitche’s official website acknowledges the difficulties of content moderation and points out the importance of using human moderators to help differentiate between false positives (like Bitche) and more serious offenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvuFr9"&gt;Kieffer goes on to ask Facebook to be more transparent and fair in how it makes these decisions, in addition to extending an invitation to both the head of Facebook’s French business as well as to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to visit Bitche for themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how the FBI managed to get into the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ubJSyKrsXz4QSd1LPgSAZ15x2Uc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69126966/acastro_190228_1777_vpn_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xXeuJq"&gt;The FBI partnered with an Australian security firm called Azimuth Security to gain access to an iPhone linked to the 2015 &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_San_Bernardino_attack"&gt;San Bernardino shooting&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/14/azimuth-san-bernardino-apple-iphone-fbi/"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reveals. Before now, the methods the FBI used to get into the iPhone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/6/11380204/fbi-iphone-attack-san-bernardino-secret"&gt;were kept secret&lt;/a&gt;. It was only clear that Apple wasn’t involved, as the company had refused to build a backdoor into the phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/17/11036306/apple-fbi-iphone-encryption-backdoor-tim-cook"&gt;kicking off a legal battle&lt;/a&gt; that only ended after the FBI successfully hacked the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feKSaT"&gt;The phone at the center of the fight was seized after its owner, Syed Rizwan Farook, perpetrated an attack that killed 14 people. The FBI attempted to get into the phone but was unable to due to the iOS 9 feature that would erase the phone after a certain number of failed password attempts. Apple attempted to help the FBI in other ways but refused to build a passcode bypass system for the bureau, saying that such a backdoor would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/28/11321700/apple-responds-fbi-iphone-hack"&gt;permanently decrease the security of its phones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2g2ZL7"&gt;After the FBI announced that it had gained access to the phone, there were concerns that Apple’s security could have been deeply compromised. But according to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, the exploit was simple: Azimuth basically found a way to guess the passcode as many times as it wanted without erasing the phone, allowing the bureau to get into the phone in a matter of hour&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ybmlH"&gt;The technical details of how the auto-erase feature was bypassed are fascinating. The actual hacking was reportedly done by two Azimuth employees who gained access to the phone by exploiting a vulnerability in an upstream software module written by Mozilla. That code was reportedly used by Apple in iPhones to enable the use of accessories with the Lightning port. Once the hackers gained initial access, they were able to chain together two more exploits, which gave them full control over the main processor, allowing them to run their own code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsFFRg"&gt;After they had this power, they were able to write and test software that guessed every passcode combination, ignoring any other systems that would lock out or erase the phone. The exploit chain, from Lightning port to processor control, was named Condor. As with many exploits, though, it didn’t last long. Mozilla reportedly fixed the Lightning port exploit a month or two later as part of a standard update, which was then adopted by the companies using the code, including Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyjrGn"&gt;In the end, not much happened as a result of the effort. The FBI &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/19/11463672/apple-fbi-san-bernardino-iphone-contents-no-leads"&gt;reportedly didn’t get any useful information from the phone&lt;/a&gt;, and the bureau never got to set a legal precedent about whether the government &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/29/11325030/apple-fbi-iphone-hack-security-encryption-what-comes-next"&gt;could compel companies to compromise the security of their devices&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/1/16393074/apple-iphone-fbi-hacking-tool-san-bernardino-case-secret-court-order"&gt;a judge ruled&lt;/a&gt; that the FBI didn’t have to reveal how it had gotten into the iPhone, or who had helped it, due to concern that the mystery firm would face cybersecurity attacks as backlash for helping the FBI if its identity was made public.&lt;/p&gt;
