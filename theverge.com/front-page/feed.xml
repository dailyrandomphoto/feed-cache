    <title>The days of knowing how big a movie is are seemingly over in a streaming-first era</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iJZUICiQF3YpwbKMXWuIT-HmPTk=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68912330/billie_eilish_doc.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0jz2Fx"&gt;Last week, &lt;em&gt;Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/streaming/22303848/billie-eilish-documentary-review"&gt;debuted on Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;. The documentary became the “biggest hit title for young adult audiences that Apple has had so far across its slate of films and TV series,” &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/billie-eilish-the-worlds-a-little-blurry-huge-global-ratings-apple-tv-plus-1234705943/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, drawing a “record-breaking 33 percent new viewers to the service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YM3Az"&gt;Sounds impressive, right? It would if Apple provided any kind of context for declarations like “biggest hit” and “record-breaking” subscriber adds. Instead, we’re left wondering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="s6ToRp"&gt;How many subscribers does Apple TV Plus have currently? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xTS31W"&gt;How many people actually watched &lt;em&gt;Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PWjS4R"&gt;How many of those new subscribers are on free Apple TV Plus trial plans? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="J8U8B7"&gt;How do those viewership numbers and subscriber additions compare to every other title?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="dzhb6w"&gt;Without any of this context, 10 million people could have watched &lt;em&gt;Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry &lt;/em&gt;or 10,000 people. I was one of them! But there’s a stark difference between those two figures. In a pre-streaming world, if the documentary was released in theaters or debuted on a network like MTV, there would be actual statistics. Weekly box office reports and Nielsen breakdowns exist to provide public insight into how well a movie or TV show is performing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFpEIm"&gt;It’s not just Apple either — with a stronger push to streaming, there’s no reason for companies to divulge numbers. As more original series and films premiere on streaming services, and as more films get taken out of theaters early to move onto a streaming service, the idea of what’s considered an official hit becomes much more difficult to track. Here are just some examples for the past few months: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oCeZBI"&gt;Hulu’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/15/21566042/trailers-fresh-prince-breach-black-beauty-happiest-season-pixar-netflix-hulu-hbo-disney"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happiest Season&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was the “most-watched film across all acquired and Hulu Original films” over its opening weekend. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="B7rIOw"&gt;Just a few weeks prior to &lt;em&gt;Happiest Season&lt;/em&gt;, Hulu’s &lt;em&gt;Run &lt;/em&gt;set the record for the “most-watched film ever on Hulu during its opening weekend.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="agw09I"&gt;HBO Max’s &lt;em&gt;The Little Things &lt;/em&gt;“quickly shot up to number one” in its opening weekend, according to WarnerMedia executive Andy Forssell. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jAzhcC"&gt;As of right now, there’s no reason for the companies to release numbers. It’s a pick ‘em on will strategy. A movie or TV show does astoundingly well, and that’s a good reason for a company like Disney or Netflix to send out a blast. (Video game publishers use a similar numbers-boasting strategy.) Netflix will note that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328481/netflix-franchise-movies-tv-shows-reality-tv-reed-hastings-ted-sarandos"&gt;99 million household accounts&lt;/a&gt; watched &lt;em&gt;at least two minutes &lt;/em&gt;of &lt;em&gt;Extraction &lt;/em&gt;within the first four weeks of its release. It sounds really good! It’s also, unfortunately, the most upfront a streaming service is about viewership. But how many people finished watching &lt;em&gt;Extraction &lt;/em&gt;compared to how many people might have thrown it on and decided after five minutes to just watch &lt;em&gt;The Witcher &lt;/em&gt;again or do something else entirely? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xyXlf"&gt;None of this matters to the streaming companies. Netflix has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238877/netflix-200-million-subscribers-q4-earnings-bridgerton-emily-paris-cobra-kai-queens-gambit"&gt;more than 203 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; and is growing. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278874/disney-plus-94-9-million-subscribers-q1-2021-earnings"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;, Hulu, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252069/hbo-max-subscribers-wonder-woman-1984-att-earnings"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253988/peacock-nbcuniversal-comcast-streaming-broadband"&gt;Peacock&lt;/a&gt; are also growing, based on quarterly earnings. Apple has never announced how many subscribers Apple TV Plus has, but third-party analyst firms have repeatedly pointed out that a significant portion of its subscriber base &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/apple-tv-plus-freeloader-problem-percent-free-1234890385/"&gt;is using free trial periods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A73SxA"&gt;The box office doesn’t dictate quality, but it does track global cultural phenomenons. As Todd Boyd, a professor of popular culture at the University of Southern California &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2012/12/17/167256415/no-1-at-the-box-office-four-reasons-why-it-doesnt-matter"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “they’re like some huge event that for many people is an option for them to say that ‘I participated in something that a lot of other people also participated in,’ and this allows them to be defined as part of a group.” In the case of &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, people rallied to try to make it the most successful film of all time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/2/20678706/avengers-endgame-avatar-box-office-marvel-disney"&gt;tracking daily box office numbers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2MQXH"&gt;Last year, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told analysts the company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21526664/netflix-movies-billion-dollar-box-office-blockbuster-ted-sarandos-earnings"&gt;making the equivalent of billion-dollar movies&lt;/a&gt;. The billion-dollar movie — a new &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fast and Furious&lt;/em&gt;, Marvel, or DC title — speaks to the power of a cultural phenomenon, of a true pop culture moment. It’s a sign of something celebrated and experienced with millions of other people around the world — people who went to a movie and likely sat through the entire thing. As &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-the-netflix-hit.html"&gt;Bilge Ebiri wrote at &lt;em&gt;Vulture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, having public data about people who watched an entire movie on Netflix or Hulu or HBO Max “tells us not just whether a movie or show made it to the right people, but also whether those people stuck with it or not — maybe even, gasp, enjoyed it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUBs5F"&gt;With the future of theaters so uncertain, this will only become a bigger problem being brought over to streaming platforms. Even less data will be made available about what swaths of people are watching. As a result, more viewing experiences will feel increasingly isolating. People like partaking in popular culture, in watching the hit that everyone else is watching — but figuring out what’s a hit and what isn’t is getting much harder to determine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHa1v0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnTwhQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfYnOg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jb6Otv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="mlkkez"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 4th, 2021 2:24PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;has stock available for both the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-S%2F606518560&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Series S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. You can find additional information &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22295709/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-restock-walmart"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZoKH5"&gt;The Xbox Series S and Series X consoles are officially out. Due to the pandemic, combined with the high demand for these consoles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551484/best-buy-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-store-sales-holiday-2020"&gt;retailers like Best Buy and Target are only selling online&lt;/a&gt;. That means you won’t be able to walk into a store to pick one up — unless you’ve purchased it already online. Only then will you be able to arrange an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5s3rFB"&gt;Until we hear updates on stock replenishing from retailers, I recommend keeping it locked to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H75RTZ8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;amp;tag=verge-evergreen-20&amp;amp;linkId=e8ef14f64e0e9e1dacba6db0add8b578&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fxbox-series-x-video-games%2F-%2FN-fd2hh&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpromotions%2Fgaming%2F20-1310%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, and (if you have memberships) &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-brand-showcase.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fprod24980179&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723309405282483811" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy encourages shoppers to visit its site&lt;/a&gt; to order instead of showing up at its stores. It doesn’t have set time slots for when it expects stock to be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVxesu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="hLH7PZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ejjLHa"&gt;If you’re trying to decide between the Xbox Series S or Series X, my colleague Tom Warren recently reviewed both consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cqFv0O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="hCC7LP"&gt;Buy with the Xbox All Access plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="tnxiJL"&gt;As an alternative to paying full price upfront for each console, you can pay a monthly installment for either of them through the Xbox All Access plan. It’s a financing option that lets you get the console upfront at no cost. You’ll be billed one monthly payment for the console and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate together ($24.99 per month for the Series S, $34.99 per month for the Series X) for 24 months.

    <title>The ‘deal with it’ glasses are being sold as an NFT</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Deal with it glasses and text" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ikpbQyor2KX-jgtSmS67z6kqKo=/0x425:1636x1516/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68912258/nft.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ryder Ripps&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vio5fY"&gt;Another iconic meme is going up for auction as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;an NFT&lt;/a&gt;: the text and sunglasses used to popularize “deal with it” GIFs. The auction is &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/0x592814ff14e030b51f6087032db0f88f4214f254/deal-with-it-2966"&gt;being held on the NFT platform Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and bidding is currently at around $8,000, with more than five hours remaining at the time this article was published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E8uQMo"&gt;The meme was listed by Ryder Ripps, the designer / creative director / “&lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/ryder-ripps-cia-redesign"&gt;art prankster&lt;/a&gt;” who recently made headlines for falsely claiming to be behind the dystopian redesign of the CIA’s website. (Ripps told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the claim was a joke and “so obvious if you have your cerebral cortex functioning.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5qEIo"&gt;Ripps does, at least, appear to be closely connected to the “deal with it” meme, even if the decade-old image’s exact provenance is difficult to fully verify. The glasses and text were popularized in 2010 on the image sharing site Dump.fm, which Ripps co-founded, and the memes were created using a Photoshop template uploaded to the site. “I made that,” Ripps said. (He added that ownership over the meme “is too stupid to lie about.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sN2mup"&gt;Crucially, this is not the original “deal with it” image, but the template that helped to popularize putting the text and glasses on just about anything. The &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/deal-with-it"&gt;deal with it dog&lt;/a&gt; predates Dump.fm, but Ripps’ site &lt;a href="https://rhizome.org/editorial/2010/jun/28/new-from-dumpfm/"&gt;was credited&lt;/a&gt; with helping the format emerge into a meme. A bunch of early uses of the meme can still be seen rounded up &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100628023619/http://dump.fm/m/dealwithit"&gt;on an archived page&lt;/a&gt; from the Dump.fm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kzgyrG"&gt;What’s unique about Ripps’ auction is that he isn’t just selling a copy of his work, he’s also selling “the full rights to this image &amp;amp; meme and the Photoshop template used to create it.” NFT sales — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287956/nyan-cat-crypto-art-foundation-nft-sale-chris-torres"&gt;such as the one for Nyan Cat&lt;/a&gt; — typically offer buyers ownership of a copy of an image, as though they were buying a physical painting, while artists still keep their intellectual rights. “I don’t agree with that personally,” Ripps said. “It just feels strange to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zoezmg"&gt;So Ripps’ auction will hand off complete control of the “deal with it” template. The sale potentially complicates matters for meme creators, since a countless number of GIFs rely on his image, which someone else will now control the rights to. It’s also unclear to what extent Ripps can even sell “full rights” to the broader meme. The sunglasses imagery was around before he made the template, and the meme has continued to have an expansive life beyond the now-defunct pages of Dump.fm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sbePmX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"},{"title":"Nyan Cat is being sold as a one-of-a-kind piece of crypto art","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287956/nyan-cat-crypto-art-foundation-nft-sale-chris-torres"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2TQntP"&gt;Ripps said he isn’t worried about someone taking ownership of his template and using it to assert control over the meme. “I think that’d be an interesting chapter in internet history,” he said. “What’s the worst thing that happens if they do that? Someone has to take down a deal with it meme? Who cares? There’s more memes in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCpm8T"&gt;In the past, Ripps has rejected the idea that one person can control a meme. “Do I care? Do I want credit?” &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@ryder_ripps/why-the-fat-jew-shouldn-t-have-apologized-eed0f7c5721f"&gt;Ripps wrote&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;em&gt;Time &lt;/em&gt;used the phrase “Deal with it” on its front cover in 2015. “No. I think its super cool! ... This type of unfettered sharing is what the internet has &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; been predicated on.” (The term “deal with it,” likewise, &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/deal-with-it"&gt;predated Ripps’ use of it&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agAq6w"&gt;NFT sales have been blowing up over the past couple weeks. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287956/nyan-cat-crypto-art-foundation-nft-sale-chris-torres"&gt;Nyan Cat&lt;/a&gt; sold on Foundation for about $592,000 in cryptocurrency at the time of sale. The digital artist Beeple is &lt;a href="https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/first-open-beeple/beeple-b-1981-1/112924"&gt;currently auctioning&lt;/a&gt; an NFT at Christie’s, with bidding now at $3.5 million with a week to go. And just about &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/kings-of-leon-to-release-new-album-as-nft-with-tokenized-tickets-for-superfans"&gt;anyone else&lt;/a&gt; with a product to move is trying to get in on the hype.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I tried the Nuggs, and they tasted like memes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Some nuggets sitting in front of a Nuggs box, which has an image of a chicken being offered a nugget." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wSiBSLUs0sFVQBo3T_kYAgl-36A=/0x540:2393x2135/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68912189/NUGGS_box_nuggets.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Behold the Nuggs.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Simulate&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Every version of the chicken simulation&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Cfe7le"&gt;“Welcome to the simulation” read a card inside the package sent to me by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsimulate.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22308229%2Fsimulate-nuggs-fake-chicken-plant-based-memes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Simulate&lt;/a&gt;, the company responsible for the Nuggs brand of plant-based chicken nuggets. Inside the package, nestled among some dry ice, were what looked like several specimen bags. Each bag contained two Nuggs, from version 1.0 to version 2.0 with six versions in between. They were each carefully labeled: “Project: The Verge. Variant: V.1.6.” As I transferred the cargo to my freezer, I felt less like I was putting away some groceries and more like I was participating in a lab experiment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JVhd0"&gt;That’s the kind of energy Simulate is going for. Its branding is simultaneously silly and self-serious, and it’s deliberately steeped in internet culture. The &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/nuggs/"&gt;Nuggs Instagram&lt;/a&gt; is almost entirely memes, with product announcements interspersed sparingly. “The name Nuggs is funny to most people, so we kind of leaned on that,” says Ben Pasternak, the company’s founder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tkLFCN"&gt;Jokes aside, Simulate, founded in 2019, is part of an industry where the competition is only getting more serious. Meat alternatives have been around for decades — Morningstar Farms was founded in the mid-1970s — but the last few years have seen an explosion of similar products as companies have gotten better at mimicking meat. A combo platter of advanced food tech and concerns about the sustainability of factory farming has made more people than ever willing to give not-meats a try. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAnb1a"&gt;The giants are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22193672/beyond-meat-ceo-interview-ethan-brown-decoder-podcast"&gt;Beyond Meat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192336/impossible-foods-ceo-interview-vergecast-podcast-plant-based-meat"&gt;Impossible Foods&lt;/a&gt;, both of which make plant-based patties that are meant to be as indistinguishable from beef as possible, going so far as to make them “bleed.” In the chicken nugget space, &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/2020/2/4/21122370/kfc-beyond-chicken-nuggets-fake-meat"&gt;Beyond Meat paired up with KFC&lt;/a&gt; to offer plant-based nuggets at select locations of the chicken-based chain. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetforgrieve/2020/09/18/morningstar-farms-courts-kids-with-vegan-nuggets-shaped-like-mickey-mouse/?sh=17f3a43e5170"&gt;Morningstar Farms recently partnered with Disney&lt;/a&gt; to bring Mickey-shaped nuggets to the freezer aisle. Even Big Chicken companies like Tyson have &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/13/tyson-foods-unveils-plant-based-nuggets-in-move-into-meat-alternatives.html"&gt;plant-based offerings&lt;/a&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIvhbk"&gt;Which brings me back to Simulate, Pasternak, and my freezer full of experimental Nuggs. Pasternak sees Tyson as competition, but he’s more interested in putting his nuggets head-to-head with its chicken-based products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwivRx"&gt;Unlike other companies that keep most of their development behind closed doors, Pasternak says he wants to “operate from a place of truth,” showing everyone the changes Simulate’s recipe has gone through. When I was offered the chance to peek inside the lab (virtually) and try every single version of the company’s Nuggs, I figured why not. You know, for science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYiVoR"&gt;Each version of Nuggs comes with release notes, similar to software updates. “Nuggs 2.0 includes fixes and improvements,” says the Simulate site. “Enables a close to indistinguishable chicken flavor.” You can only buy the latest version (in this case, Nuggs 2.0), but &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsimulate.com%2Freleases%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22308229%2Fsimulate-nuggs-fake-chicken-plant-based-memes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the notes for each past version&lt;/a&gt; live on the site. Looking through the notes while eating each Nugg added some fun insights to my experience. Version 1.5, which “enable[d] decreased sodium content,” did indeed taste less salty than Version 1.4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L29cFj"&gt;Pasternak began his career building software, which explains why software updates show up in Simulate’s branding. He thinks of Simulate as a nutritional company with a software framework, where new iterations of the product are constantly being developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A skinned nugget sits on the side of a microscope while a nugget sliver is in the slide." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/34Z2XRFxMSu6qeT7jTsRREm3QFk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342542/Image_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Simulate&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Nugg ready for examination.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NKMumt"&gt;And there have been plenty of iterations. Doug Henderson and Bob Schultz, the Simulate food engineers who spend their days poking and prodding simulated nuggets, say that for every version of Nuggs released, there were hundreds more&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;tested in the lab. They use devices that press, squeeze, and tear the Nuggs to measure and track tiny changes in their cohesiveness, chewiness, and springiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27uwEm"&gt;Between Versions 1.6 and 2.0, they put together a database of every plant-based meat product on the market so they could track and compare them to Nuggs. The constant testing and comparison led them to switch from pea protein — which Schultz says is an “immature technology” with several texture and flavor issues — to wheat and soy proteins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBvbpv"&gt;My own judgment of the Nuggs was much less rigorous. I have not eaten a nugget that originated from an actual chicken in about 14 years, and I therefore am less than qualified to say how close in taste and texture Nuggs and chicken nuggets are. I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; say that my face journeyed from a grimace at a strange aftertaste in Version 1.0 to a contented nod at the crunch of Version 2.0. I didn’t get to experience the Simulate &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsimulate.com%2Fsauce%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22308229%2Fsimulate-nuggs-fake-chicken-plant-based-memes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BBQ sauce&lt;/a&gt;, but I did divide my duos of Nuggs for a highly scientific taste test. For each version, I tried one Nugg plain; these were my control group. I added hot sauce to the other for an extremely research-driven reason. (I really like hot sauce.) The verdict: they are very good vehicles for hot sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rx6Bty"&gt;I’ve never been particularly interested in products that aim to perfectly re-create meat. The idea grosses me out, even though I appreciate the novelty. But Pasternak sees Nuggs as a product that should appeal to all people, vegans and meat lovers alike. (Though the current price of $35 for 50 Nuggs might dissuade people in either camp.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The hands of two people, crossed at the wrists, holding nuggets that are almost touching. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-DcvwB3zDnKfeZB8JZqUBF_Ry3o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342576/NUGGS_2020_0495.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Simulate&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These nuggets are not here to proselytize.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rx05IP"&gt;Part of Simulate’s brand mission is to remain “non-preachy.” The people behind the company aren’t pushing a specific vegan or vegetarian agenda — “We wanted to not use any of the V words,” Pasternak tells me — they just want to make a good nugget. “We don’t want to tell anybody that this is a healthy food,” says Schultz, “we just want it to be the best chicken nugget experience you possibly can have.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1voH2N"&gt;That makes sense since plant-based doesn’t automatically equate healthy. “We didn’t evolve to eat ultra processed foods and these meat substitutes are ultra processed foods,” says Marion Nestle, a Nutrition and Food Studies professor at NYU. “People would be much better off eating real food.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gl66wB"&gt;Other experts take a softer stance: these aren’t health foods, but they are at least healthier than real nuggets — which, for the record, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/12/robert-c-baker-the-man-who-invented-chicken-nuggets.html"&gt;were also developed in a lab&lt;/a&gt;. Nuggs are processed, but they’re lower in cholesterol, a major contributor to heart disease. “If you’re taking that cholesterol out, and you can provide consumers with an alternative, then why not?” says Jillian Semaan, director of food and environment at Earth Day Network, an environmental activism nonprofit. As the Simulate site boasts, Nuggs “kill you slower.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UMFdzX"&gt;Simulated meats are also better for the planet, says Semaan. There’s no livestock involved when making meat from plants, meaning there’s &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22287498/meat-wildlife-biodiversity-species-plantbased"&gt;less land required&lt;/a&gt; and no &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#methane"&gt;greenhouse gas burps&lt;/a&gt;. “We need to take a closer look at how we’re using our resources,” she says. Whether it’s Nuggs or other plant-based foods, “it’s kind of a no-brainer when it comes to having a sustainable place for all of us to live on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="do6M3C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People are taking a closer look at what they’re eating”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vk26ps"&gt;Pasternak hopes that simulated meats will become more popular than their animal-based counterparts in the next few decades. Semaan isn’t sure the tide will turn so quickly, but she does see a shift happening. “I think people are taking a closer look at what they’re eating, how food is grown, and what foods that they can consume,” she says. “That’s going to be for the betterment of themselves and the planet.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFLb2Y"&gt;I could pretend otherwise, but I really wasn’t thinking much about the planet, or my own health, while I was munching on the different variations of Nuggs. My deepest thoughts were more along the lines of “This first version tastes like a shoe,” and “There’s a nice amount of seasoning in this breading.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="P2IsGg"&gt;Personally, when I’m staring down the shelves in the grocery store, taste and ease of preparation are further toward the front of my mind than a product’s environmental impact. Ultimately, even after going through the entire experiment, I still don’t know if Nuggs taste like chicken or if they will be the future of sustainable food. But I did find that they were enjoyable enough to eat when a hankering for nuggets strikes — along with some hot sauce, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

The goal is to provide a reliable, secure connection for business customers without having to worry about sharing bandwidth with the rest of the household. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mV9Kd"&gt;Home Office Internet is an extension of the LTE-based &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18275640/tmobile-lte-wireless-home-internet-service-pilot-launch"&gt;wireless home broadband consumer service&lt;/a&gt; that’s being piloted now, and it works in basically the same way. Users receive a router and can self-install the network. It uses 4G and 5G signals and, like the consumer service, includes a potentially important caveat: customers are subject to deprioritization slowdowns at times when the network is busy. That’s an annoyance for anyone but would be particularly bad for customers trying to conduct business on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUSuHp"&gt;Home Office Internet will be available to businesses starting March 22nd, and at launch T-Mobile says 60 million households will be covered. The company aims to expand that to 90 million households by 2025. T-Mobile didn’t share any updates on the consumer home broadband service, which remains in testing in certain markets.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alphabet’s moonshot lab is working on a device to give people superhuman hearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gZVl1Fv4fsPzQIBNNGqm32VJVGM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68911891/acastro_180130_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jfsUUg"&gt;Alphabet has attempted to take on some wild projects over the years, like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21513353/alphabet-google-x-lab-moonshot-computational-agriculture-mineral-revealed"&gt;crop-sniffing plant buggy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161029/tidal-moonshot-sustainable-fish-farms"&gt;fish-tracking cameras&lt;/a&gt;. But now, its X lab is working on a device that could give people superhuman hearing. As &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-x-alphabet-hearing-project-wolverine-codename-augmented-reality-2021-3?international=true&amp;amp;r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt;, the project, codenamed “Wolverine,” is exploring the future of hearing through sensor-packed hardware. The team, members of which spoke to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; anonymously, say they’re currently trying to figure out how to isolate people’s voices in a crowded room or make it easier to focus on one person when overlapping conversations are happening around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Su9XxP"&gt;They’ve already iterated on the device multiple times, including devices that covered the whole ear and others that protruded from above the ear. These iterations have been large because the team incorporates lots of microphones into the build, but newer versions are smaller, &lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;says. Multiple people from hearing technology companies have joined the team, including talent from Starkey Hearing Technologies and Eargo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBb93v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; says the Wolverine team’s goals most closely align to that of &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/whisper-announces-35m-series-b-to-change-hearing-aids-with-ai-and-subscription-model/"&gt;Whisper&lt;/a&gt;, a company that came out of stealth last year. That team has managed to isolate sounds through a “sound separation engine,” which adapts to wearers’ environments. This suggests the lab’s goal isn’t to just create a device everyone would want, but rather an enhanced hearing aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJaBh7"&gt;Alphabet’s team isn’t focused on just one device or one use case, &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; says. The team is looking to build a successful business with multiple devices and models, so if they’re successful, you might start wearing Google-owned hearing aids.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart will have PS5 and Xbox Series X restocks available today </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qs7kgLsOEhwKsUYeWKWCzsOZ_wM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68911732/vpavic_4261_20201023_0068.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Due2Rh"&gt;Both the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X / S gaming consoles will be back in stock at Walmart later today. A Walmart spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the retailer will have the consoles available for purchase again at 11:30AM PT /  2:30PM ET for the Xbox Series X / S and  12PM PT / 3PM ET for the PS5. As usual, stock will likely not last very long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hp1rKY"&gt;Walmart plans to have inventory for the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Console%2F363472942&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition%2F493824815&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-S%2F606518560&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series S&lt;/a&gt; gaming consoles, with prices ranging from $300 to $500 depending on the model you purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7jDvaI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6H8DPb"&gt;If you plan to buy a PS5 console, there are a few additional items you should pick up to get the most out of your new console. I recommend picking up a second &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DualSense-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC6C75Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt;, which is necessary for any in-person multiplayer action. I suggest that early adopters also subscribe to &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you a few perks, such as access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zo7xb2"&gt;No option to expand PS5’s SSD, but it is likely coming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;later this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YwqpDB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="2xum71"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GzvvrT"&gt;If you are buying either an Xbox Series X or Series S, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF248LD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;additional controller&lt;/a&gt; is likely a good purchase. And unlike the PS5, you can purchase a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB SSD expansion&lt;/a&gt; to add to the Xbox’s base storage (512GB on the Series S, 1TB on the X), though it is not cheap. If you are having trouble deciding on what games to buy, you can always buy a subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you access to a slew of digital games and access to Xbox Live Gold. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenHaystack is a new open-source tool that lets you create DIY AirTags on Apple’s Find My network</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="OpenHaystack" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RWv4gZcgIkCpqVS0u4KSp5A2mEM=/155x0:1748x1062/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68911699/OpenHaystack_Screenshot.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OpenHaystack&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dzuy7b"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking"&gt;promised to open up its Find My app to third-party accessory makers&lt;/a&gt;. But ahead of that, there’s a new tool that will let anybody make their own Bluetooth tracking tag to use with the Find My network so they can track its location. &lt;a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack#installation"&gt;OpenHaystack&lt;/a&gt; is a new open-source tool developed by security researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/seemoo/seemoo/index.en.jsp"&gt;Secure Mobile Networking Lab&lt;/a&gt;, who have essentially reverse-engineered the way Apple devices register themselves to the Find My mesh network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEZeQU"&gt;It is, in short, a way to create your own DIY AirTags today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zlLXv"&gt;OpenHaystack works via a custom Mac app that can be used to track the location of custom tags that you create. As of right now, the tool has direct support to make a tracking tag using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/8/8910685/bbc-micro-bit-final-design-giving-away-to-kids"&gt;BBC micro:bit mini computer&lt;/a&gt;, though other Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device support could be added by other developers in the future. Once registered on Apple’s Find My network, the OpenHaystack app will be able to report the tag’s location just like Apple’s Find My app works for iPhones and other Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvYYZC"&gt;The whole system is a bit of a hack — in the sense that it’s complex, not in the sense that it’s actually hacking anything. It uses a plugin for Apple Mail (which authenticates you as a genuine Apple user) to get the necessary access to Apple’s Find My network to create and locate the keys — so Mail needs to be running for OpenHaystack to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPS6sM"&gt;There don’t appear to be serious security implications for the Find My network itself, either (though the team has &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211849"&gt;submitted other bug reports to Apple&lt;/a&gt;). That doesn’t mean you should just go ahead and start using OpenHaystack, however. There’s an important disclaimer on the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XbBH78"&gt;OpenHaystack is experimental software. The code is untested and incomplete. For example, OpenHaystack tags using our &lt;a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware"&gt;firmware&lt;/a&gt; broadcast a fixed public key and, therefore, are trackable by other devices in proximity (this might change in a future release). OpenHaystack is not affiliated with or endorsed by Apple Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GB48S3"&gt;A high-level understanding of how the security model for Find My works also helps understand why OpenHaystack is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToMNk7"&gt;Find My works by using a combination of public and private keys. Any Apple user can access the public keys for devices in the Find My network, but you need the private key in order to actually access location information. This means not even Apple can access your location information without your private keys. The network is possible because Apple devices communally track the public keys, but only users can get location data from private keys.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="How OpenHaystack gets on the FindMy network" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LbLNvcqV7Wz51mhNC1yaLl405Nk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345345/FindMyOverview.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OpenHaystack&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How OpenHaystack gets on the Find My network.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n70MOz"&gt;What OpenHaystack does is create one of those public / private key pairs for your own Bluetooth tag and uses Apple Mail to register it in the Find My network. To Apple, it just looks like another iPhone. The Mac app then accesses the public key database, pairs it with the private key you created, and bam: secure location data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byvR9j"&gt;From the way it’s designed, it seems like it might be difficult for Apple to cut off OpenHaystack easily without also cutting off a bunch of older Apple devices. However, it’s also surely true that Apple as a company won’t like the whole thing and may try to find a way to block it. A developer could use the system to create a way to add Android devices to the Find My network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnABVp"&gt;The team behind OpenHaystack has written a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02282"&gt;paper detailing its methods&lt;/a&gt; and disclosing a now-fixed security flaw. It also released the &lt;a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware"&gt;source code for its firmware&lt;/a&gt;, which other developers could use to adapt OpenHaystack to other BLE devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhvZGZ"&gt;Apple’s &lt;em&gt;official&lt;/em&gt; support for third-party accessories is still coming. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2FP-AUC002%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22313461%2Fopenhaystack-apple-find-my-network-diy-airtags" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Belkin has already announced a set of earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that will support Find My. Given how complex the setup of OpenHaystack is, it probably won’t gain mass adoption. It’s similar in some ways to AirMessage and Beeper, two tools that use Mac utilities to redirect iMessages to Android devices. Apple’s ecosystem is locked down in any number of ways, but the Mac finds a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TTDZk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Edge gets a speedy startup feature and vertical tabs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4zY-MrbIlFQelBwXBgl55xWO5FU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68911586/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IysseP"&gt;Microsoft is rolling out some new improvements to its Edge browser this month. While the software maker announced vertical tabs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199819/microsoft-edge-vertical-tabs-feature-chromium"&gt;nearly a year ago&lt;/a&gt;, the feature is finally making its way to all Edge users this month. You’ll be able to stack tabs at the side of the browser instead of the traditional long list of tabs at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9B0b4"&gt;The vertical tabs feature looks ideal for 16:9 screens, and you can click to switch between tabs or group some together. It arrives just weeks after Microsoft implemented a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242622/microsoft-edge-new-themes-icons-sleeping-tabs-feature"&gt;sleeping tabs feature in Edge&lt;/a&gt; that’s designed to automatically release system resources for inactive tabs when you have a large amount of tabs open. This prevents Edge tabs from hogging memory and CPU resources.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HAL6kyE4ZaTVsng3d3C7TTmwbsc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345218/W10_20H2_Laptop_Edge_Vertical_Tabs_16x9_en_US.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Edge vertical tabs feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="52NsHz"&gt;Microsoft is also improving the startup experience for Edge this month. A new startup boost feature is rolling out that makes browser launches up to 41 percent faster after rebooting a device. “Initial tests show startup times improve from 29 percent to 41 percent with this feature,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=175340"&gt;says Liat Ben-Zur&lt;/a&gt;, a Microsoft executive working on the company’s “Modern Life” initiative. “Startup boost will be automatically enabled this month and you can access your browser settings menu to personalize Microsoft Edge even more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUUyLZ"&gt;If, somehow, you’re still using Bing and haven’t switched to Google, Microsoft is also improving how search results work from Edge. Results for popular searches like recipes will soon include improved visuals. Big topics like “giraffes” or “Kenya” will also aggregate visual results into an infographic at the top of search results. These new search results should be available in the US in the “coming weeks,” according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zNC8PrAESp3Cc8PMnFT4PaxoxiI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345225/Recipes_GIF.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Bing search results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BDOWbx"&gt;Finally, Microsoft Edge users will also see a new history view in the browser this month. When you navigate to history it will soon drop down from the toolbar instead of heading into the settings section. It should be a lot easier to search, open, or manage search history now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUjsiu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="fsjjC0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;’s newest DLC characters, Pyra and Mythra from &lt;em&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles 2&lt;/em&gt;, will be available in the game on Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210304005310/en/"&gt;Nintendo announced&lt;/a&gt;. They’re included as part of the second &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; Fighters Pass, or you can buy them separately for $5.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xewWl3"&gt;Series director Masahiro Sakurai showed off the new fighters in a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/XeDBCgDSiB4?t=1771"&gt;video presentation Thursday morning&lt;/a&gt;. Pyra’s moves do more damage while Mythra moves faster and jumps higher, and you’ll be able to switch between the two fighters whenever you want during a match. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="8QMenK"&gt;If you get the new fighters, you’ll also be able to play on a new stage from &lt;em&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles 2&lt;/em&gt;, the Cloud Sea of Alrest, where you ride on the back of a giant monster traveling through the sky. Pyra and Mythra also come with new songs from &lt;em&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
