    <title>Public vote counting starts for Amazon union drive in Alabama</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lcYviW"&gt;The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has begun publicly tallying votes for a proposed Amazon workers’ union in Alabama, which would be the first of its kind nationwide. The count, conducted over Zoom, may not include all potentially eligible ballots, but it will offer an early look at the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3K9XGn"&gt;The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) announced yesterday that 3,215 ballots were received from the roughly 5,800 workers at BHM1, a fulfillment center located in Bessemer, Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTIPbH"&gt;Amazon workers at Bessemer cast their ballots by mail in February and March, and the official counting process began on March 30th. Representatives can challenge individual workers’ eligibility to vote, and those ballots won’t be counted during this tally — but they could be deemed eligible later and potentially affect the election’s outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdpDQH"&gt;BHM1 opened in March of last year, and the union effort began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;taking shape&lt;/a&gt; not long after.  Employees were frustrated with the company’s strict and automatically enforced productivity metrics, the grueling pace of work, and an atmosphere many describe as dehumanizing and disrespectful. Amazon has faced criticism over these issues nationwide. Last month, it further inflamed controversy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365330/amazon-apology-pee-bottles-worker-warehouse-union-pocan"&gt;by falsely denying&lt;/a&gt; that its workplace standards led workers to urinate in water bottles rather than take bathroom breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="16uMsM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Organizers say they’re frustrated with a dehumanizing workplace&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yyc9kF"&gt;A group &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;reached out&lt;/a&gt; to the RWDSU, which represented workers in nearby poultry plants and other businesses. By November, organizers had gathered enough signatures to petition the NLRB for an election, which was held by mail due to the pandemic. Voting began in early February and ended Monday, March 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNfX3d"&gt;Amazon has always &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/technology/amazon-unions-virginia.html"&gt;fiercely resisted&lt;/a&gt; unionization: &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/10/6/21502639/amazon-union-busting-tracking-memo-spoc"&gt;tracking&lt;/a&gt; workplaces for signs of organizing, contracting with union-busting consultants, and firing workers who protest working conditions. Though some of the company’s warehouses are unionized in Europe, where labor laws make organizing far easier, only one other warehouse in the US has even made it to a vote before BHM1, and that was only a small group of 30 repair technicians at a Delaware warehouse. And &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/16/business/workers-at-an-amazon-warehouse-reject-forming-a-union.html"&gt;they lost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkDLIG"&gt;The BHM1 drive, in contrast, is huge: about 5,800 workers. It’s not just the biggest union vote at Amazon. It would be the largest group of workers to gain representation in the US in &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-a-win-at-amazon-would-be-labors-largest-in-20-years"&gt;three decades&lt;/a&gt;, a major victory for organized labor after years of decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u36jyw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I have never seen Amazon fight for something like this.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tSy3Pu"&gt;Amazon fought the effort aggressively, advertising heavily, holding mandatory anti-union meetings, and sending workers multiple texts per day. It argued against holding the vote by mail, and it &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/08/amazon-bessemer-mailbox-union/"&gt;pushed the US Postal Service&lt;/a&gt; to install a mailbox near the warehouse just before the start of voting, a move labor organizers suggest may have influenced votes and could be grounds for a challenge if they lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4su06N"&gt;The company even had the county change the timing on a traffic light leaving the warehouse parking lot — a measure Amazon says was meant to alleviate congestion during shift change but that organizers say deprived them of an important venue for canvassing workers. “I have never seen Amazon fight for something like this. I have never seen them try to push for something this hard before,” a longtime Amazon employee previously told&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="piqPfR"&gt;Amazon has opposed the Amazon union effort at every step so far, and it will have further chances to do so. Employers often stonewall in negotiations over a first contract, sometimes for years, in an attempt to outlast the employees who pushed for it and discourage others from organizing. If Amazon follows this route, organizers will likely have to use protests, political pressure, and other measures to get Amazon to negotiate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJymTS"&gt;Attention will also turn to labor activism elsewhere in Amazon. For years, organizing at Amazon warehouses consisted primarily of informal protests. While they won occasional victories over specific issues, like altering &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-workers-who-petitioned-for-paid-time-off-claim"&gt;time-off policies&lt;/a&gt; or getting fired workers reinstated, the Bessemer vote shows that unionization offers a possible way to lock in more durable improvements. The RWDSU recently said it has been contacted by over &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-19/amazon-workers-inspired-by-alabama-weigh-union-drives-elsewhere?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;1,000 Amazon workers&lt;/a&gt; interested in unionizing since the BHM1 campaign began. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKQbpN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZEj3e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6abxEm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aL3yPR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onhs5q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNBvn7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFPeMQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cycling legend Greg LeMond on his new e-bikes, his failed partnership with Trek, and the future of cycling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JDZTl1MJCTrOSnEcZepxP0tJ38=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69097386/Greg_Prolog_Away.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three-time Tour de France champion Greg LeMond has a new e-bike venture.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo courtesy of Greg LeMond&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;LeMond’s new e-bikes will be among the most lightweight bikes in the industry&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ice5cU"&gt;It shouldn’t come as a shock, but electric bikes can weigh a ton. It’s not uncommon for an e-bike to tip the scales at 50 pounds or more. Electric cargo bikes are even heavier, topping out at 80–90 pounds. So for anyone looking for something more in the flyweight category, here comes three-time Tour de France champion Greg LeMond with a handsome new lineup of battery-powered bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ihmQCI"&gt;LeMond unveiled his first two models earlier this year: there’s the high-step frame Prolog and the more accessible Dutch with a step-thru frame. Both are extremely lightweight, which LeMond says comes from his desire to buck the trend of heavier (and usually more powerful) e-bikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEeR6Y"&gt;“I truly believe in e-bikes and how it will change people’s lives from a health perspective,” LeMond told me in an interview late last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vujamf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I truly believe in e-bikes”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A2KTNB"&gt;The frames of both bikes are made of carbon fiber, including the forks, fenders, and seat posts. Depending on your opinion about carbon fiber, this is either really great or merely okay. Racing enthusiasts love carbon fiber bikes, while riders who use their bikes for daily transportation or off-roading tend to prefer something stronger, like aluminum or titanium. Also, carbon is more expensive to manufacture, which usually results in higher prices for consumers. But LeMond has his own carbon fiber business, LeMond Carbon, which shares some employees with his bike company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wP5VZT"&gt;LeMond’s new e-bikes are undeniably attractive — that pink paint job is so winsome, I really love it — but are probably not what many people would expect from the two-time Road Race World Championship winner (1983 and 1989) and three-time Tour de France champ (1986, 1989, and 1990). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="30F3WE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10436289"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tl3esB"&gt;For one, they’re not drop bar-sporting speedsters designed for doing circuits at the velodrome. Rather, LeMond is taking aim at urban dwellers who want a durable e-bike to help get them around a city but who also may need to carry their bike up and down a flight of steps and don’t want to get weighed down by a bulky battery and motor. These are city bikes with integrated batteries and rear-hub motors from Mahle, a German automotive supplier that also makes electric drivetrains for Specialized and a host of other bike companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9mc90"&gt;That doesn’t mean there won’t be any racing bikes in future lineups, the cycling champ said. “We still are coming out with performance bikes,” LeMond said. “We are not getting away from my DNA, but that’s going to play probably a secondary role with our e-bikes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZWlkt"&gt;As the only American to win the Tour de France &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/sports/cycling/armstrong-stripped-of-his-7-tour-de-france-titles.html"&gt;without the use of performance-enhancing drugs&lt;/a&gt;, LeMond is considered by many to be among the greatest American cyclists of all time. He is undeniably one of the great all-around cyclists of the modern era and an icon of the sport’s global popularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greg LeMond and his son Geoff working on the design of their new e-bikes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iptA3x"&gt;LeMond first encountered electric bikes seven years ago when a friend from the Netherlands who works for Japanese bike manufacturer SunTour let him test out some of the company’s electric motors. The experience, he said, was “transformational.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7tbx9"&gt;“The only thing that comes close to being like a bionic person, you know,” LeMond said. “&lt;em&gt;The Six Million Dollar Man&lt;/em&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxgHMo"&gt;The Prolog (pronounced like “prologue”) was originally slated for a February 2021 release but didn’t end up shipping until late March. At 26 pounds (11.8 kg), the Prolog finds itself in the same category as Gogoro’s similarly lightweight Eeyo 1S — and it will fall in that upper-tier price bracket as well, with a price starting at $4,500. (Like I said, carbon fiber ain’t cheap.) The Dutch, with its low-step frame and mustache-shaped handlebars, will come out later in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iDy2F"&gt;With the LeMond name emblazoned on the side, the performance is obviously a top consideration. The Prolog’s motor kicks out 40nm of torque, which is less than the 60nm of torque provided by the Brose S Mag motors on the similarly priced Serial 1 e-bikes from Harley-Davidson, but more than the 20nm torque provided by the Eeyo 1S’s 250W Smartwheel motor (although Gogoro claims its Smartwheel actually puts out 50nm). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z81xS0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bike has a top speed of 20 mph, thanks to a 36-volt / 250-watt power supply&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ql0WwO"&gt;The bike has a top speed of 20 mph, thanks to a 36-volt / 250-watt power supply, which is fed by a nonremovable 250 watt-hour battery. The amount of boost delivered can be adjusted with three levels of power assist. The cranks, derailleurs, chainrings, and brakes are from Shimano. The bikes roll on 30cm Panaracer GravelKing Slick+ tires and Token aluminum rims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejqvQY"&gt;There is a range of add-ons that will make the bike fancier and more expensive. You can add Shimano Di2 electronic shifting ($800), LeMond carbon rims laced to Tune hubs ($1,800), a front basket ($185), a rear rack ($185), fenders ($185), and a range extender ($700).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZydAg"&gt;The bike has a very clean look, with all the wiring fed through the frame. There will be three frame sizes: small, medium, and large. And both bikes have integrated lighting in the front and rear that feed off the internal battery.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y3y4bd1nk-PdlFhuCOXathI81cE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430270/LeMond_Process_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo courtesy of Greg LeMond&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I spent eight years defending myself,” LeMond said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1sg15F"&gt;LeMond launched his first bike company in 1986, and since then, his career as an entrepreneur has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride. According to &lt;em&gt;Bicycling &lt;/em&gt;magazine, this is currently the fourth iteration of LeMond Bicycles. One previous version was a licensing deal with Trek that ended poorly, with Trek asking a federal court to dissolve its partnership with LeMond citing “inconsistent business dealings.” LeMond responded by suing Trek, which the Wisconsin-based company characterized as containing false and irresponsible allegations.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;A spokesperson for Trek did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLm0xK"&gt;For his part, LeMond claimed that Trek “literally tried to destroy my business, which they did. They put me out of business.” That said, he said he wishes he had handled the Trek partnership differently. “I spent eight years defending myself. My only regret was not cutting ties much sooner and then instead of defending myself, hoping to repair a relationship, I would have gone on my own,” he said. “Instead of being in a defensive mode, I would have been in an offensive mode, building something rather than trying to protect something that probably wasn’t going to sell anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2SXnh"&gt;He continued, “This was all a strategy for Trek to kind of basically paint me as a bad business person, and that stuck. It’s sad, but people will have their own opinion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZTdmyM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This was all a strategy for Trek to kind of basically paint me as a bad business person, and that stuck.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OxtQAE"&gt;The original plan for his new venture was to manufacture the e-bikes out of a 65,000-square-foot facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, but that plan appears to be on hold. Most e-bikes are built in China, and initially, LeMond’s bikes won’t be any different. He hopes to also add a production line in Sweden, while some of the components, like the lights, fenders, and baskets, will be manufactured in Tennessee. Eventually, the goal is to have production lines up and running in three continents: the US, Europe, and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrWJpu"&gt;“I don’t want to speak too quick, but we are going to bring some amazing things up in the next 12 months,” he said. “These are made by us. This is not an outsourced deal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzVTcP"&gt;LeMond insisted that all of the speed bumps he has hit in his post-racing life have been extremely minor. “The hard part for me is I’m not just a person; I’m a business,” he said. “So there’s been some contractual disputes... and that’s it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LBSyCw"&gt;This new venture, and these new bikes, offer a chance at redemption for LeMond. His racing career is in the rearview — and e-bikes, he said, are the future of cycling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="KDlaLx"&gt;“We’re real,” he said. “For real. We’re not just marketing or graphic design, which most companies are. Some are just outsource companies. We are literally assembling things. We are making these bikes.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Lenovo’s new gaming phone break spectacularly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jYbUyj2JSZaG9nRAMU6Tjzpi6QQ=/1x0:1975x1316/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69097225/jerryrigeverythinglenovophoneduel2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz_vxrm8rjM" target="_blank"&gt;JerryRigEverything&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kdq8qN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22372613/lenovo-legion-phone-duel-2-release-date-price-specs-fans"&gt;Lenovo’s new Legion Phone Duel 2&lt;/a&gt; is a gaming phone that has two USB-C ports, a pop-up camera, and even built-in fans. There’s so much tech inside that Lenovo decided it’d be best to shove its most crucial, hard-working components into the middle of the phone, making it easier for the fans to keep it all cool during gameplay. As a result, it’s thicker in the middle, flanked by two batteries. That didn’t seem like a huge red flag at first. If anything, it seemed clever — that is, until &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Jz_vxrm8rjM"&gt;YouTuber JerryRigEverything&lt;/a&gt; got ahold of the phone (via &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/08/lenovos-new-gaming-phone-snaps-in-half-like-a-graham-cracker/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rj8Tmw"&gt;As part of the channel’s signature rigorous testing of durability, each device is eventually bent to see how much flex it can withstand before breaking. Most devices can hold up but usually not without some bent metal or snapped glass along the way. The Legion Phone Duel 2 didn’t take well &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; to being flexed, not even a little bit. At around the 8:40 mark in the video, shortly after the host said “I’m not even remotely concerned about it breaking,” it satisfyingly snapped at the antenna line that meets the raised middle section, compromising the phone’s ability to power on. With little force, the host also broke the other side to illustrate the lack of structural integrity in the design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oLENnd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Two speakers, two fans, two batteries, two pieces”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1hXUCX"&gt;Lenovo’s device isn’t necessarily an outlier compared to other recent gaming phones the channel has tested. The Asus ROG Phone 5 (similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;Ultimate model that I recently reviewed&lt;/a&gt;) also &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Dqi9QGyRWGk?t=456"&gt;broke during the test&lt;/a&gt;, despite having a more cohesive design. That said, it did appear to require more force to break than Lenovo’s new phone. I’m no engineer, but it seems like splitting the battery in two might be part of what’s to blame for the fragility, as this is how Asus’ latest phone is arranged internally, too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYwqcm"&gt;As different as the Legion Phone Duel 2 looks compared to some other gaming-centric phones, it comes at a high $950 price. And its somewhat fragile design might eventually cost you even more down the road if you need to find a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u1abRj"&gt;Charging is a common concern with electric vehicles. But some owners of the brand-new Mustang Mach-E have run into a peculiar problem: their electric SUVs won’t start even when the main battery pack is full. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZo9Q7"&gt;That’s because, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has learned, there’s a problem with some early Mustang Mach-E SUVs that involves how the much smaller 12-volt battery gets charged. It’s the latest in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311594/ford-mustang-mach-e-delays-quality-free-charging-cash-back"&gt;growing&lt;/a&gt; line of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316055/ford-mustang-mach-e-recall-loose-bolt-delivery-delays"&gt;small issues&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/ford/2021/01/16/ford-mustang-mach-e-delivery-delay/4189265001/"&gt;have come to light&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356539/ford-connected-charge-station-sales-halt-issue-mustang-mach-e"&gt;rollout of Ford’s first long-range electric car&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MhWNpU"&gt;As is the case in other electric cars, the Mustang Mach-E keeps its 12-volt lead-acid battery topped up by essentially sipping power from the much larger lithium-ion battery pack. Based on owners’ accounts &lt;a href="https://www.macheforum.com/site/threads/deep-sleep-mode-12v-battery-drained-dead-update-mach-e-jump-started.3457/page-42"&gt;across&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.macheforum.com/site/threads/how-to-add-access-ports-for-lvb-connection-points.4107/"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; forum threads, including one who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the problem is this stops happening whenever the Mustang Mach-E is plugged in to charge up the larger battery pack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZdiTG"&gt;That is especially an issue for owners in areas with cold weather, as Ford encourages them &lt;a href="https://owner.ford.com/support/how-tos/ev/driving-tips-to-increase-electric-vehicle-winter-range.html"&gt;to leave their Mustang Mach-Es plugged in&lt;/a&gt; so the SUVs can use power from the grid to warm up before driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YLzNZo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford says a “small number” of vehicles are affected&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oKw3Wt"&gt;The 12-volt battery powers many of the Mustang Mach-E’s systems (since the larger battery pack is high-voltage), and so when it dies, the electric SUV cannot be started. When this happens, owners have reported the FordPass app says the vehicle is in “deep sleep” mode. Some forum members have started referring to it as the “electric brick” problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8j5oj"&gt;Ford recently filed a technical service bulletin with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that &lt;a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/tsbs/2021/MC-10189793-0001.pdf"&gt;confirms the problem&lt;/a&gt; has to do with the software on the powertrain control module. Ford wrote that this only affects Mustang Mach-E SUVs built on or before February 3rd, meaning it’s possible that dozens are affected. (Ford would only say that a “small number” of the nearly &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/498351/us-ford-mache-sales-q12021/"&gt;7,000 Mustang Mach-Es delivered in the first three months of the year&lt;/a&gt; have the issue.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9sOnc"&gt;Right now, those owners cannot get the fix via an over-the-air update. The company said in a statement that they’ll have to bring their Mustang Mach-Es to a dealer: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="lIo2Oe"&gt;We are aware that a small number of Mustang Mach-E owners have had their 12V battery reach a low voltage condition. We proactively worked with early owners experiencing this issue to identify the root cause and a fix. In the rare instances where this still occurs, customers can now contact their local EV-certified Ford dealer to have the matter resolved.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nCdrJF"&gt;Ford did tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the problem will be fixable via wireless update “later this year” and that Mustang Mach-Es currently coming off the line should not be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vo9WQi"&gt;It is possible to jump the 12-volt battery, just as you would jump-start an internal combustion car. But it’s not nearly as straightforward, especially because the battery is located behind the Mustang Mach-E’s front trunk, and the hood’s electronic latch is powered by the low-voltage battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="rZxwfS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s possible to jump-start the Mustang Mach-E, but it’s not easy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GMBeD0"&gt;To first open the front trunk then, owners &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKK_Vt1m5TA&amp;amp;t=51s"&gt;have to open a panel in the front bumper&lt;/a&gt; that contains two leads, which can be used to jump the front trunk’s electronic hood latch. Then they have to pull back a panel underneath the hood to find the battery — though even at this point, some owners have had trouble accessing the leads on the 12-volt battery and have &lt;a href="https://www.macheforum.com/site/threads/how-to-add-access-ports-for-lvb-connection-points.4107/"&gt;had to cut through the vinyl&lt;/a&gt; to jump-start the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gxv651"&gt;Ford offers free roadside assistance with the Mustang Mach-E, too, so owners have this as an option if they need to get their electric SUVs towed to a dealer. The roadside assistance is also supposed to include 12-volt battery jump starts, &lt;a href="https://www.fordservicecontent.com/Ford_Content/Catalog/owner_information/2021-Ford-Mustang-Mach-E-Owners-Manual-version-1_om_EN-US_09_2020-1.pdf"&gt;according to the owner manual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Take a ride on this man’s model train set</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hpAhMhDP0rV4GOmW_NY3YSVBHUk=/1009x0:4894x2590/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69096932/Screen_Shot_2021_04_08_at_9.56.23_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XZWWj9"&gt;Some people spent the pandemic writing the next &lt;em&gt;King Lear&lt;/em&gt;, others lamenting the fact that they weren’t. &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/4/17/21201878/quarantine-productivity-social-distancing-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19-capitalism-ep-thompson"&gt;It doesn’t really matter&lt;/a&gt;. There are plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22167393/pandemic-tech-tiktok-zoom-facetime-google-2020"&gt;inspiring pandemic projects&lt;/a&gt; to go around, but one of the most striking (and brain-breaking) has to be &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQTfo32EjvY"&gt;this model train video&lt;/a&gt; created by Jason Shron of the YouTube channel &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/rapidotrains/featured"&gt;Rapido Trains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIr15j"&gt;Shron is a devoted train enthusiast and talented model maker. But his model train project re-creating the Canadian VIA rail line connecting Toronto to Montreal is really a treasure only a lot of time (due to COVID-19 lockdowns) and passion (from a lifetime appreciation of the rail) can create. Just look at this video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C0qDL5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fQTfo32EjvY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2fk0dq"&gt;That’s footage shot from one of Shron’s model trains, superimposed over the window of a human-scale VIA train model. It looks, concerningly, like a rail train ride. But you might now be wondering: where did Shron get a human-sized model train? Well, he built that, too — in his basement: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2ZxRCI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YjMnWdIWjWs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VdulKp"&gt;You have to commend the attention to detail here. Not only do the models look great — Shron sourced real train seats and other equipment for his human-sized re-creation — but the sound design really sells it. The last time I rode a train was over a year ago now, but the gentle air-conditioned hum, soft creak as the train rides the tracks, white noise of other people talking, and sudden whoosh of another train passing is unmistakable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJ72v2"&gt;It’s almost too real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5q8Hm"&gt;Consider the implications: if Shron can re-create a train line to almost perfect scale (and a human-sized train car for that matter), where does it stop? Why not a model home with a model train set inside? Or a model town containing the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJKYa0"&gt;I’m not talking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/20/18150216/welcome-to-marwen-review-steve-carell-robert-zemeckis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to Marwen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; I’m more thinking &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIizh6nYnTU&amp;amp;t=16s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Synecdoche, New York&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe we were so focused on wringing our hands about the frankly ridiculous popularity of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837874/elon-musk-says-odds-living-in-simulation"&gt;simulation theory&lt;/a&gt; that we ignored the other kind of simulation theory. That a kind man with a deep respect for one of the greatest forms of human transportation (don’t text airplanes, my phone is off), could have built a perfect, fake world around us without us ever knowing. Because then, what’s really real, you know? Am I? Are you?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tj6zpq2pc8jGpwah5egX8mdTJ9I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430085/jason_shron_in_his_basement_railcar.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The smiling face of a brilliant hobbyist OR the man who runs our small model world? You be the judge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oryHJM"&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQTfo32EjvY"&gt;the video is very relaxing&lt;/a&gt;. You should give it a watch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony Pictures movies will stream first on Netflix instead of Starz</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8CHsSAwphIAbIj5uoWkwDgI92O8=/3x0:275x181/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69096887/spiderman.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CWVpDv"&gt;Sony Pictures has signed a new deal with Netflix that will see the streamer become the exclusive home of films like &lt;em&gt;Uncharted &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Morbius &lt;/em&gt;when they finish their theatrical and home video runs beginning in 2022, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/netflix-sony-pictures-pay-1-starz-output-1234946413/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQBU60"&gt;The new deal sees Netflix replace Starz as Sony’s partner for the “pay one window” for what &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; says is a “recording-setting price tag.” Netflix is an obvious choice for Sony, given that the company already has a pay one deal for its animated releases. But the new deal is far more comprehensive and will see Sony’s theatrical films from its Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures Classics, Screen Gems, and TriStar Pictures studios all head to Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vnx1ny"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Starting in 2022, Netflix will be the first US streaming home for Sony Pictures films following their theatrical releases. Get ready for UNCHARTED, MORBIUS, BULLET TRAIN &amp;amp; WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING, plus future sequels to VENOM, JUMANJI, BAD BOYS &amp;amp; SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE&lt;/p&gt;— NetflixFilm (@NetflixFilm) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixFilm/status/1380226536729583616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HobZZl"&gt;It’s the kind of deal that’s increasingly rare to see in the world of cinema, given that companies like Disney (which previously had a similar $300 million deal with Netflix from 2016 to 2019) and Warner Bros. are skipping pay one deals to send their films directly to their respective in-house Disney Plus and HBO Max streaming services. And NBCUniversal — which currently has pay one deals with Netflix for its Universal films and HBO Max for its animated Illumination lineup — is reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360819/nbc-peacock-movies-hbo-netflix-universal-studios-illumination-entertainment"&gt;mulling a similar change&lt;/a&gt; that would funnel its movies to Peacock instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGDCmS"&gt;The new deal will also give Netflix a first look at any of Sony’s original movies that it’s looking to send directly to streaming (although Sony will still be able to sell to competitors if Netflix passes). Netflix is committing to buying an unspecified minimum number of movies, however. Additionally, the streaming company will also license older movies from Sony’s library to be available on Netflix, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCJueP"&gt;“At Sony Pictures, we produce some of the biggest blockbusters and the most creative, original films in the industry. This exciting agreement further demonstrates the importance of that content to our distribution partners as they grow their audiences and deliver the very best in entertainment,” Keith Le Goy, Sony Pictures’ president of worldwide distribution and networks, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tt5Mcw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7rjP5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Three questions that will decide Epic v. Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-AU_82ZDjlEZqy_LndGkDcie7DE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69096249/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;New filings show both sides’ legal strategies at work&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="UzO5Bd"&gt;On May 3rd, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;publisher Epic Games will finally have its day in court, forcing Apple to defend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;kicking &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off the iOS App Store&lt;/a&gt; last year. Epic’s antitrust lawsuit is bigger than a single game; it’s a direct challenge to the App Store model, the most significant legal challenge Apple has faced since the Xerox days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsUOSQ"&gt;Last night, &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/405/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/407/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/"&gt;sides&lt;/a&gt; filed a document called a “proposed findings of fact,” essentially laying out every factual claim they’ll rely on in their arguments. The documents run more than 650 pages in total, giving a detailed roadmap of how each side sees the case — from the early days of the iPhone to Epic’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493096/epic-apple-antitrust-lawsuit-fortnite-app-store-court-hearing"&gt;specific preparations for picking this fight with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. But the filings also bring the case into focus, raising three questions that will be central to the trial over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qQYdC1"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Fortnite vs Apple: App Store Royale|78038" data-volume-uuid="e322ad1d6" data-volume-id="78038" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-605" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="VW8TJd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the exclusive App Store a necessary part of iOS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="SxoDNd"&gt;The heart of the case is the so-called App Store tax — a 30 percent surcharge Apple collects on purchases made through the App Store. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; was kicked off the App Store for dodging that tax by installing its own payment system, which is forbidden under App Store rules. Now, Epic is making the case in court that the rules should never have been put in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lRinUq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Legal monopolies and abuses of market power&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W88Sba"&gt;You often hear that this case is about whether the App Store is a monopoly — but Epic’s argument is more subtle than that, drawing on antitrust ideas around legal monopolies and abuses of market power. As Epic sees it, Apple’s monopoly over iOS is legal, but it’s using the market power from that monopoly to dominate the secondary market for app distribution. Epic compares the situation to Microsoft’s antitrust case in the ’90s: a legitimate monopoly over Windows, extended illegally to the secondary market in web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0MXLJ"&gt;It’s a good theory, but it only works if you see the App Store model as fundamentally separate from iOS. In its statement of facts, Apple describes the exclusive App Store as a fundamental part of the iPhone, part of the broader offering that makes the devices valuable. “Apple wanted to ensure that iOS devices were more protected from those malware and instability issues and quality issues that the PC world was used to,” Apple claims in its filing. App Store exclusivity is part of that, but so are security measures like the code-signing and hardware root-of-trust systems. On the software side, there is a range of private APIs and OS-level entitlements that are only enabled after App Store review, tying the systems that much tighter together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Jxu1g"&gt;Of course, it’s inconvenient for this argument that Google is offering a competing mobile operating system with none of these restrictions — to say nothing of Apple’s own macOS, which allows side loading. Clearly, it would be technically possible to allow competing app stores on iOS. The question is whether the court sees that as changing Apple’s business model or changing iOS itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="NQj0UK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is the iPhone different from a PlayStation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="n8lgwx"&gt;One of the biggest challenges for Epic is that the App Store model is fairly widespread. Consoles like Xbox and PlayStation operate on basically the same playbook, delivering games digitally through an open but curated digital store that’s locked to the hardware and controlled by the manufacturer. That alone doesn’t make it legal, but it adds credence to Apple’s claim that the App Store lockdown isn’t trapping consumers. If you don’t want to play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on an iPhone, you can play it on a console or a PC. Some devices come locked into a specific distribution channel and some don’t, giving users the chance to vote with their feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PlB1P2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Video game consoles operate under a radically different business model”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DPsUjD"&gt;Epic’s counter to this argument, as explained in the filing, is that “video game consoles operate under a radically different business model than smartphones.” Development for console games is slow and expensive work, and consoles are useless without a steady supply of those games, so console manufacturers are under immense pressure to attract developers. That means hardware itself is often sold at cost, leaving App Store commissions as the primary source of profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXDPDw"&gt;Apple is different, Epic argues, because most of its profits still come from iPhone sales. “Developers do not participate in those profits,” the filing argues, “even though the availability of apps contributes greatly to the sale of devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rb70G5"&gt;On some level, this boils down to the argument that console companies are nicer to developers, so their platform power is less of an issue. The constant competition between Xbox and PlayStation gives game developers leverage to extract more favorable terms. But iOS and Android don’t compete for app developers in the same way, and the lower cost of mobile development means the competition happens on vastly different terms. Apple has given people lots of reasons to buy an iPhone, which means there’s less pressure on any given line of business. But that’s well short of the standard for monopoly power, and Apple ultimately comes away from the console comparison looking pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Ig69R4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much control can Apple exert over its hardware?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="6ezXaY"&gt;Underneath everything else, Apple is facing a profound question of how much control it can exert over its own devices. For critics, this is Apple’s original sin, using industrial and graphic design to lure customers into a walled garden, then locking the gate. For fans, it’s Apple’s genius, integrating hardware and software to deliver a more purposeful and powerful user experience. But it all rests on Apple’s ability to maintain a closed stack, using hardware integration to control what happens in software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMHW0v"&gt;This trial won’t undo that stack, but it could limit what Apple can do with it. The Epic Games fight started over payment processing, but the same legal standard could allow for alternative app stores or limit the restrictions Apple can place on rogue apps like Parler. It’s a first step toward setting regulatory limits on how tech companies operate, similar to the regulations on wireless carriers or banks. At its most basic level, Epic is arguing that Apple’s ecosystem has grown too big and too powerful for it to be run entirely out of Cupertino, and it’s time for it to be directly accountable to antitrust law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBIU20"&gt;Hundreds of pages in Apple’s filing are devoted to the benefits of that system for developers and iPhone owners, much of it undeniably true. There really is less malware on iOS devices because of Apple’s software controls, even if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;scam apps sometimes slip through&lt;/a&gt;. The system really does generate a lot of money for iOS developers, many of whom couldn’t compete outside of Apple’s walled garden. The shift to digital distribution really has saved money for developers who don’t need to distribute their product through brick-and-mortar retail anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="wcd3uB"&gt;But in a sense, all of that is beside the point. Abuses of market power aren’t excused just because they’re sometimes helpful, and classical monopolies like Standard Oil or Bell Telephone had lots of side benefits, too. The bigger question is whether courts are ready to dive into the mobile software stack and start dictating the terms of how tech companies can set up their marketplaces. That’s a hard question, and it won’t be settled by a single ruling or a single case. But one way or another, it’s a question this court will have to take on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon adds 720p streaming to its Luna cloud gaming service to improve stability</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x6s55j4YghHo9ijaP6Dbbba6Z78=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69096222/image.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pk4JBZ"&gt;Amazon is &lt;a href="https://amazonluna.blog/amazon-luna-introduces-new-720p-streaming-option-d9eccfd173f0?gi=2d933a0e6723"&gt;adding a new streaming option&lt;/a&gt; to its Luna cloud gaming platform that will cap resolution at 720p to help improve stability for players on slower internet connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wo3R24"&gt;Right now, Luna streams only at 1080p, with 4K coming at some point in the future. Yet even at 1080p, internet connections that struggle to keep up with the high bandwidth demands of cloud gaming might result in latency, lag, and audio issues for the player when using a service like Luna. Now, Amazon says those using Luna in its early access beta — the platform has yet to release to the public — can toggle on the 720p streaming mode in the settings panel to help with performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hua8qa"&gt;“One of the most requested features is the ability to play at lower resolutions to match unique internet connection speeds and bandwidth demands,” the company said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Starting today, we’re enabling a new 720p option, allowing for decreased bandwidth and data usage by streaming at a lower resolution.” Amazon also suggests the lower-resolution setting for Luna will help those who have home internet data caps, like the ones Comcast has said it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264430/comcast-data-cap-rollout-delayed-twelve-us-states-isp-bills"&gt;start imposing on its customers this July&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZC9sKV"&gt;Luna &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21451371/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming-service-twitch-alexa-controller"&gt;released last fall in early access&lt;/a&gt; with a unique channel model that borrows concepts from cable and streaming television. Instead of paying a fee to use the service like Nvidia GeForce Now or buying your games outright like on Google Stadia, Luna itself is free to use but access to streamed games is gated behind “channels” with individual monthly subscriptions. The only two available right now are Amazon’s Luna Plus channel ($5.99 per month) and a dedicated Ubisoft one ($14.99). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Listen to 16 minutes of Final Fantasy VII Remake’s soundtrack performed by a live orchestra</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DCx-1NJEzitWcMlNd_hAtbb9LeM=/40x0:1810x1180/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69096196/FFVIIRemakeCon_1_1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: AWR Music Productions&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vHmfBb"&gt;Square Enix has released &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/kHJVZOCqTAw"&gt;a 16-minute trailer&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; Orchestral World Tour, and if you’re a fan of the game’s fantastic soundtrack, I highly recommend watching this video from beginning to end. Watching the songs performed by a live orchestra brought a huge smile to my face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8wAnj"&gt;The trailer features three songs: a medley of the game’s opening, including the bombastic title fanfare that &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; gives me goosebumps; “Stand Up,” the song used during the Honeybee Inn dance scene; and a medley of the classic battle theme, “Let the Battles Begin!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXUBRK"&gt;More than 100 musicians perform the arrangements. If you want to try to catch a show for yourself, you can see the schedule of upcoming performances on the &lt;a href="https://ffvii-remakeconcerts.com/"&gt;tour’s website&lt;/a&gt;. Sadly, the tour isn’t currently scheduled to take place anywhere near me; I guess I’ll just have to watch this video a hundred more times to try to re-create the experience for myself. Darn.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>That Fyre Fest tweet with the sad sandwich will be auctioned as an NFT for medical expenses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YCYxDXendLEL1z-0HRJ4bwA7wM4=/0x114:680x567/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69096040/fyrefest.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/trev4president/status/857776562615308288" target="_blank"&gt;Trevor DeHaas/Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N6gI5C"&gt;Trevor DeHaas is auctioning his 2017 tweet of the “dinner” he received at Fyre Fest as an NFT. But unlike the Fest itself, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trev4president/status/857776562615308288"&gt;tweeted photo of the limp cheese slice&lt;/a&gt; on wheat bread with some greens and a sad tomato in a styrofoam container isn’t a grift; as first &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/nft-fyre-fest-blockchain-dinner-tweet-66eea211-4284-4e8e-821a-899cc60b6d74.html"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, DeHaas is hoping to raise $80,000 which he plans to put toward his medical bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTlZH1"&gt;“With how hot the NFT market is right now I figured I’d give it a shot and could hopefully raise enough money that I wouldn’t need to rely on a GoFundMe to pay for my medical expenses,” DeHaas said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The last thing I want is to guilt trip someone into buying the NFT and copyright to pay for my medical expenses but I would like the auction winner to know that their money would be going to a good cause.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5qMjt"&gt;The organizers of Fyre Fest billed it as an exclusive, luxury music festival in the Bahamas, which would include top-notch catering, big-name performers, and transportation via Jet Ski and yacht. Kendall Jenner was among the celebrities paid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/4/15547734/fyre-fest-kendall-jenner-instagram-sponsored-paid"&gt;$250,000 to promote the event&lt;/a&gt;, which guests paid up to $12,000 to attend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sfd6t"&gt;That is not what happened, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnzjTw"&gt;Social posts from attendees like DeHaas showed images of a poorly organized, subpar event that wasn’t close to what was advertised, and soon &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2017/music/news/mcfarland-fyre-class-action-criminal-grand-jury-subpoena-1202446126/"&gt;the lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; began. In 2018, Fyre Fest organizer &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/arts/music/fyre-festival-organizer-sentenced-fraud.html?smtyp=cur&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimes"&gt;Billy McFarland was sentenced to six years in prison&lt;/a&gt; after pleading guilty to wire fraud charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="k0R4E2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="onIXO5"&gt;DeHaas said he was inspired by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s auction of his first-ever tweet, which &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/22/jack-dorsey-sells-his-first-tweet-ever-as-an-nft-for-over-2point9-million.html"&gt;sold for $2.9 million&lt;/a&gt; on March 22nd. “Now, a few weeks before the 4 year anniversary of the festival (4/28) I’m selling the most iconic cheese sandwich on the blockchain along with the ownership of copyright,” he told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHubjc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trev4president/status/1379832081845485569?s=20"&gt;DeHaas clarified on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that he was selling the tweet on &lt;a href="http://flipkick.io"&gt;flipkick.io&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based company for artists and musicians to “monetize their work with Physical NFTs,” according to &lt;a href="https://flipkick.io/about"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;. Ironic twist: Fyre Fest co-organizer Ja Rule is a partner in Flipkick, but DeHaas says the musician is not directly involved in the auction of his cheese sandwich tweet. However, Ja Rule, who was &lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ja-rule-cleared-of-wrongdoing-in-major-fyre-fest-lawsuit-2576105"&gt;cleared of wrongdoing&lt;/a&gt; in connection with Fyre Fest, recently &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/mar/25/ja-rule-nft-fyre-festival-artwork"&gt;sold an NFT of a painting of the Fyre Fest logo&lt;/a&gt; for $122,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3CPOR"&gt;DeHaas says he plans to transfer copyright and ownership rights for the NFT to the auction winner. His aim is to raise money for his medical expenses; according to his &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/trevors-kidney-fund"&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt;, DeHaas is in end-stage renal disease and needs a kidney transplant.  “I currently do dialysis for 7 hours every day and in the mean time trying to find a living kidney donor,” DeHaas told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The expenses from a kidney transplant can be astronomical even with insurance. Plus there are expenses for my donor that I would like to cover.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFO1kT"&gt;Which raises a troubling question: are NFT auctions going to become another tool — like GoFundMe pages — to raise money for costs not covered in America’s abysmal health care system? If something good comes out of the debacle that was Fyre Fest (other than the &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-or-hulu-which-fyre-festival-documentary-you-should-watch/"&gt;dueling documentaries on Hulu and Netflix&lt;/a&gt;), that’s certainly a win. But using NFTs to pay for surgery and treatment introduces an even bleaker scenario for people desperate to pay their medical bills who aren’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/30/4787602/breaking-bad-series-finale-breaks-records-for-ratings-and-piracy"&gt;Walter White&lt;/a&gt; or independently wealthy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvErPq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 8th, 1:02PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added comment from Trevor DeHaas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
