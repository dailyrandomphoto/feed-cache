    <title>Adidas is making Xbox sneakers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qzZUr3KNe08stEMwBl9kXT1m41I=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958780/Xbox_20th_Forum_Tech_Copy_JPG.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lcWYvC"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox team is partnering with Adidas to create limited-edition Xbox sneakers. The collaboration will see Adidas produce an Xbox sneaker to mark 20 years since the original release of the Xbox console. The sneakers include the Xbox logo and translucent green details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgPoac"&gt;While this appears to be a limited-edition sneaker that Microsoft will use for giveaways, there will also be a separate Xbox-inspired sneaker available for purchase later this year. “This is just the beginning of our partnership with adidas, and over the next few months we’ll continue to mark our 20th anniversary by launching additional sneakers inspired by past and present Xbox console generations, including the first-ever sneaker available for purchase by our fans later this year,” &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/06/xbox-adidas-anniversary-partnership/"&gt;explains James Monosmith&lt;/a&gt;, a marketing manager at Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jlvzzI"&gt;Adidas and Xbox have created a launch trailer for its sneaker partnership that features footage of the original Xbox console and &lt;em&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved&lt;/em&gt;. Alongside the Xbox sneakers, Microsoft is also planning to release an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/2/22364073/microsoft-xbox-series-x-mini-fridge-skittles-twitter-brand-poll"&gt;Xbox mini fridge this holiday&lt;/a&gt;. The company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aarongreenberg/status/1441027928834281476"&gt;has promised&lt;/a&gt; to provide more information about its Xbox mini fridge plans at some point this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wd6GU"&gt;Microsoft’s work with Adidas on an Xbox sneaker follows a similar collaboration between Nike, Sony, and basketball player Paul George earlier this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420584/nike-pg5-playstation-shoes-sneakers-paul-george-basketball"&gt;The PS5-inspired sneakers&lt;/a&gt; went on sale earlier this year, more than &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-28-nike-pg-2-5-playstation-classic-paul-george.html"&gt;two years after&lt;/a&gt; the previous PlayStation sneakers that Nike and Sony created in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat adds ‘challenges’ with cash prizes to its TikTok competitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HRHQKeLFnaJB65nYgD8kfvvKvBQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958614/Spotlight_Challenges.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snapchat’s Spotlight Challenges | Image: Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JpjB2X"&gt;Snapchat is adding another way for creators to earn cash. The app is launching a feature called Spotlight Challenges, which will reward a handful of creators each week for making videos using specific Lenses, doing certain activities, or playing a chosen sound inside the app’s TikTok competitor, Spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yry7qy"&gt;Around three to five creators will be awarded cash for each challenge, with the winners being chosen from among the most-viewed eligible videos. Payments will be divided among winners from prize pools that “typically range from $1k to $25k,” with the minimum payout being $250, according to Snap. There’ll be multiple challenges every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="co4Q73"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Snap is still paying millions to creators of top Spotlight videos&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HINfTF"&gt;The challenges offer a new way for Snap to incentivize users to make videos for Spotlight — and it does so in a way that offers the company a lot of control. It can boost certain trends or try to encourage different types of content than people would typically make. That could help as it tries to differentiate Spotlight from TikTok and give people a reason to keep coming back to find something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9p94V1"&gt;It’s also a potential revenue opportunity. Challenges won’t be sponsored at launch, but Snap “may” offer sponsored ones in the future, a Snap spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AvdLI8"&gt;Challenges are rolling out now in the US, with more markets to follow. The spokesperson says these payments will be in addition to the millions of dollars per month the company pays out to creators globally who make top Spotlight videos. Snap was paying $1 million per day at launch, but later reduced the sum to a less-specific “millions per month.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zrYnnY"&gt;The payments seem to have been working, at least as of a few months ago. In July, Snap said daily usage of Spotlight was up 49 percent quarter over quarter. Time spent per day was also up more than 60 percent in the US — though in both cases, Snap didn’t share the actual figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TEjOdy"&gt;In addition to Challenges, Snap is adding a couple other ways for creators to get paid. Gifting is now rolling out globally, allowing viewers to tip creators with digital tokens, of which they’ll get a revenue cut. Snap is also expanding its Creator Marketplace to include video creators, letting businesses connect with them for sponsorships. Access to these features is limited, however: only approved “Snap Stars” are eligible for gifting and the marketplace, and creators have to be invited by Snap to participate in that program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIBFHS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction October 6th, 9:40AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snap clarified after publication that the “$1k to $25k” figure is the typical prize pool for Challenges, not the typical range for individual payouts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pinterest whistleblower Ifeoma Ozoma has a new way for tech workers to speak out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n7IvLiewMn7ODNDa1NiFTYR8H7E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958684/gcampos_210220_4385_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ifeoma Ozoma poses for a portrait outside her home in New Mexico on February 20th, 2021.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Gabriela Campos for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zrFzTa"&gt;When Ifeoma Ozoma &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ifeomaozoma/status/1272546213322080258?lang=en"&gt;came forward&lt;/a&gt; with allegations of discrimination and racism at Pinterest, she was prepared. She had a list of reporters on deck to share her story. She’d already hired a lawyer. Then she started hearing from other tech workers who also wanted to speak out. “The general lack of awareness around options and resources was shocking,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U8jqKd"&gt;Now, she’s aiming to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LP86eD"&gt;On Wednesday, Ozoma launched &lt;a href="https://techworkerhandbook.org/"&gt;the Tech Worker Handbook&lt;/a&gt; — a comprehensive online resource to help employees who want to speak out. “Deciding to go toe-to-toe with a powerful and well-resourced corporation is difficult for many reasons,” the website reads. “Access to information about how to find legal counsel, file a complaint with a governmental organization, work with the media, secure personal information, or ensure physical safety should not be an additional barrier.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwSqQk"&gt;The website includes information on how to secure legal counsel, engage with the media, and maintain digital and physical security. “It’s not a step by step guide,” Ozoma says. “It’s a resource for people who have information that’s in the public interest to help them decide if coming forward is the right decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqFttM"&gt;For employees in California, the decision could be made easier by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272779/silenced-no-more-act-california-nda-employees-workplace-harassment"&gt;the Silenced No More Act&lt;/a&gt; — a bill Ozoma helped push that would protect workers who speak out about harassment and discrimination, even if they’ve signed a non-disclosure agreement. The bill &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/silenced-no-more-assembly"&gt;passed the California Assembly in August&lt;/a&gt; and is currently sitting on Governor Newsom’s desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xWSDV"&gt;Ozoma partnered with the Whistleblowing International Network, the Signals Network, and Lioness Strategies — the organization behind last week’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702335/jeff-bezos-employees-essay-blue-origin-toxic-workplace"&gt;bombshell Blue Origin revelations&lt;/a&gt; — to design the Tech Worker Handbook resources. The project received funding from the Omidyar Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0l1Cq"&gt;Ozoma stresses that this is about making whistleblowers as effective as possible. “Frances was super fucking prepared,” she says by way of example, referring to the former Facebook product manager who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;testified before a Senate subcommittee Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; about the harmful effects of the platform. “If you’re prepared, you’re more powerful.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S764x5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tELsAv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Metroid Dread is moody, cryptic, and frequently frustrating</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l6o5tPlQjul1-0ZetWILl9Zqj20=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958620/Switch_MetroidDread_screen_06.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Samus Aran’s new adventure is caught between action and exploration&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="FUOLUM"&gt;From the very beginning, &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; has been about feeling alone. The games typically drop players on a harsh alien world, stripped of most of their abilities and with little guidance on how to survive and escape. When it works, it’s incredible; there’s a good reason why the series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/14/16303016/metroid-nintendo-influence-legacy"&gt;spawned an entire genre of 2D exploration games&lt;/a&gt;. Even with a host of modern contemporaries, there’s still something about &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt;’s particular blend of sci-fi solitude that remains distinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TccvQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;, the first mainline entry in the series since 2002 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22536783/metroid-dread-yoshio-sakamoto-nintendo-switch-e3-2021"&gt;and a game that took a long time to go from concept to reality&lt;/a&gt; — largely understands this. Its world is dark and cryptic, both a place to explore and a puzzle to pick apart. It nails the classic &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; vibe while also adding a new sense of terror in the form of relentless robots that will chase you down like a &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil &lt;/em&gt;monster. It’s the closest &lt;em&gt;Metroid &lt;/em&gt;has come to being a full-on horror game. At the same time, &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; also wants to be an action game, one with lots of boss battles and surprise fights against quick-moving enemies. Over the course of the game, those two sides constantly feel at odds and never quite come together in a satisfying way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDeGGf"&gt;The game starts, as &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; games always do, with bounty hunter Samus Aran following a distress beacon to a planet where something mysterious has happened. Her job is to investigate, but instead, she finds herself trapped on a hostile planet called ZDR, which consists of a number of subterranean locations — everything from a research facility to a vibrant forest to an ancient sanctuary — all connected together via various tunnels and a very convenient transportation system. Samus has once again lost her powers when she arrives (the game calls it “physical amnesia”), and the goal is to recover them so that she can navigate the labyrinth and get back to her ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="metroid dread" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_753N-DRuuK4r7YCDUGb4unPLF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902172/Switch_MetroidDread_screen_02.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Px7nx5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; has never been big on story in the traditional sense. It’s not a series that’s packed with cutscenes and dialogue. (That said, the game does open with a helpful primer since predecessor &lt;em&gt;Metroid Fusion&lt;/em&gt; came out nearly two decades ago.) &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; continues this tradition; there are a handful of lengthy story moments, but mostly, you’ll be learning about the planet by exploring it and the occasional update from your AI assistant Adam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Z0YuX"&gt;But there’s still lots of worldbuilding here, and it mostly comes through the locations you’ll explore. Though &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; is a 2D game, its graphics are in three dimensions, and the artists have used that to build fully fleshed-out environments with lots of visual depth. (The 3D elements are strictly aesthetic.) In the background, you’ll see terrifying, brutal experiments taking place, the ruins of ancient statues and buildings, and wildlife that scatters at your approach. One section was completely dark and covered in cobwebs until I managed to hit the button that returned power. It was delightfully spooky. I was particularly taken by an area that’s set amidst a vast aquarium, where you can see all kinds of alien sea creatures darting around and, on occasion, banging against the glass when you approach. There’s also a great sense of scale, and the camera will zoom out to show you just how tiny Samus is compared to a huge machine or monster. Sometimes these visual touches hint at things happening in the game, like a horrible boss enemy coming up, but mostly, they serve as welcome window dressing that gives a sense of place and purpose to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jWHSqm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The average encounter with an enemy feels more exciting and dynamic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mdXoAV"&gt;As far as how it plays, &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; is classic &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt;, and it largely builds off of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16291350/metroid-samus-returns-review-nintendo-3ds"&gt;2017’s &lt;em&gt;Samus Returns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a remake of &lt;em&gt;Metroid II&lt;/em&gt; for the Nintendo 3DS. That means it’s a side-scrolling game where you navigate tight, interconnected levels using a variety of skills. Backtracking is a hallmark. The idea is that you’ll come across areas — a strange door, or a ledge that’s just too high, or maybe a lava-filled room that’s just a little too hot for comfort — that you can’t access until you get the right ability. At the beginning, Samus can’t do much more than fire her gun arm and jump, but you’ll slowly regain access to her arsenal, from the iconic morph ball to a double jump to freezing missiles. When you have the right ability, you can head back to previously inaccessible areas to open up new paths. It’s a now-familiar structure, but it still works because it’s so satisfying to finally be able to overcome those hurdles that stumped you early in the game. I also love watching the map slowly fill out as I venture to new, hidden corners of each area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56ocOD"&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Samus Returns&lt;/em&gt;, Nintendo and its partner studio MercurySteam took a slightly more action-oriented approach, and that continues here. Samus can move quickly with a new dash move, and she has a melee attack that lets you knock back enemies if you time it just right, just like in &lt;em&gt;Samus Returns&lt;/em&gt;. This has some benefits; it makes the average encounter with an enemy feel more exciting and dynamic, and it turns some of the boss battles into frantically-paced fights. But there are definitely some drawbacks. For one, the controls are cumbersome, particularly later in the game when Samus gets lots of abilities. Having to hold down multiple shoulder buttons to fire missiles at a goopy alien darting around the screen is not exactly fun, especially when you &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; have to memorize their movements and dash away so that you don’t die for a dozenth time in a row. The controls simply don’t feel up to the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PuHl85"&gt;Not all of the bosses or big encounters are so frustrating. Many are thrilling. &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; fans will know just how satisfying it can be to take down a towering alien after you figure out the right pattern to hit their weak points. And &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; has lots of cool monsters, from tentacle-baring sea creatures to chained-up dragon-like beasts. The problem is that there are just too many of these large-scale encounters. In addition to the main bosses, there are more fast-paced fights against Samus-sized baddies like ancient warriors and robotic soldiers that require quick reflexes and often took me many, many deaths to get through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="metroid dread" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QqlRuDK2xHY-ZQJXvIVDWMcW53c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902174/Switch_MetroidDread_screen_07.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XaQTF1"&gt;The problem isn’t that these battles are challenging — it’s that there are far too many of them. At times it feels like a boss rush mode, where every few rooms, you’re up against something new. To make matters more frustrating, &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; has an annoying habit of frequently blocking your path right before one of these encounters, so you have no choice but to finish the battle before you can proceed. There were many times where I would’ve appreciated being able to take a breather with some exploration before coming back to a challenging boss. The sheer amount of fighting also takes away from the solemn, moody vibe that’s so intrinsic to &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s jarring to be constantly pulled out of the quiet atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="j7vxQX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The E.M.M.I makes for some incredibly tense moments&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EsXmCc"&gt;The good news is that &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt;’s most notable addition, robotic sentinels called E.M.M.I, do a lot to add to that vibe. Essentially, certain sections of ZDR are under the protection of an E.M.M.I, and they will hunt down and kill anything that doesn’t belong. All you can do is survive. One of Samus’ new abilities is called a “phantom cloak,” and it makes her invisible for short periods of time. Since you can’t fight, whenever the E.M.M.I approaches, you have to either run or hide. This makes for some incredibly tense moments, where you’re crouched in a corner or hanging from a ledge while the bot prowls, hoping that your cloak doesn’t run out before it leaves. These scenes really ratchet up the tension, making you feel alone and, at times, helpless on this violent planet. And by restricting E.M.M.I to specific zones, the game’s designers have helped keep it from being too frustrating; once you figure out what to do, these sequences usually last just a few seconds, after which point you can finally breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hHN5HL"&gt;This makes &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; all the more frustrating because it does so much right. It nails the classic feel of a &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; game while updating it with wonderfully detailed visuals, more satisfying combat, and new areas that briefly turn it into a stealth horror experience. But all of that comes to a grinding halt when you have to fight three bosses in a short span, each of which requires either fast reflexes or pattern memorization to get through — or both. Instead of punctuating the quiet exploration with intense battles, the copious boss encounters instead turn into a slog. &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; features some of the most beautifully dark and solemn moments in the franchise — but you’ll have to be prepared to really fight to see it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nav5cV"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Metroid Dread &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches on the Nintendo Switch on October 8th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo Switch OLED review: screentime</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s not 4K, but it sure looks good&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="VWA1eY"&gt;Buying an upgraded version of a gadget can be complicated. It’s not always immediately clear what’s changed or if those changes are even useful to you; this can happen with iterative phone updates or, more recently, the latest generation of game consoles from Sony and Microsoft. In the case of the latest Switch, though, Nintendo made things easy: all that matters is how much you care about the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6XV0C"&gt;The new $350 OLED Switch is functionally identical to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"&gt;version that launched in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. It plays all of the same games, has the same interface, and uses the same controllers. Those games don’t have any kind of performance boost; no better frame rates or higher resolution. And aside from some small tweaks — an improved kickstand, a slightly redesigned dock, more storage — the hardware doesn’t seem all that different. When you pick it up, it just feels like a Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuKYkK"&gt;But as soon as you turn on the screen, you can see the difference. The new Switch swaps the original’s LCD display for a bigger, brighter OLED screen. It doesn’t fundamentally change what the Switch is or what it can do. But if you plan on spending a lot of time in handheld mode, it makes a big difference to how you experience games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="a5IGBx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10792667"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hgZFD8"&gt;Okay, so, the basics. The OLED Switch has a seven-inch OLED screen, which is a bump up from the original’s 6.2-inch display (and a huge jump from the portable-only Switch Lite and its 5.5-inch touchscreen). This doesn’t actually make the hardware all that much bigger, though. The OLED Switch measures 102mm x 242mm x 13.9mm and weighs 420 grams with the controllers attached; the original Switch clocks in at 102mm x 239mm x 13.9mm and weighs 398 grams. In my hands, I could barely tell the difference in terms of weight and size. Rather than feeling bigger, it’s more like Nintendo trimmed back the huge black bezel to make more screen real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObTyVa"&gt;That screen is the star of this new device. The size is nice, particularly if you’re playing games with lots of text or a complicated interface, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726336/fire-emblem-three-houses-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And though it features the same 720p output as the base model, things didn’t appear noticeably less sharp to me. But the more obvious change is how much brighter and more vibrant everything looks. You can see this in colorful games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20871958/legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review-nintendo-switch-updates-graphics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where the colors really pop. (Rewatching &lt;em&gt;Link’s Awakening&lt;/em&gt;’s Ghibli-inspired opening animation &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; made me wish the Switch had some video streaming apps like Netflix.) This is true whether you’re playing something new or old; I found that the excellent sprites from &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter III: Third Strike&lt;/em&gt; were really striking on the new display, even if they are two decades old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jC4RdGSgQCvIJO-kDiZ_l4q7-z8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873299/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity&lt;/em&gt; running on the OLED Switch.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g0T1OhREsxWOkqO-7BlLZTPoXnQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873311/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Finally, a built-in stand that works.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-03q4G2hyVznbC_XAFlBjp2KBRg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873312/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The buttons have a slightly refreshed look.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r0lYc5"&gt;The benefits also go in the opposite direction and make dark virtual worlds appear more stark. The creepy side-scrolling game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12050342/inside-review-xbox-one-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a great example of this; the inky blacks really stand out, making its world feel all the more bleak and oppressive (as it’s supposed to). On some screens, &lt;em&gt;Inside&lt;/em&gt;’s black-and-white visuals can blur together a bit, but here things remain distinct. Possibly the best showcase for the OLED display is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22474509"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which coincidentally launches alongside the new Switch. The moody adventure has you navigating dark caverns, ancient forests, and underwater research facilities, and there’s a wonderful contrast between them. During one sequence when you turn the lights on in an old, abandoned facility, the shift is genuinely jarring. I played through the entirety of the game on the original Switch for our review, and then spent a few hours replaying it on the OLED version and, well, I really wish I had waited for the new console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="O3SrvT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10792652"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AjIi4L"&gt;It’s important to note that these visual upgrades are purely due to the display. The new Switch isn’t more powerful, so you won’t see any kind of performance changes. (It’s most certainly not &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701210/nintendo-switch-4k-pro-rumors-oled"&gt;the much-rumored “Switch Pro.”&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; looks more vibrant and colorful on an OLED Switch, but it still has the same flat textures and slow pop-in as it does on every other version of the hardware. This also means that if you play games on your television using the dock, the experience is exactly the same as would be with a base model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPrZhs"&gt;A few other things about the screen. While it’s far too early to say whether burn-in will be a problem, Nintendo does warn against displaying “the same image on the OLED screen for extended periods of time” in order to minimize “risk of image retention or screen burn-in.” The company also says that the display features an “anti-scattering adhesive film,” which it says not to remove; though after several days with the device I admit I didn’t even notice there was a film on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMVacO"&gt;Aside from the screen, the biggest upgrade here comes down to design rather than technology: the Switch finally has a good built-in stand. I never really think about the kickstand on my base Switch, mainly because it sucks. It’s so flimsy that I don’t trust it with keeping an expensive video game console upright. In four years, I’ve barely used it at all. But the OLED Switch now features a Surface-style stand that extends the full length of the device and is much more flexible in terms of viewing angles. You know how in every Switch commercial, there are people playing games in the park or on a rooftop in tabletop mode, having lots of fun? Well, I finally feel comfortable doing that, and it turns out it’s great. It’s become my preferred method of getting in some matches of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590249/pokemon-unite-nintendo-switch-hands-on-esports"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it works especially well for pick-up-and-play games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22632465/warioware-get-it-together-nintendo-switch-preview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WarioWare: Get it Together&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280837/nintendo-switch-clubhouse-games-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clubhouse Games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5tPq8pFNaHKhQca8ceMC9TkSdlI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873303/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The dock has a less boxy look now.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hnnjdq"&gt;The rest of the changes are much more minor. The buttons and vent on the top of the Switch have been streamlined a little, and the speakers have moved from the back panel to just under the screen on the front. Nintendo says they offer improved sound, but to me they just sounded a bit louder. (There’s still a standard headphone jack for when you really want to immerse yourself, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674704/nintendo-switch-bluetooth-audio-software-update"&gt;Nintendo recently added Bluetooth audio support to all Switch hardware via a software update&lt;/a&gt;.) The dock has a slightly more refined look with rounded corners on the top, and it comes in white now. There’s also the addition of a LAN port, and the dock’s rear panel is removable, instead of on a hinge, which makes it a little easier to swap cables. The new dock is also compatible with the original Switch, and vice versa. Meanwhile, Nintendo has doubled the built-in storage to 64GB, though you can expand that to up to 2TB with a microSD card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhKl9Q"&gt;Key aspects of the handheld haven’t changed at all. The Switch OLED uses the same Joy-Con controllers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained"&gt;so you’ll still have to live in fear of the dreaded drift&lt;/a&gt;. And it has the same battery life as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697601/nintendo-switch-new-model-battery-life-improvements"&gt;the slightly improved version of the base Switch introduced in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, which means you’ll get between five to nine hours of gameplay on a charge, depending on what you’re playing and your brightness settings. The bigger, brighter screen doesn’t appear to make a difference in that regard. When playing docked, it also still tops out at 1080p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EvlGhl"&gt;All of this puts the OLED Switch in an interesting place within Nintendo’s slowly growing family of hardware. The Switch Lite is the obvious entry point, a cheaper model and one designed explicitly for portable play with its small size and sturdy construction. The base Switch, meanwhile, is decent on the go but best for those who will primarily use it as a home console, which makes the newest model the best of both worlds. For $50 more it works like a typical Switch at home, but its excellent OLED display and finally functional kickstand also make it the more premium portable experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SR7mq4"&gt;So, again, it all comes down to that screen. You already know what else to expect from a Switch. It hasn’t changed all that much in four years. But if you want that experience to look better, brighter, and more vibrant when you’re away from the TV, the choice is simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IiqdKa"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nintendo Switch OLED launches on October 8th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new iPad Mini is already discounted at Adorama</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CUtEuu2FQHlRATRtMGT2CBBAPeY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958593/vpavic_210924_4766_0022_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini is $25 off today, the first discount we’ve seen on the 8.3-inch tablet.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lqP68B"&gt;At $499, the latest iPad Mini isn’t cheap. Luckily, Adorama is &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/102869/1036?subId1=VergeDeals100621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmk7r3lla.html"&gt;currently taking $25 off&lt;/a&gt; of the 64GB, Wi-Fi-equipped model in all four colorways, bringing the final sale price down to $474. The latest model is equipped with Apple’s new A15 Bionic processor and a 12MP rear camera, not to mention Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt; feature, which allows the front-facing camera to digitally pan and zoom in order to keep you in the frame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iILOjK"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we also praised the design of the sixth-gen iPad Mini, the larger screen, and the fact that the new tablet offers USB-C support, though, we disliked that it lacks a headphone jack. And while today’s discount isn’t a huge one, it is one of the first we’ve seen on the Apple slate since it launched just over a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PV32lk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zKeMiP"&gt;If you’re in need of a stylus, you can pair your discounted iPad Mini with the second-generation Apple Pencil, which is once again &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13527013?sid=VergeDailyDealsRoundUp10062021&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Woot&lt;/a&gt; until October 9th, or while supplies last. Typically $129, you can pick the stylus up for $110, which is just $10 more than its best price to date. Amazon Prime members will get free shipping. Unlike its predecessor, the newest Apple Pencil can wirelessly charge while magnetically attached to the side of the latest iPad Pro, iPad Mini, or iPad Air. Note that it will not, however, work with the newest entry-level iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fwQZni"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500002"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XLZY02"&gt;You can now purchase the best drone under $1,000 for even less at Newegg. DJI’s official Newegg storefront is now offering a refurbished &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=VergeDailyDeals10062021&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F380-0002-003U1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DJI Mavic Air 2 Fly More Combo for $769&lt;/a&gt;, and throwing in a $60 Newegg gift card. Normally $988 when sold new, that equates to $219 in savings. The Mavic Air 2 offers 34 minutes of flight time, as well as a built-in 48MP camera that is far better than that found on its predecessor. The midrange drone also offers features like ActiveTrack 3.0, which automatically follows a subject, as well as improved connectivity. In addition to the drone, the discounted bundle includes an AC power cable, a pair of extra control sticks, a shoulder bag, six low-noise propellers, a battery-to-power bank adapter, a gimbal protector, and more. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21243887/dji-mavic-air-2-2020-drone-flight-photography-video-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6NnCMn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10791622"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e0pq3w"&gt;Apple aficionados, you’re in luck today: we’ve got a third Apple discount for you. Right now, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/102869/1036?subId1=VergeDeals100621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmgyl3ama.html"&gt;Adorama is selling Apple’s AirPods &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://adorama.rfvk.net/e4ENXr"&gt;Max for $449&lt;/a&gt; in a variety of colors. That’s a $100 discount and one of the lowest prices we’ve seen on what we believe are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; you can buy right now. As noted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the AirPods Max boast excellent sound quality, top-of-the-line noise cancellation, and a breathable knit mesh headband canopy that makes them comfortable to wear over long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AAGYen"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a9ff9q"&gt;If the $474 iPad Mini above seems too expensive, Amazon is now selling the ad-supported, 32GB version of the latest Amazon Fire HD 10 at its lowest price to date. Normally $150, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BX7FV5L/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can buy it today for $100&lt;/a&gt;, and get a 20 percent extra discount if you trade in select devices. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22578620/amazon-fire-hd-10-plus-productivity-bundle-kids-pro-2021-tablet-review-which-to-buy"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we liked the tablet’s sharp, colorful screen, while noting that it offers good battery life for the price. It’s a good buy if you’re on a budget and would like a tablet strictly for watching movies or consuming Amazon content, however, keep in mind that we may see even steeper discounts as Black Friday approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="833xuZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10616001"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Uber wants to make airport trips less messy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-TRANSPORT-AVIATION" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RTIeadKhUmZT9MR9ClpxPuBXvHg=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958412/1228126348.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2chbrg"&gt;Uber is rolling out several new features designed to improve the most dreaded trip imaginable: the airport trip. In select cities, customers can book a ride to the airport 30 days in advance and even send their flight information to their driver so they can track its progress in real-time. The company is also deploying machine learning to improve curbside pickups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UyKLN"&gt;As airport traffic steadily increases in the wake of the pandemic, Uber sees an opportunity to strengthen its position as the first choice for pickups and drop-offs for air travelers, as well as make improvements for drivers, who have long complained about the current chaotic system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FCcup"&gt;To start out, Uber is rolling out its Uber Reserve advance booking feature to more airports around the US. The company is also working with flight database OAG to add flight tracking information. When booking a ride in advance, riders will be asked to provide their flight information, and within 24 hours of a flight’s landing, they’ll receive notifications of any delays or potential early arrivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t0TqRr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;working with flight database OAG to add flight tracking information&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tYlG1m"&gt;Uber’s algorithm will respond to any time changes, adjusting the reservation pickup time automatically and informing the driver. And if there are multiple changes to the arrival time, the app will make sure riders are not bombarded with in-app pings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2xL9l"&gt;This is not completely new territory for the company. Uber Reserve, the advanced booking module, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21556948/uber-reserve-book-ride-advance-30-days-service-fee"&gt;was first rolled out nearly a year ago&lt;/a&gt; in dozens of markets. Prior to that, booking a car ahead of time has typically been the exclusive realm of for-hire vehicle services like black car and limo companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3t2TO"&gt;In fact, for years, Uber argued that such features were unnecessary when a car can be summoned to your front door in about five minutes. The worry has been that rather than responding to immediate ride requests, drivers would be wasting time circling a neighborhood, waiting for a scheduled customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnKOmB"&gt;Now, not only is Uber going all in on advanced booking, it’s attempting to make it as luxurious and deferential to the rider as possible. In addition to flight information, Uber is also offering 60 minutes of complimentary wait time at no additional charge. So if you’re not quite ready to get in the car after landing, the driver will wait a whole hour for you. Riders may not see an extra charge, but Uber will be compensating drivers for the time spent waiting, so don’t expect this to be a profit-generating feature for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2TkCU9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;So if you’re not quite ready to get in the car after landing, the driver will wait a whole hour for you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TkwHcE"&gt;Uber Reserve is exclusive to Uber Black and Uber Black SUV customers and will be available at the following airports: Atlanta (ATL), Charleston (CHS), Charlotte (CLT), Chicago (ORD + MDW), Dallas (DFW + DAL), Denver (DEN), Fort Myers (RSW), Houston (IAH + HOU), Miami (MIA + FLL + PBI), Nashville (BNA), New Orleans (MSY), New York (JFK + LGA), Orlando (MCO), Philadelphia (PHL), Phoenix (PHX), Seattle (SEA), and Washington DC (DCA + IAD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIthhL"&gt;If you don’t like planning things out so far in advance, Uber is rolling out another new feature called Ready When You Are. Customers who request a ride once you land can choose to be picked up in 20 minutes, 10 minutes, or as soon as possible — depending on how quickly they think they’ll de-plane and make it through the baggage area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WDsE6H"&gt;Uber is currently piloting this feature at six airports: Nashville (BNA), New Orleans (MSY), Portland (PDX), Philadelphia (PHL), Seattle (SEA) and Toronto (YYZ). It’s available to Android phone users today, with iOS coming in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ENOQIl"&gt;And for those who prefer to live dangerously, Uber has a new feature to make spontaneous curbside pickups less hectic. The company is using machine learning to predict demand ahead of time and then dispatch a certain number of drivers who can then be matched with riders more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a1PhYF"&gt;This feature is available at 15 airports worldwide: Chicago (MDW), Las Vegas (LAS), Los Angeles (LAX), New Orleans (MSY), New York (JFK and LGA), Philadelphia (PHL), Portland (PDX), Salt Lake City (SLC), San Diego (SAN), San Francisco (SFO), San Jose (SJC), and Seattle (SEA) in the US as well as Kolkata (CCU), London, (LHR), Montreal (YUL), Riyadh (RUH), and Toronto (YYZ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khcghH"&gt;All these new features come as the company is feeling more bullish about its financial situation. In a recent filing with government regulators, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687501/uber-adjusted-profit-q3-2021-pandemic-ride-hailing-food-delivery"&gt;Uber predicted it will be profitable&lt;/a&gt; this quarter for the first time in its history. Whereas the company previously expected to make a net loss of under $100 million, it now believes it could make an adjusted profit of up to $25 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OeKEZb"&gt;With the easing of lockdown restrictions around the world, demand for Uber’s ride-hailing business has started to recover, resulting in an acute &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371850/uber-lyft-driver-shortage-covid-bonus-stimulus"&gt;driver shortage&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. Meanwhile, the company’s food-delivery business, while still unprofitable overall, has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/may/05/uber-earnings-food-delivery-revenue"&gt;boomed over the course of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv8tg8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verge Tech Survey 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XWXX2_W2TVY4Kb4tZJd2CXgcb0U=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958423/VRG_ILLO_Verge_2021_tech_survey.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;After a year of the pandemic, we asked Americans if their trust in big tech companies has changed — and if the biggest ones should be broken up&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="piUnNR"&gt;In a year of isolation, fear, sickness, and death, the tech industry provided many of the ways people stayed connected. It also made Americans very aware of their reliance on the major tech companies. So have our attitudes toward them shifted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83udey"&gt;Starting in 2017, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has conducted periodic surveys gauging Americans’ attitudes toward the major tech industry; our most recent one was published in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21144680/verge-tech-survey-2020-trust-privacy-security-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;the fall of 2019&lt;/a&gt;, just before life was upended by the novel coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L28OTc"&gt;Though the pandemic has changed a lot of American life, our findings reveal that it mostly hasn’t changed our feelings about tech companies. There are some exceptions, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="Qb3RYv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10790939"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LzvnWk"&gt;Thirteen percent of respondents who were familiar with the brand had unfavorable opinions of Amazon, compared to just 9 percent in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zOybLS"&gt;The estimation of Facebook and Twitter also fell among people familiar with them — with 34 percent saying they had unfavorable opinions of Facebook, compared to 29 percent in 2020, and 42 saying they had unfavorable opinions of Twitter, compared to 39 percent in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gf8UjH"&gt;More people said Apple had a negative impact on society, but that was still just 9 percent of respondents familiar with the brand, compared to 5 percent in 2020. Facebook and Twitter were also more likely to be viewed as bad for society among those who recognized the brands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mulUXC"&gt;Among people who don’t use Facebook, 43 percent of them are avoiding it because they don’t like how it does business — a jump from 27 percent in the last survey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="wC4FNM"&gt;These are surprisingly large shifts in just a year. 2020 was a record profitable year for Amazon as more people relied on it during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ouXbO"&gt;We added a new company, TikTok, to our survey this year: 31 percent of people who recognized the brand say it has a negative impact on our society. Also, it’s the brand people most distrust when it comes to personal information, since 64 percent of respondents say they don’t trust it. Facebook and Instagram are the second and third least-trusted brands when it comes to personal information; in both cases, a majority of respondents indicated that they felt the brands were untrustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="myig0N"&gt;There is also an increased interest in breaking up Big Tech. This year, 61 percent of our respondents said that the government should split up tech companies if they get too big; last year, only 56 percent of people said that. Maybe the pandemic drove home how much we rely on these businesses — and how they can change our lives at the drop of a hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIheF1"&gt;These are among the findings of the third &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; Tech Trust Survey. This survey was conducted in August with 1,200 people nationally representative of the US. The sample error is ± 3 percent at a 95 percent level of confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbKqT9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch source code and creator payouts part of massive leak</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Z_jM2k7TtmweZ5b4WO82eaSXHM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958206/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_hate_raid_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7CdT68"&gt;Twitch appears to have been hacked, leaking source code for the company’s streaming service, an unreleased Steam competitor from Amazon Game Studios, and details of creator payouts. An anonymous poster on the 4chan messaging board has released a 125GB torrent, which they claim includes the entirety of Twitch and its commit history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zL9yY3"&gt;The poster claims the leak is designed to “foster more disruption and competition in the online video streaming space.” &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;is able to confirm that the leak is legitimate, and includes code that is as recent as this week. &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-entirety-of-twitch-has-reportedly-been-leaked/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video Games Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first reported details on the leak earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TnFGO"&gt;The leak includes the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="pvYMHU"&gt;3 years worth of details regarding creator payouts on Twitch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="37krkg"&gt;The entirety of twitch.tv, “with commit history going back to its early beginnings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jhlqcu"&gt;Source code for the mobile, desktop, and video game console Twitch clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yym8KC"&gt;Code related to proprietary SDKs and internal AWS services used by Twitch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xfSJRt"&gt;An unreleased Steam competitor from Amazon Game Studios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="q57MdY"&gt;Data on other Twitch properties like IGDB and CurseForge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="e04pQA"&gt;Twitch’s internal security tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="MUIQWO"&gt;The leak is labelled as “part one,” suggesting there could be more to come. &lt;em&gt;Video Games Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; reports that Twitch is aware of the breach, but the company has not yet informed its userbase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fv7qzg"&gt;The leak doesn’t appear to include password or address information on Twitch users, but that doesn’t mean this information hasn’t been obtained as part of this breach. In fact, the leaker seems to have focused on sharing Twitch’s own company tools and information, rather than code that would include personal accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DexmCK"&gt;We’ve reached out to Twitch to comment on this leak, and we’ll update you accordingly. Until we hear back, we’d recommend changing your Twitch password and enabling two-factor authentication on your account if you haven’t done so already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bs9pM"&gt;Twitch has been struggling to contain ongoing hate and harassment recently. After weeks of hate raids, some Twitch streamers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650578/twitch-streamers-walkout-protest-hate-raids"&gt;took a day off in August&lt;/a&gt; to protest against the company’s lack of action. Twitch has responded to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620874/twitch-implements-improved-chat-filters"&gt;#DoBetterTwitch movement&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a hashtag that the anonymous poster has used today to promote this leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpNZye"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 7:35AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The Verge can confirm leak is legitimate, and we have included more details on the data within the leak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Polar’s Grit X multisport watch goes Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Z0KhYhKsPyOzfB0ZCm3GBELcEc=/13x0:2040x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958059/verge_DSC_6507__1__2040pxl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Polar Grit X Pro (shown in copper colorway) features a sapphire lens and rugged FKM strap.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oMNhJH"&gt;Polar is making a number of updates to its family of sport watches today. This includes the launch of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polar.com%2Fus-en%2Fgrit-x-pro&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F6%2F22710376%2Fpolar-grit-x-pro-hands-on-multisport-watch-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Polar Grit X Pro&lt;/a&gt; for outdoor multisport enthusiasts, alongside feature and design tweaks to the company’s “premium” Vantage V2 multisport watch and Polar Unite fitness watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyklzd"&gt;The Grit X Pro is an update to the Grit X launched last year. For an extra $70/€70, the $499.90/€499.90 Pro model adds a tougher sapphire lens and a durable yet supple FKM watch band. It also adds Track Back routing to help you return to your starting point on unknown trails, Performance Tests to measure your V02max fitness level, and quick access to altimeter, coordinates, and compass via always-on dashboards. Otherwise, you’re pretty much looking at the same specs as last year: GPS/A-GPS, waterproof to 100 meters, turn-by-turn navigation when linked with Komoot, and what’s considered to be one of the most accurate heart rate sensors available on any watch. Grit X watches will last for up to 40 hours of battery life in full GPS and heart-rate tracking modes, up to 100 hours by disabling some features, or up to seven days in watch mode. The Grit X Pro is available in copper, black, and gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbkoUn"&gt;If weight is a primary concern (rugged multisport watches are heavy!), then Polar is also selling a titanium version, which is 12 percent lighter for $599.95/€599.90 — a price that includes a second band made of leather. The watch plus leather band weighs 53g in total, or 73g with FKM band. The Grit X Pro Titan is now the most expensive sport watch in Polar’s lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7QP5rXbf8rWVsjq5zH1maDSijVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902072/Grit_X_Pro_Groupshot.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Polar&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Grit X Pro comes in 3 new colorways as well as a lighter weight titanium model (2nd from left).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SZvTge"&gt;Polar sent me a copper-colored Grit X Pro review unit to test. Although I’ve only used it for a few days, I can already say that the Pro model, like the Grit X it builds upon, offers a respectable mix of features for the price. It lacks some capabilities like on-device topographic trail maps and local storage for music that you’ll find on other multisport outdoor watches, but Polar’s latest covers most of the basics nicely. Uniquely, Polar’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polar.com%2Fen%2Fsmart-coaching%2Ffit-spark&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F6%2F22710376%2Fpolar-grit-x-pro-hands-on-multisport-watch-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitspark workout suggestions&lt;/a&gt; are actually quite useful since they’re tailored to my current fitness level, goals, activity history, and nightly recharge score that takes into account how well I’ve slept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsgAkO"&gt;I really like the weight, look, and textured buttons of the Grit X Pro, but I find the display to be less readable, both indoors and out, compared to class-leading sport watches like the more expensive &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fp%2F641479%2Fpn%2F010-02158-01&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F6%2F22710376%2Fpolar-grit-x-pro-hands-on-multisport-watch-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Garmin Fenix 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. I also like the texture of the FKM rubber band, and the durability looks promising compared to the basic silicone bands often bundled with other sport watches (I tore one of Garmin’s while mountain biking, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xzY39r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10790754"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wj3NLX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polar.com%2Fnl%2Fvantage%2Fv2&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F6%2F22710376%2Fpolar-grit-x-pro-hands-on-multisport-watch-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Polar’s $499.95 Vantage V2&lt;/a&gt;, launched last year, is the company’s multisport watch for those repulsed by the Grit’s chiseled aesthetic. Now, in addition to a new bright red colorway, Polar is giving the Vantage V2 the ability to quickly swap out bands to make this sport watch suitable for more occasions.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gOKqXwHqZBxVa47XcWbnPtjK3jI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902154/Polar_Vantage_V2_back_OHR_Grey_leather_Shift_edition.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New quick-release bar for bands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P4Fuzb"&gt;Today, the Vantage V2 is getting a $549.95 Shift Edition, available in silver and black, that ships with leather and FKM straps fitted with new quick release bars. Current Vantage V2 owners can buy a $49.95 Shift Edition bundle, which includes the quick-release adapter bars and choice of any 22mm Polar band. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL67Xn"&gt;Vantage V2 owners are also getting a 3.0 software update on October 20th that mirrors the latest additions added to the Grit X Pro. These include always-on dashboard features like compass and altimeter, navigation features to help you return to the start of your journey, and an HR sensor mode that uses Bluetooth to show your heart rate on gym equipment and mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Polar Unite and the sad reality of stay-at-home fitness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MtNVFc"&gt;Finally, Polar is giving its lightweight (32g) $149.95 Unite watch new red and teal colorways alongside a software update. The update trickles down features like weekly summaries and energy source (carbs, proteins, and fats) consumption estimates available on other Polar watches, in addition to the same HR sensor mode coming to the Vantage V2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATBkUZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The Grit X Pro tracks VO2max, unlike the Grit X at launch, with the addition of the Performance Test feature. The article has been updated to reflect this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
