    <title>Lyft is bringing back shared rides starting on July 19th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/810irVBp0tmQmPT_Oo-h9vO-h9E=/0x0:1194x796/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69585299/shared_rides_are_back_lyft.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Lyft is bringing back shared rides | Lyft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ypOtQL"&gt;Lyft will once again allow passengers to share their rides with strangers starting next week after suspending the service over a year ago in response to the pandemic, the company announced today. Shared rides will be available in Philadelphia, Chicago, and Denver starting on Monday, July 19th, followed by additional markets “in the coming months.” It’s good news for anyone who wants a cheaper or more environmentally friendly way of making a journey in a private hire car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rmf7u1"&gt;Although shared rides are returning, they’re doing so with some social distancing restrictions. Drivers and passengers will still be required to wear masks at all times, and eating or drinking is banned during journeys. Shared rides will also be limited to two riders who’ll have to keep the front and middle seats empty to maintain distance. Drivers and passengers have the option of canceling journeys without any penalty if fellow riders aren’t obeying the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEYtD7"&gt;Lyft is also tweaking how shared rides work in an attempt to make them more predictable. Passengers will now have the option of booking a shared ride up to half an hour in advance, which Lyft says will help it “better match riders going in the same direction for the most efficient route.” Routes, pickups, and pricing will be fixed ahead of time, and the further in advance a journey is booked, the more discounted it’ll be, Lyft says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SldKxP"&gt;Although it’s unclear how many passengers will be comfortable sharing rides with strangers, even with Lyft’s safety measures in place, carpooling is seen as an important means of reducing the environmental impact of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152512/uber-lyft-climate-change-emissions-pollution-ucs-study"&gt;One study last year&lt;/a&gt;, released before the pandemic took hold in the US, said that services like these generate around 69 percent more climate pollution than the modes of transport they replace, and it recommended electric cars and carpooling as a means of mitigating this. Although Lyft dismissed the report as “misleading,” it said that it “encourages the use of shared rides.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Daki00"&gt;Uber and Lyft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183276/uber-uberpool-suspension-coronavirus-us-canada-carpool-pandemic"&gt;suspended their carpooling services&lt;/a&gt; in response to the pandemic in March. But while Lyft is moving to reintroduce ride-sharing, the future of UberPool is less certain. &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uberpool-cheap-shared-rides-are-not-coming-back-after-pandemic-2021-5?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; recently reported&lt;/a&gt; that it may return in an “unrecognizable” format in an attempt to make it more profitable. Discounts for using a shared ride could be reduced from 50 to 20 percent, and the service may only be available in certain locations or at select times of day. However, at least &lt;a href="https://thewest.com.au/technology/uber/uber-pool-to-return-to-perth-as-rideshare-giant-shakes-covid-19-fears-ng-b881811412z"&gt;one market in Australia&lt;/a&gt; has seen the return of UberPool, suggesting it won’t disappear entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GE2C8t"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sklKTK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TSMC’s revenues surge as it warns chip shortage will continue into next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7h_lGQId3k7X145w-W3QCd6a_c=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69585265/1232190357.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wDnuIL"&gt;Chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has reiterated that it expects chip shortages to continue into next year, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-15/tsmc-s-second-quarter-profit-rises-11-on-strong-chip-demand?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The warning came as the company reported its &lt;a href="https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/2852"&gt;latest financial results&lt;/a&gt;, which saw its net sales rise almost 20 percent to NT$372 billion (around $13.3 billion) compared to the same quarter the previous year. However, automakers should see the shortage gradually easing this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROxJ2X"&gt;As the world’s largest contract chip manufacturer, a lot of attention has been paid to TSMC amid the global chip shortage, which has impacted the manufacturing of everything from cars to game consoles. TSMC is a leading manufacturer of semiconductors and is responsible for producing the majority of smartphone processors worldwide. It supplies chips to the world’s biggest tech companies, including Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD, and controls 28 percent of the world’s semiconductor production capacity, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/mega-wave-capex-cycle-logic-semiconductor-industry/"&gt;report from Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQ0LjE"&gt;Warnings about the chip shortage lasting into 2022 are broadly in line with what TSMC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385240/tsmc-chip-shortage-2022-intel-ceo-earnings-graphics-cards-cpus-gpus"&gt;said last quarter&lt;/a&gt;, when CEO C. C. Wei said, “In 2023, I hope we can offer more capacity to support our customers. At that time, we’ll start to see the supply chain tightness release a little bit.” Other companies have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;issued warnings along a similar timeline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yq4Urd"&gt;Amid the continued shortages, all eyes are on how quickly TSMC can increase production. The company has committed to spending $100 billion through 2023 to expand its capacity, and in this year alone, it expects microcontroller production to increase by almost 60 percent, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes. Last month, the company started construction of a new $12 billion semiconductor manufacturing facility in Arizona, and in April, it confirmed it would spend $2.8 billion expanding production in Nanjing, China, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/TSMC-logs-20-net-profit-rise-in-Q2-amid-chip-shortage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also considering building its first chip plant in Japan, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-15/ceo-says-tsmc-is-considering-building-a-chip-plant-in-japan?utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;its CEO has confirmed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KN0PjG"&gt;In the meantime, the chip shortage is continuing to have a real impact on the electronics available for people to buy. Just this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575836/gm-wireless-charging-cadillac-chevy-tahoe-chip-shortage"&gt;General Motors said it would drop wireless smartphone charging&lt;/a&gt; from some of its new SUVs because of supply chain challenges, and shortages are also starting to cause a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575037/pc-market-q2-growth-slowing-chip-shortage-covid-demand"&gt;slowdown in the PC market&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEIgJG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfrpQO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram experiences survived the pandemic and are expanding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-JJl2q0-Bdn5THXTb8sjH57C7mc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69585209/akrales_191010_3617_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gCGSkh"&gt;The pandemic nearly killed those Instagram-ready pop-up experiences. Places like Color Factory and Museum of Ice Cream &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202081/instagram-museum-pop-up-color-factory-museum-ice-cream-lay-offs"&gt;laid off&lt;/a&gt; employees as the world shut down, and they tried, seemingly unsuccessfully, to re-create their photogenic experiences online. But now, they’re back, raising money, and opening new locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwCU7H"&gt;Color Factory tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it recently closed a $10 million fundraising round from private equity and angel investors, which it’ll use to expand and hire people who help build the sites. Today, it’s additionally announcing its next location: Chicago. It’ll be opening a Color Factory in the Willis Tower, a major sightseeing destination that brings in nearly 2 million visitors a year on its own. The idea is clearly for Color Factory to benefit from the people already visiting the building and to attract new visitors who might care more about Color Factory’s setup than the Willis Tower’s Skydeck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qSMNqR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The team is renovating rooms to encourage repeat visits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4GxVfl"&gt;At the same time, Color Factory seems to be entering a new stage, one where building a location might not be enough to propel the business forward, and instead, the team has to encourage repeat visitors. They, for the first time, renovated multiple rooms in their original New York City location and will upgrade the camera system in the coming months to allow for people to take home actual prints of the photos they take. (Seemingly the team is now acknowledging that its locations are no longer pop-up experiences and will stay in a space for as long as it’ll have them and be successful.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjltGA"&gt;“Eighty percent of our business [in New York] pre-pandemic was tourism, like people going one-and-done, so you didn’t need to make exhibits that you wanted to go back to three or four times because most of our consumers would come once and never come again, or not to that facility, or they would leave and come again years later,” CEO Jeff Lind says. Now, however, the New York City location mostly caters to locals who the team wants to keep coming back for years. That means exhibit updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRdYb1"&gt;Color Factory’s main competitor, Museum of Ice Cream, also &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CREghPaB9Ev/"&gt;just announced&lt;/a&gt; its newest location: Austin. The photogenic experiences are spreading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odBjKi"&gt;But all of this news comes at a time when Instagram’s own CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557942/instagram-no-longer-photo-app-video-entertainment-focus"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; the platform as “no longer a photo-sharing app.” Still, Color Factory, its competitors, and its investors see potential in the space. In 2019, Lind and his team &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20949838/color-factory-houston-instagram-pop-up-experience-museum"&gt;told me&lt;/a&gt; their work wasn’t all about the ‘gram, and these changes, as well as the deemphasis on photos on Instagram, might test that belief.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new 3D emoji include Clippy coming back to life in Office</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/46JL8qR4XMuAi3rzStCWgluNyCI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69585177/Clippy.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FMlAcP"&gt;Microsoft is bringing its infamous Clippy character back to life as an emoji in Office. After a successful campaign &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577468/microsoft-office-clippy-emoji-tweet-likes"&gt;to get some Twitter and Instagram likes&lt;/a&gt;, Clippy will now replace the paperclip emoji that exists across Windows, Office, Microsoft Teams, and other Microsoft 365 products. It’s part of a bigger update that will see 1,800 emoji in Microsoft 365 updated with 3D designs and the company’s Fluent Design language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKE0Tu"&gt;Clippy is the star of the show, with 3D emoji that have been redesigned to add a lot more personality. “I grew up using Clippy, and it just seemed like a fun little Easter egg,” says Claire Anderson, Microsoft’s official “Emoji-ologist,” in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We just all imagined that delight when you put the paperclip in a Microsoft product and then all of a sudden, you get this dose of nostalgia.” Clippy, with its Groucho eyebrows, will now replace the flat and boring paperclip.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l7VDu38yBzK6S9BEU62UKbo5rxc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22718943/Clippy.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clippy replaces the old and flat paperclip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QSjtE9"&gt;The big change with Microsoft’s emoji is a move to 3D that will show up across Windows and elsewhere. “We opted for 3D designs over 2D and chose to animate the majority of our emoji,” explains Anderson. The emoji have been redesigned to include bright and saturated colors, with a focus on fun in the workplace. The 3D element really makes them pop, and they look a lot more modern than what’s currently available in Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUFxh1"&gt;Around 900 of these overhauled emoji will also be animated in products like Microsoft Teams. “We loved that element of Skype legacy, so we wanted to bring that into this new system and bring that to life for more of our users,” says Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3dCwky"&gt;Emoji have increasingly been an important part of online communications in recent years, adding emotion to what would otherwise be lifeless computer-based interactions. Microsoft says it has worked to “rethink graphical expressions of professionalism” with this big emoji update, something that’s particularly relevant during a pandemic that has blurred the lines between work and life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bF7wopg37YAx2Aag5NHarduGog4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22718946/windowsemoji.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Windows emoji.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="r3heIu"&gt;“Because being playful or highly expressive doesn’t come easily to everyone, emoji are the perfect little helpers,” says Anderson. “Far from being frivolous or ornamental, they’re extensions of our own humanity and an important communication tool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmnFwM"&gt;Microsoft’s renewed focus on fun with its emoji is a far cry from the company’s previous effort to resurrect Clippy. Some employees working on Microsoft Teams&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18276923/microsoft-clippy-microsoft-teams-stickers-removal"&gt; released a fun sticker pack in 2019 featuring animated Clippy GIFs&lt;/a&gt;, but Microsoft quickly removed them after a few days. An insider at Microsoft told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time that the “brand police” inside the company weren’t happy that Clippy had appeared in Microsoft Teams. It’s likely that there were legal or copyright issues behind the decision, and interestingly, Microsoft actually&lt;a href="https://trademarks.justia.com/907/82/clippy-90782096.html"&gt; filed for a Clippy trademark&lt;/a&gt; just last month.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qI8ShXYAgua4BDKMfvX-f5cXFl8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22718948/smileys_collection.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new smiley emoji.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HD6pPo"&gt;Microsoft’s new emoji might be a minor addition to the company’s online services, but they also speak to a broader design ambition at the software maker. Microsoft has been&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/29/18515776/microsoft-design-open-fluent-prototypes-history"&gt; challenging itself to adopt an “open design” philosophy&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, a more coherent and human approach to how it designs software and hardware across its various teams. We’ve seen a greater focus on iconography, and a Fluent Design system that spans across Microsoft’s services.&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"&gt; Windows 11 is the latest example of Microsoft’s design changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXOb9B"&gt;The refreshed emoji will start to appear across all of Microsoft 365 in the coming months. Flipgrid will get access to the new emoji next month, with Microsoft Teams and Windows getting updated in the holiday season. Yammer, Outlook, and other Office apps will see the emoji updates soon after, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yZDxx"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What a new book reveals about Facebook and Russian interference</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LSP1u9Av-_ZF1q7iHYZVJh4jr-U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69584773/wjoel_180319_2394_facebook_006.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth&lt;/em&gt; tracks the last five years of Facebook scandals &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6QaS3u"&gt;As the second season of the great 2000s crime drama &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; begins, Baltimore police detective Jimmy McNulty finds himself on a boat. After spending the previous season sounding the alarm about local drug kingpin Avon Barksdale, to the indifference and annoyance of his various superiors, McNulty is exiled to the city’s marine unit. (His bosses have learned he gets seasick, and punish him accordingly.) The special investigation team he was part of is forcibly disbanded; drug dealing in Baltimore continues unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lylWxC"&gt;Something similar happens to Alex Stamos, the non-fictional former chief security officer of Facebook, in the wake of his 2016-17 investigation into Russian interference on the platform. In&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ugly-Truth-Inside-Facebooks-Domination-ebook/dp/B09461YYFV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8"&gt; &lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth: Inside Facebook’s Battle for Domination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, authors Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang detail the company’s dawning awareness of the foreign adversaries in their midst. By the time it’s all over, Donald Trump will be president, and Facebook’s halting response triggers an international reckoning over the size and power of technology platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FisaHS"&gt;&lt;q&gt; the company’s dawning awareness of the foreign adversaries in their midst&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QiPrF0"&gt;The broad outlines of this story are well known, and have been told on a regular basis ever since, including in this column. (The aftermath of the 2016 election, and Facebook’s role in it, were the original inspiration for this newsletter.) The value in &lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth&lt;/em&gt; comes from the detail it brings to the Russia investigation as it was experienced by some of its participants at the time. And while I ultimately come to some different conclusions than the authors do, the book is worth reading for everyone interested in social networks, trust and safety, and cybersecurity. (And, of course, for anyone else like me who is fascinated by Facebook history.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xl4J8S"&gt;First, some disclosures: Frenkel and Kang have been colleagues of mine on the Facebook beat for years, and I’ve long been a fan of their work. I’m also friendly with Stamos — no reporter can resist a loudmouth who always gets in trouble with his bosses for telling them things they don’t want to hear, since this is secretly how we all think of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBfB6S"&gt;Stamos arrived at Facebook in September 2015 following a high-profile stint at Yahoo, where he discovered a vulnerability in Yahoo mail that allowed the US government to monitor the messages of Yahoo Mail users. The vulnerability had been approved by then-CEO Marissa Mayer; Stamos quit a few weeks later on principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qw9TFQ"&gt;There were actually two separate Russian campaigns on Facebook during the 2016 election. The first came from Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU. Facebook first discovered GRU activity in March 2016, according to a postmortem circulated internally the following year. GRU agents made fake Facebook accounts and pages, and used them to spread disinformation and false news. Stamos’ team shared reports on what it found with the FBI — it heard nothing back from the agency — and also with his direct supervisors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2KVrr"&gt;Facebook was slow to remove some of what it found, in part because at the time it had no rule against foreign groups setting up groups and pages to manipulate American opinion. After Facebook became aware that a Russian-operated page known as DCLeaks was distributing stolen emails from the Clinton campaign to journalists on the platform, the company initially took no action. Only after a security analyst found that the documents contained personal information — a clear violation of Facebook rules — was DCLeaks banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRcbFe"&gt;But even as the company investigated, it said nothing publicly. The authors write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3GgET2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They didn’t have a protocol in place, and so they didn’t want us to take action. It made no sense.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QKIvyL"&gt;Within the threat intel group, there was debate over what should be done. Facebook was a private company, some argued, not an intelligence agency; the platform was not duty-bound to report its findings. For all Facebook knew, the National Security Agency was tracking the same Russian accounts the company was seeing, and possibly planning arrests. It might be irresponsible for Facebook to say anything. Others argued that Facebook’s silence was facilitating Russian efforts to spread the stolen information. They said the company needed to make public that Russia-linked accounts were spreading hacked documents through Facebook. To them, the situation felt like a potential national emergency. “It was crazy. They didn’t have a protocol in place, and so they didn’t want us to take action. It made no sense,” one security team member said. “It felt like this was maybe a time to break precedent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoFHIH"&gt;While Facebook considered what to do about the Russians’ hack-and-leak campaign, a separate influence operation was unfolding under its nose. The Internet Research Agency, a “troll farm” that&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html"&gt; the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; had first profiled in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, was running its own attack. It was discovered only after the election, in 2017, when a senator alerted Facebook officials to its existence. A subsequent Facebook investigation found that the IRA had published 80,000 posts, spent $100,000 on 3,300 advertisements, and reached as many as 126 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2I1t9"&gt;That investigation had been undertaken by Stamos’ team without the knowledge of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg or COO Sheryl Sandberg — this is the moment in the book that I began to see him as Jimmy McNulty — and Frenkel and Kang report that this put him in a tenuous position. Tensions spilled out during a presentation of the team’s findings to Zuckerberg and his leadership team in December 2016, a month after the election:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkgvDK"&gt;His investigation could expose the company to legal liability or congressional oversight, and Sandberg, as the liaison be- tween Facebook and Washington, would eventually be called to DC to explain Facebook’s findings to Congress. “No one said the words, but there was this feeling that you can’t disclose what you don’t know,” according to one executive who attended the meeting. Stamos’s team had uncovered information that no one, including the U.S. government, had previously known. But at Facebook, being proactive was not always appreciated. “By investigating what Russia was doing, Alex had forced us to make decisions about what we were going to publicly say. People weren’t happy about that,” recalled the executive. “He had taken it upon himself to uncover a problem. That’s never a good look,” observed another meeting participant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sglHbA"&gt;Stamos would spend the next year managing the fallout of the revelations, and putting together various plans to restructure Facebook’s security operations. One of his ideas was to embed security people throughout the organization, rather than silo it from the rest of Facebook. The company accepted this idea, but it wound up leaving him like McNulty on the boat — a man without a country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8489FY"&gt;When he returned to work in January, the security team of over 120 people that he had built was largely disbanded. As he had suggested, they were moved across to various parts of the company, but he had no role, or visibility, into their work. Instead, he was left in charge of a whittled-down team of roughly five people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQxRTa"&gt;Stamos left Facebook in the summer of 2018 to create the Stanford Internet Observatory, where he built a team that analyzes influence operations on social platforms around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="rWayaP"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bVYKRb"&gt;What lessons have platforms learned, if any, since 2016? Facebook massively expanded its team devoted to “platform integrity,” which monitors for Russia-style campaigns, and publishes monthly reports on the networks of adversaries that it disrupts around the world. (This has become so routine that they now typically get little coverage beyond Facebook’s own blog posts on the subject.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h2Cnce"&gt;“Since 2017, we have removed over 150 covert influence operations originating in more than 50 counties,” Facebook told me today, “and a dedicated investigative team continues to vigilantly protect democracy on our platform both here and abroad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdCE3o"&gt;Meanwhile, disinformation in US elections has become a primarily domestic concern, driven by politicians like former President Donald Trump, who spread lies with impunity and was often rewarded for it by his voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIX6ia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; is a show about how people are shaped by the systems that they work within, and &lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth&lt;/em&gt; offers a story like that, too. Facebook’s police found plenty of suspicious activity while out on patrol, but they struggled to make an airtight case — to say, definitively, what they were looking at. Amid that uncertainty, the almighty inertia of bureaucracy took over: &lt;em&gt;who do we tell? What do they do with what they tell them? Who is ultimately responsible? &lt;/em&gt;And in the confusion, Russia’s campaign succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="i6s4qm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;in the confusion, Russia’s campaign succeeded&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZO8QI4"&gt;At the same time, the story of the 2016 election is much bigger than Russia and Facebook. It’s a story about the accelerating polarization of our country; white anxiety over demographic changes; the decline of local journalism; and the fracturing of our broader information ecosystem. Even the Russia story was not simply about Facebook:&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/world/europe/russian-hackers-find-ready-bullhorns-in-the-media.html"&gt; the country pioneered the strategy of “hack and leak”&lt;/a&gt; — stealing documents and sharing them with mainstream news outlets while concealing their origin, giving those documents greater legitimacy when they were published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6kl4n"&gt;Facebook had many failures during 2016, but the greatest one was of imagination: an inability to see that a platform that had gathered together billions of people would create a powerful point of leverage for foreign adversaries seeking to reshape public opinion — and to benefit from the platform’s own viral sharing mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xV5eak"&gt;Facebook has since learned that lesson; it has never been harder to set up a network of fake accounts on the network and keep it operational. And yet just because Facebook is less vulnerable to attack from state actors doesn’t mean its current information environment is good or healthy. High-quality news is too often relegated to a secondary tab, while depending on your friend and follow graph, your News Feed could be as dumb, partisan, and polarizing as ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOATUv"&gt;What will be the result of people consuming years of feed posts that misinform them, or lead them to outrage? Who is the McNulty inside Facebook empowered to run &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; investigation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZcBLC"&gt;It feels like there are some failures of imagination there, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="uFttUp"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Y0oXP2"&gt;While the Russia story is at the heart of &lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth&lt;/em&gt;, the book also serves as a kind of compendium of Facebook’s highest-profile scandals over the years. Searching for a connecting thread, the authors attribute the company’s history of public relations crises to its capitalist origins: “the platform is built upon a fundamental, possibly irreconcilable dichotomy: its purported mission to advance society by connecting people while also profiting off them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0H7txX"&gt;Certainly, Facebook triggered several crises as a direct result of pursuing growth and profits above all else: the initial launch of the News Feed; the&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Beacon"&gt; Beacon&lt;/a&gt; advertising disaster; setting posts to public by default in 2009; and most damningly, the tragic, heedless expansion into a genocidal&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html"&gt; Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;, where Facebook initially had only a single moderator who spoke Burmese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UlDt4"&gt;Other topics covered here, though, don’t fit quite as squarely into that narrative. The company’s use of human moderators to select “trending topics” for the feed, which is given much space in the book, actually &lt;em&gt;improved&lt;/em&gt; Facebook by keeping misinformation out of sight. To the extent it was a scandal, it was only because selecting for high-quality news disadvantaged Republican outrage bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3B1OyZ"&gt;In other cases, the company faces blowback because it exercises its right to moderate content as it sees fit: leaving up a manipulated video of Nancy Pelosi, say, or defending a decade-old policy permitting Holocaust deniers on the platform. (That policy was reversed last year.) Whatever you think of those decisions, they don’t strike me as capitalist growth hacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="naT1qr"&gt;To me, the most alarming Facebook scandals have always been the ones that reflect the company’s ability to affect human psychology, typically without our knowledge. Like the time in 2012 that the company&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/"&gt; experimented with altering users’ moods&lt;/a&gt; by showing them happy or sad posts in the News Feed. Or the revelation that Cambridge Analytica used Facebook data to create “psychographic profiles” of users in hope of better targeting them with ads to benefit the Trump campaign. (This effort seems to have been a total failure, but the fact that this even seemed possible fueled much of the outrage toward that company and Facebook.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFLnBX"&gt;You can look at the story of Russian interference on Facebook as a growth-and-profits scandal, I &lt;em&gt;guess&lt;/em&gt; — if you want to suggest it happened only because the company under-invested in security and moderation, which everyone at Facebook now acknowledges it did. But to me this one falls in that last camp — the human psychology one. I’m ultimately less worried that it took Facebook so long to find the Russians as I am about what it was possible for them to do&lt;em&gt; using &lt;/em&gt;Facebook. After all, the same viral machinery they used so successfully in 2016 is still being used every day — by Americans against other Americans, and by&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/June-2021-CIB-Report-Final.pdf"&gt; various foreign governments against their own citizens.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ta5pe3"&gt;To me, that’s not a story about the business model being “broken,” as is so often said about the company. If Facebook had switched off ads in 2015 and become a nonprofit organization, the vast majority of the 2016 Russian influence operation still would have been possible. To me, this is a story about a social network that is massive, powerful, mostly unregulated, and by virtue of its data being privately owned, still poorly understood. In 2021, Facebook now has the tools for dealing with foreign adversaries. But Americans still don’t have many tools for dealing with Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kxXFx"&gt;So by all means, let’s keep debating those bills now before Congress. Let’s pass a national privacy law. Let’s scrutinize future mergers and keep an eye&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537795/is-facebook-cornering-the-vr-market"&gt; on Facebook’s VR ambitions&lt;/a&gt;. And let’s invest in&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/what-social-networks-could-learn"&gt; public social media&lt;/a&gt; — and public media in general — to see what kinds of good we can do online when we remove the profit motive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NGNONp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;for more than five years, various parts of our critical internet infrastructure have been under attack&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2MMBoj"&gt;But let’s also not allow ourselves the comforting delusion that the problems in our information environment begin and end in Menlo Park. All year now, cyberattacks have been ravaging our country — many of them appearing to originate in Russia. That’s a different story from the one told in &lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth&lt;/em&gt;, but it is also part of a single story, which is that for more than five years now, various parts of our critical internet infrastructure have been under attack. Until very recently, thanks to the president they helped elect, Russia has suffered very few consequences for its actions. And among all the ugly truths on parade here, that might be the one that baffles me most of all. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Candace Parker becomes first woman to feature on NBA 2K cover</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Chicago Sky v New York Liberty" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pEYvhagREqqb-zHZpdvx_5lnEZE=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69584706/1233602900.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ned Dishman/NBAE via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m5AJPc"&gt;Candace Parker has become the first WNBA player to appear on the cover of an &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K&lt;/em&gt; game. The Chicago Sky forward, a six-time WNBA All-Star, two-time WNBA MVP, and 2016 WNBA Finals MVP, is featured on the cover of the WNBA 25th Anniversary Special Edition of &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K22&lt;/em&gt;, which will be released on September 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHlsTc"&gt;“I grew up a video game fanatic, that’s what I did, to the point where my brothers would give me the fake controller when I was younger where I think I was playing and I wasn’t,” &lt;a href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/31816516/chicago-sky-candace-parker-first-woman-cover-nba-2k-game"&gt;Parker tells ESPN&lt;/a&gt;. “All I wanted to do was just be like them. As a kid growing up, you dream of having your own shoe and dream of being in a video game. Those are an athlete as a kid’s dreams. To be able to experience that, I don’t take it lightly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="S9HiTX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Extremely proud and humbled to be the first female cover athlete in the history of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NBA2K?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NBA2K&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m honored to work with a company that’s investing in women and betting on us to succeed. I’m hopeful there will be many more badass females to follow      &lt;a href="https://t.co/WJan4YE7Qt"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WJan4YE7Qt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Candace Parker (@Candace_Parker) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Candace_Parker/status/1415311818071756806?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ALnUpH"&gt;The WNBA was added to &lt;em&gt;2K&lt;/em&gt; three years ago with &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K20&lt;/em&gt;, so it’s a little surprising it’s taken this long for a female player to be featured on the cover — particularly since 2K Sports often releases multiple versions of the game starring different athletes. Last year’s &lt;em&gt;2K21&lt;/em&gt;, for example, had Damian Lillard on the last-generation console versions, Zion Williamson on the PS5 and Series X versions, and a special “Mamba Forever” edition honoring the late Kobe Bryant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjUya5"&gt;This time around, the Dallas Mavericks’ star guard Luka Doncic will be featured on the standard cover, while an NBA 75th Anniversary Edition cover depicts NBA legends Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Dirk Nowitzki, and Kevin Durant. There’s yet another special edition starring the Washington Wizards’ Rui Hachimura, which will only be available in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyX4dX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBA 2K22&lt;/em&gt; will be released on the PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch, PC, and Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

    <title>Amazon adds AirPlay 2 and HomeKit to two Fire TV Edition TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GRIl6CVdBf_cSWN_jAr9Ezf2gMA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69584030/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zXQ8jp"&gt;Amazon is adding support for AirPlay 2 and HomeKit to two of its Fire TV Edition TVs in a free update, the company &lt;a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/apple-airplay-2-and-homekit-now-available-on-toshiba-and-insignia-4k-uhd-smart-fire-tv-2020-models-89188a0b0fb3"&gt;announced on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. Both the 2020 Toshiba 4K UHD Smart Fire TV with Dolby Vision and the 2020 Insignia 4K UHD Smart TV will receive the features, before they arrive on Amazon’s less expensive Fire TV sticks and set-top boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7OgeT"&gt;On these specific TV sets, AirPlay 2 should function the same on Apple’s own Apple TV, allowing you to send audio and video from your phone, tablet, or computer to the big screen and control playback from your device. Integrating with HomeKit, Apple’s smart home ecosystem, requires a little extra legwork: you’ll have to enable HomeKit in your TV’s settings under Display &amp;amp; Sounds &amp;gt; AirPlay &amp;amp; HomeKit &amp;gt; Set Up, and then add it as a device in the Home app. Once it’s added, you can use Siri to turn your Fire TV on and off, change the volume, or switch inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSRKpf"&gt;Both AirPlay 2 and HomeKit coming to Fire TVs (and hopefully, one day soon, Fire TV sticks) should make using the TVs with Apple’s devices that much easier. Apple already has an in with Amazon’s devices — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20930244/apple-tv-app-amazon-fire-tv-stick-models-now-available"&gt;Apple TV Plus app came to Fire TVs&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BX6Z41"&gt;It’s a stark contrast to how these two companies were interacting a little over five years ago, Back then, Amazon had banned sales of competing hardware like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/2/9439281/amazon-ban-apple-tv-chromecast-why"&gt;Apple TV (and Chromecast, and Nexus Player)&lt;/a&gt; in its marketplace because it claimed it was important to only sell media players that “interact well” with Prime Video. The companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/12/14/16777508/amazon-brings-back-apple-tv-google-chromecast"&gt;have since reconciled&lt;/a&gt;, and reached a very favorable deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;for Amazon that allows it to avoid Apple’s 30 percent App Store commission&lt;/a&gt; and use its own in-app purchase system. Now things are better. At least if you own an iPhone and Fire TV. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix snags former EA, Oculus exec to lead its video game efforts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kHyYKD-0XwbmYb2lJJOvB5rZm3U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69583622/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gqqEE6"&gt;A report this spring from &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/netflix-seeks-executive-to-expand-game-efforts"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said that Netflix was seeking an executive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452173/netflix-gaming-subscription-service-executive-2022"&gt;to lead its push into gaming&lt;/a&gt;, with an eye toward offering an Apple Arcade or Xbox Game Pass-like subscription bundle. Now, as first reported &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/netflix-nflx-to-offer-video-games-on-its-streaming-platform?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the streaming company has hired Mike Verdu as its vice president of game development reporting to COO Greg Peters. A Netflix spokesperson confirmed the hire to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxBAtP"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Netflix could offer games right next to its other streaming content “within the next year” listed as a new genre just like documentaries or anything else, without charging extra for the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvXwjj"&gt;Verdu is a former exec who has experience with mobile gaming companies like Zynga, ran EA Mobile for a year, and most recently has been working at Facebook acquiring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22530144/facebook-oculus-studios-acquires-bigbox-vr-population-one"&gt;a series of Oculus game developers like BigBox VR&lt;/a&gt;, maker of &lt;em&gt;Population: One&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JJm1EO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The attention economy is dead, but Fortnite might hold the key to an answer","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/3/18246868/attention-economy-fortnite-advertising-user-engagement"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="u3hhdu"&gt;On its last earnings call in April (&lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Netflix-Inc.-Q1-2021-Earnings-Call-Apr-20-2021.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;), Peters said “...we’re in the business of creating these amazing deep universes and compelling characters and people come to love those universes and they want to immerse themselves more deeply and get to know the characters better and their back stories and all that stuff. And so really we’re trying to figure out what are all these different ways that we can increase those points of connection, we can deepen that fandom.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Asy3pk"&gt;“And certainly, games is (sic) a really interesting component of that... And there’s no doubt that games are going to be an important form of entertainment and an important sort of modality to deepen that fan experience. So we’re going to keep going, and we’ll continue to learn and figure it out as we go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBI14h"&gt;Netflix gaming forays have included interactive features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152973/netflix-carmen-sandiego-interactive-special-black-mirror-gaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carmen Sandiego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as licensed games including a &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; title for mobile devices. It also currently has a few job listings &lt;a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/93060254"&gt;for positions producing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/64788193"&gt;leading interactive products&lt;/a&gt;, postings that don’t mention the word gaming, but show it’s staffing up with people who have the experience necessary to help that division get off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfKire"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 14th, 7:25PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional details and confirmation from a Netflix spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft attributes new SolarWinds attack to a Chinese hacker group</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cGaGmP"&gt;Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2021%2F07%2F13%2Fmicrosoft-discovers-threat-actor-targeting-solarwinds-serv-u-software-with-0-day-exploit%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that SolarWinds software was attacked with a zero-day exploit by a group of hackers it calls “DEV-0322.” The hackers were focused on SolarWinds’ Serv-U FTP software, with the presumed goal of accessing the company’s clients in the US defense industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DAaCsU"&gt;The zero-day attack was first spotted in a routine Microsoft 365 Defender scan. The software noticed an “anomalous malicious process” that Microsoft explains in more detail in &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2021%2F07%2F13%2Fmicrosoft-discovers-threat-actor-targeting-solarwinds-serv-u-software-with-0-day-exploit%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its blog&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems the hackers were attempting to make themselves Serv-U administrators, among other suspicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="klIEzb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Update Serv-U as soon as possible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U05ytu"&gt;SolarWinds reported the zero-day exploit &lt;a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2021-35211"&gt;on Friday, July 9th&lt;/a&gt;, explaining that all of the Serv-U releases from May 5th and earlier contained the vulnerability. The company released a hotfix to address the issue and the exploit has since been patched, but Microsoft writes that if Serv-U’s Secure Shell (SSH) protocol connected to the internet, the hackers could “remotely run arbitrary code with privileges, allowing them to perform actions like install and run malicious payloads, or view and change data.” Anyone running older Serv-U software is encouraged to update it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1u5Adr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/13/22173035/hackers-russia-breached-us-government-agencies-email-cozy-bear"&gt;The first hack&lt;/a&gt; that shoved SolarWinds into the limelight in December 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210667/solarwinds-hack-worse-government-microsoft-cybersecurity"&gt;exposed hundreds&lt;/a&gt; of government agencies and businesses. Unlike the previous hack, which is now widely connected to a Russian state-affiliated group of hackers called Cozy Bear, Microsoft says this zero-day attack originated in China. DEV-0322 has made a habit of attacking “entities in the US Defense Industrial Base Sector,” Microsoft writes, and is known for “using commercial VPN solutions and compromised consumer routers in their attacker infrastructure.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus says the base OnePlus 9 Pro actually won’t be sold in North America</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid, but has room to improve" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/abwW_Zeb-zdZl3IGCvW1HnAMCMU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69583432/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0053_Edit_1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Gg8nu"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro went on sale on April 2nd, but to date, the $969 base model, which comes with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, hasn’t been available to actually buy in North America. The company had told &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/03/oneplus-delays-sales-of-the-9-pros-969-base-model/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; on April 3rd&lt;/a&gt; that the base version was still on the way, but now, according to &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/14/the-969-base-model-oneplus-9-pro-is-never-coming-to-the-us/"&gt;a new statement given to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it actually won’t make its way to the US or Canada due to “unforeseen supply constraints.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V23oP9"&gt;Here’s the full statement, from &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6KWun5"&gt;“The OnePlus 9 Pro 8x128 GB variant was originally set to be sold in North America for $969. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen supply constraints specific to North American devices, we recently concluded it is no longer possible to bring this configuration to the United States and Canada. In North America we are prioritizing the 12x256 GB version to ensure our users have access to the highest spec device.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wKPcL9"&gt;This decision means that that the only OnePlus 9 Pro model available for US and Canadian consumers is the more expensive $1,069 version with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. But if you’re looking for a more affordable OnePlus phone, the OnePlus 9 is still a good option, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;my colleague Allison Johnson’s review&lt;/a&gt;. While it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of the 9 Pro, it starts at $729, making it $340 cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
