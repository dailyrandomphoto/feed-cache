    <title>Conservative pranksters face $5 million proposed fine over robocalls</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JVzlyo"&gt;On Tuesday, the Federal Communications Commission proposed &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-375180A1.pdf"&gt;an over $5 million fine&lt;/a&gt; against conspiracy theorists and conservative activists John Burkman and Jacob Wohl for making hundreds of robocalls spreading 2020 election misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GP5nh"&gt;In its proposal, the FCC said that the agency is weighing a $5,134,500 fine against Burkman and Wohl for making over 1,100 robocalls in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA. The violating pre-recorded calls told voters that their personal information would be “part of a public database” that would be used by “police departments to track down old warrants and be used by credit card companies to collect outstanding debts” if they chose to vote by mail in the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bOZbX"&gt;It’s the largest TCPA fine the FCC has ever proposed, according to a press release from the agency Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bLlB0"&gt;Last October, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497823/jacob-wohl-jack-burkman-michigan-robocall-voter-intimidation-felony-charges"&gt;filed four felony charges&lt;/a&gt; against Burkman and Wohl, accusing the pair of discouraging Detroit residents from voting in the 2020 election. Specifically, the case accuses them of targeting voters in Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Illinois in around 85,000 calls last August. According to the Michigan Attorney General’s Office, the calls claimed to come from “Project 1599, a civil rights organization” founded by the pair and targeted areas with large populations of Black voters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCZvXd"&gt;“We remain committed to defending democracy against misinformation spread in an attempt to undermine our free and fair elections,” Nessel said in a statement earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3p4l7"&gt;A trial date &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/ag/0,4534,7-359-92297_47203-558712%E2%80%94,00.html"&gt;has not been set&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s OLED TV from my dreams reportedly delayed to 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vWJ1UQYTEcPA7RPZr9BxDJInNmw=/22x0:1030x672/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69770987/LG_Dolby_Vision_Gaming_02a.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XfIZuU"&gt;At CES 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224137/lg-display-42-inch-oled-tv-panel-announced"&gt;LG Display announced&lt;/a&gt; that it intended to produce a 42-inch OLED TV panel sometime in 2021. You weren’t alone if, like me, you got really excited, and also expected one of these more compact OLED panels to have already launched. That’s not happening this year, according to sources speaking to &lt;a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202108190017"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Korea Economic Daily&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who say that the launch of LG’s planned 42-inch OLED TV has been pushed to 2022 instead, alongside the new 2022 TV lineup and debut at CES 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9AynW"&gt;The delay doesn’t seem to have been caused by issues with production, according to &lt;em&gt;The Korea Economic Daily. &lt;/em&gt;While its sources expected LG to launch the 42-inch in the second half of 2021 following mass production of the panels, they say the company switched the launch window to “maximize its marketing efforts rather than unveiling it later this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JVX2IBv3-2yRgRvXj0fJql5rzBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227031/44900793067647000_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;LG Display&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’d probably pose like this with an OLED if I owned one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z4WtQr"&gt;Compared to LG’s entry-level A1-series OLED TVs that have 60Hz displays, LG is apparently angling this new 42-inch model to fit in with its other high-end OLED TVs, like the OLED G1 evo and C1 lineups, despite its smaller size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYNtdq"&gt;If all of this pans out, it’ll ideally have a 120Hz refresh rate display with multiple HDMI 2.1 ports that allow 120 frames per second 4K gameplay (in games that support it) on PC, PS5, or Xbox Series X. It should also support variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low-latency mode, which are features that can make gaming look and feel smoother and more enjoyable. Though, with specs like that, I wouldn’t expect this to be a particularly affordable TV. The current 48-inch C1 was originally priced at $1,499.99 (but can currently be purchased for $1,299.99), so this smaller one will hopefully cost a little less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvXNZq"&gt;At 42 inches, this OLED panel isn’t going after the average TV viewer. This size straddles the line between TV and gaming monitor, and it seems ideal for gamers with desk space — and disposable income — to spare. There are plenty of big gaming monitor options north of $700 that offer competitive specs like HDMI 2.1 ports and VRR, but none that have a panel that can compete with the rich contrast, color accuracy, and brightness of an OLED. Well, except for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382201/gigabyte-aorus-4k-gaming-monitor-tv-oled"&gt;Gigabyte’s $1,500 Aorus FO48U gaming monitor&lt;/a&gt;. Okay, &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/b52e629c-c63e-4d6b-877d-6dff584c7863"&gt;the $2,500 curved Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 is rad&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nRTH9t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to LG for confirmation of this alleged delay, and whether it can confirm if the TV will appear at CES 2022 next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung will let you unlock your Z Fold 3’s bootloader, but at the cost of your cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/knM-Jr7vnUGfjkP4IUKRywCWjMk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69770961/dbohn_210820_4722_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jPLB9Z"&gt;Samsung seems to be trying to discourage users from modifying the software on their new Galaxy Z Fold 3s, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-unlock-bootloader-broken-camera/"&gt;giving them a message&lt;/a&gt; that unlocking the phone’s bootloader will render the phone’s cameras unusable (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/08/24/samsung-cripples-the-galaxy-z-fold3-if-you-unlock-the-bootloader/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/11/20/unlocking-bootloader-sony-phones-no-longer-wrecks-camera-pie/"&gt;isn’t the first time&lt;/a&gt; we’ve seen phone manufacturers pull this sort of trick, but it seems to represent an escalation in Samsung’s fight against its users who want to gain complete control over their phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJ7TsX"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/unlocking-bootloader-will-disable-the-camera.4321957/"&gt;XDA Forums user confirms&lt;/a&gt; that after unlocking the bootloader, the Z Fold 3’s cameras were completely non-functional: facial recognition, loading the camera app, and trying third-party camera apps all failed for them. The user reports that re-locking the bootloader made the cameras work again. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LvBdSg7b7QZMbhQfWtdtpKa3zOE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803288/20210820_121528.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/unlocking-bootloader-will-disable-the-camera.4321957/#post-85506611" target="_blank"&gt;白い熊 on XDA Forums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The message shown to users trying to unlock their bootloader.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HvNHFu"&gt;According to a photo (seen above) posted by a member of the forums, the message users receive when trying to unlock their Z Fold 3’s bootloader reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ote4a"&gt;Unlock the bootloader to install custom operating system software. Doing so will cause the camera to be disabled and may cause your phone or apps to stop working correctly. To prevent unauthorized access to your personal data, your phone will be factory reset, which will erase all data, including files and downloaded apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XK1Fmd"&gt;Volume up: Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cw29iv"&gt;Unlock bootloader (may void warranty)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seJ0cP"&gt;Volume down: No&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpUVLP"&gt;Do not unlock bootloader and restart phone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3vtrq1"&gt;(A factory reset is &lt;a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/239798/how-to-unlock-your-android-phones-bootloader-the-official-way/"&gt;generally standard&lt;/a&gt; after a bootloader unlock, as is the possibility of a voided warranty.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsQDBi"&gt;While this may be an escalation, Samsung has previously had a somewhat unfriendly stance towards modders. &lt;a href="https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-platform-for-enterprise/faqs/faq-115013719548.htm"&gt;Samsung’s Knox documentation says that&lt;/a&gt;, if you root your phone and flash it with an unofficial Android build, anything having to do with its Knox security will &lt;a href="https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-platform-for-enterprise/faqs/faq-115013562087.htm"&gt;be permanently disabled&lt;/a&gt;, and will only be restored if you replace the phone’s hardware. This means that, if you root a Samsung phone, features like Samsung Pay and Secure Folder won’t ever work again. To be clear, this doesn’t happen if you just unlock your phone’s bootloader — it only occurs after you make changes to the phone’s OS (though doing so is the main reason to unlock your bootloader, so it’s perhaps a distinction without much difference).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xiX36T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving up your cameras seems like an unreasonable ask&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yCF0eD"&gt;While that’s certainly more destructive and permanent, you could also argue that it’s not unreasonable to give up Samsung Pay and Secure Folder if you really want root access to your phone. Giving up your ability to take pictures is a much bigger ask. Plus, unless Samsung’s changed how Knox works, rooting your Fold 3 after unlocking it will also shut down those features, leaving you with a phone that has no cameras, no NFC payment, and no Secure Folder (not that you could take any sensitive pictures anyways). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FElkUr"&gt;There are some ways in which turning off features for rooted users makes sense. In the case of Knox, the phone doesn’t know what code is running on the phone, so it can’t make any promises of security. In the same vein, it wouldn’t be unreasonable if Samsung didn’t let you use the Fold 3’s &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00062630/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;facial recognition unlock feature&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s hard to see how turning off the cameras entirely is anything but a punishment for users who want to mod their phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BDAExV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to see how turning off the cameras entirely is anything but a punishment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RxYodS"&gt;If you’re a US-based Samsung customer, though, you’d have to try a lot harder to even run into these issues — because Samsung reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.thecustomdroid.com/sampwnd-unlock-bootloader-samsung-snapdragon/"&gt;doesn’t officially allow bootloader unlocking&lt;/a&gt; on Snapdragon-based phones sold in the US. There are services you can pay for that claim to unlock your US phone’s bootloader, but it’s not &lt;a href="https://www.hardreset.info/devices/samsung/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2/faq/bootloader-unlock/"&gt;the relatively simple process&lt;/a&gt; found on the global version of the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hP20J"&gt;At the moment, it’s unclear whether the Galaxy Z Flip 3 will also have the same limitation, though one of XDA Forums’ members &lt;a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/unlocking-bootloader-will-disable-the-camera.4321957/page-2#post-85526781"&gt;posted a picture of the unlock bootloader screen on their Flip&lt;/a&gt; and the notice doesn’t mention the cameras. Samsung didn’t immediately answer &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s questions about whether the policy also applied to the Flip, or provide a statement about the policy in general.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter boosts Spaces by showing which ones your friends are attending</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HgF57fa70tcWXNF2varI99Fc-30=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69770849/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rOrmEZ"&gt;Twitter is experimenting with a way to make it easier to find Spaces that you might be interested in. Some users on iOS or Android will now see if someone they follow is listening in on a Space right at the top of their timelines, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1430260138481487881"&gt;according to the Spaces Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PU2twZ"&gt;Twitter has already been surfacing Spaces in that top bar (where you might have also seen Fleets before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;Twitter shut them down&lt;/a&gt;), but previously, it only showed Spaces from people you follow who were &lt;em&gt;hosting&lt;/em&gt; the social audio rooms. Now, though, you might also see when somebody you follow is tuning into one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AIW7E5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;we’re experimenting with ways to help you discover more Spaces. for some of you on iOS and android, if someone you follow is listening to a Space, you’ll see it at the top of your tl.&lt;br&gt;you can control who can see your listening activity in your settings.&lt;br&gt;send us your thoughts! &lt;a href="https://t.co/8fbEZUMvM7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8fbEZUMvM7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1430260138481487881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jZSyAQ"&gt;If you don’t want your followers to know what Spaces you’re attending, you can turn that off by navigating to the “Settings and privacy” menu, then “Privacy and safety,” and then toggling off the option to “allow followers to see which Spaces you’re listening to.” Turning this off won’t hide your presence inside Spaces, though. If you’re attending a Space, the people in the room with you will still be able to see that you’re there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BaC8XG"&gt;Just last week, Twitter added another way to make Spaces more discoverable by making it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631036/twitter-spaces-developers-api-v2"&gt;easier for other apps to point to Spaces&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also continuing to iterate on the experience of being in a Space, adding the ability &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611609/twitter-spaces-co-host-feature-moderate-manage-social-audio-rooms"&gt;for Spaces hosts to designate up to two co-hosts&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is forcing the popular Groovy Discord music bot offline</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oEXBkWIjsMe87-WEvXlW4S0ORK8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69770729/acastro_180322_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YqxuLA"&gt;Google-owned YouTube is starting to crack down on Discord music bots. The search giant has sent a cease and desist to the owners of the popular Groovy Bot, which lets Discord users play music from YouTube videos and is installed on more than 16 million Discord servers. Google wants the service gone within seven days, and Groovy is complying by shutting down its bot on August 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W01GSq"&gt;“Groovy has been a huge part of my life over the past five years. It started because my friend’s bot sucked and I thought I could make a better one,” says Nik Ammerlaan, Groovy Bot owner, in a message announcing the closure. The Groovy Bot sources music from YouTube and allows Discord users to play and share it in servers where the bot is installed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BxiRZ"&gt;Groovy Bot allows for a social listening party on Discord, largely using the audio from YouTube videos. It has become hugely popular over the past five years, with &lt;a href="https://tinelund.dk/groovy-bot-the-best-music-bot-for-discord-groovy-15/"&gt;some estimates&lt;/a&gt; suggesting it has more than 250 million users. It has now caught the attention of Google and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zNUjSM6-Hhbdh3vEJR_x10w1Ggw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803360/99nShh7.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Groovy Bot service will end later this month.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fkw0fF"&gt;“I’m not sure why they decided to send it [a cease and desist] now,” says Ammerlaan in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “They probably just didn’t know about it, to be honest.” Ammerlaan admits Groovy Bot has been a “huge weight” on his shoulders over the past five years, and that Google’s actions were always something he saw coming. “It was just a matter of seeing when it would happen,” says Ammerlaan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3oiVH"&gt;While Groovy Bot supports Spotify, YouTube, Soundcloud, and other services, “something like 98 percent of the tracks played on Groovy were from YouTube,” admits Ammerlaan. Google’s move to force Groovy Bot offline could mean we’ll now see similar action against other Discord bot owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8S2XK"&gt;Rythm, the most popular Discord music bot, is still standing strong... for now. “We don’t currently plan to shut down,” a Rythm bot co-owner, Jet, wrote in a message to its community of users. Rythm is installed on nearly 20 million Discord servers and says it has more than 560 million users as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOQy1T"&gt;We tried to reach out to one of the owners of Rythm, but after initially responding the owner didn’t respond to requests about whether Google had issued a cease and desist. If Google isn’t happy with Groovy Bot, then it’s hard to imagine it’s going to let Rythm continue, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xuVVJV"&gt;Groovy Bot shutting down comes just weeks after several YouTube video downloading sites have disappeared randomly. The removal of this bot also leaves a giant hole in Discord’s bot offerings. “We take the rights of others seriously and require developers who create bots for Discord to do the same,” says a Discord spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If a bot running on Discord violates someone else’s rights, that third party or Discord may take action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBtHY1"&gt;We reached out to Google to comment on the cease and desist order against Groovy Bot, but the company did not respond in time for publication.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart is launching a new white label delivery service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OG9w12n4b0isSU-v35v1RKq3C8E=/11x0:856x563/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69770424/WalmartGoLocal.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Walmart&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M05JKc"&gt;Walmart plans to offer its logistics and delivery services to other companies as part of a new last-mile delivery business, &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/08/24/walmart-launches-walmart-golocal-a-new-delivery-as-a-service-business"&gt;the company announced on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The service, called Walmart GoLocal&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;hopes to serve as a white label delivery offering for businesses big and small, and yet another way for Walmart to try to edge out Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JswpFg"&gt;Details on Walmart GoLocal are fairly sparse, though Walmart does say the service will be “competitively priced” and that it has “already established a number of contractual agreements with national and enterprise retail clients.” Walmart tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;pricing will be based on “the needs of the client and based on what they want to offer to their customers.” &lt;a href="https://one.walmart.com/content/go-local/home-page.html"&gt;The GoLocal website&lt;/a&gt; offers a few more details: customers will order directly from a small business, that business’s platform will ping Walmart, Walmart GoLocal will dispatch a delivery driver, and then collect relevant feedback to give to the business. It’s not a wholly unusual setup, both &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpostmates.com%2Fdeveloper&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F24%2F22639778%2Fwalmart-golocal-delivery-service-small-business-drones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Postmates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://get.doordash.com/en-us/products/drive"&gt;DoorDash&lt;/a&gt; offer white label solutions that work more or less the same. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o1B7G5jUzR-WCJmmxF1Yd4hHa3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803050/Screenshot_2021_08_24_11.10.06_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Walmart&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The basic flow of a Walmart GoLocal order.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gDMCUv"&gt;One difference in Walmart’s version is its driver pool. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/with-holidays-around-corner-walmart-starts-last-mile-delivery-service-2021-08-24/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the drivers delivering for Walmart GoLocal customers will be pulled from the company’s Spark delivery service. Walmart piloted Spark &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17828028/walmart-partners-bringg-logistics-platform-grocery-delivery"&gt;as a sort of Uber for grocery delivery&lt;/a&gt; — Instacart, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363507/walmart-instacart-partnership-same-day-grocery-delivery-amazon-whole-foods-rivalry"&gt;another Walmart partner&lt;/a&gt;, is a good analog — but opening them up to non-Walmart deliveries (and non-food deliveries) could make Spark work a lot more like a white label &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/29/9413787/amazon-flex-package-delivery-seattle"&gt;Amazon Flex&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8PDkm"&gt;Walmart claims it will also make deliveries via drone or autonomous vehicle depending on the size of the delivery and the location. &lt;a href="https://dronedj.com/2021/08/24/walmart-delivery-drone-golocal/"&gt;As noted by DroneDJ&lt;/a&gt;, Walmart’s investment &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/06/17/walmart-invests-in-droneup-the-nationwide-on-demand-drone-delivery-provider"&gt;in DroneUp’s 10,000 Federal Aviation Administration certified pilots&lt;/a&gt; will probably help with the drone part of the equation. Delivery by autonomous car might similarly be supported by another Walmart investment — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557603/cruise-walmart-autonomous-vehicles-delivery-arizona"&gt;Cruise’s self-driving electric cars&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KJP2E"&gt;GoLocal, Spark, DroneUp, and the rest are a mess of brand names and business investments, but further proof of all the bets Walmart is placing on mastering delivery before Amazon becomes the de facto standard. Not every one of Walmart’s moves against tech giants like Amazon or Netflix have worked out — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21228486/fandango-vudu-streaming-purchase-walmart-comcast-nbcuniversal-amazon-itunes"&gt;see the sale of Vudu to Fandango&lt;/a&gt; — but with last-mile delivery, Walmart is at least playing in a space it's already familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA is opening the patents for some of its accessibility tech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshot of Apex Legends, showing a dessert landscape and a hand holding a knife, with text in the upper right corner that says “you pinged shield battery.”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pirQy0r_WzxfAEQ88WgRFV6sKss=/96x0:1607x1007/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69767263/Shield_Battery_Ping.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A player uses the Ping System in &lt;/em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;em&gt; to alert their team of the presence of a “Shield Battery”.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Electronic Arts&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SbuZYk"&gt;Electronic Arts is pledging to open the patents for some of its accessibility-related tech, including the much-celebrated &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; ping system, the company announced today. EA says it won’t file infringement lawsuits against people or companies for using tech that falls under patents listed in the pledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYcajp"&gt;The ping system in &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, which allows people to play the team-based game without hearing or speaking, has been praised both as an impressive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213537/apex-legend-voice-chat-solo-play-xbox-ps4-pc"&gt;alternative to voice chat&lt;/a&gt; and as a great &lt;a href="https://www.cbr.com/apex-legends-ping-system-is-still-its-best-feature-and-its-most-accessible/"&gt;accessibility feature&lt;/a&gt; for players with a variety of disabilities. A patent that covers the system (&lt;a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&amp;amp;docid=11097189"&gt;US 11,097,189&lt;/a&gt;) was issued the same day as EA’s announcement of the pledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iesF0h"&gt;Along with the ping system patent, EA is opening patents for the tech it uses in &lt;em&gt;Madden&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt; to make them more accessible for people with colorblindness and low vision. The tech includes automated systems for improving visibility by detecting and modifying colors (&lt;a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&amp;amp;docid=10118097"&gt;US 10,118,097&lt;/a&gt;) and contrast ratios (&lt;a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&amp;amp;docid=10878540"&gt;US 10,878,540&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot from Madden 21, showing different options of plays, with color contrast adjusted for color blindness." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Czz5ZQ8J2PsH6I-EFtctXo8OMbk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801446/Ex._1___Deuteranopia_On__as_seen_with_deuteranopia_.png"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HGymNb"&gt;The pledge also includes a patent for a “personalized sound technology” (&lt;a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&amp;amp;docid=10878540"&gt;US 10,878,540&lt;/a&gt;) that will modify or create music for people based on their listening preferences and level of hearing, though EA says this tech hasn’t been developed yet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1Y5cu"&gt;In addition to opening some of its patents, EA is open-sourcing code that helps address issues with brightness, contrast, and colorblindness in digital content. The code is published &lt;a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/Tunable-Colorblindness-Solution"&gt;on EA’s GitHub&lt;/a&gt; under the Apache 2.0 license, so developers can use or adapt it for their own games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQeNK5"&gt;“We hope developers will make the most of these patents and encourage those who have the resources, innovation and creativity to do as we have by making their own pledges that put accessibility first,” says Chris Bruzzo, EVP of positive play, commercial, and marketing at EA. “We welcome collaboration with others on how we move the industry forward together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRdQVg"&gt;EA doesn’t have plans to help other developers implement its tech beyond sharing the patents. “We absolutely respect individual developers and their own expertise in determining how to use our accessibility inventions in a way that works with their software,” says Bruzzo. The company says it plans to add patents for future accessibility-related tech to the pledge, as well as open-sourcing more of its tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQQcBR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 24th, 4:02PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added details about EA’s colorblindness code and how tech sharing will work.   &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook’s Apple, ten years later</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Holds Product Launch Event At New Campus In Cupertino" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YxEx3tl_5htXRkoUd0lHEtS6F7w=/0x99:3000x2099/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69770236/846161976.10.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Looking back at a decade without Jobs — Apple’s biggest decade ever&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1KA34Z"&gt;On August 24th, 2011 — ten years ago today — Apple co-founder Steve Jobs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/8/25/2383755/steve-jobs-resigns-as-apple-ceo-replaced-by-tim-cook-jobs-takes"&gt;resigned as CEO&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the world’s &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-brand/apple-usurps-google-as-worlds-most-valuable-brand-idUSTRE74800D20110509"&gt;newly minted&lt;/a&gt; most valuable brand in the hands of his successor Tim Cook. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/8/25/2383755/steve-jobs-resigns-as-apple-ceo-replaced-by-tim-cook-jobs-takes"&gt;Just six weeks later&lt;/a&gt;, Jobs died. Needless to say, Cook had some big shoes to fill: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/08/25/steve-jobs-apples-ceo-retrospective-products"&gt;Jobs is remembered&lt;/a&gt; as the visionary CEO and marketer behind the Mac, iPhone, iPad, iPod, iTunes, and the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="444Mz3"&gt;A decade later, what has Tim Cook built?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OOOyqG"&gt;The most valuable and profitable company in the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uREFDS"&gt;Apple is bigger than oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fX5KWq"&gt;A company that turns a web of complex components into sophisticated computing devices now makes more money than those that effectively pump barrels of cash out of the ground. And it’s because Tim Cook meticulously crafted the overseas supply chains to make it so, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/29/2910338/tim-cook-china-foxconn-zhengzhou-factory-visit"&gt;contracting manufacturers like Foxconn&lt;/a&gt; which employ hundreds of thousands of Chinese laborers for Apple’s production lines, and delivering a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/28/apple-price-hikes-and-services-growth-produced-a-42point5percent-gross-margin.html#:~:text=Apple's%2038%25%20gross%20margin%20was,certain%20as%20death%20and%20taxes.&amp;amp;text=In%20its%20quarterly%20earnings%20report,%2C%20the%20figure%20was%2040%25."&gt;remarkably steady gross margin&lt;/a&gt; for years. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/09/apple-pips-exxon-as-worlds-biggest-company"&gt;In August 2011&lt;/a&gt;, shortly before Jobs stepped down, Apple had already briefly passed Exxon to become the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, on the back of Tim Cook’s efforts as COO and interim CEO. Even in 2019, when Saudi Arabia opened up state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco for trading, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21350154/apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-saudi-aramco"&gt;it didn’t dominate for long&lt;/a&gt;: Apple surpassed it last July on its way to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375223/apple-2-trillion-market-cap-first-us-company-stock-price"&gt;$2 trillion market cap&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple is approaching $2.5 trillion now. It’s more profitable than Saudi Aramco, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bwuafe"&gt;By any metric imaginable, Tim Cook has grown Apple into a behemoth over the past decade. Revenues reached a record $111 billion this holiday season, &lt;em&gt;quadruple&lt;/em&gt; what the company saw the same quarter in 2011. Profits more than quadrupled from $6B in Q1 2011 to $28.8B in Q1 2021. The company holds nearly $200 billion in cash, more than double &lt;a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Latest-News-Wires/2011/0729/Apple-cash-on-hand-76-billion.-US-Treasury-74-billion"&gt;the already-staggering $76 billion&lt;/a&gt; it had in 2011, and Apple has more than doubled in size with 147,000 full-time employees — compared to 60,400 the year Jobs stepped down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVt7jh"&gt;As of June 2021, Apple now makes an average of $10,000 &lt;em&gt;every second&lt;/em&gt;, $3,600 of which is pure profit. How long ago did you start reading this story? Chances are Apple grossed half a million dollars by the time you finish this sentence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="es" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple first quarter revenue:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Q1 2021: $111.4 billion &lt;br&gt;Q1 2020 $91.8 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2019 $84.3 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2018 $88.3 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2017  $78.4 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2016  $75.3 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2015  $74.6 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2014  $57.6 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2013 $54.5 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2012 $46.3 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2011  $26.7 billion&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Erlichman (@JonErlichman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JonErlichman/status/1354544947127603201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lQBNui"&gt;All of these numbers reflect how Cook’s Apple relentlessly pumped out premium products that consumers were eager to buy, steadily improving them year by year, at a pace Jobs’ Apple never did. Between 2013 and 2018, Apple sold more iPhones &lt;em&gt;every single year&lt;/em&gt; than it did during the five years Jobs was in charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbqS8w"&gt;For some, the dollar signs alone are proof Cook has been a complete success. If you spent $1,000 on Apple stock the week Steve Jobs stepped down, it’d be worth nearly $11,000 today, not including dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kr24C0"&gt;But measuring Apple by financial performance alone is only half the story. If you were hoping Cook would be a Jobs-esque product visionary, you probably haven’t been quite as impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FdasIY"&gt;Hardware swings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OQzIu9"&gt;As the venerable tech journalist Walt Mossberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21026112/apple-tim-cook-iphone-watch-tv-decade-blockbusters-walt-mossberg"&gt;wrote for us two years ago&lt;/a&gt;, Tim Cook’s Apple has yet to produce a truly game-changing hardware product — nothing on the scale of the iPhone, iPad, or Mac. The biggest new Apple products under Tim Cook are either iPhone accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods, or products his Apple delivered because they were what customers were asking for — like iPhones with larger screens. “Steve was pretty adamant that big phones aren’t something we’re going to do,” says tech analyst and former Apple marketing director Michael Gartenberg, noting it was part of the discussion around the iPhone 6 Plus launch in 2014. “Tim said consumers want it, we’ve got the capability to do it, so we’re going to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOzDOB"&gt;But there have also been some surprisingly public failures, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;the unceremoniously canceled AirPower charging pad&lt;/a&gt;, the difficult-to-upgrade Mac Pro that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/6/22520378/apple-wwdc-2021-developer-insult-macbook-pro"&gt;Apple admitted&lt;/a&gt; was a mistake, and most of all, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;the shameful five-year saga&lt;/a&gt; where Apple’s flagship MacBook laptops had keyboards that just couldn’t be trusted not to break. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple iPhone 6 Plus" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QTJTeQw4Q7EadQ6r8cmLsXtGOcI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/797122/DSCF1788-2040.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 6 Plus came with a 5.5-inch screen, compared to 4- and 3.5-inch screens on previous devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s dust-intolerant butterfly keyboards were first introduced in its 12-inch MacBook in 2015.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s8cNuR"&gt;And whether he was chasing Steve Jobs’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2012/7/12/3151491/fighting-words-apple-post-pc-microsoft-pc-plus"&gt;notion of a post-PC world&lt;/a&gt; or attacking it on his own terms, Cook’s Apple spent years focused on the iPad at the expense of the Mac, only to discover it was alienating some of its most important fans: the Apple developers it relied on to create iPhone and iPad apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyYyUd"&gt;(It’s particularly egregious when you consider that 2013 Mac Pro and 2016 MacBook Pro were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/10/4412350/apple-new-mac-pro-wwdc-2013"&gt;supposed to be Apple’s &lt;em&gt;answers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the idea it’d abandoned Mac power users.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9FFBW"&gt;The Apple Watch is now a hit product in a category of one, as Google and others continue flailing to compete. But part of the Apple Watch’s success is simply how expectations lower over time. When it was announced in late 2014 as Cook’s first big new product, it &lt;a href="http://watch-apples-most-personal-device-ever/"&gt;was explicitly introduced&lt;/a&gt; as a product innovation on par with the Mac, iPod, and iPhone, with its digital crown touted as “Apple’s most revolutionary navigation tool since the iPod Click Wheel and iPhone Multi-Touch.” The pitch was that it could change your life by changing your health — and that it was a luxury product, too, with an 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition variant starting at $10,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NOoMk"&gt;But Apple had to reboot the entire Watch interface and ditch the ultra-luxury versions before finally finding its footing with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;the Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. Even now, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496813/apple-watch-heart-monitor-ekg-false-positive"&gt;not a lot of evidence&lt;/a&gt; it’s meaningfully improving people’s health, aside from the occasional &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-watch-lifesaving-health-features-read-5-peoples-stories/"&gt;anecdotal reports&lt;/a&gt; about people whose watches detected a fall or a heart rate spike in time to save their life. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple AirPods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TjrwlP"&gt;Apple’s AirPods, its second big wearable product under Cook, are also a smash hit. But in many ways, AirPods are symbolic of the entire Cook era, where a seemingly obvious idea, executed at scale and tied tightly to the iPhone, becomes not only a business but also a cultural success. “It’s that process, that continued refinement of Apple, that has been Tim Cook’s genius,” says Gartenberg, pointing out how Cook’s Apple also did the seemingly impossible by transitioning the Mac away from Intel processors practically overnight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVZCZd"&gt;While it’s too early to tell, the M1 chip may go down as one of Cook’s biggest swings: his Apple channeled the company’s relentless efforts to improve its Arm-based iPhone processors year after year after year into a new M1 laptop chip that blew away the skeptics, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;upending our entire concept of laptop performance&lt;/a&gt;. Jobs may have bought P.A. Semi in 2008 to reduce the company’s reliance on partners to power the iPhone, but by 2011 Apple hadn’t yet introduced its own CPU cores inside an Apple A-series chip, much less its own graphics. Cook’s Apple made it happen, and Cook took a victory lap this April &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/20/22394756/apple-tim-cook-mission-impossible-heist-action-movie-stunt-lasers"&gt;by adding the new M1 chip into the iPad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3arxXhPSmHQTGpoozfYbnBaHBXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458386/tim_cook_spy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tim Cook smiles in a Mission: Impossible-esque marketing video where he infiltrates Apple to plant an M1 chip in the iPad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VckANs"&gt;Still, both the AirPods and Watch have fundamentally been accessories for the iPhone, not new computing platforms in their own right: standalone Watch apps have not become a booming market. Cook’s biggest promises have mostly yet to pan out: he spent a year after Jobs’ death talking about Apple’s TV efforts, only to totally start over with the Apple TV Plus streaming service. He’s repeatedly said Apple’s greatest contribution to the world &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/08/tim-cook-teases-new-apple-services-tied-to-health-care.html"&gt;would be in health&lt;/a&gt;, with the Watch and the Peloton-like Fitness Plus platform the small beginnings of that effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mPH0j"&gt;And while Cook has teased for half a decade that augmented reality might become a new platform — calling it “a big idea like the smartphone,” “profound,” and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview"&gt;“critically important” to Apple’s future&lt;/a&gt; — it’s largely just been teasers. Very little has come of ARKit, which brought basic augmented reality apps to the iPhone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16329366/ios-11-apple-arkit-best-new-ar-apps"&gt;since its 2017 debut&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple’s rumored AR headset has — if understandably — been a year or two away &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/27/17291964/apple-vr-ar-headset-report"&gt;for the last three years in a row&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="p4rApd"&gt;The services turn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lqjmoz"&gt;If Tim Cook stepped down from Apple tomorrow, though, analysts wouldn’t be asking if a product visionary will take his place — they’d be wondering whether the next CEO will continue turning Apple into a services company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6PPhT"&gt;In the second quarter of 2016, Cook and Apple CFO Luca Maestri drew financial analysts’ attention to a remarkable fact it had quietly been disclosing for well over a year — Apple was becoming a services company, too. The App Store and the company’s other paid subscriptions were accelerating quarter over quarter and year over year — and they had raked in $4.8 billion in Q1 2015 &lt;em&gt;alone&lt;/em&gt;. In 2017, after pulling in over $7 billion per quarter for three fiscal quarters in a row, Apple declared its services business was the size of a Fortune 100 company all by itself. Last quarter, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY21_Q3_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf"&gt;Apple saw a record $17.5 billion in services revenue&lt;/a&gt;, nearly half the size of the iPhone and more than double any other hardware category. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="D4FSqQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s services business eclipsed the Mac and iPad years ago&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WUgNc5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;As emails from the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt; (#10) revealed, the App Store alone had already eclipsed the company’s entire Mac and iPad businesses in 2016, with only the iPhone towering above it. Add movies, music, books, magazines, paid iCloud storage plans, AppleCare, Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple TV Plus, Apple News Plus, and Apple Fitness Plus, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses"&gt;you’ve got a wide array of services collectively pulling in billions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41rcor"&gt;It’s not clear which of these make a dent beyond the App Store, as Apple stopped talking about Apple Music’s paid subscribers after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761603/apple-music-60-million-subscribers-eddy-cue-spotify"&gt;it hit 60 million in June 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and the company still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394404/apple-tv-plus-free-trial-july-2021-ted-lasso-second-season-timing"&gt;effectively gives away Apple TV Plus for free&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3NcAu"&gt;But Cook’s sights are set beyond content services, too: with Apple Pay, the Apple Card, Apple Cash, and the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575852/apple-pay-later-report-affirm-paypal-klarna-monthly-installments"&gt;Apple Pay Later&lt;/a&gt;, the company seems to be edging into banking as well, locking in a cut of your transactions at the same time it’s locking you into its software ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eSusHKkETOnKHF0qDJKLjVLYKVM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803090/apple_card.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Card.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m07x0x"&gt;There is one place that Cook’s Apple admirably won’t go: while some of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22526881/apple-icloud-plus-privacy-subscription-services-revenue-wwdc-2021"&gt;Apple’s service upsells&lt;/a&gt; can be highly annoying, Cook has been a champion for user privacy, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/1/9437717/apple-ceo-tim-cook-privacy-car-npr-interview"&gt;calling it “a fundamental human right,”&lt;/a&gt; and famously fighting the FBI over requests that, privacy advocates agreed, might lead to governments having backdoors into users’ phones. It’s the rare tech giant that isn’t using your data as a revenue stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzNlcV"&gt;Some of Apple’s services play goes back to the days of Steve Jobs. One year before he died, he delivered an internal strategy presentation where he declared 2011 the “Year of the Cloud,” and that Apple should “tie all of our products together, so we further lock customers into our ecosystem.” But the majority of Apple’s services today were introduced on Tim Cook’s watch, and Apple Pay in particular should go down as one of the company’s game changing moves — while other phone makers do have a direct equivalent, it was Cook’s Apple that drove instant, seamless, touchless payments across large parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LF4zDI"&gt;Growing pains&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SpOXfI"&gt;The question now is whether Apple can keep up with its all-encompassing pursuit of growth, because after a decade some cracks are beginning to show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOIjYE"&gt;Consumers, competitors, and lawmakers around the world are starting to treat Apple like just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22521476/apple-walled-garden-carrier-app-store-innovation"&gt;another giant company trying to extract revenue&lt;/a&gt; any way it can — and as the company has become responsible for a billion devices and 2 million apps, its reputation is starting to take some brutal body blows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cb9cLL"&gt;Apple has never apologized so much as it has in the past few years, whether it’s for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573710/apple-battery-gate-throttle-iphones-settlement-amount"&gt;artificially slowing down older iPhones&lt;/a&gt; to preserve their batteries, secretly having human contractors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836760/apple-apology-siri-audio-recordings-privacy-changes-contractors"&gt;listen to Siri recordings&lt;/a&gt;, or backing away from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app"&gt;forcing a developer to add in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3N79cVD7GA5P1VFHwJMpbBiMZJU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13670433/appleprivacy_vsavov2.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s “What happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone,” one of many privacy ads the company created.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LWRwsS"&gt;Even as Tim Cook continues to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282158/apple-services-privacy-credit-card-tv-data-sharing"&gt;push Apple as a privacy company&lt;/a&gt;, where what happens on your phone stays on your phone, Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;grappling with the reality of child porn&lt;/a&gt; and making potentially worrying privacy concessions as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4FVY8"&gt;The company’s embroiled in lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny around the globe alleging the App Store is a monopoly, and while it’s entirely uncertain whether judges will agree, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;Apple’s own internal emails&lt;/a&gt; do a pretty good job of showing how the company values lock-in and favors some developers over others, despite Tim Cook’s testimony under oath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wasIlc"&gt;Even as Apple tries to maintain the image of a technological leader that puts people first, the company has deployed an army of lobbyists to kill regulation it opposes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525542/apple-right-to-repair-bill-california-lobbyist-comptia"&gt;in California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22357121/arizona-hb2005-app-store-bill-dead-apple-google-big-tech-lobbying"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;North Dakota&lt;/a&gt;, Louisiana, and Georgia — where Apple &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/20/apple-takes-on-state-legislatures-georgia-506299"&gt;reportedly threatened to pull its investment from a historically Black college&lt;/a&gt; if a challenge to its App Store went through. The company has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/23/technology/apple-google-south-korea-app-store.html"&gt;asked the Biden administration to pressure the South Korean government&lt;/a&gt; from enacting a similar law. Even as Apple projects an image of its App Store as a trustworthy place to shop, it’s become increasingly obvious that its 500 human reviewers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;don’t have time to catch the most egregious scams&lt;/a&gt; successfully bilking users out of millions of dollars, even though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;emails show&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s been aware of the problem for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpwKLQ"&gt;Cook’s all-important supply chains have consistently been under fire, too, with reports &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166286/apple-china-labor-violations-temporary-workers"&gt;that Apple turned a blind eye&lt;/a&gt; to labor law violations in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tEM7mK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple employees are organizing, now under the banner #AppleToo","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"},{"title":"Sweetheart deals and plastic knives: all the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"},{"title":"Apple isn’t just a walled garden, it’s a carrier","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22521476/apple-walled-garden-carrier-app-store-innovation"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="d6dZ8Z"&gt;Although Apple prides itself on a culture of secrecy, it’s currently undergoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453302/apple-culture-secrecy-leak-antonio-garcia-martinez-letter"&gt;a wave of employee activism that might change that culture forever&lt;/a&gt; in ways beyond Cook’s control — although the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;may be illegally trying&lt;/a&gt; to control it anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zqKNr"&gt;And even though Tim Cook has touted diversity for many years, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/30/7133103/thank-you-tim-cook"&gt;deserves credit&lt;/a&gt; for coming out as the first openly gay CEO of a Fortune 500 company, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/"&gt;Apple’s own leadership page&lt;/a&gt; is still &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="I8TABB"&gt;It’s possible Tim Cook won’t be the one to solve these problems. He’s been with the company for 23 years, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/apples-ceo-is-making-very-different-choices-from-mark-zuckerberg.html?showTranscript=1"&gt;he recently told Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; he probably won’t still be there after another decade has passed. But few of them were problems in the Steve Jobs era: many are a function of the Apple that Tim Cook built. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aChGJC"&gt;Microsoft revealed a colorful &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fforza-horizon-5-limited-edition%3Focid%3DEvent_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Video_lrn_8.24.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F24%2F22639740%2Fxbox-series-x-forza-horizon-5-colorful-translucent-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new custom Xbox Series X / S controller&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; during its Gamescom 2021 Xbox stream. Much of the controller is a translucent yellow, but it also features blue and pink as accent colors, with “paint splotches” splashed across the front, pink buttons with blue letters, and the blue and pink control sticks. The controller also has black grips that look to have a rubberized texture, which will differ from the bumpier texture used on other Series X controllers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzDBKs"&gt;The new controller costs $74.99, which is a $15 increase from the $59.99 price of standard controllers, but it also comes with some exclusive &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5 &lt;/em&gt;DLC. You can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fforza-horizon-5-limited-edition%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DnOD%2FrLJHOac%26ranSiteID%3DnOD_rLJHOac-2Y7ZkhUqYxeTLH2oVnNM6w%26epi%3DnOD_rLJHOac-2Y7ZkhUqYxeTLH2oVnNM6w%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2200057_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__6t91u1iv2gkfqmcc1aulhv0fbf2xrme3oxwvxr3100%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%2528nOD_rLJHOac-2Y7ZkhUqYxeTLH2oVnNM6w%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_6t91u1iv2gkfqmcc1aulhv0fbf2xrme3oxwvxr3100&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F24%2F22639740%2Fxbox-series-x-forza-horizon-5-colorful-translucent-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder it from Microsoft’s online store now&lt;/a&gt;, and it will be available on November 9th, the same day as the &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvPogM"&gt;Microsoft also shared &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPgUk3NZcbI"&gt;a thrilling trailer&lt;/a&gt; showing off the first eight minutes of the game, which includes a number of cars dropping out of planes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="vDZEI2"&gt;Microsoft has revealed quite a few new controller colors since the Series X / S launched last year, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607786/microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-aqua-shift-special-edition-blue-rubber-side-grips"&gt;a dazzling blue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529221/cosmic-red-ps5-controller-hands-on-series-x"&gt;a bright red&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fxbox-wireless-controller%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F24%2F22639740%2Fxbox-series-x-forza-horizon-5-colorful-translucent-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a neon green&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fspacejamanewlegacy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F24%2F22639740%2Fxbox-series-x-forza-horizon-5-colorful-translucent-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;controllers themed after &lt;em&gt;Space Jam: A New Legacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And if none of the currently available controllers are your style, you can design your own custom controller with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22531865/microsoft-xbox-design-lab-series-x-colors"&gt;newly reopened Xbox Design Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
