    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QRZwVA"&gt;Netflix is holding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22448313/netflix-geeked-week-event-the-witcher-sandman-cuphead-resident-evil"&gt;its first “Geeked” virtual event&lt;/a&gt; starting on June 7th, an entire week dedicated to genre stories across film and TV. That means sci-fi and fantasy, and shows based on comic books and video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZabuE"&gt;The company says that more than 50 projects will be featured, including big names like &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sandman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lucifer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417254/league-of-legends-animated-series-arcane-netflix"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; animated series&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;em&gt;The Cuphead Show&lt;/em&gt;, and more. In addition to big announcements and trailers, the event will also include “first looks, behind-the-scenes footage, cast interviews, celebrity games, script table reads, live performances, and much more,” according to Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9YMT7"&gt;It’s a lot to spread across five days. Here’s how you can keep up with everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z6PNMH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UTi1pLgi1vY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5RV0um"&gt;What time is Netflix’s Geeked Week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Su4im6"&gt;The event takes place from June 7th to the 11th, and Netflix says that things will kick off at  9AM PT / 12PM ET. The company will also be posting daily recaps at 10AM PT / 1PM ET, suggesting that things will last around an hour each day. There isn’t an exact schedule, but Netflix says that “each day will be broadly themed to different genres: film, comic books, fantasy, anime / animation, and gaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pJMbUQ"&gt;Where can I watch the event?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lLn9Wa"&gt;If you want to watch everything, it seems like it’ll be hard to miss, as Netflix will be utilizing just about every video platform imaginable. That means you can watch and follow the daily events on &lt;a href="http://youtube.com/netflix"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/netflixgeeked"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitch.tv/netflix"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://facebook.com/netflixgeeked"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://tiktok.com/@netflixgeeked"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;. And be sure to stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for coverage of the biggest announcements.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft looks ready to launch Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JgA2sVO8AEXsyUZESl5LYCXnWzA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69381801/RWF5uB.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wSNjTr"&gt;Microsoft has been teasing a “next generation” of Windows for months now, but new hints suggest the company isn’t just preparing an update to its existing Windows 10 software, but a new, numbered version of the operating system: Windows 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNZDDn"&gt;The software giant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465126/microsoft-windows-event-june-24th"&gt;announced a new Windows event for June 24th&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, promising to show “what’s next for Windows.” The event invite included an image of what looks like a new Windows logo, with light shining through the window in only two vertical bars, creating an outline that looks very much like the number 11. Microsoft followed up with an animated version of this image, making it clear the company intentionally ignored the horizontal bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="23AbkU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Join us June 24th at 11 am ET for the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MicrosoftEvent?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MicrosoftEvent&lt;/a&gt; to see what’s next. &lt;a href="https://t.co/kSQYIDZSyi"&gt;https://t.co/kSQYIDZSyi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Emb5GPHOf0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Emb5GPHOf0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Windows (@Windows) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Windows/status/1400125115765907458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IimQvJ"&gt;Microsoft’s Windows event also starts at 11AM ET, not the usual start time for typical Windows and Surface events. Following the event invite, Microsoft exec &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yusuf_i_mehdi/status/1400125771746746371"&gt;Yusuf Mehdi said&lt;/a&gt; he hasn’t “been this excited for a new version of Windows since Windows 95!” It’s the first time we’ve heard Microsoft specifically mention a “new version” of Windows is on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83VbqA"&gt;The event invite also comes just a week after Nadella &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453222/microsoft-windows-next-generation-announcement-sun-valley-build-2021-keynote"&gt;teased a “next generation of Windows” announcement&lt;/a&gt;. Nadella promised that Microsoft would soon share “one of the most significant updates to Windows of the past decade.” Microsoft’s chief product officer, Panos Panay, also teased a “next generation” of Windows earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="au4LOt"&gt;If Microsoft is truly readying to move beyond Windows 10 and towards Windows 11, we’re expecting to see big visual changes to reflect that. Microsoft has been working on something codenamed Sun Valley, which the company has referred to as a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X_SH6v9iEEDYwVrtRSrlYFtbWGM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22495503/Windows_10_Sun_Valley_refresh.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big UI changes are coming to Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sAm7wK"&gt;A lot of these visual changes will come from the work Microsoft completed on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230554/microsoft-windows-10x-leak-chrome-os-chromebooks-hands-on"&gt;Windows 10X&lt;/a&gt;, a lightweight version of Windows intended to rival Chrome OS, before it was scrapped. That includes a new Start menu, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313037/microsoft-windows-10-new-system-icons-ui-overhaul-sun-valley"&gt;new system icons&lt;/a&gt;, File Explorer improvements, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422553/microsoft-windows-95-era-icons-removal-windows-10-update-sun-valley"&gt;end of Windows 95-era icons&lt;/a&gt; that drag Windows users back to the past in dialog boxes. Rounded corners and updates to the built-in Windows apps are also planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8Us7C"&gt;Significant changes are also on the way for Windows beyond the user interface. Microsoft appears to be ready to address a lot of lingering problems, with fixes planned for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407995/microsoft-windows-apps-rearranging-sleep-resume-fix-directx-12"&gt;rearranging apps issue&lt;/a&gt; on multiple monitors, an upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336240/microsoft-windows-10-auto-hdr-pc-gaming-directx-11-12"&gt;Xbox Auto HDR feature&lt;/a&gt;, and improvements to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410088/microsoft-windows-10-bluetooth-aac-support-update"&gt;Bluetooth audio support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hku6Eq"&gt;Perhaps the biggest lingering issue waiting to be fixed is the Windows store. Microsoft has been working on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393655/microsoft-windows-app-store-overhaul-apps-games-rumor"&gt;new app store for Windows&lt;/a&gt; in recent months, and rumors suggest it will be a significant departure from what exists today. Nadella has promised to “unlock greater economic opportunity for developers and creators” with Windows, and the Windows store seems like the obvious way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gFgXen"&gt;Microsoft is reportedly overhauling its Windows app store to allow developers to submit any Windows application, including browsers like Chrome or Firefox. This would significantly improve the store alone, but Microsoft might also be considering allowing third-party commerce platforms in apps. That would mean Microsoft wouldn’t take a cut from developers who use their own in-app purchase systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y11yGrzfA0LcAlNJ7zr-_Fh2pNY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235025/10xactioncenter.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of the changes Microsoft planned for Windows 10X are now coming to Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="StQAMK"&gt;So far, Microsoft has only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;announced a cut to 12 percent&lt;/a&gt; commission for PC games in the Windows store, but allowing developers to bypass Microsoft’s cut would be a significant change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PS37fV"&gt;Moving to Windows 11 branding would also back up Microsoft’s reinvestment in Windows. The software maker signaled a renewed interest in Windows last year, during a pandemic that has demonstrated how important the operating system is. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246561/microsoft-windows-10x-single-screens-windows-usage-demand-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;Windows usage jumped&lt;/a&gt; as workers and students across the world turned to laptops and PCs to work from home. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21319750/pc-shipments-coronavirus-pandemic-idc-gartner-q2-2020"&gt;PC shipments have also surged&lt;/a&gt; over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPLbSQ"&gt;After slicing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/29/17176220/microsoft-windows-reorg-business-terry-myerson-ai-cloud"&gt;Windows into two parts&lt;/a&gt; back in 2018, Microsoft moved parts of Windows development back under Panos Panay’s control last year. The move was a clear admission that Microsoft’s Windows split didn’t work, after months of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645609/microsofts-universal-windows-app-dead-microsoft-store-windows-store"&gt;messy development experiences&lt;/a&gt; for Windows 10, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/1/21276653/microsoft-windows-10-may-2020-update-block-known-issues-list"&gt;delayed Windows updates&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/2/20678596/windows-10-19h2-update-september-feature-update"&gt;lack of major new features&lt;/a&gt;, and lots of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17951298/microsoft-windows-10-bugs-issues-report"&gt;Windows update issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1c0xE"&gt;Moving to Windows 11 would still be a surprise move for Microsoft, though. The company previously referred to Windows 10 as “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/7/8568473/windows-10-last-version-of-windows"&gt;the last version of Windows&lt;/a&gt;” in its big push to position the OS as a service that’s continually updated. While there are monthly updates to Windows, the more significant changes are typically delivered twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P3VIY-kOjCaRuTO0nG0RM9V8yd4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8451737/akrales_170502_1637_0519.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new version of Windows always helps boost PC sales.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ta7qIh"&gt;Microsoft has struggled with naming these updates, though. We’ve seen the Windows 10 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/25/12269736/microsoft-windows-10-anniversary-update-features-review"&gt;Anniversary Update&lt;/a&gt;, Fall &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16487760/microsoft-windows-10-fall-creators-update-features-review"&gt;Creators Update&lt;/a&gt;, and simple dates like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20885221/microsoft-windows-10-october-update-release-date-download-features-how-to"&gt;November 2019 Update&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft has also adopted yet another naming scheme recently, referring to updates as 20H1 or 21H1 to signify both the release year and part of the year the update launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4pLi7"&gt;A move to Windows 11 wouldn’t necessarily clear up Microsoft’s update naming issues, but if the company also adopted point releases like Windows 11.1, that would certainly help both consumers and IT admins to quickly understand which version is the latest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMGD6s"&gt;OEMs would also be happy to see a Windows 11 release. A new version of Windows always drives new hardware sales and renewed interest in the operating system. If Microsoft backs that up with a new UI and a fresh look and feel for Windows, it will be the typical playbook we’ve seen for Windows for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I42Eoc"&gt;It’s not long until we find out whether Microsoft is ready to dial the version number of Windows up to 11. The Windows elevent (as I’m now calling it) will start at 11AM ET on June 24th, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all the news live as it happens.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp says accounts will soon be usable across up to four devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2qcVNtiOj1khqlolLlEgV8fBDtg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69381533/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ucgf95"&gt;WhatsApp has confirmed that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21361542/whatsapp-multiple-devices-support-ipad-app-chat-sync-rumors"&gt;long-rumored multi-device support&lt;/a&gt; will be entering public beta in the coming months, allowing users to access their accounts from up to four linked devices. New “view once” and “disappearing mode” features were also officially announced. The news came in an interview &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/will-cathcart-and-mark-zuckerberg-confirm-to-wabetainfo-3-features-to-come-on-whatsapp/"&gt;between &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and WhatsApp head Will Cathcart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uw3ZLj"&gt;Cathcart stopped short of confirming reports that WhatsApp has an iPad app in development, but said that multi-device support will make WhatsApp on iPad a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1oDl4"&gt;As well as multi-device support, Zuckerberg also confirmed that WhatsApp is adding a new “view once” feature, which will allow users to send content that disappears after it’s been viewed. The service is also expanding its disappearing messages feature, which currently allows messages to be deleted after a set period of time. In the future, a new “disappearing mode” will let you turn on disappearing messages across all chat threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pvw0PM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s been a big technical challenge”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nKkfMZ"&gt;Facebook’s CEO confirmed that the multi-device feature will not compromise the end-to-end encryption that WhatsApp offers for messages sent between individuals. “It’ll still be end-to-end encrypted,” Zuckerberg wrote. “It’s been a big technical challenge to get all your messages and content to sync properly across devices even when your phone battery dies, but we’ve solved this and we’re looking forward to getting it out soon!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxNy9s"&gt;WhatsApp did not confirm when the “view once” and “disappearing mode” features are expected to launch, but Cathcart said that multi-device support will be entering public beta “in the next month or two.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWaomi"&gt;Alongside multi-device support, &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo &lt;/em&gt;has also reported that WhatsApp is working on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319136/whatsapp-cloud-backups-icloud-google-drive-password-encryption-security"&gt;new password-protected encrypted chat backups&lt;/a&gt; feature which could finally allow users to transfer their chat histories &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-to-allow-chat-history-migration-between-ios-and-android/"&gt;between iOS and Android devices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; has previously discovered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267292/whatsapp-qr-codes-adding-contacts-beta-ios-android"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893033/whatsapp-disappearing-messages-beta-self-destruct-privacy-security"&gt;features&lt;/a&gt; before their official release, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309982/whatsapp-contact-qr-codes-animated-stickers-video-call-improvements"&gt;adding contacts via QR codes&lt;/a&gt; and WhatsApp’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550634/whatsapp-disappearing-messages-feature"&gt;disappearing messages&lt;/a&gt; feature.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring will require video requests to be public in Neighbors app starting next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BBmgMP-uLiZ86GXg0vgxTVwONHQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69381531/dseifert_20210323_4486_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OHfItJ"&gt;Ring is adjusting how public agencies such as police and fire departments are able to request video clips from Ring camera owners in its Neighbors app. Starting next week, agencies will only be able to request clips be sent to them through public posts that are viewable in the app’s main feed; they will no longer be able to send individuals specific requests for clips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKWy2g"&gt;Ring says this new method provides greater transparency to what public agencies are requesting, as all requests will now be logged on the agency’s profile and reviewable by anyone using the app. Agencies will not be able to remove or delete the posts, according to Ring, though they can be marked as “resolved.” Ring says it limits video clips requests to “verified public safety agencies” and has a &lt;a href="https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061496911"&gt;set of guidelines that agencies must abide by&lt;/a&gt; in order to be able to request footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcmCgB"&gt;Prior to this change, law enforcement agencies were able to send private emails through Ring to owners who lived in an area of active investigation in order to request footage, which the owners could then approve or deny. Though the app allowed Ring owners to blanket deny all requests for footage, these emails were not publicly available for review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lu2gA-QhyALWGvHXrlKJX2dMYFM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555229/Neighbors_Feed.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Requests for footage from public agencies will now show up in the main Neighbors feed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vf0hPx34LD1KaOrUJ9gtCTob8RQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555230/Agency_Profile_Posts.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each agency will have a public profile page with their history of video requests visible by all in the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vrz63O"&gt;Once the change is live in the app, Ring owners will see posts from their local authorities in the main app feed. They can then click on those posts to securely share footage from their cameras. Ring says that if you previously opted out of receiving requests for video clips, you will not receive notifications when agencies post to the feed. It will also be possible to hide the requests from the feed entirely. In general, the change makes the whole process more opt-in than opt-out, as it was before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3YJHA"&gt;The Neighbors app has been one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/17/21141336/amazon-ring-cameras-spy-neighbors-police-nbc-news-intelligencer"&gt;most controversial aspects&lt;/a&gt; of Ring’s product line, as it has long faced criticism for amplifying mundane issues and providing a way for minorities to be harassed. It is a separate app from Ring’s main app, which is used for setup and control of Ring cameras, and is similar to hyperlocal social networks such as Nextdoor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Philips Hue gets a sleeker new app rebuilt ‘from the ground up’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4lOdM9uuVETfe4VRBOS5hsFcsJU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69381351/hue_app4_home_dashboard.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FeSmzT"&gt;The Philips Hue app is getting a big update on Thursday. The team at Signify, which makes Hue lights, has rebuilt the app “from the ground up” to make it easier to use. The new version looks mostly the same as the existing app, but it has tweaks around the edges to make it quicker to access different controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VwFTw"&gt;One of the bigger changes is faster access to room controls. Now, when you tap on a room or zone, the app will present a grid of all the available lights and pre-set scenes so you can find them right away. In the prior version, you had to switch back and forth across different tabs that were easy to get lost in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3xLAy"&gt;You’ll also now be able to add new lights from within the Room tab — not just the Settings menu — and if you’re a power user with multiple Hue bridges, the app will let you switch between them from a button on the main screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EBnn4b95yN9kCwGqZXwjlL44F60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555837/hue_app4_tile_view.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Signify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you open a room, you’ll now see a grid of scene and light options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KT7j2V"&gt;Signify is replacing the “routines” feature with a new “automations” tab, which is supposed to offer more advanced options for triggering your lights on and off. The app can also now take into consideration whether another person is already home when triggering “coming home” or “leaving home” automations, so the lights won’t all turn off just because the Hue app’s controller stepped out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6J8yB"&gt;The new app launches Thursday for iOS and Android. Signify says that later this summer, it’ll follow up with an update introducing “dynamic scenes” that allow lights to cycle through different colors over time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FBI names REvil as the group behind meat supplier cyberattack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7eQ7X5pGNF_dB6Www2v6lKSlLvs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69381104/acastro_170621_1777_0007_v2_0001_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DDT59J"&gt;The FBI has said that cybercriminal group REvil (also known as Sodinokibi) was behind the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463621/jbs-cyberattack-russia-largest-meat-supplier"&gt;recent attack on meat supplier JBS&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://therecord.media/fbi-jbs-ransomware-attack-was-carried-out-by-revil/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This follows a statement from White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, which indicated that the attack likely came from a Russian-based organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rq45lg"&gt;REvil has previously been implicated in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396283/apple-schematics-leak-ransomware-quanta-supplier-leak"&gt;recent Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341642/acer-ransomware-microsoft-exchange-revil-security"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt; ransomware attacks, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054951/travelex-currency-exchange-offline-malware-attack-ransom"&gt;last year’s Travelex attack&lt;/a&gt;. The JBS intrusion, however, could have wide-ranging effects: the company is the world’s largest meat processor, and the incident shut down some of the largest slaughterhouses in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9CRtpp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;New FBI statement: “We have attributed the JBS attack to REvil and Sodinokibi and are working diligently to bring the threat actors to justice.” &lt;a href="https://t.co/JPZtygT8N9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JPZtygT8N9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Natasha Bertrand (@NatashaBertrand) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NatashaBertrand/status/1400199441823436812?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K72Wwo"&gt;This is the second major attack on US infrastructure by suspected Russian cybercriminals that we’ve seen in as many months — the group behind the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428996/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-apology-investigation"&gt;Colonial pipeline attack&lt;/a&gt; that occurred last month was also believed to have been carried out by a group based in the country. While JBS is headquartered in Brazil, the company &lt;a href="https://jbsfoodsgroup.com/articles/jbs-usa-and-pilgrim-s-announce-progress-in-resolving-cyberattack"&gt;says the affected plants&lt;/a&gt; were in the US, Canada, and Australia. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces Snapdragon-powered Galaxy Book Go laptops from $349</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3yT_Dj49x9ax6ylxJXO-Mt7vNY4=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69381067/Galaxy_Book_Go_PR_main2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cZisZm"&gt;Samsung has announced two new Windows laptops running Arm-based processors. The Galaxy Book Go and Galaxy Book Go 5G both use Snapdragon chips from Qualcomm rather than Samsung’s own Exynos designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BpoTw"&gt;The Galaxy Book Go is an entry-level model that starts at $349. It has the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451392/qualcomm-snapdragon-7c-gen-2-arm-processor"&gt;updated Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 processor&lt;/a&gt; that Qualcomm announced last month, as well as 4GB or 8GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB of eUFS storage. The display is a 14-inch 1080p LCD and the laptop is 14.9mm thick, weighing in at 1.38kg.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T5F08aLOKKh3hdrQY-tXHBk2zmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22556433/Galaxy_Book_Go_PR_main3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XkBZOG"&gt;The Galaxy Book Go 5G, meanwhile, uses Qualcomm’s more powerful &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020"&gt;Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2&lt;/a&gt; processor — though other laptops with that chip aren’t exactly powerhouses — and, as the name suggests, it includes 5G connectivity. Despite running on a Snapdragon chip with an integrated LTE modem, the $349 Galaxy Book Go is actually Wi-Fi-only. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Opvk36"&gt;Specs otherwise appear to be shared between the two laptops. The Galaxy Book Go has two USB-C ports, one USB-A port, a headphone jack, a 720p webcam, and a microSD card slot. Samsung hasn’t given pricing or release information for the Galaxy Book Go 5G just yet, but the $349 Galaxy Book Go is going on sale on June 10th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>For Apple TV Plus to succeed, it has to be everywhere — even Android TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LCCa0KZN32lwitIK2S2LLzcnmV8=/128x0:1505x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69380653/Apple_introduces_apple_tv_plus_03252019_big.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple TV Plus logo.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VKzcOk"&gt;This week, Apple brought its Apple TV app to many new Android TV devices — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462960/apple-tv-app-nvidia-shield-now-available"&gt;not just the Nvidia Shield&lt;/a&gt;. And Apple was smart to widen that support — the expiration date for free trials of Apple TV Plus is swiftly approaching, with many customers about to see their subscriptions end July 1st. That gives Apple a month to win over Android TV users by letting them watch flagship shows like the earnest and delightful &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; on the big screen, a show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394062/apple-tv-ted-lasso-season-2-trailer-premiere-date"&gt;whose second season&lt;/a&gt; will premiere near the end of July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zz9VYe"&gt;The rollout of the Apple TV app to Android TV OS devices started Monday at 8AM PT, a Google spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. As a caveat, the Google spokesperson clarified that support does not extend to third-party operator set-top boxes, so, for example, devices like AT&amp;amp;T’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21160860/att-tv-now-available-android-tv-google-assistant-streaming"&gt;Android TV set-top box&lt;/a&gt; probably won’t get Apple TV anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1vnhvI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The rollout does not extend to third-party operator set-top boxes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUmHPI"&gt;That Apple’s finally made its streaming app available across Android TV devices isn’t much of a shocker. The app was previously made available on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287905/apple-tv-app-now-available-chromecast-google-tv"&gt;non-Apple devices&lt;/a&gt; like the Chromecast with Google TV and the PlayStation 5, and it’s been on Roku and Fire TV devices since 2019. Some Sony TVs running Android TV and other Vizio models running SmartCast OS additionally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21516418/apple-tv-sony-android-now-available-software-update"&gt;received support&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-tv-arrives-on-vizio-smartcast-tvs-1845006293"&gt;for the app&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNTqHY"&gt;But it’s also not entirely shocking for a company banking heavily on its services offerings. Apple seems to have figured out somewhere along the way that it needed to play nice with other device makers if it wanted to grow Apple TV Plus subscriptions in any meaningful way. With some &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/apple-services-revenue-tops-16-9-billion-4175371/"&gt;660 million paid subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; across its services as of April, Apple TV Plus’ &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1136261/number-of-apple-tv-plus-subscribers-us/"&gt;estimated 40 million&lt;/a&gt; U.S. subscribers is a small but certainly not insignificant slice of that pie — but that figure could quickly change come July when those users will have to decide whether Apple’s shows are worth paying for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GeoJ1w"&gt;Apple launched its service back in 2019 with an astonishingly meager lineup of originals. Sure, they were high-caliber productions with big-name talent and directors at the helm. And sure, some of them were even good! (M. Night Shyamalan’s bizarre psychological thriller &lt;em&gt;Servant&lt;/em&gt; is one such example.) But Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394404/apple-tv-plus-free-trial-july-2021-ted-lasso-second-season-timing"&gt;extended its lengthy free trials&lt;/a&gt; of the service that it offered to users who purchased its devices, and that trial period is very nearly about to end for some of the earliest users to hop on the freebie train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TqZDcA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple is about to face a subscriber reckoning&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RrhWAa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; — which Tim Cook has &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/apple-services-revenue-tops-16-9-billion-4175371/"&gt;cited as being a critical success&lt;/a&gt; for the platform — will, again, release its second season toward the end of next month. But for some Apple users, their free trials to Apple TV Plus end July 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8ywqr"&gt;In other words, Apple’s dangling a content carrot in front of its most loyal users in hopes that they’ll stick around and hand over their money. But with so many other services available at present, it’s unclear whether that’ll be enough to make them stay. In fact, research MoffettNathanson &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/apple-tv-plus-freeloader-problem-percent-free-1234890385/"&gt;estimated earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that nearly 30 percent of Apple TV Plus subscribers did not plan to resubscribe following their trial periods. While $5 per month isn’t too much for a premium service comparatively speaking, it does start to add up when people are counting all the subscriptions they fork out money for each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBijHS"&gt;Because Apple’s entire plan for the service is to be a hub for either its own in-house productions — or exclusively attained feature films like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21264009/tom-hanks-greyhound-apple-tv-plus-streaming-sony-pictures-pandemic"&gt;Tom Hanks’ &lt;em&gt;Greyhound&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — that means the company has some catching up to do to reach anything close to the library scale of most of its peers, particularly considering it’s about to start making people pay for the service. Making it available across Android TV devices hooked up in users’ homes is a good way to prepare for this change. Plus, especially accounting for the pandemic, who on earth wants to watch an entire feature film on a palm-sized iPhone when they can watch it on the biggest screen in their home instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MjWM4U"&gt;It’s almost as if Apple realized that &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-never-made-imessage-for-android-to-lock-in-ios-us-1846650480"&gt;doing things the Apple way&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t going to be a successful model for competing in the streaming wars. And while the service is late to the party in terms of accessibility across platforms — it has taken far too long for this app to arrive on more Android TV devices, in my opinion — it was a necessary move for Apple TV Plus’s success in the long run. As long-trialed subscribers discover they’ll suddenly need to pay for Apple’s content, the churn is going to burn.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Your next laptop may come with a cryptominer, courtesy of Norton</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lsCmzfIHvSEXsYogjo2Csm9Lc7M=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69380550/norton_crypto.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Norton&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EuE0J6"&gt;Ethereum mining is coming to perhaps an unexpected place: Norton 360, the antivirus software that many readers will know from setting up new computers for their parents (&lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/norton-360-antivirus-now-lets-you-mine-ethereum-cryptocurrency/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;BleepingComputer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). In &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210602005361/en/"&gt;its press release&lt;/a&gt;, Norton claims its brand is a perfect fit: people looking to mine crypto won’t have to dig through the dark, scary parts of the web, where they could possibly find “unvetted code.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2ZGUl"&gt;The company also says that it’ll store users’ crypto wallets in the cloud, with its own Norton Wallet. As far as actually using their gains, a Norton spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; there will be a button that allows users to “pull money into Coinbase.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2krHr"&gt;Until now, Norton claims, people who wanted to mine had to disable their security software to do it, which made things harder for them. While that somewhat seems like a problem that could at least in part be caused by Norton 360 itself, Norton does have a point that using software that comes pre-installed on your computer is easier than having to figure out mining for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zmCcDx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Think Kindle with Special Offers, except it’s taxing your computer’s GPU&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n0QrYh"&gt;But is that really what we want? Putting aside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;environmental concerns&lt;/a&gt; of thousands of new miners, and the potential unexpected tax implications that &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/norton-360-antivirus-now-lets-you-mine-ethereum-cryptocurrency/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BleepingComputer&lt;/em&gt; brings up&lt;/a&gt; (not that those are things that should be ignored), the idea of having mining software included in a program that comes with people’s computers seems like a slippery slope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3iVbgC"&gt;It’s easy to imagine a company, not necessarily Norton, offering cheaper or even free computers, if you just turn your unused computing cycles into a recurring source of profit for the bloatware makers subsidizing your purchase. Think Kindle with Special Offers, except instead of ads you’re taxing your computer’s GPU and sucking back electricity when you’re not using it (or, in the case of really shady manufacturers, when you are). Norton may be opening a door here that’s hard to close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6qjYh"&gt;While Norton specifically calls out Ethereum in its blog post, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/02/investing/nortonlifelock-crypto-mining-ethereum/index.html"&gt;it told &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it was considering letting people mine other “reputable crypto currencies” later on. The company’s letting in early adopters on Thursday, and hopes to roll it out to everyone “in the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA will send two missions to Venus for the first time in over 30 years</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mu0DvE"&gt;The agency has picked two new robotic missions to explore the hot hell-world of Venus, Earth’s neighbor and the second planet from the Sun, administrator Bill Nelson announced on Wednesday. The two missions, DAVINCI+ and VERITAS, were among four competing proposals under the latest round of NASA’s Discovery Program, which manages smaller planetary exploration missions with a slim budget of roughly $500 million each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0vEeA"&gt;“These two sister missions both aim to understand how Venus became an inferno-like world capable of melting lead at the surface,” Nelson said during his first “State of NASA” address at the agency’s headquarters in Washington, DC on Wednesday. “They will offer the entire science community a chance to investigate a planet we haven’t been to in more than 30 years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MjFHwp"&gt;DAVINCI+, slated to launch around 2029, will mark the first US-led mission into the atmosphere of Venus since 1978, when NASA’s second Pioneer mission plunged into Venusian clouds for scientific study. The spacecraft will fly by Venus twice to snap close-up photos of the planet’s surface before tossing a robotic probe into its thick atmosphere to measure its gasses and other elements.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image of Venus captured by NASA’s Parker Solar Probe last summer showing the planet’s mysterious nightside and revealing a surprisingly clear view of its surface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wVHd6w"&gt;Interest in Venus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438514/venus-future-exploration-spacecraft-flagship-missions-nasa-phosphine-detection"&gt;spiked&lt;/a&gt; last year during NASA’s review of the four missions, when a separate international team of researchers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428796/venus-gas-life-sign-discovery-phosphine-biosignature"&gt;published findings that the noxious gas, phosphine&lt;/a&gt;, was possibly floating in the clouds of Venus — an intriguing theory that hinted at the first signs of off-world life, as phosphine is known to be made primarily by living organisms. But other researchers disputed the team’s findings, leaving the phosphine theory open-ended. DAVINCI+’s plunge through Venus’ atmosphere could decisively settle that mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvhKl3"&gt;When the research was published, NASA’s previous administrator, Jim Bridenstine, said “it’s time to prioritize Venus.” NASA’s science associate administrator, Thomas Zurbuchen, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that although the two probes could help confirm the phosphine research, they were picked for their scientific value, proposed timeline, and other factors independent of the phosphine findings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NzcXf"&gt;The second mission, VERITAS, is a probe slated to launch around 2028, just before DAVINCI+. It’ll orbit Venus and map its surface much like NASA’s Magellan probe did for four years beginning in 1990, but with a much sharper focus that will give scientists a better picture of the planet’s geological history. It’ll use a synthetic aperture radar and track surface elevations to “create 3D reconstructions of topography and confirm whether processes such as plate tectonics and volcanism are still active on Venus,” NASA &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-2-missions-to-study-lost-habitable-world-of-venus"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dPdh75"&gt;Another camera on VERITAS will be sensitive to a wavelength that could spot signs of water vapor in Venus’ atmosphere, which, if detected, could hint that active volcanoes had been degassing on the planet’s surface sometime long ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mcXdhp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Venus is closer to the Sun, it’s a hot house now, but once upon a time it might’ve been different”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="87tbEt"&gt;Taken together, the two missions make clear that NASA is finally going all in on Venus, a spicy-hot planet long sidelined by other, more scientifically popular planets like Mars. The two Discovery-class missions that competed with DAVINCI+ and VERITAS were TRIDENT, which would’ve studied Neptune’s icy moon Triton, and the Io Volcano Observer (IVO), which would’ve studied the tidal forces on Jupiter’s moon Io. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6Y2H0"&gt;The twin missions to Venus aim to confront the possibility that the planet was once habitable. “Venus is closer to the Sun, it’s a hot house now, but once upon a time it might’ve been different,” NASA’s Discovery program head Thomas Wagner tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Studying the planet’s atmosphere up close could give scientists clues on how it evolved over time to allow Venus to become the hell world it is today, with surface temperatures of around 900 degrees Fahrenheit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWPI8G"&gt;The missions could also help scientists learn how to look at exoplanets, distant planets in other solar systems. Though hot and unlivable, Venus sits in the Goldilocks zone of our solar system, a term scientists use to characterize the position of exoplanets whose distances from the Sun sit in just the right spot to foster life. Venus, Wagner says, could be a model, right next to Earth, to help us understand exoplanets farther away. The planet’s distance from our Sun also raises equally intriguing questions about why Venus turned into the hell-world it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YI08D"&gt;“Since Venus is in the goldilocks zone, we want to know what the heck went on on Venus,” Wagner says.&lt;/p&gt;
