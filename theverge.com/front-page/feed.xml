    <title>Samsung announces a cheaper entry-level Galaxy Book with no OLED</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cfxlt71RR0VuLgL1KjMbk_Dp56g=/1x0:3799x2532/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199782/Galaxy_Book_15inch_MysticBlue_WiFi_Top_Wide_Open_210417022709.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Book comes in silver or this sleek blue color&lt;/em&gt; | Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZXPBjX"&gt;Samsung announced two entry-level Galaxy Book laptops at its Unpacked event: the Galaxy Book and the Galaxy Book Flex2 Alpha. The former will start at around $800 (according to Samsung, that price is subject to change) and will launch in the second half of 2021, whereas the Flex2 Alpha starts at $849 and is available for preorder now, shipping in mid-May. These round out the fleet of premium models announced today, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405540/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-features-price-photos-video-release-date"&gt;the Galaxy Book Pro and Pro 360&lt;/a&gt; with OLED screens that start at $999, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407647/samsungs-galaxy-book-odyssey-nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-gpu"&gt;$1,399 Galaxy Book Odyssey gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt; that’s the first to sport Nvidia’s new RTX 3050 Ti graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r7iI7N"&gt;Starting with the Galaxy Book, it has a 15.6-inch 1080p TFT LCD display, and it supports up to two fast NVMe SSDs. It has two USB-C ports (one of which can recharge the laptop with the included 65W charger), two USB-A 3.2 ports, an HDMI port, a headphone jack, a microSD card slot, and an optional nano SIM tray for LTE. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The silver color of the Galaxy Book.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CxVrla"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/mediaresources/galaxy_book/techspecs"&gt;Samsung’s mobile press site&lt;/a&gt; shows that the Intel Pentium Gold or Celeron processor may show up in some models globally, but the company hasn’t confirmed what will be in the starting configuration in the US. A Samsung spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the final price and specs will be announced closer to its launch in the second half of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2Nso2"&gt;According to the site linked above, if you need more power, you’ll be able to bump it up to 11th Gen Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, with the option of taking advantage of their Iris Xe integrated graphics, or you can opt for Nvidia’s GeForce MX450 discrete graphics. The Galaxy Book can be upgraded to 16GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUvkoS"&gt;Rounding out the specs, the Galaxy Book comes in silver or blue, and every configuration will have a 54Wh battery. Similar to the Galaxy Book Pro lineup, this one supports Dolby Atmos audio. Its webcam is a 720p HD sensor with a dual array mic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book Flex2 Alpha" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o6rMz98wvPgYWczG0sNnkak92O8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475568/Galaxy_Book_Flex2_Alpha_012_R_Perspective_Windows_Mystic_Black_RGB.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Book Flex2 Alpha will launch in black, blue, or silver.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RGpWxM"&gt;If you want a 2-in-1 laptop with a better QLED screen that’s still not as expensive as the Galaxy Book Pro, Samsung also announced two sizes (13.3 and 15.6 inches) of the new Galaxy Book Flex2 Alpha. Each model has a 1080p QLED display, and either Intel’s 11th Gen i5 or i7 processors. &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/galaxy-book-flex/buy/?modelCode=NP730QDA-KA1US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The price for the 13-inch model starts at $849&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6YSBX"&gt;The starting configuration includes 8GB of RAM, but supports up to 16GB, and the storage tops out at 512GB. It has a standard selection of ports, including two USB-A 3.0 ports, a USB-C port, a headphone jack, a power plug, HDMI, and a microSD slot. Like the Galaxy Book, this model also has a 54Wh battery.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The UAW wants to unionize EV startup factory workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7a-fzntkO1szOZiAz5oFNF4dZEU=/0x89:3708x2561/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199762/2019_03_normal.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZHS9IN"&gt;The United Auto Workers union is “laying the groundwork” to organize factory workers that will build electric vehicles for startups like Rivian and Lucid Motors, president Rory Gamble told &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/26/with-biden-as-an-ally-uaw-union-prepares-to-battle-for-ev-jobs.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;amp;par=sharebar"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGzTkz"&gt;“That’s a given. We are formulating plans to go out to all these start-ups to give these workers a voice,” he said. “In today’s world, you have to think out of the box in how you reach people. We really have to drive home the benefits of belonging to the union.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9JtCF"&gt;Gamble declined to say what those plans involve, according to CNBC. The UAW did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Representatives for Rivian, Lucid Motors, Faraday Future, and Lordstown Motors did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6CwNyF"&gt;Factory workers who build cars for legacy automakers like Ford, General Motors, and others have long been part of the UAW. But that’s not been the case for newer automakers in the US. The factory Tesla operates was once jointly owned by Toyota and GM, and its workforce was represented by the UAW. But when Tesla bought the shuttered factory after the recession in 2010, it &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2019/01/11/tesla-not-buying-gm-factory-union-employees-ceo/"&gt;rebuilt the workforce without a union&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZJH3jb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The UAW long fought, but ultimately failed, to organize workers at Tesla&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7r2nbv"&gt;Since then, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has maintained that his factory workers are better off without union representation. He once wrote that the UAW “does not share our mission,” and claimed its “true allegiance is to the giant car companies, where the money they take from employees in dues is vastly more than they could ever make from Tesla.” (The UAW collects monthly dues ranging from 0.805 percent to 1.44 percent of a worker’s monthly earnings, depending &lt;a href="https://uaw.org/dues-faq/"&gt;on a number of factors&lt;/a&gt;.) The National Labor Relations Board ultimately ruled that Musk’s comments &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22351157/tesla-elon-musk-delete-anti-union-tweet-national-labor-relations-board"&gt;should be considered union-busting and broke the law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NEHfXr"&gt;While a lot of attention has recently been paid to organizing efforts in tech and media industries, the number of non-government employees who belong to a union has fallen slightly over the last decade. The labor rights movement took an especially public hit earlier this month when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377142/bessemer-amazon-labor-union-loss-warehouse-rwdsu"&gt;a push to unionize an Amazon warehouse in Alabama overwhelmingly failed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pt2gwf"&gt;Similarly high-profile efforts to unionize in the auto industry have also recently failed, like when the UAW tried to organize workers at &lt;a href="https://www.labornotes.org/2017/08/why-did-nissan-workers-vote-no"&gt;a Nissan plant in Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 or at Volkswagen’s plant in &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/15/733074989/tennessee-workers-reject-union-at-volkswagen-plant-again"&gt;Chattanooga, Tennessee in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmp8j9"&gt;There are a number of EV startups that plan to build their vehicles in the United States. But, like Tesla, they have been assembling non-unionized workforces ahead of production at their respective factories. Many of them are also now flush with cash thanks to big investments or mergers with publicly traded special purpose acquisition companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nkw63"&gt;Rivian, which is backed by Amazon and is the most well-funded of the bunch, is supposed to start assembling its electric pickup truck and SUV at a former Mitsubishi plant it bought in Normal, Illinois. Saudi Arabia-backed Lucid Motors will build its electric luxury sedan at a massive new factory it’s building in Casa Grande, Arizona. Faraday Future, which is going public sometime before the end of June, is partway through refurbishing and retooling a former Pirelli tire plant in Hanford, California, where it will build its luxury SUV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqIPcf"&gt;One of the youngest EV startups in the country, Lordstown Motors, bought a shuttered GM factory in Lordstown, Ohio that was previously operated by UAW workers. The company’s CEO Steve Burns has said he was considering rehiring some of that workforce, but he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21173309/lordstown-motors-steve-burns-interview-ceo-gm-ohio-factory-trump"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; that it would be up to them whether they want to unionize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3PldS"&gt;“[I]t isn’t our call, but in case they do, we will embrace it and make sure the union knows what we’re trying to accomplish and see how we can work together to hit it out of the park,” Burns said. “The culture of the place is union, you know, the history. So we anticipate that to happen, to have union representation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OM3pum"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 vaccinations are keeping older Americans out of hospitals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-VACCINE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ojS5Tefn4W87NmjSjAybaZE6MYE=/64x0:5739x3783/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199750/1232342354.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wKZS8Y"&gt;Two shots of a COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of hospitalization by 94 percent for people over 65, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7018e1.htm?s_cid=mm7018e1_e&amp;amp;ACSTrackingID=usCDC_921-DM55819&amp;amp;ACSTrackingLabel=MMWR%20Early%20Release%20-%20Vol.%2070%2C%20April%2028%2C%202021&amp;amp;deliveryName=usCDC_921-DM55819"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4H0nv"&gt;That age group is at the highest risk of severe cases of COVID-19 — that’s why it was prioritized for the early waves of vaccination in the United States. Keeping that age group out of the hospital would go a long way to drive down the hospitalization rates from the disease overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2SAqj"&gt;The analysis looked at people hospitalized at 24 hospitals in 14 states during January, February, and March. It included 417 hospitalized patients, 187 of whom tested positive for COVID-19 and 230 who did not. Partial vaccination, defined in this case as having a first dose two weeks before starting to feel sick, was 64 percent effective against hospitalization. The shots were 94 percent effective for people who were fully vaccinated, two weeks out from their second dose. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Graphic showing that two doses of the vaccine reduces hospitalization risk from COVID-19 by 94 percent." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cCMV54J651YXgGRETISjy_wGz_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475544/mm7018e1_EffectivenessOlderAdults_IMAGE_28Apr21_1200x675.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5oZdMw"&gt;The data is consistent with the clinical trials testing the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which found that the shots would keep people out of the hospital. But because only a small percentage of people with COVID-19 need to be hospitalized, the trials themselves&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;didn’t have enough data to say how well they prevent hospitalization in the 65-plus age group, the CDC report notes. This real-world analysis adds more data to answer that question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ni2OSC"&gt;The study is yet another sign that the COVID-19 vaccines are overwhelmingly effective. Other data collected over the past few months found that the shots &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358085/covid-vaccines-effective-real-world-infection-protection-cdc"&gt;protect against infection&lt;/a&gt; with the coronavirus, not just symptomatic disease, and that they work well against &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395551/covid-vaccine-breakthrough-infection-rare-cdc"&gt;variant forms&lt;/a&gt; of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnUrBh"&gt;Around 68 percent of people over 65 in the United States are fully vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile launches LTE-based SyncUp Tracker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-W8JVbG76a6O-mdfEZJsOyqHfqI=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199710/SyncUP_TRACKER_Black_Front_Left_Laynard_RGB_2020_10_01_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SyncUp uses LTE rather than Bluetooth or UWB so it doesn’t need to be within range of your phone (or someone else’s) to be located.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: T-Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mfl65d"&gt;It seems that 2021 is the year of the tracker, with new options from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, and now T-Mobile in the form of its SyncUp Tracker. But unlike those other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20901686/tile-tracker-mate-pro-slim-sticker-release-date-news-features"&gt;Tile-type&lt;/a&gt; tracking devices, SyncUp uses LTE rather than Bluetooth or Ultra Wideband for real-time location information, a la &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/10/17841570/samsung-smartthings-tracker-gps-lte-m"&gt;Samsung’s SmartThings&lt;/a&gt; tracker. That means it doesn’t rely on being within a certain range of your phone (or other phones) to tell you where it is — but it does come with a $5 per month data charge on your T-Mobile phone plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAxx6S"&gt;The SyncUp offers some nice tracking features: you can make the device ring to help locate it when it’s out of sight, for example, and it offers geofencing to send you an alert when it leaves a predetermined area. It’s also IP67 dust and water resistant. More unusually, it offers a light sensor as an optional feature to detect if it’s been moved from somewhere dark, like the inside of a suitcase, to somewhere brighter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DzKIvKSkEiy0BEErMMBX5VLh1no=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475640/T_Mobile_SyncUP_TRACKER_Lifestyle_Bike_21CM0084_030421_0918.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: T-Mobile&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SyncUp’s rechargeable battery should last up to seven days on a charge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="urUnmC"&gt;Some trackers fit into the “set it and forget it” category with long-lasting batteries that only need to be replaced once a year or so. The SyncUp is not one of these devices. Its 900mAh battery needs to be recharged about once every seven days, so it’ll either be something you use occasionally as needed, or one more gadget in your life that you have to remember to charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cifbMS"&gt;Since the SyncUp operates on T-Mobile’s data network, you’ll need one of their data plans to use it: specifically, a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fplans&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F28%2F22407716%2Ft-mobile-syncup-tracker-lte-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;postpaid Magenta plan&lt;/a&gt;, though the company says it plans to make the tracker available for Sprint and prepaid customers in the future. With autopay, T-Mobile says prices start at $5 per month per connected device, and it’s compatible with both Android and iOS phones. It goes on sale next Friday, May 7th, for $60 outright or $2.50 per month with financing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber will let you book a vaccine appointment through its app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_zEdfNNgOM1B2OkyN9uKxtfgU00=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199224/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SMZwXz"&gt;You can now book a vaccine appointment — and a ride to that appointment — in the Uber app.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRDJBI"&gt;The new feature is part of a host of product news that Uber announced today under the rubric “go anywhere, get anything.” With more people getting vaccinated, the company is banking on a big comeback to help make up for the steep losses it suffered during 2020. And it’s rolling out a series of new features aimed at enticing lockdown-weary customers back to its platform — whether to travel somewhere or to get something delivered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ed0zYK"&gt;The vaccine appointments are being offered nationwide through the company’s previously announced partnership with Walgreens. Since February, Uber has been offering free rides to Walgreens stores for people who book a vaccine appointment but do not have transportation and live in an underserved community. The company says it’s committed to offering 10 million free or discounted rides to people from those communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJSa0t"&gt;Now that partnership includes vaccine appointments at participating Walgreen drugstores. Walgreens says vaccinations are now available at more than 9,000 locations across the country as eligibility expansion continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fRgiV3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“go anywhere, get anything”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hivllm"&gt;Uber’s main rival Lyft similarly has the goal of offering 60 million rides to and from vaccine appointments to people from low-income or high-risk communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WU83VV"&gt;Uber is also offering new and different ways to get around that don’t necessarily involve a vehicle-for-hire. The company is teaming up with rental car services across the country, including Avis, Budget, and Hertz, to offer its customers the ability to rent a car through its app. And for an extra fee, you can also pay to have that car delivered straight to your front door through Uber’s new valet service. That service is only available in Washington, DC starting in May, but Uber expects to expand it nationwide later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajFr9C"&gt;The company is expanding its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21556948/uber-reserve-book-ride-advance-30-days-service-fee"&gt;Uber Reserve&lt;/a&gt; feature that lets customers book a ride 30 days in advance to more cities, including Paris, London, and “hundreds” of US cities and towns. It’s a sign of Uber’s growing confidence that more people will be taking trips to the airport in the coming months as vaccines become more plentiful and business and leisure travel returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x21XZ1"&gt;For customers who want to use Uber to make multiple stops, the company is introducing a new Hourly feature for reserving rides by the hour. Previously, the feature was only available in Uber Black and Uber Premium, the company’s higher-priced products. Now it will also be available to customers who use UberX. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1BpjZs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Uber is also bringing more features to its Uber Eats delivery service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yl2kl1"&gt;Uber is also bringing more features to its Uber Eats delivery service, including a Pickup and Go option to purchase takeout food or liquor along your route in a for-hire Uber vehicle. Preorders allow customers to order food from restaurants when they are closed. And the company is including a new option to bundle delivery orders from multiple locations, so customers can get takeout food and grocery items in the same order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPzVUb"&gt;If all of this sounds like a lot of extra work for drivers, it’s probably because it is. Uber and Lyft are both facing a massive driver shortage right now, with many drivers abandoning the platforms over low wages, stressful working conditions, and the decrease in demand brought on by the pandemic. Both companies have responded by hiking rates and offering bonuses to lure more drivers back into their vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOWhLk"&gt;A major challenge for this effort, though, is that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22277043/uber-lyft-earnings-q4-2020-profit-loss-covid"&gt;COVID-19 continues to be a huge drag on Uber’s and Lyft’s respective businesses&lt;/a&gt;. As case numbers spiked over the winter, both companies lost a significant portion of their customer base. People stayed at home, or when they did go out, they opted not to use ride-hailing apps. In the last quarter of 2020, Uber said it had only 93 million “monthly active platform consumers,” its term for users who take at least one ride on Uber or buy at least one meal on Uber Eats — a 16 percent decrease year over year. Meanwhile, Lyft reported a drop in monthly active users of 45 percent, from 22 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 12.5 million in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtK3ln"&gt;Both companies will report their first quarter earnings in the first week of May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9Okja"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Book Odyssey introduces Nvidia’s new RTX 3050 Ti</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3_gHZ0rxGt0bNVvB9JB-cOU-Tsw=/57x0:672x410/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199073/download.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s new Galaxy Book Odyssey.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mTOPbR"&gt;Samsung is announcing its new Galaxy Book Odyssey gaming laptop today, complete with Nvidia’s unannounced GeForce RTX 3050 Ti and 3050 graphics cards. The 15.6-inch (1080p) gaming laptop starts at $1,399 and will ship with Intel’s 11th Gen Core H i5 or i7 processors, up to 32GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of SSD storage. The big new addition is a choice between Nvidia’s RTX 3050 or RTX 3050 Ti GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95Dfeo"&gt;Samsung hasn’t provided many details on the RTX 3050 or RTX 3050 Ti, and Nvidia hasn’t even announced the GPU yet, so details are slim. The RTX 3050 Ti name &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315175/nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-gpu-asus-leak-rumor"&gt;appeared in March on an Asus website&lt;/a&gt; that mentioned it would have 4GB of memory. Combined with the numbering scheme and 135-watt charger, this suggests this is more of an entry-level gaming laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Book Odyssey includes a variety of ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iArGUV"&gt;This Galaxy Book Odyssey also includes a 720p webcam, a fingerprint reader on the power key, and microSD expandable storage. There are two USB-C ports, three USB 3.2 ports, an HDMI port, and a network port. Samsung says this new gaming laptop also ships with a mysterious “enhanced cooling system,” which will presumably help keep things cool when you’re gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pjTTaZ"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Book Odyssey will be available in “mystic black” in August, starting at $1,399. Samsung also announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405540/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-features-price-photos-video-release-date"&gt;new Galaxy Book Pro and Galaxy Book Pro 360 lightweight laptops&lt;/a&gt; today, complete with OLED screens.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moped-sharing startup Revel plans to launch a Tesla-only ride-hailing service in NYC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PcvBBuHvudFGcunD2kdBEHxbMHI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198944/revel_pressimage.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VdBjRF"&gt;Electric moped-sharing startup Revel is adding a new vehicle to its fleet — this time with four wheels instead of two. The Brooklyn-based company is launching its own Uber-esque ride-hailing service in New York City using only electric vehicles from Tesla. And true to its Uber-imitating ways, the company is announcing its intention to launch the service before obtaining its license to legally to operate in the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9OJcCM"&gt;It’s an interesting — and potentially risky — move for the three-year-old startup with thousands of shared electric mopeds in cities across the US. As it grows in size, Revel has also gotten more ambitious, launching an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22279921/revel-ebike-subscription-nyc-price-specs"&gt;e-bike subscription service&lt;/a&gt; and unveiling plans to build &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/electric-moped-startup-revel-launches-an-ev-charging-business/"&gt;the largest EV charging station in New York City&lt;/a&gt;. Now, it has its sights set on Uber and Lyft’s customers as it expands into ride-hailing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="F8EYCw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s an interesting — and potentially risky — move&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c09nRK"&gt;But rather than poach customers from Uber and Lyft, Revel may end up hurting New York City’s already struggling yellow taxi drivers. The company says it plans to offer its service only in Manhattan to start out, with pick-ups and drop-offs taking place below 42nd Street. The company says it will expand into additional neighborhoods and boroughs based on where the demand is. That’s prime yellow cab territory, and with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/09/us/yellow-taxi-drivers-new-york-covid/index.html"&gt;ridership still down 80–90 percent since March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, the timing couldn’t be worse for many cab drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9Ut59"&gt;The city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has been at odds with Uber and Lyft over the years &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20758796/nyc-uber-lyft-cap-extended-tlc-de-blasio"&gt;over its efforts to cap the number of for-hire-vehicle licenses&lt;/a&gt; it hands out. The TLC exempts wheelchair-accessible and electric vehicles from the cap, giving Revel a loophole to launch its Tesla-only service.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A25FhO"&gt;“TLC capped for-hire vehicles because supply already exceeds demand,” TLC Commissioner and Chair Aloysee Heredia Jarmoszuk said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The electric battery exemption exists to encourage already-licensed cars to go green, not to flood an already saturated market or to disenfranchise the Yellow Taxi sector in Manhattan. This ride-share scheme deviates from the spirit of those rules, and TLC will not cut corners in doing its full diligence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gvHYt0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This ride-share scheme deviates from the spirit of those rules”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k8ZVt6"&gt;A TLC spokesperson was more blunt, saying, “Revel is not licensed to operate for-hire transportation vehicles in NYC.” But Revel says that, as of this month, the TLC approved its base application and issued its base license number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLLfhc"&gt;“We are currently finalizing this process,” a Revel spokesperson said. “Revel has always, and will continue to operate legally in any city where we offer our service.” (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/7/3300244/uber-taxi-new-york-travis-kalanick-rogue"&gt;Uber famously flouted the TLC’s rules&lt;/a&gt; when it launched in New York City back in 2012.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfAzH7"&gt;In a statement, Revel CEO and co-founder Frank Reig dismissed the TLC commissioner’s concerns, stating that the company was committed to following the rules as laid out by the city’s regulations. “Our ability to operate doesn’t depend on the Commissioner’s opinion—it depends on us taking the steps laid out by law to complete the administrative licensing process, which we’ve done since the start,” Reig said. “Right now we are exactly where we need to be as we look towards putting Revel rideshare vehicles on the road in May.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Huyxzt"&gt;Revel wouldn’t reveal its pricing, but it said it would be competitive with Uber and Lyft. In New York City, vehicle-for-hire firms charge on a per-mile basis, with booking fees and Black Car Fund surcharges tacked on at the end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="npFQQN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10468916"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lKoqUE"&gt;If it ultimately receives the green light to launch, Revel clearly wants to make a splash with its all-Tesla fleet. The company has 50 bright blue Tesla Model Y vehicles with Revel’s logo emblazoned on the side for the initial launch. The Model Ys will be slightly modified, with the front passenger seat removed for added legroom. As per COVID-19 guidelines, a plastic partition will separate the driver from the passengers, and the vehicles will be cleaned on a daily basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0g9mQ"&gt;The fleet will be owned by Revel, which is another divergence from Uber and Lyft, which subscribe to an asset-light business model where the drivers or vehicle-for-hire bases own the vehicles. As such, Revel will be responsible for all of the costs associated with ride-hailing, including maintenance, cleanings, and refueling — or in this case, battery charging. To help with that, Revel’s new Superhub charging station will go online with its first 10 chargers starting in June 2020, with more locations planned for across the city in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3K6Av"&gt;Drivers will be hired as employees by Revel and will have access to training, health care, and paid time off. This is similar to how Revel classifies its workers who rebalance the company’s fleet of electric mopeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K1TkOV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ride-sharing raises a host of new possibilities for Revel&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rTNuI4"&gt;It’s unclear whether the company’s differences from Uber and Lyft will be enough to convince regulators that it would have a negative impact on the yellow taxi industry in New York City. Uber’s emergence over nine years ago has sent taxi medallion prices tumbling, with many indebted drivers calling for a bailout from the city. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/23/nyregion/nyc-taxi-suicides.html"&gt;Nearly a thousand drivers have filed for bankruptcy, with at least six drivers dying from suicide&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vsj9MA"&gt;Ride-sharing also raises a host of safety concerns. Uber and Lyft have long struggled to keep riders and drivers safe from one another. In its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997939/uber-safety-report-2018-sexual-assault-ride-hailing-platform-stats"&gt;first safety report&lt;/a&gt;, Uber disclosed that 3,045 sexual assaults occurred on Uber trips in 2018 alone. Additionally, nine people were murdered during Uber rides, and 58 people died in auto-related crashes. Drivers reported being victims of assaults at roughly the same rate as riders. Uber and Lyft recently agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325675/uber-lyft-driver-deactivate-assault-murder-share-safety"&gt;share information&lt;/a&gt; on drivers who were deactivated for committing serious offenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXAlLL"&gt;Revel has already sparred with the City of New York over its sometimes-scofflaw moped customers. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344993/revel-suspends-electric-moped-nyc-people-killed"&gt;Revel was forced to temporarily shut down&lt;/a&gt; its service after two customers were killed and one was critically injured while riding the shared electric mopeds. The company eventually resumed service with &lt;a href="https://gorevel.com/safety/"&gt;new protective measures for riders&lt;/a&gt; like a mandatory in-app safety test and a requirement that all riders take a selfie of themselves wearing a helmet before they’ll be allowed to ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ShL0ss"&gt;Revel also isn’t the first micromobility company to consider leveling up to cars. Scooter- and bike-sharing service Lime briefly flirted with electric car-sharing with its LimePod product in Seattle, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/lime-is-shutting-down-car-rental-service-limepod/"&gt;only to shut it down after a few months&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxQPgH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 28th, 11:05AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with a statement from Revel CEO and co-founder Frank Reig. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrZ9hb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Wktrz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beefing over beef is a distraction the climate movement can’t afford </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shake Shack Burger Chain Considers I.P.O." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WOT21nr3m15TEeKEVxUXD3vB29M=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198925/453780980.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A burger in New York City.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ldpaj9"&gt;Lately, it seems like forgoing red meat has become an unfortunate proxy for environmental credentials. &lt;em&gt;Epicurious&lt;/em&gt;, for example, just &lt;a href="https://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/why-epicurious-left-beef-behind-article"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will no longer publish articles or recipes with beef in a decision it calls, “not anti-beef but rather pro-planet.” And then there are headlines like “&lt;a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/why-do-some-green-activists-eat-meat/"&gt;Why do some green activists eat meat&lt;/a&gt;?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUhXmQ"&gt;Meat-eating, meanwhile, has become a sort of symbol for climate denial. There are Twitter wars swirling around whether Biden’s climate ambitions will infringe on Americans’ right to eat burgers (his actual climate proposals would not).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TjCkG1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Diet shouldn’t be a political scorecard for how down you are for the planet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yAGA0K"&gt;But diet shouldn’t be a political scorecard for how down you are for the planet. Shaming people over what they eat — particularly for girls, immigrants, and people who don’t fit the unfairly skinny box of beauty standards — is nothing new. We don’t need to add one more minefield. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3lm8J"&gt;Focusing heavily on individual responsibility to save the planet can also be a big distraction from the actual systemic change needed to tackle the global climate crisis. What’s more, it can alienate people who do care about climate change but might not have as many options when it comes to what they eat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7hP2q"&gt;Livestock are responsible for a &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/"&gt;hefty 14.5 percent chunk&lt;/a&gt; of global greenhouse gas emissions. Meat industries have taken efforts to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22379909/big-meat-companies-spend-millions-lobbying-climate"&gt;obscure&lt;/a&gt; the connection between meat and climate change. So these industries should be held accountable for the damage they do to the planet we call home. As a media outlet and respected food institution, &lt;em&gt;Epicurious&lt;/em&gt; does have some power and responsibility to do just that by leaving beef behind.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0GSjl"&gt;Most individuals don’t carry the same weight on their shoulders, especially if you live in a neighborhood where fresh produce or meat alternatives feel out of reach. Taking on the climate crisis is a battle against structural barriers and systemic failures. It’s about confronting power, not people’s dinner choices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="KWDMi9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Confronting power, not people’s dinner choices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fND22h"&gt;Having the alternatives easily available to be able to give up beef, for example, might require some level of privilege. Up to &lt;a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/documentation/"&gt;54 million people&lt;/a&gt; in the US — more than 17 percent of the US population — live in low-income census tracts without a grocery store nearby. If you’re in one of these food deserts, a hot dog from a gas station or a burger from McDonald’s might just be what’s at hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5A4Hm"&gt;“Boycotts of terrible retailers are a wonderful idea until you realize that they are the only option in some areas,” Mikki Kendall writes in her book, &lt;em&gt;Hood Feminism: Notes from the Women That a Movement Forgot&lt;/em&gt;. “Who is being hurt more? The corporation, or the people who rely on it for access to food?” Kendall’s book is broadly about how mainstream feminist groups can marginalize girls and women of color when they fail to recognize other inequities and injustices they face — including food insecurity. Mainstream environmentalism can apply similar lessons to their movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87e888"&gt;“All too often, our culture broadly equates ‘environmentalism’ with personal consumerism. To be ‘good,’ we must convert to 100 percent solar energy, ride an upcycled bike everywhere, stop flying, eat vegan,” &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/5/28/18629833/climate-change-2019-green-new-deal"&gt;writes Mary Annaïse Heglar&lt;/a&gt;, a climate justice essayist, in &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;. “All this raises the price of admission to the climate movement to an exorbitant level, often pricing out people of color and other marginalized groups.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="699YEv"&gt;There could, of course, be big gains for people and the planet if there were better access to fresh fruits and vegetables for everyone regardless of identity, income, or where they live. That’s a conversation about empowerment and self-determination, not shame and moral high grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tq6bOd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Empowerment and self-determination, not shame and moral high grounds&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mxJk3Y"&gt;There already are plenty of people who abstain from meat for environmental, cultural, or personal reasons. And if someone does want to reduce their individual carbon footprint, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/2017/12/12/16762900/mediterranean-diet-pescatarian-climate-change"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that cutting down on meat is one of the most effective ways to do that. The best way to support people who do want to eat less meat might be to ensure they have access to the foods they actually want. Again, choosing what you eat is easier said than done when you don’t have fresh foods or culturally specific ingredients nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptWe7S"&gt;There are even more disparities to consider when it comes to food and the climate crisis. Not everyone is equally responsible for the problem. Researchers have found that the typical diet of white Americans had &lt;a href="https://grist.org/article/dear-white-people-we-need-to-talk-about-your-diets-carbon-footprint/"&gt;higher per capita greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt; compared to that of Black and Latinx Americans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOWOJy"&gt;But again, focusing heavily on individual choice and responsibility to save the planet can be a big distraction. We’re seeing that play out now with the drama over the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/04/26/republicans-meat-biden-climate-plan/"&gt;false story&lt;/a&gt; that Joe Biden plans to limit Americans’ red meat consumption to four pounds a year. Biden has never suggested such a meat limit. Instead, he’s proposed dramatically making over the nation’s infrastructure to transition toward clean energy — an actual policy debate with a lot more rhetorical meat to sink your teeth into. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWVpy0"&gt;That saga also highlights how much food can be tied to identity, and how shaming someone for their diet tends to divide and disempower people rather than get them to act on climate change. Ultimately, everyone deserves to be at the table if they care about the climate. Refusing someone a seat because they’re not readily abandoning meat hurts more than it helps. Each person might have something different to offer, whether it’s a dish, an idea, or a vote. The solutions make up a potluck — not a prix fixe, one-size-fits-all menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svMClw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ns6w5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 3 (non-LTE) review: third time’s the charm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $169 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is $30 off its usual price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F185638711%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; has knocked down its price to $179, down from $229.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qq3ebV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="0eLZZK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch SE review: pay a lot less to give up only a little","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="lzhqCk"&gt;If you want a 40mm model that supports GPS and cellular, Amazon has this configuration down to its lowest price of about $420 in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-Cellular-40mm/dp/B08J5X2JNC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rose gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-Cellular-40mm/dp/B08J5R3K3Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Late last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30, which is what it is going for now at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fpreselect%3D80770243%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. There is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; to show the time, weather, and other information that is available for $40, which is $20 below its usual $60 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHsulr"&gt;Amazon is also selling some bundles, including a $40 one that features &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4FDPHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one Sengled Bluetooth bulb&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Amazon-Smart-Charcoal/dp/B08GTWC9ZB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot and Amazon Smart Plug bundle&lt;/a&gt; available for $40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;We have seen this product go down to $40, which is what it is currently available for now at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is also selling a bundle for $55 which includes an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B08GV4SF3W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition plus an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3GbSWO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;Currently, the fourth generation Echo available for $100 (usual price) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733330369536034962#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770246%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiNGuc"&gt;If you are looking for a pair of Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $180&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $20 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XqDD6Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the Echo Studio is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D411Fi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is the one to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90 and we have seen it go down as low as $45. At the moment, the Echo Show 5 is on sale for $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation Echo Show 10. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It is also mounted on a motorized swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
