    <title>How to get a government-paid discount on your broadband </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0VSs6-nM67vX-UDEmnm0m0TOjPY=/0x0:945x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69270446/EBB_Program_Social_Media_Post_Images_Option1_Telehealth1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gWCc31"&gt;The past year, a lot of people were laid off or otherwise unable to pay for basic necessities. So the &lt;a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-116HR133SA-RCP-116-68.pdf"&gt;stimulus package&lt;/a&gt; passed by Congress in December included a provision to pay for broadband and other basic tech for those who, because of job loss or other financial difficulties, can’t afford to pay for it on their own. And starting this week, if you qualify, you can take advantage of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kf2rdg"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://getemergencybroadband.org/"&gt;Emergency Broadband Benefit Program&lt;/a&gt; is being administered by the FCC and offers a temporary discount on monthly broadband bills — up to $50 a month (or $75 if your household is on qualifying Tribal lands). If your income qualifies, you can also get a one-time discount of up to $100 for a computer or a tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgqz9D"&gt;It’s not a lot, considering how much tech costs these days, but every little bit helps. And applications for that discount will be available starting tomorrow, May 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GCs6Bw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are a variety of ways you can qualify for the program&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ji2jm"&gt;There are a variety of ways &lt;a href="https://www.lifelinesupport.org/do-i-qualify/"&gt;you can qualify for the program&lt;/a&gt;. Qualifications can include your income level (at or below 135 percent of &lt;a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/2021-poverty-guidelines"&gt;the Federal Poverty level&lt;/a&gt;), participation in a program such as SNAP or Medicaid, job loss due to the pandemic, or other criteria. You can get more information by either visiting the &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumer-faq-emergency-broadband-benefit"&gt;FCC website&lt;/a&gt; or by going to &lt;a href="https://getemergencybroadband.org/"&gt;getemergencybroadband.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDFd5I"&gt;If you think you qualify, you can either &lt;a href="https://getemergencybroadband.org/"&gt;apply online&lt;/a&gt;, contact your current broadband provider to see if they are participating in the program (or &lt;a href="https://data.usac.org/publicreports/CompaniesNearMe/Download/Report"&gt;check this list for a provider near you&lt;/a&gt;), or print out and complete an application and send it to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kdkprs"&gt;Emergency Broadband Support Center&lt;br&gt;P.O. Box 7081&lt;br&gt;London, KY 40742.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yZoQ0N"&gt;One warning: if you think you may qualify, don’t put off sending in the application. This is a temporary program, and you lose your benefit when the fund runs out of money, or “six months after the Department of Health and Human Services declares an end to the COVID-19 health emergency” — whichever is sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vHraN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVhEO5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6QQ18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instacart tells entry-level team to return to office, senior managers can stay home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sizzling U.S. Stock Markets Await Next Leg Of Record IPO Run" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BNroc8ZGpF6XO6JhBzjplr0YqVs=/0x2:4000x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69270427/1230448031.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PnEVI3"&gt;Instacart is shifting to a primarily remote-first workplace, but employees say the company has arbitrarily chosen which teams have to come into the office in a way that hurts junior employees. Workers on the central operations team — which includes logistics and trust and safety — have been told they need to return to the San Francisco office three days a week starting in September and were not given a clear reason why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCt0jf"&gt;“To a lot of employees this policy excluding us from permanent remote work is being interpreted as ‘we trust the majority of the company to be able to work remote permanently, but not these specific employees,’” says one employee who asked to remain anonymous for fear of professional retaliation. “Considering everyone has been remote for over a year, it’s very disappointing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0pI2d"&gt;Last week, the company announced that 70 percent of the workforce would be remote. “We asked our employees what they wanted the future of work at Instacart to look like, their response? Make it flexible,” &lt;a href="https://instacart.careers/remote/"&gt;a newly updated careers page says&lt;/a&gt;. “We know there’s no one-size-fits-all approach for how we do our best work, so we’re introducing a hybrid work environment for when it’s safe for our offices to re-open.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Am3K2H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not a matter of data security.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VqT6AN"&gt;Workers on central operations say they aren’t sure why they’re being required to come in. While companies like Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497789/facebook-content-moderators-accenture-return-office-coronavirus"&gt;mandate in-office work for content moderators who handle sensitive information&lt;/a&gt;, Instacart is letting the central ops team work from home twice a week — and has allowed them to be fully remote for the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SO8JEd"&gt;In response to questions from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an Instacart spokesperson said: “Central Operations employees often work with sensitive proprietary information and data that is managed on-site in Instacart’s offices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gXFSzU"&gt;The team, estimated to be around 100 people, includes many entry-level employees and workers who are new to the tech industry. Employees say the power imbalance makes it difficult to push back on the remote work policy. “A lot of the roles are easily replaceable,” says another worker who asked not to be named. “They can happily find someone else to fill that role if you’re not okay with the policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cH0Ihn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Two commenters say they plan to quit if the policy doesn’t change.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EY0vuz"&gt;On the anonymous chat app Blind, one user wrote that managers on the central operations team were told to “silence the issue, when reported, rather than find a solution.” While anyone with an Instacart email address can post on Blind, the comment scared employees who worried they’d be fired if they questioned the mandate. Two commenters say they plan to quit if the policy doesn’t change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yx1dkv"&gt;An Instacart spokesperson said it has never told managers to silence the remote work issue, adding: “We always encourage employee feedback on these policies and will continue to create forums for open discussion to ensure every Instacart employee feels engaged, productive, and successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lKV2d"&gt;In an internal email obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an Instacart director said in-person work was a “foundational element to professional growth, team cohesion, cross-collaboration, and sustained performance over time.” But the requirement does not apply to most other teams at the company, nor does it extend to senior managers in the central operations organization. Those employees are able to work remotely, popping into the office a “percentage of time” throughout the month, according to the internal note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5jnzdh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter and Coinbase have committed to going fully remote.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1RM836"&gt;The tension between Instacart employees and management highlights the quandary that many tech companies will likely face as they begin to reopen their offices. While organizations like Twitter and Coinbase have committed to going fully remote, others are attempting a hybrid approach that will doubtless leave some workers frustrated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lluyeB"&gt;That’s partly because many tech workers have moved outside of San Francisco. Natalie Holmes, a research fellow at the California Policy Lab, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-03-04/california-exodus-san-francisco-migration#:~:text=California-,Californians%20aren't%20leaving%20the%20state%20en%20masse%20%E2%80%94%20but%20they,from%20the%20California%20Policy%20Lab."&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the city was experiencing “a unique and dramatic exodus” amid the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPLGkQ"&gt;Instacart employees on the central operations team were already upset about having to return to in-person work three days a week when the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2021/05/06/instacart-remote-work-new-normal-office-hq.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;San Francisco Business Times &lt;/em&gt;published an article&lt;/a&gt; last week announcing most of the company would be remote. “The article put it in perspective that we were basically the only people who would be required in the office,” the anonymous employee says. “That threw the reason of ‘cross-collaboration’ out the window, since the teams we work with won’t be there.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Join Sen. Ed Markey and Gigi Sohn for a Verge Live event on Wednesday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SbmCCql77aGkGgAs4pNlKC08FUo=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150086/VER_VergeLive_Article_GigiSohn.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xu6vIF"&gt;In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216843/georgia-runoff-net-neutrality-fcc-jon-ossoff-raphael-warnock-democrats-senate"&gt;the future looked bright for net neutrality&lt;/a&gt;. After a surprise victory in the Georgia special elections, Democrats gained a majority in the Senate, opening the door for aggressive new Federal Communications Commission leadership that could reinstate net neutrality by regulatory order. There was even talk of passing a bill that would enshrine net neutrality in law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="3Eq4SG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10454209"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VDZaaI"&gt;In the three months since then, not much has happened. Preoccupied with the pandemic, the Biden White House has focused on shepherding through its relief and rebuilding efforts, a pair of massive spending bills that require every bit of political capital Democrats can spare. As a result, even basic measures like appointing a new FCC chair have taken a back seat to more urgent matters. But that may finally be changing, with rumblings from the FCC and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18206984/net-neutrality-bill-congress-new-fcc-markey"&gt;poised to introduce a net neutrality bill in Congress in the months to come&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOPafK"&gt;In a new &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; Live event on Wednesday, we’ll dive into the net neutrality fight and the broader progressive effort to upgrade America’s internet. With so much of Washington focused on infrastructure, there’s never been a better time to take stock of the broadband gap and the various ways the government can make sure America stays online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeG3qG"&gt;After a few opening words from &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Nilay Patel, we’ll have a conversation with Markey, talking through the path forward for net neutrality in this Congress. After that, we’ll talk to Georgetown fellow and Public Knowledge co-founder Gigi Sohn, who will get into what the next four years might hold for broadband access and broadband regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwNJf7"&gt;Just like our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287443/section-230-amy-klobuchar-internet-regulation-panel-event-sign-up"&gt;March event&lt;/a&gt;, the whole thing will be virtual, but you’ll be able to drop questions in a chat room if there’s anything you want to know. We won’t be posting the full video publicly, so the only way to see it is to &lt;a href="https://www.voxmediaevents.com/thevergeliveinfrastructure/article"&gt;sign up here&lt;/a&gt;. We hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now buy NFTs on eBay, and ‘blockchain-driven collectibles’ are coming soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="eBay new logo STOCK" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N5-AKBxepMJyBVVg1Jz2TqhrmJU=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69270085/ebay-logo-stock_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5EcduJ"&gt;eBay is &lt;a href="https://community.ebay.com/t5/Announcements/eBay-and-Digital-Collectibles-Our-Tech-Led-Reimagination/ba-p/31861893"&gt;now allowing NFTs to be sold on its platform&lt;/a&gt;, making the digital collectibles available side by side with physical ones. Whether you’re looking for a physical Dogecoin replica or a digital representation of Elon Musk holding Doge, eBay is apparently now the place to get both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbYsR2"&gt;At the moment, eBay wants to make sure that NFTs are listed by trusted sellers, and only in certain categories like trading cards, music, entertainment, and art. The company does say, though, that it hopes to expand its policies and tools in the future to allow more categories after it’s gathered feedback from the community with the current crop of NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="FhvQEK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D6PFVAV8enXMZMx_FW_wX35FhTQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22507051/Screen_Shot_2021_05_11_at_10.39.11_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first result when searching “NFT” on eBay, to the surprise of no one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qVb6kn"&gt;The blog post also mentions future updates to allow “blockchain-driven collectables,” though it doesn’t expand on what that means outside of NFTs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="745p04"&gt;eBay’s CEO &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ebay-ceo-says-looking-cryptocurrency-payment-option-cnbc-2021-05-03"&gt;said earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; that the company would be open to accepting cryptocurrencies in the future, but at the moment the NFTs being sold on the platform seem to be using its standard payment system linked to a credit card or PayPal account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZetzKt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel is the dream computer I’ll never own</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A laptop unlike any other&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7NjIfd"&gt;The Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel is a computer I will never own. But I really, really wish I could. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWRRPR"&gt;Artists, creators, and engineers who are looking for a powerful high-end convertible have all kinds of options on today’s market. But only Acer’s ConceptD line can fold in six different ways. There are not one, but two hinges attached to the display: a traditional clamshell hinge and another one in the middle of the lid that enables the screen to rotate outward. By using the two hinges in tandem, you can put the screen in nearly any position you want. This unique form factor makes the ConceptD 7 Ezel unlike any other laptop on the market.      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="j1LL6I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Acer’s Swift 5 puts the ‘ultra’ in ‘ultraportable’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22256779/acer-swift-5-2021-review-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"},{"title":"Acer Travelmate P6 review: a suitable business partner","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22339981/acer-travelmate-p6-review-2021-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="B9L2p0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10494201"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kDWr55"&gt;There are other things that separate the Ezel from something like a MacBook, of course. It also has a sleek look with an attractive finish, a gorgeous 15.6-inch 4K UHD touch display, a built-in Wacom EMR pen, and all the ports you need. The chips on the inside are quite powerful. But you can find similar benefits in many convertibles that are half the price. The people who should shell out thousands of dollars for this device are those who have a need for the combination of its unique form factor and large screen — and the rest of us can be jealous of them from afar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="tjtAjd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A sleek look with an attractive finish&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2jTQt"&gt;Before ogling too much over this form factor, you might want to know how much it costs. The $2,499 base model comes with an Intel Core i7-10750H, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. For $2,999.99, you can bump the graphics up to a GeForce RTX 2070 and 2TB of storage. I was sent the top model, which has a Core i7-10875H, 32GB of RAM, and a GeForce RTX 2080 Super Max-Q, for a whopping $3,999.99. These components are both a generation old — Acer hasn’t refreshed the ConceptD with the latest chips yet — but they still deliver solid performance, as you’ll see later on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="86DWnE"&gt;These prices will make the ConceptD 7 Ezel an unrealistic purchase for most people, but there’s a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acer.com%2Fac%2Fen%2FUS%2Fcontent%2Fconceptd-models%2Flaptops%2Fconceptd3ezel&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22430445%2Facer-conceptd-7-ezel-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;14-inch ConceptD&lt;/a&gt; that’s more affordable if you’re interested in this form factor. For those whose work involves professional design and video editing, CGI, machine learning, and the like, Acer also sells a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acer.com%2Fac%2Fen%2FUS%2Fcontent%2Fconceptd-model%2FNX.C5FAA.001&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22430445%2Facer-conceptd-7-ezel-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ConceptD 7 Ezel Pro&lt;/a&gt; with an Nvidia Quadro GPU. Those are expensive, and people whose work requires a Quadro likely know who they are. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel open, seen from above, on a patterned carpet. The screen displays a few colored paintbrush strokes on a black background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WWObCunEnSAeGGvuCPSh_GM7y_g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22490291/akrales_20210430_4515_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A normal-looking laptop, until you start bending the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oyxxQY"&gt;There are all kinds of ways you could theoretically arrange the ConceptD, but Acer has defined six. There’s Laptop (self-explanatory), Pad (tablet mode), Float (screen facing forward, hanging above the keyboard deck), Stand (screen facing forward, forming a tent shape over the keyboard deck), Share (screen facing upward, parallel to the keyboard deck), and Display (clamshell shape, but with the screen facing away from the keyboard). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="J0Wtne"&gt;&lt;q&gt; The Ezel is too heavy to practically hold as a tablet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ewKJN"&gt;I started out using the Ezel in Laptop most of the time, but Float grew on me quickly. It brought the screen much closer to me — it’s pretty far away in Laptop mode, given the size of the keyboard deck. I can see the use cases for the other modes as well: I’d love to use Stand to take notes during a lecture, for example, and Share could be useful for drawing while standing at a desk. The one form I can’t really see myself using is Pad because, at 5.6 pounds, the Ezel is too heavy to practically hold as a tablet unless you’re swole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpE0tR"&gt;The one hiccup I ran into is that the screen is very top-heavy. A few times when I picked the device up, the screen would start to fall forward and I’d have to catch it to keep the lid open. My preferences for Windows tablet mode vs. Windows desktop mode also didn’t quite line up with the device’s. It stayed in desktop mode when in Stand, for example, but I’d prefer it switch to Tablet Mode in that form since the keyboard isn’t accessible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel in Float, seen from above and to the left. The screen displays several paintbrush strokes on a black background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/83JU3OCr0FGFNM4hIl4YGwEnneo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22490295/akrales_20210503_4515_0093.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer calls this the “Ezel Hinge design.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PGqHjx"&gt;The fact that these form factors are useful, of course, doesn’t mean that most people need&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;them. Convertibles like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; can emulate most of these positions as well (Float and Stand are the really unique ones). The Ezel is really meant for people who will be using the nontraditional forms a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;. For those folks, it has two main benefits: moving the screen around is quite smooth and seamless (you don’t have to use two hands to flip the whole machine around, as you would with a 2-in-1 workstation), and the hinge is also sturdy enough that you can draw in Float and Share with no wobble at all. Of course, this sturdiness comes with a big weight penalty, in addition to its price premium — the Ezel is much heavier than most convertible machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vtv0fg"&gt;That extra heft isn’t for nothing — there are some serious fans in this device. Specifically, there are two “4th-Gen AeroBlade 3D” fans in addition to three heat pipes, and there are vents all over the place including the sides of the case and above the keyboard. The system (which Acer calls its “Vortex Flow” design) did a good job of keeping the chassis cool during my day-to-day work — the bottom sometimes got warm but was never uncomfortably hot, and I never felt much heat on the keyboard or palm rests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eZgG7S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10494211"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QtZMfX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The fans had trouble keeping pace with the CPU&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sJRv6I"&gt;The fans had trouble keeping pace with the CPU, though. Temperatures stayed solidly in the mid-70s to mid-80s (Celsius) during a 30-minute loop of Cinebench — but throughout several runs of a five-minute, 33-second 4K video export in Adobe Premiere Pro, I saw it jump up to the mid-90s, and even high-90s often. Cinebench scores did decrease over time, and export times also got slower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpT8wf"&gt;The ConceptD took two minutes and 55 seconds to complete the video export, which is one of the fastest times we’ve ever seen from a laptop. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; with the same processor and a GTX 1650 Ti took four minutes and 23 seconds (though different versions of Premiere Pro can impact export times, so synthetic benchmarks such as Cinebench are more precise for direct comparison). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o4hzxh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10494273"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ylTifT"&gt;I also ran PugetBench for Premiere Pro, which measures a device’s performance on a number of real-world Premiere Pro tasks, and the ConceptD scored a 604, which beats the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=34962"&gt;XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; as well. The ConceptD also solidly beats the &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/7749339"&gt;XPS&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/compute/1335492"&gt;Geekbench 5&lt;/a&gt; across the board. The XPS isn’t exactly on a level playing field here, since it has a weaker GPU — these results just illustrate the increased performance that the ConceptD will give you for the extra money. Acer’s machine did lose to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;Apple’s M1 MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; in both single-core tests, which underscores how powerful Apple’s processor is in single-core workloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="AHAbIO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10494222"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpkcoE"&gt;The Ezel comes with some software features tailored to creative work as well. In Acer’s ConceptD Palette app, you can swap between Native and Adobe RGB color presets, as well as customizable profiles. You can also monitor CPU, GPU, and memory usage to see how much power your apps are using, and you can toggle between various split-screen layouts if you’re multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBTlyj"&gt;Acer says it’s worked with developers to “optimize” the device to work with various software including Premiere Pro, After Effects, Maya, Revit, and KeyShot. You could also run games on the ConceptD, but it wouldn’t be the best choice since the screen is just 60Hz and won’t be able to display very high frame rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Umlupg"&gt;As is often the case with big workstations, the Ezel’s battery life isn’t amazing. I averaged four hours and five minutes of continuous use with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. That’s not unexpected, considering the high-resolution display and the discrete GPU, but it’s worth noting that you’ll probably need to bring the hefty brick with you if you’re taking the Ezel out and about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRo4dq"&gt;Elsewhere, the ConceptD 7 is a fine laptop to use. The keyboard is a bit flatter than I prefer but comfortable enough. The backlighting is a dark orange color (Acer calls it warm amber) that looks nice against the white deck. The touchpad is a bit small for a laptop of this size and I sometimes hit plastic while scrolling, but it is quite smooth. The chassis itself is a sturdy magnesium-aluminum alloy, and it’s covered in a nice white finish that Acer says is “highly resistant” to dirt and sun exposure. There’s a fingerprint reader built into the power button on the left side of the chassis, which works just fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84c0Vp"&gt;I enjoyed using the built-in stylus, though it’s a bit stiff to pull out of its garage and requires a substantial nail. The pen uses Wacom EMR technology, meaning it never needs to be charged; it draws its power from inside the display. I enjoyed the limited drawing I was able to do on the smooth matte display (I’m an amateur artist at best). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel seen from the front on a desk. The screen displays The Verge homepage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gk8fzhPRyhtEW668QoMSirhtNM4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22490320/akrales_20210503_4515_0189.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pen lives on the right side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f4vNtL"&gt;Acer says the ConceptD utilizes “improved psychoacoustics” to provide a better listening experience. You can swap between presets for music, voice, movies, and various types of games in the DTS:X Ultra app that comes preloaded if you have external speakers or headphones connected. If you’re using just the laptop, there are Music, Game, Movies, and Voice presets in ConceptD Palette. The dual front speakers themselves deliver not-great audio that’s quite lacking in the bass department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel with the screen floating backwards above the keyboard deck, seen from above. The screen displays several multicolored paint strokes on a black background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FhErTw7G066Eq0QtQ6jmiKintlM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22490297/akrales_20210503_4515_0103.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you want to switch to tablet mode?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="fg3Kip"&gt;The ConceptD 7 Ezel is… well, in a word, it’s awesome. But you don’t need me to tell you that you don’t need to spend $4,000 to get an awesome device. If you want a touchscreen convertible with stylus support and can live without quite this much processing power, devices like the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fmdp%2Fenvy---omen%2Fhp-spectre-x360-15-3074457345617433669--1%23%21%26tab%3Dvao&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22430445%2Facer-conceptd-7-ezel-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP Spectre x360 15&lt;/a&gt; are half the price of this device, more portable, and also have outstanding screens. The Spectre’s screen doesn’t literally fold over the keyboard, but it’ll work for many of the same use cases. And even for folks who want this particular form factor, the smaller ConceptD 3 Ezel will be a more practical purchase. The ConceptD 7 Ezel is for those who need serious power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ZV4A2H"&gt;But man, is the ConceptD 7 Ezel a great device for content creators. As a professional reviewer, I’ve used more creator-focused laptops than most people on the planet — and I’ve never used anything like this. It’s a great idea, it’s powerful, it’s well-built, and it’s a lot of fun to use. I won’t recommend that you buy it — but if you do, please know that I’m very jealous of you. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard is showing off two hours of Overwatch 2 next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2WDhZJ9ZKm0vuAhj8jPN_pdvTm4=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269895/blizzconline_toronto_03.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Ol4eQ"&gt;Blizzard has been relatively quiet of late when it comes to &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;. The developer &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/19/22291871/overwatch-2-hero-designs-widowmaker-mccree-pharah-reaper"&gt;teased some new character designs in February at Blizzcon&lt;/a&gt;, but there hasn’t been much news about the core game. It looks like that’s about to change, though: on May 20th, Blizzard will hold a two-hour-long live stream focused on the player-versus-player elements of &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s sequel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNgeEz"&gt;Blizzard says that the stream will feature “a first look at player-versus-player changes coming to &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2.&lt;/em&gt;” The stream will also include appearances by &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; game director Aaron Keller — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394116/overwatch-director-jeff-kaplan-activision-blizzard-departure"&gt;who recently took over for Jeff Kaplan&lt;/a&gt; — along with lead hero designer Geoff Goodman and associate art director Dion Rogers. “From new maps to major gameplay updates, we’re reinvigorating the core &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; experience,” Blizzard says. The stream will be broadcast on both Twitch and YouTube at 3PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaUkzX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943766/blizzard-overwatch-2-sequel-announcement-blizzcon-2019"&gt;first announced at Blizzcon 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22267131/diablo-4-overwatch-2-release-date-2022-activision-blizzard-earnings"&gt;it isn’t expected to launch until sometime after this year&lt;/a&gt;. That said, it appears that Blizzard will be more open about development moving forward. In addition to the stream, the developer will also be holding an AMA on Reddit on May 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft tries to evade scalpers by offering Xbox Series X and S to Xbox Insider members</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FEBpx8WBZlqISZgBeE277QnIio0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269824/vpavic_4275_20201030_0050.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J9RIFU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xboxinsider/status/1392168474961747973"&gt;Microsoft is introducing&lt;/a&gt; a new “Console Purchase Pilot” program that &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/comments/na2cm6/a_limited_pilot_is_available_to_xbox_insiders_to/gxr3f10/"&gt;will give selected Xbox Insider members&lt;/a&gt; the chance to register to reserve an Xbox Series X or Series S console directly from the company through their existing Xbox One consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBhVCk"&gt;The new program is only rolling out in the US for now, and even if you are given the chance to sign up, it doesn’t mean that you’ll actually be selected to buy one of the highly in-demand consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3GS7GU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today we're introducing the Console Purchase Pilot, allowing US &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XboxInsiders?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#XboxInsiders&lt;/a&gt; on Xbox One to register for a chance to reserve an Xbox Series X|S console. Check the Xbox Insider Hub on Xbox One for details. Limited space is available and not all who register will be selected. &lt;a href="https://t.co/MBkQmbSDWc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/MBkQmbSDWc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xbox Insider (@xboxinsider) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xboxinsider/status/1392168474961747973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kbpa6a"&gt;Customers will also have to use the Xbox Insider Hub app on an Xbox One console to both sign up for the Console Purchase Pilot and purchase the console itself — you won’t be able to conduct the transaction on a PC, web browser, Xbox 360, or Xbox Series X / S by design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NmY9B8"&gt;That means that the program will be intentionally targeted to dedicated Xbox fans who already own an Xbox One console and are looking to upgrade, and it could help cut down on scalpers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/8/13561008/microsoft-xbox-insider-program"&gt;Introduced in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/xbox-insider-program"&gt;the Xbox Insider program&lt;/a&gt; lets dedicated Xbox fans give direct feedback to Microsoft and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/10/16123506/microsoft-xbox-insider-program-test-preview"&gt;test future software updates and features&lt;/a&gt; ahead of broader public rollouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdym0n"&gt;And with next-gen consoles expected to be hard to find for months to come — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260564/microsoft-xbox-series-x-stock-june-supply-constraints"&gt;at its last update&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft said to expect the new Xboxes to be tough to buy until at least June — testing out new ways to directly sell consoles to fans could be the best way to make sure that more units don’t end up on the eBay aftermarket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cO1faG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer claims its new Blade 15 is the ‘thinnest’ 15-inch RTX gaming laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QUWkEMZwMgYYEpE0VDP9uFZhvL0=/0x1:3218x2146/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69267557/razerblade15advancedmid2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The starting model is roughly one millimeter thinner than the previous generation.&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2nDSFX"&gt;Razer has just announced new versions of its Blade 15 workhorse gaming laptop, complete with some of the biggest changes to the lineup in some time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yyz6e"&gt;Like many other laptops announced today, the new Blade 15 Advanced features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22187586"&gt;Intel’s 11th Gen H-series processors&lt;/a&gt; and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series graphics chips, with up to a Core i9 11900H (2.5GHz base clock, 4.9GHz boost clock), an RTX 3080 GPU with 16GB of video memory (Razer declined to share the total graphics power ahead of publishing), and a 4K touchscreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKbdjU"&gt;The most welcome improvement might be the new fingerprint-resistant coating making its way to all of these new models. I can’t imagine that it’ll eliminate fingerprints altogether, but this should address one of the biggest annoyances with the prior models. The Windows Hello webcam is getting bumped up to 1080p resolution (from 720p), and Razer claims the trackpads have improved palm rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cg1VuV"&gt;For the new design, Razer managed to shave off a little more than a millimeter from the thickness of the Blade 15 Advanced, coming in at 15.8mm thick. Razer claims that it’s the smallest 15-inch gaming laptop with RTX graphics and is 17 percent smaller by dimensions compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;MSI GS66 Stealth&lt;/a&gt;. This size reduction applies only to the starting model that has the RTX 3060, though. Thinner might sound more appealing, but it isn’t usually better for gaming performance. Nvidia allows OEMs like Razer to choose the wattage and clock speed of the GPU based on their laptop designs, and generally speaking, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;the thinner the laptop is, the worse it can be running games&lt;/a&gt; compared to thicker laptops that typically allow for bigger cooling systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTyuNS"&gt;The higher-specced options are thicker than this 15.8mm model, but that’s roughly the same thickness as the previous generation. The width and depth of these machines debuting today are also unchanged from the previous gen at 355 and 235mm (13.98 and 9.25 inches), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JSfDKqUjLcrQ5hGoJSXDlRfsIEo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504795/razerblade15advancedmid2021_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Blade 15 Advanced can be configured with an FHD, QHD, or 4K display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WHkNjI"&gt;The latest (and thinnest) Blade 15 Advanced starts at $2,299, and this model has a 240Hz QHD IPS panel with 2.5ms response time and 100 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 gamut. It has an octa-core Intel Core i7-11800H processor, the RTX 3060 GPU with 8GB of video memory, and 16GB of DDR4 RAM clocked at 3,200MHz. This thinner model has a 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD that supports PCIe 4.0 for faster read / write and transfer speeds and a 65Wh battery. All other Advanced models have a 80Wh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zyJhmY"&gt;The selection of ports across the Advanced lineup is similar but not exactly the same as the models released earlier in 2021. The most notable exceptions are the two new Thunderbolt 4 ports. In addition, you’ll find an UHS-III SD card reader, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports, a headphone jack, and an HDMI 2.1 port. Aside from that, all new Blade 15 models support Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, 20V charging via USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;

The starting model has only one M.2 slot because of its thin design, but all other new models have an additional M.2 slot for a total of up to 4TB of storage supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVwH9Q"&gt;Spending more will get you a better screen, processor, and GPU. Below you can see the specs of each option, as well as the most recent version of the prior Blade 15 Advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Afmvr9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10492453"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UuAWei"&gt;All of these new Blade 15 Advanced machines will be available for preorder starting Monday, May 17th from Razer. They’ll go on sale and ship sometime in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfWFiP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Razer’s original press release and website incorrectly listed battery capacities. The thinnest Blade 15 Advanced has a 65Wh battery, while the thicker models have a 80Wh battery. This story has been updated with the correct battery information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to choose a photo storage service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Photos on the Google Pixel" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gYXwhBgMRaP0gsWNtPB0Z6ePB8k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67778301/google_photos_vlad_savov.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q9HfSI"&gt;Last November, Google — which until now has offered unlimited storage for “high quality” (read: compressed) photos — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;announced that “unlimited” is being changed&lt;/a&gt; to “up to 15GB on your Google account.” In other words, while photo and video storage currently does not count against your total of 15 free gigs on a Google account, it will as of this coming June 1st — along with your Gmail, Google Drive files, and other stored data. Once you hit that 15GB wall, you will have to buy into the Google One service to increase your storage capacity. (Unless you own a Pixel, in which case you still have no limits on “high quality” photos.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTbl7b"&gt;If you’re a Google Photos user who finds all of this a bit irritating, you may be thinking of leaving. But first, it’s a good idea to check out your alternatives. Below are some of the main photo storage services available to you, along with their basic fees, so you can figure out whether you want to switch. (Note: We’ve only included services that are specifically geared toward photos, not more general storage services such as OneDrive or Dropbox.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chKhYl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.google.com/"&gt;Google Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vXH35MCZPB-qOWTZMXZFKj3STjc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504078/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.57.42_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Photos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qoZVjQ"&gt;Google provides each of its accounts with 15GB of free storage. However, for the last few years, photos have been treated differently: under its “high quality” plan, Google stored an unlimited number of photos for free as long as you allow them to be compressed to 16 megapixels. (According to Google, photos that size can be printed without issue up to 24 x 16 inches.) Videos were kept to a maximum of 1080p. (Data such as closed captions could be eliminated to save space.) “Original quality” photos — those that were not compressed — were not part of this unlimited plan but were counted as regular files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5YwJy"&gt;However, all of that is changing. As mentioned above, starting on June 1st, 2021, Google will be including photos in its storage calculations. Once you hit that 15GB ceiling, you will have to buy into the &lt;a href="https://one.google.com/about"&gt;Google One service&lt;/a&gt; for additional storage space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVXGQL"&gt;Google One currently starts at 100GB of storage for $1.99 a month ($19.99 a year) and proceeds to 200GB for $2.99 a month ($29.99 a year) or 2TB for $9.99 a month ($99.99 a year). The 2TB plan also comes with a VPN for Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxaryX"&gt;Before you run to invest in Google One, be aware that there are several mitigating factors Google is offering its users. When the new plan goes into effect, that is when the clock starts; photos you uploaded before then won’t count toward your 15GB limit. Also, if you’re a Pixel owner, then you can continue to upload high-quality photos without affecting your 15GB limit. (Of course, Pixel owners used to get unlimited original quality for free, rather than having to upload their photos in “high quality.” But hey, it’s something.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qTIED4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.icloud.com/photos"&gt;iCloud Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iCloud Photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OhHlPR3hHSzYXLHM4BHWLPypgyw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22045506/Screen_Shot_2020_11_16_at_9.50.00_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iCloud Photos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gIMWLM"&gt;If you’re part of Apple’s ecosystem, then you have easy access to iCloud Photos, Apple’s equivalent to Google Photos. iCloud Photos is connected to the Phone app on your Mac or iOS device as a backup for your photos. You automatically get 5GB of storage space associated with your iCloud account; after that, it costs 99 cents per month for 50GB, $2.99 per month for 200GB, and $9.99 per month for 2TB. (This is for the US; &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238"&gt;other countries have different fees&lt;/a&gt;.) Windows users can also access iCloud Photos via an &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204283"&gt;associated app&lt;/a&gt;; Android users will have to access it using a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yZr3Oh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Flickr page" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rs5L-CTH_oyitP0u2yut9q5965c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13692625/flickr_interface.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flickr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0WoADA"&gt;Flickr has a free plan as well, but it’s limited to 1,000 photos — within certain guidelines: photo files are limited to 200MB and video files to 1GB. For &lt;a href="https://help.flickr.com/pricing-faq-r1qHsTEbU"&gt;unlimited storage without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you pay either $6.99 a month or $59.99 annually (plus tax). Other advantages to a paid annual membership include stats about which of your photos are trending and a variety of discounts from several companies, including Adobe and SmugMug (which is now part of Flickr). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BrJgci"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smugmug.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21561171%2Fphoto-storage-service-google-amazon-flickr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SmugMug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Smugmug" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8w07DX4OmmluqYJWke4hyZfYgMg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22032766/smugmug.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: SmugMug&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SmugMug&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mH6JCv"&gt;Speaking of SmugMug, this long-lasting service is also available, offering storage, portfolios, and sales opportunities for professionals. For $55 a year or $7 a month, you get unlimited uploads and a customizable website. The Power plan ($85 a year or $11 monthly) adds site customization and your own domain name. If you’re looking to be a professional photographer, the Portfolio plan adds e-commerce features for $200 a year or $27 a month (you keep 85 percent of the markup). And finally, the Pro plan lets you create events, price lists, and branded orders, among other features, for $360 a year or $42 a month. If you’re interested in trying it out, you can get a two-week trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m3pftc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://500px.com/"&gt;500px&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="500px" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OvSPHukZyZ_L03o3HavAkQfYvd8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22045546/500px_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: 500px&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;500px&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YKFo5I"&gt;Canadian company 500px is actually more for professional photographers than your average snap-and-save picture taker. It offers pros a place to store, exhibit, and license their work. So if you have ambitions to start peddling your photos, 500px may be worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oJbxb"&gt;The site offers two paid plans. The first, modestly named Awesome, offers unlimited uploads, priority support, no ads, a history of “liked” photos, gallery slideshows, and a profile badge for $59.88 a year or $4.99 monthly. The Pro plan adds a way to display your services and organization tools for $119.88 a year or $9.99 monthly. (You get a discount on your first year: Awesome costs $47.88 a year or $3.99 monthly, while Pro goes for $71.88 a year or $5.99 monthly.) And if you want to make a bit of money, you can submit your photos to be licensed for stock usage through 500px. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67i7IV"&gt;There is a free ad-supported plan that gives you seven uploads a week. When you sign up, you can try out the Pro plan for two weeks before committing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZgbkNT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://app.photobucket.com/explore"&gt;Photobucket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Photobucket" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wRnWvdW4CSwYhI3v_juEr5ai-1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504081/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_10.54.08_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photobucket&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fui9Kk"&gt;Photobucket offers a limited free plan, allowing you to upload up to 250 photos for free — more a trial plan than anything else. If you like what you see, you can start with the Beginner plan at $5.99 per month or $64.68 annually, which gives you 25GB of storage, along with no ads, password-protected album sharing, and an image editor. For $7.99 per month or $86.28 annually, the Intermediate plan provides 250GB of storage and unlimited image hosting. Finally, for $12.99 per month or $140.28 annually, the Expert plan offers unlimited storage and no image compression, among other extras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1bm9gL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.deviantart.com/"&gt;DeviantArt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="DeviantArt" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CgcJg8R-ExLnrm10unHvuB1l4Pc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504090/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_10.57.24_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DeviantArt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z7uIFC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.deviantart.com/"&gt;DeviantArt&lt;/a&gt; calls itself “the world’s largest art community” with a social network for visual artists of all kinds. It offers visitors a wide range of artist galleries to view, divided into categories such as traditional, animation, and illustrations. DeviantArt (or DA for short) even has its own publishing platform called Sta.sh — emphasizing the fact that this site, like 500px, is less for simple storage and more for showing (and selling) your art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YBRVT"&gt;With a free membership in DeviantArt, there are no restrictions on how much you upload for public access, and you get admission to DA’s community of artists and art lovers. &lt;a href="https://www.deviantart.com/core-membership/"&gt;Core Members enjoy additional perks&lt;/a&gt;. For $3.95 a month or $39.95 a year, you get to sell your art with no service fee (but a 20 percent fee on Premium Gallery &amp;amp; Premium download sales) and a $100 max price per digital item, along with 20GB of private storage space in Sta.sh. For $7.95 a month or $79.95 a year, you can charge up to $1,000 per item and pay a 12 percent fee on Premium Gallery &amp;amp; Premium download sales, along with 30GB of private storage. Finally, $14.95 a month or $149.95 a year lets you charge up to $10,000 per item, lowers your fee to 10 percent fee per sale, and gets you 50GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iBQOi3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/photos/storage"&gt;Amazon Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon Photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uyGvuT12uD0xtAZPBYAG3hjy6Tw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504092/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_10.58.40_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Photos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FRZOow"&gt;Amazon provides its Prime members with a grab bag of extras along with the free shipping. In addition to the video offerings, music streaming, and other goodies, you get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/photos"&gt;unlimited photo storage&lt;/a&gt; for $119 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FzQzPt"&gt;A nice perk is that you can share that unlimited storage with five friends or family members in what is called the Family Vault. Everything there is accessible to everyone who shares the Vault. “Unlimited,” by the way, does not include videos or other files; for those, Prime members get 5GB of storage, and after that, there is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/photos/storage/plans"&gt;a long list of storage plans&lt;/a&gt; available starting from $1.99 a month for 100GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZJVY1"&gt;That’s something to keep in mind if you drop your Prime membership. In that case, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=201480950"&gt;according to the Amazon instructions&lt;/a&gt;, “the unlimited photo storage benefits associated with the membership end. All uploaded photos count toward your Amazon Drive storage limit.” The total storage for non-Prime members (stills and video) is 5GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqq6cZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 12th, 4:55PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to include SmugMug and to explain that it only covers photo-specific services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rH9748"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 16th, 10:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add iCloud Photos and to update the prices and screenshot for 500px.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5C1A3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 11th, 2021, 1:10PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Several prices and screenshots updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose gets into hearing aid business with new FDA-cleared SoundControl hearing aids</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A pair of hands holding a small case with Bose hearing aids inside." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UnGkLyzIMH-_r7YioI72PC9ToLM=/0x29:823x578/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269707/Screen_Shot_2021_05_11_at_12.10.55_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose SoundControl hearing aids.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bose&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9iQt2Q"&gt;Bose &lt;a href="https://globalpressroom.bose.com/us-en/pressrelease/view/2111"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it will begin selling direct-to-consumer SoundControl hearing aids for adults with mild to moderate hearing loss on May 18th. They’ll cost $849.95 and will be sold directly by Bose in five states — Massachusetts, Montana, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas — before they’re available nationally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETt8mA"&gt;The hearing aids are meant to be fit and controlled by the wearer without needing to see an audiologist for a hearing test and professional fitting. They use standard hearing aid batteries that Bose says will last up to four days if used 14 hours a day. Volume, treble and bass, and modes for different listening environments can be adjusted and preset in the Bose Hear app on iOS or Android. There’s a “Focus” feature with different settings, including a “Front” setting for filtering noise in busy rooms and an “Everywhere” setting that allows all sounds during walks outside or around the house.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A smartphone propped next to the Bose hearing aids. On the phone’s screen is a page that shows scrolling sliders for adjusting World Volume on the left and Treble and Bass on the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q1LGnsuVEBNJ3Gavak5U-dNnN-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22506841/Bose_SoundControl__Hearing_Aids_with_Bose_Hear_App_2111_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bose&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Volume and bass / treble adjustment in the Bose Hear app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="p5vU5K"&gt;“In the United States alone, approximately 48 million people suffer from some degree of hearing loss that interferes with their life. But the cost and complexity of treatment have become major barriers to getting help,” said Brian Maguire, category director of Bose Hear, in the press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mz84yt"&gt;Prescription hearing aids can cost several thousand dollars and are rarely fully covered by insurance. Less costly personal sound amplification products (PSAPs) are sold in stores, but they aren’t as effective or adjustable as hearing aids and aren’t regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. The SoundControl hearing aids are the first to be authorized by the FDA for use without assistance from a health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1F0rb"&gt;An older design for Bose hearing aids with “self-fitting technology” was &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-allows-marketing-first-self-fitting-hearing-aid-controlled-user"&gt;cleared by the FDA&lt;/a&gt; through De Novo classification in 2018, meaning it’s a low-risk product, and there are no direct-to-consumer devices like it on the market. That design had a neckband and a rechargeable battery like &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.bose.com/en_us/support/products/bose_wellness_support/hearphones.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose’s Hearphones&lt;/a&gt;, a hearing amplifier that was &lt;a href="https://www.seniorliving.org/hearing-aids/bose/"&gt;discontinued last year&lt;/a&gt;. The new design looks more like traditional hearing aids, with a receiver behind the ear and a small tip that sits in the ear canal, and was &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K211008"&gt;cleared by the FDA&lt;/a&gt; last week based on substantial equivalence to the 2018 De Novo authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
