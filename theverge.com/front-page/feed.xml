    <title>Digit is now offering a bank account with its automatic savings features built in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pMTR3nwSdO1DmE8sCtQx2f4IVY=/1x0:3216x2143/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69454047/d2_press_shot.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4wqOdl"&gt;Digit is building on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/19/8064431/digit-is-the-automated-savings-plan-we-ve-been-waiting-for"&gt;automated savings know-how&lt;/a&gt; with a new $9.99 per month banking feature called Direct that will launch later this year. With the new service, you’ll have access to “spending” and “bills” accounts, a debit card (with access to ATMs), and all of the usual &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgnZWQ5pfxAhXvHzQIHRh3AMcQFjALegQIAhAE&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2019%2F11%2F1%2F20943665%2Fdigit-savings-student-loan-crisis-college-debt&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2v87rZVowQqtZI2oX2gtHy"&gt;AI-enabled savings tools&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgnZWQ5pfxAhXvHzQIHRh3AMcQFjAKegQIBRAE&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2018%2F4%2F25%2F17279682%2Fdigit-app-money-management-credit-card-debt&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1_xq4G30pt_-_vLV0kOT47"&gt;Digit’s gained over the years&lt;/a&gt;, but with no waiting for bank transfers and theoretically even easier saving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esLFoe"&gt;Along with the banking basics offered by Digit’s partner for the service, MetaBank, Digit Direct includes a redesign of the Digit app. Digit’s original app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538137/budget-apps-mint-buxfer-ynab-google-sheets"&gt;put savings goals front and center&lt;/a&gt;. Goals are still part of Digit in Direct, but the emphasis now is on the two new accounts the service adds to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aIMr2Yvf-kgD1QR52PqZtdeQHm4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658308/Direct.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Digit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Digit app with a focus on spending, bills, and goals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WQcpMy"&gt;At the top is Spending, which is essentially the checking account portion of Direct. The app will display how much money you have freely available, and it includes menus where you can manage your Digit Direct debit card, see transactions, and track the money Digit intelligently moves between your various other Digit accounts. The debit card works like any other card sporting a chip, and Digit says it’s supported at 55,000 fee-free ATMs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8vwpsx_uysZ9xeEfJSRIpY8HAr4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658338/Bills_Digit_Direct.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Digit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digit Direct features a separate bills account for recurring charges. You can also send checks, if required.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A5ateE"&gt;Below spending is bills, which is a separate account, hopefully protecting that money from being spent on things it’s not set aside for. The bills section is for upcoming payments, like subscriptions, rent, utilities, and other recurring charges. For Direct to work as intended, you’ll have to switch the payment information for your various recurring charges to your new bills account. Note that for now, the bills section can only automatically save for and track monthly charges. Digit says yearly recurring charges are on the roadmap for 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eqCHwvbZXvhdubT3nVvKRNJGiiQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658347/Digit_direct_savings.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Digit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can set individual savings goals in the new Digit app and track how the service moves money around after each deposit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yc0lzg"&gt;The final section is savings, or the savings account portion of Direct. It works similarly to how goals did in the original Digit. You can set a goal with a specific date and dollar amount, and Digit will analyze your spending and periodically squirrel away money it determines you won’t need right away. For a more detailed savings history, you can tap in to each goal and see how Digit has moved money in to it over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4CuWU"&gt;I’ve been using the beta version of Direct for the last few weeks, and as a sort of set-it-and-forget-it service, I’ve mostly not thought about it since I signed up — which is honestly great. Digit CEO Ethan Bloch says that from its inception, the ideal version of Digit was a sort of science fiction smart assistant for finances. I would not say Direct is there yet, but even in its beta form, it does put a lot of the trickier parts of managing money on autopilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61Amng"&gt;The timing could not be better. Simple, the online bank that I think best threaded the needle between being easy to use and actually having features that helped me save money on a set schedule, was &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiMiKWB6JfxAhXUPH0KHa4eB0kQFjAAegQIBBAD&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F7%2F22219271%2Fsimple-bank-online-shutting-down-pnc-bbva&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2_S2FUPQz-BIvT4zUQGC-3"&gt;recently shut down&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, customers were &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiMiKWB6JfxAhXUPH0KHa4eB0kQFjAJegQIBRAD&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F9%2F22427811%2Fsimple-bbva-transition-errors-bank-shutdown&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1i4q7-UUwNE0Teg_CX5Db4"&gt;transferred to its parent company BBVA&lt;/a&gt;, which is fine, but not nearly as user-friendly or mobile-first as Simple was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yb6vqV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Digit’s smarts come with a cost&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9okn99"&gt;Direct is in many ways poised to fill that gap, though other companies certainly match some — if not all — of what Simple had. Chime has a nice app and an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chime.com%2Fautomatic-savings%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F15%2F22533664%2Fdigit-automatic-savings-online-bank-ai-subscription" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;optional savings account&lt;/a&gt; that can round up purchases and automatically save the difference. One (yes it’s a bank just called One) has &lt;a href="https://www.onefinance.com/pockets/"&gt;a feature called Pockets&lt;/a&gt; that’s similar to Simple’s automatic savings goals, setting aside money for long-term payments. Both are free while Direct carries a monthly fee which, depending on what you’re looking for, might be a barrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5Obak"&gt;For anyone already paying for the regular Digit $5-per-month subscription, the Direct monthly fee isn’t a huge increase, but it does illustrate some of the tension between whom Direct seems able to help and whom it might currently be best for. Living paycheck to paycheck while working retail, having something that automatically set aside money for my rent and utilities was a lifesaver. The main reason I joined Simple was that in addition to being free, it was an actual bank from which I could order a checkbook. Digit’s Direct seems equally capable (with different access to checks), but again, the cost is worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5JH7w"&gt;Direct obviously brings smarts into the equation, so the real question becomes how much you value what Digit’s able to intelligently do with your money. You’ll be able to see for yourself when Direct launches this fall, with a 30-day trial and then $9.99 per month or $95-a-year subscription. &lt;a href="https://waitlist.digit.co/"&gt;You can join the waitlist&lt;/a&gt; to get early access to Direct starting today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Level’s new smart door lock is a little simpler and a little less expensive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ayKoJMDoofsjLrwfbbtC8wDKNsk=/0x2:7706x5139/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69454074/Copy_of_Level_Lock_iPhone.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Level Lock looks like a standard deadbolt from the outside&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Level&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U7jUHy"&gt;Smart lock company Level is announcing a new model in its lineup today, simply named the Level Lock. The new Level Lock is very similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21400301/level-touch-smart-lock-price-design-features"&gt;model introduced last year&lt;/a&gt; (now known as the Level Lock Touch) but without the touch controls. It sits in the middle of Level’s lineup and is available starting today in matte black, satin nickel, satin chrome, or polished brass for $249.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHQ9XD"&gt;Like the $329 Level Lock Touch, the Level Lock uses the core technology that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304792/level-lock-smart-homekit-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;first debuted in the Level Bolt&lt;/a&gt; to completely hide all of the smart lock’s electronics and battery in the bolt of the lock itself. This allows the design of the lock to be very discreet and modern — you wouldn’t know it’s a smart lock just by looking at it. Level says the single CR2 battery in the bolt can power the lock for up to a year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QbotcJLHlnFAD3hv6uUfSzLyfIs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659082/Copy_of_Level_Lock_4_part.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Level&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Level Lock’s smarts, battery, and motor are hidden entirely in the body and bolt of the lock itself, so there’s no attachment on the outside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="guCrKn"&gt;Starting today, all of Level’s locks are now certified with the Works with Alexa program, so you can use Amazon Alexa to control them. They also work with Amazon’s Sidewalk network, as well as Apple’s HomeKit platform for control outside of the home. You can also control the lock with the Level smartphone app or a standard key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNr1oM"&gt;There are many smart locks available, and few are as expensive as Level’s options. But all of them require large keypads, battery packs, or other obvious fixtures on the door that give away their smarts. For those that want a smart lock, but don’t want to advertise the fact, Level’s locks are the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TijN8U"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia won’t explain the mysterious absence of its RTX 3070 Ti GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/isU4j_t17t1XEQjcZBkjqYmVeqg=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69453952/twarren_20210607_4625_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8sCD7K"&gt;Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition card went on sale last week, but buyers looking for the $599 GPU have found it impossible to find. While we’re used to seeing extremely &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;low stock of new GPUs&lt;/a&gt;, none of Nvidia’s own RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition models appear to have gone on sale in the US or UK — and Nvidia won’t say why not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V9cwKE"&gt;Nvidia has partnered with Scan Computers in the UK to sell its Founders Edition cards, and with Best Buy in the US. While Scan had a reasonable amount of stock of the RTX 3080 Ti earlier this month, the RTX 3070 Ti was non-existent. Scan has not responded to a request for comment by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and the company has been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ScanComputers/status/1403273973371125766"&gt;telling people on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that “all Founders Edition cards are released direct through the Nvidia website.” But that website never included a link to a Scan listing of the RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="670Y9d"&gt;It’s a similar situation in the US. While Best Buy made a big deal about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465116/best-buy-stores-nvidia-rtx-3080-ti-founders-edition-thursday-line-up"&gt;RTX 3080 Ti being available in 81 stores&lt;/a&gt;, the RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition was online-only. Those hoping to purchase the RTX 3070 Ti were &lt;a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/graphics-cards/133877/instantly-out-of-stock-best-buys-online-sale-for-nvidias-rtx-3070-ti-disappoints"&gt;met with disappointment&lt;/a&gt; when the card instantly went out of stock. Unsurprisingly, Best Buy has also not responded to comment about the situation, and it’s not clear if the company ever actually sold any RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition cards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pkNoBZQbnVFI2v96kXtxvJQ9Lds=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645496/twarren_20210607_4625_0010.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition is impossible to find.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8uCx1C"&gt;The lack of RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition cards is also best illustrated at eBay. I’ve only managed to find &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F224496739605&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F15%2F22534601%2Fnvidia-rtx-3070-ti-founders-edition-sales" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two sellers&lt;/a&gt; that have &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F384218798437&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F15%2F22534601%2Fnvidia-rtx-3070-ti-founders-edition-sales" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;listed&lt;/a&gt; Nvidia’s own cards over the past week in the US, with none in the UK. That’s incredibly unusual, as all previous RTX cards immediately get listed by scalpers looking to make a profit on order confirmation emails before cards are shipped a couple of days later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHE5eE"&gt;In comparison, there’s a flood of RTX 3080 Ti cards available on eBay, and listings appeared within minutes of the cards going on sale earlier this month. I’ve personally been tracking GPU sales for months, and I never saw the RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition card appear on sale at Scan in the UK. I’ve successfully managed to purchase Founders Edition versions of the RTX 3090 and RTX 3080 Ti at launch previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xjuXGV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti review: a loss to AMD","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22524897/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-ti-review-test-benchmarks"},{"title":"Nvidia’s RTX 3080 Ti will be available at 81 Best Buy stores on Thursday","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465116/best-buy-stores-nvidia-rtx-3080-ti-founders-edition-thursday-line-up"},{"title":"Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti review: more 4K for more of your wallet","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22463608/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-review-test-benchmarks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wOEmbZ"&gt;Nvidia has been doing a better job at getting stock of its cards out recently, so it’s surprising to see that the RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition is nearly impossible to find. Alongside the RTX 3080 Ti launch, Nvidia released a new batch of RTX 3080 cards and a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleague in the UK was also able to purchase one. Nvidia has not responded to requests for comment on the situation with the RTX 3070 Ti, but some third-party cards do appear to have gone on sale in limited quantities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbnoE6"&gt;It’s possible that the lack of Nvidia’s own cards is related to some early driver issues. During my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22524897/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-ti-review-test-benchmarks"&gt;review of the RTX 3070 Ti&lt;/a&gt; I noticed some strange performance drops during &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;, and Nvidia subsequently confirmed it was investigating the issue. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/rtx-3070-ti-review-nvidia-has-flipped-its-turn-signal-out-of-the-gpu-fast-lane/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica &lt;/em&gt;also reported&lt;/a&gt; seeing “bizarre RTX 3070 Ti behavior,” with performance dropping below RTX 3070 levels and then returning. &lt;em&gt;Ars&lt;/em&gt; says it can no longer replicate the “initial weird performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCRC8M"&gt;Either way, we’re still waiting on Nvidia to say exactly what’s going on here. In a period when it’s extremely difficult to buy a new GPU, a paper launch is the last thing anyone wants to see.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This simple dock turns your Apple Watch into a bedside orb</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DouBt1NpuEalMEFtk6e5MK_bSnw=/0x0:1094x729/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69453818/bedroom_black_watch_1296x.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slot in your Apple Watch, and the NightWatch magnifies its screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NightWatch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DvbADM"&gt;Have you ever tried using your Apple Watch as a bedside clock, but given up because the screen is just &lt;em&gt;too dang small?&lt;/em&gt; Well, boy do we have a $49.99 dock for you. The &lt;a href="https://nightwatch.shop/"&gt;NightWatch&lt;/a&gt; is combination charging dock, magnifying glass, and acoustic amplifier, bringing together these functions to turn the Apple Watch’s nightstand mode into a bona fide bedside alarm, complete with a tap-to-wake feature to show you the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i35Y4q"&gt;We’ve previously covered novelty docks that turn the Apple Watch into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14257268/apple-watch-elago-w3-stand-macintosh-smartwatch"&gt;miniature Macintosh replica&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20701999/apple-watch-elago-w6-stand-classic-ipod-smartwatch"&gt;an iPod&lt;/a&gt;. But the NightWatch attempts to make the Apple Watch work &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; in nightstand mode, by making its screen bigger and easier to read and using “integrated sound channels’ to amplify the sound of your alarm. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x5jO8yziUObZDaof3uw_LfHMYMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659578/test_lighting_03_1080x.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NightWatch&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You slot in your existing charging puck behind the watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dbI95e"&gt;It’s a pretty simple accessory, all told, and basically consists of a single block of polished lucite. That means it doesn’t come with its own charger, so you’ll have to slot in your existing charging puck, and the advertised “tap display” seems to just be relying on the fact that the Apple Watch’s screen will light up at the slightest nudge. “Even nudging or tapping the table might work,” the NightWatch’s &lt;a href="https://nightwatch.shop/pages/support-1"&gt;support page says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i27rZO"&gt;The NightWatch’s launch comes at a potentially awkward time. Last year Apple added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;new sleep tracking feature to the Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, which means many people now sleep with their watches on their wrists rather than on their nightstand. But if you’re not interested in tracking your sleep data, the NightWatch supports all Apple Watches, is available for pre-order now &lt;a href="https://nightwatch.shop/"&gt;over on its website&lt;/a&gt;, and will be coming to Amazon next week. Shipping is due later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon brings its cashierless tech to a full-size grocery store for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h9d5TOB1dq6jTtbgtEQaNH6uQ3A=/0x0:7800x5200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69453690/Factoria_JWO_Exit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c56uEo"&gt;Amazon’s cashierless Just Walk Out technology is coming to a full-size grocery store for the first time, the &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-fresh-grocery-store-meet-just-walk-out-shopping"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The new 25,000 square foot Amazon Fresh store is significantly bigger than the 10,400 square foot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21151021/amazon-go-grocery-store-expansion-open-seattle-cashier-less"&gt;Amazon Go Grocery store it opened last year&lt;/a&gt;, or its standard 1,200 and 2,300 square feet Go stores, marking a minor milestone as Amazon scales up its technology. The new store will be Amazon’s fourteenth Fresh location in the US when it opens on June 17th in Bellevue, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2UAzN"&gt;When Amazon previously opened a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403786/amazon-fresh-woodland-hills-los-angeles-california-dash-cart-grocery-store"&gt;35,000 square foot Amazon Fresh store last year&lt;/a&gt; using its high-tech Dash Carts, it prompted speculation that the company’s Just Walk Out technology wasn’t suitable for larger stores. But Amazon has always maintained that Just Walk Out, which uses a series of overhead cameras and pressure sensitive shelves to automatically detect what shoppers put in their carts, can scale up to stores of any size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rkVG7Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new store is 25,000 square feet in size&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ijnarl"&gt;“Bringing Just Walk Out technology to a full-size grocery space with the Amazon Fresh store in Bellevue showcases the technology’s continued ability to scale and adapt to new environments and selection” said Amazon’s vice president of Physical Retail and Technology, Dilip Kumar. “I’m thrilled it’ll help even more customers enjoy an easier and faster way to shop and can’t wait to get their feedback on this latest Just Walk Out offering.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48AP7G"&gt;Amazon says that when customers arrive at the new store in Bellevue, Washington, they’ll be prompted to pick a checkout option, and that traditional checkouts will still be available for customers that want them. If they decide to use Just Walk Out, they can enter the store by scanning a QR code in the Amazon app, inserting a linked credit or debit card, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496673/amazon-one-palm-reading-vein-recognition-payments-identity-verification"&gt;scanning their palm&lt;/a&gt;. Once they leave the store, they’re automatically billed for the items in their virtual cart, and a receipt is sent digitally to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YllMu5"&gt;The new store uses of Just Walk Out, but it won’t feature the high-tech Dash shopping carts Amazon debuted in its first Fresh grocery store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403786/amazon-fresh-woodland-hills-los-angeles-california-dash-cart-grocery-store"&gt;last August&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon declined to say whether it would be bringing Just Walk Out tech to its pre-existing Amazon Fresh stores in the US. Meanwhile in the UK, the technology appears in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22312970/amazon-fresh-cashier-less-store-uk-go-grocery-london"&gt;Fresh-branded locations&lt;/a&gt; that are similar in size to Amazon’s Go stores in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZZwan"&gt;In addition to Amazon’s own stores, the company also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171230/amazon-just-walk-out-technology-cashierless-go-stores-third-party-retailers"&gt;provides Just Walk Out to third-party retailers&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon says Hudson markets, OTG CIBO Express, and Delaware North are three external retailers that have started to roll out the technology at various locations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is producing a ‘fictionalized’ series about Spotify</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rbeQxcrHp_npDQD_jtzhHke2x3k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69452571/akrales_190522_3442_0053.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2TiwRf"&gt;Netflix has tapped the original story of one of the music industry’s biggest startup successes for a forthcoming untitled original series. The series will tell a “fictionalized account” of Spotify’s co-founders, including the service’s chief Daniel Ek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2iqF7"&gt;The six-part series — which is already &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81186296"&gt;listed on Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, though with limited information — will pull from authors Jonas Leijonhufvud and Sven Carlsson, which documents the rise of Spotify under Ek and his business partner Martin Lorentzon, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/streaming/global/netflix-spotify-drama-cast-1234995731/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The book is &lt;a href="https://bonnierrights.se/work/spotify-untold/"&gt;said to have drawn&lt;/a&gt; from “over seventy interviews, along with previously untapped sources” for a “David vs Goliath story about how strong convictions, unrelenting willpower, and big dreams can help small players take on the titans of tech.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hyVncY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The six-part series will pull from the 2019 non-fiction book &lt;em&gt;Spotify Untold&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VIIMRO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; reports that the show has cast Swedish actors Edvin Endre in the role of Ek and Christian Hillborg as a fictionalized Lorentzon character. It’s unclear whether a Steve Jobs-like figure will appear in the film, though it’s certainly possible. &lt;em&gt;Spotify Untold&lt;/em&gt; does cover the seemingly never-ending battle between Spotify and Apple, and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/music/news/spotify-book-authors-interview-daniel-ek-steve-jobs-1203277715/"&gt;Jobs does feature&lt;/a&gt; in the book’s narrative about Apple’s push-back against Spotify’s launch in the US. As the authors themselves hold that their Jobs intel was central to the book’s narrative, it would be a shame to leave that thread out of the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22TDFr"&gt;Netflix declined to confirm to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; whether a Jobs character would appear in the series. But speaking about the book in 2019, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/music/news/spotify-book-authors-interview-daniel-ek-steve-jobs-1203277715/"&gt;Carlsson told &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “we both felt a rush of adrenaline when we unraveled the details about the conflict between Apple and Spotify. After several months of research, we could finally account for how Jobs actively worked to oppose Spotify’s establishment in the U.S., and what he may have been thinking. It gave the story an edge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjJCQp"&gt;Plus, nothing spells drama like one tech titan producing a “fictionalized” series about the messy origin story of another. Show us fake Jobs, already, Netflix!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0OX1O"&gt;The show will arrive on Netflix in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch E3 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oa1-khhYmtqlpCAP5VnzRqPRboc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69386792/acastro_180604_1777_E3_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VC1JN5"&gt;E3 2021 is nearly over — there’s just one more full day left. The show has delivered some big announcements so far, including a trailer and release date for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22307059/elden-ring-george-rr-martin-fromsoftware-e3-2021-trailer-gameplay"&gt;highly-anticipated &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22531110/ubisoft-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-game-trailer-e3-2021"&gt;a trailer for Ubisoft’s gorgeous &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release"&gt;a release date for Microsoft and Bethesda’s &lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22532295/final-fantasy-origins-square-enix-team-ninja-trailer-e3-2021"&gt;the reveal of a chaos-filled and action-heavy &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; spinoff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fqabr"&gt;But on Tuesday, there’s still one more potentially huge event on the calendar: a Nintendo Direct with “roughly 40 minutes” of information about upcoming Nintendo Switch games. (Fingers crossed for news on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18661533/nintendo-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-sequel-e3-2019"&gt;the sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) And there are also shows from Bandai Namco (the publisher of &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;, I should add) and GameSpot to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer is releasing its Project Hazel mask in limited drops in the fourth quarter of this year </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DRvVk8ZcmrpnInBPxgMhclZb8fE=/198x185:1277x904/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69452440/razer_project_hazel_gallery_007.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TeJ01v"&gt;Razer had a few announcements timed for E3 2021, including its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22297493"&gt;Razer Blade 14 with AMD’s Ryzen 9 processors&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22288350"&gt;updated Raptor 27 gaming monitor along with a 130W GaN charger&lt;/a&gt;. We weren’t expecting to hear about anything else, but Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan announced that its Project Hazel mask will actually go on sale, starting early in the fourth quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9BBqv"&gt;Tan said that Hazel will be released in “drops” exclusively on its website, with the first coming in that fourth quarter timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zq1ZIBm1KtGCkma7XA5YLhDVVWU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658997/image.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A slide from Razer’s E3 2021 presentation announcing the launch plan. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eN9fKL"&gt;Alongside that availability announcement, Tan also shared some changes coming to the mask since it was first shown &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;. Razer is planning to keep the mask’s transparent design to make it easier to see the wearer’s mouth, but the company will also be adding interior lighting and anti-fog coating on the inside of the mask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dqb4tA"&gt;If you want to see what Project Hazel looks like on your face, Razer has &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/ar/465912324600616/"&gt;an Instagram filter&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Razer/status/1385971794226520068"&gt;lets you try it on via augmented reality&lt;/a&gt;. (I should note that for some reason, it doesn’t work for me on my iPhone 12 mini.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5VlFch"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We know you’ve been waiting for the Project Hazel smart mask to become a reality – we’re working on it and there’ll be news soon! Meantime, we’ve made our Project Hazel smart mask available as an Instagram AR Filter. Check out how it looks like on you: &lt;a href="https://t.co/jGFjDnZHDU"&gt;https://t.co/jGFjDnZHDU&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/j8bo5twjYU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/j8bo5twjYU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— R Λ Z Ξ R (@Razer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Razer/status/1385971794226520068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Razer’s updated Raptor 27 is a faster 165Hz monitor, now with optional VESA</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Raptor 27 gaming monitor" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T0RJl8DCBo7fkiBZ4p48zacJDtI=/0x0:2824x1883/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69452284/raptor27_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Raptor 27 looks the same as the previous model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="csB5o1"&gt;Razer has refreshed its minimalist Raptor 27 gaming monitor with &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/free-sync"&gt;FreeSync Premium&lt;/a&gt; support with low frame rate compensation for smoother gameplay; a slightly faster 165Hz refresh rate (the previous model topped out at 144Hz); and THX certification claiming to deliver great color, tone, and image accuracy. Like the 2019 version, this one has Nvidia G-Sync compatibility, and its matte 27-inch QHD IPS panel covers 95 percent of the DCI-P3 color space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0owe3d"&gt;This monitor will cost $799.99 when it releases in Q3 2021, which is $100 more than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18168800/razer-raptor-gaming-monitor-blade-advanced-nvidia-rtx-price-ces-2019"&gt;previous version&lt;/a&gt;. The improvements make it at least worth considering if you want to game on PC with enhanced variable refresh rate tech. That, and Razer’s Raptor 27 is tough to beat when it comes to design, with its sturdy aluminum base that lets the monitor flip 90 degrees for easy cable management. It’s undoubtedly a high price to pay, though, when some 4K gaming monitors cost just a little more. For $899, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22216979/acer-gaming-monitors-nitro-predator-xv28-xb27-xb32-ces-2021-may-price-specs-hdmi-21"&gt;Acer’s Nitro XV28&lt;/a&gt; has a 28-inch 4K IPS screen with HDMI 2.1 ports that support up to fast 120Hz refresh rate gaming on PC or the PS5 and Xbox Series X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HMKPP"&gt;Razer now offers a VESA adapter for this Raptor 27 and the previous model. If you want to abandon the base that comes with the monitor, this adapter (also releasing in Q3 2021) costs $100 and will let you mount the Raptor 27 to a monitor arm or some other VESA base that you might prefer. This would have been a pretty appealing accessory to include with the refreshed monitor, particularly given that the new monitor &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; costs $100 more, but alas. There’s a good chance you might want to use the standard Chroma LED-lined base anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Raptor 27" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5UJLahf3-9FdwqzT6PdLQdW1lvw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646033/raptor27_vesamount.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The optional VESA adapter will let you mount the Raptor 27 to a monitor arm or a different stand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fx0ZEq"&gt;Outside of the tweaks I mentioned earlier, not much else is different here. The ports haven’t changed with this update. It still comes with an HDMI 2.0b port, a DisplayPort v1.4 port, a USB-C port with DisplayPort support, two USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 1 passthrough ports, and a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer GaN charger" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/749QHsJoBa4lMIJ2SdHDmb7sljU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646040/razergan.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charge up to four devices at once, with 130W of power to split.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1OYLjL"&gt;Razer has another E3 announcement, but it has little to do with gaming: it’s a $179.99 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/30/18203879/gan-chargers-anker-powerport-atom-pd-1-ravpower-45w"&gt;GaN charger&lt;/a&gt; that can supply up to 130W of total power. It’s worth noting that its two USB-C ports support up to 100W (not 130W as the name might seem to suggest), and the two USB Type-A ports can pull 18W each. If you have multiple devices plugged in at once, it’ll share the wattage between them, totaling up to 130W. The charger comes with some global adapters included, so it might be a good option for traveling, depending on where you’re going. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bexVPR"&gt;Razer’s GaN charger isn’t the only 100W option on the market. There’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21311978/hyper-hyperjuice-charger-available-price-kickstarter-specs"&gt;HyperJuice’s similar-looking $100 charger&lt;/a&gt;, for one, and that company also made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21492491/hyperjuice-stackable-gan-charger-100-watts-kickstarter-available-now-pricing-release-date"&gt;these inventive 65W and 100W GaN chargers&lt;/a&gt; that can be stacked for more power and more ports. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a faster USB-C charger than 100W, but that could change in the future, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/5/25/22453936/usb-c-power-delivery-extended-power-range-epr"&gt;the new USB-C Release 2.1 spec supports up to 240W charging&lt;/a&gt;. Though, in the meantime, it won’t take much effort to find a more affordable GaN charger than Razer’s.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Blade 14 is the first Blade laptop with AMD Ryzen processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user uses the Razer Blade 14 on a laptop stand connected to an external mechanical keyboard and monitor. The monitor screen displays a game; the laptop screen displays a Razer logo on a red, black, and green background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1iiLqMLHuM8qPhAzCMO3_-g-_ws=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69452290/Razer_Blade_14__2021__Gaming___3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Razer Blade 14.&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DwsSSQ"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_rogame/status/1374818024683941891"&gt;months&lt;/a&gt; of rumors and speculation, many gamers’ dreams have finally come true. Today, Razer has announced the new Razer Blade 14, which is powered by AMD’s flagship Ryzen 9 5900HX. It’s the first Razer Blade to include an AMD processor, and it’s available for purchase now on Razer’s website starting at $1,799.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vBIbHS"&gt;The 14-inch gaming rig will also feature up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU and a QHD 165Hz display as well as an FHD 144Hz option. Razer says the Blade will be the smallest 14-inch gaming laptop on the market, with dimensions of 12.59 x 8.66 x 0.66 inches. There’s also a 720p webcam (which isn’t a given on gaming laptops these days).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHjZNa"&gt;The rest of the laptop looks like a fairly standard Razer Blade, including the signature per-key RGB keyboard and the triple-headed snake logo on the lid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An over-the-shoulder shot of a user typing on the Razer Blade 14. The screen displays the Razer logo on a red, green, and black background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4WrA-1ysW-5u9lfJbe8tDTcFC24=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658030/Razer_Blade_14__2021__Studio_1___Alt.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check those keys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NOeqoS"&gt;“As gamers demand lighter and more powerful form factors in gaming laptops, we have remained committed to our goal of delivering best-in-class mobile processors for premium OEM designs,” said Saeid Moshkelani, SVP and GM of AMD’s client business unit. “We are excited to collaborate with Razer, for the first time ever, by powering the Razer Blade 14 with the best mobile processors we have developed for gaming.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user sits at an outdoor picnic table, typing on the Razer Blade 14." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H97zYVSErBgzRnbHMhWZRfZLALY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658021/Razer_Blade_14__2021__Lifestyle_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The logo we know and love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JCt3xf"&gt;Razer’s Intel systems have consistently ranked among our picks for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;best gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt; you can buy. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/a&gt; delivers excellent frame rates while remaining comparable in size to a number of 15-inch productivity machines. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21340554/razer-blade-stealth-13-review-keyboard-specs-price-features"&gt;Blade Stealth 13&lt;/a&gt; is one of very few 13-inch gaming laptops that can run AAA titles at native resolution, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt; delivers some of the most powerful performance you can find in a gaming laptop, period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ypba6"&gt;But laptops with AMD CPUs have been doing better than those with Intel CPUs in recent years, in both performance and battery life. Our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;top two&lt;/a&gt; selections for the best gaming laptop are both AMD-powered, as is our best budget pick. Asus’ AMD-powered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt; delivers some of the best performance and battery life that we’ve ever seen from a 14-inch laptop. It’s exciting to see Razer combining its top-notch build quality with these top-notch processors, and we’ll see how well it stacks up to Asus’ offerings once we’ve gotten our hands on the unit. &lt;/p&gt;
