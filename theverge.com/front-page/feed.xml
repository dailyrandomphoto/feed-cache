    <title>Amazon Fire HD 10 (2021) review: things are getting complicated</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Amazon’s big, cheap tablet can now be had many different ways&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="rIqHQQ"&gt;Amazon’s lineup of Fire tablets has settled into a familiar routine: they are available in small, medium, and large; they are priced far lower than comparable iPads; and they are mostly good for reading and watching movies or TV, with content likely supplied by Amazon itself. The company doesn’t update them as often as their competitors, sometimes going a few years between upgrades. This year, the large model, the Fire HD 10, has gotten a refresh, bringing a redesigned body, better performance, and a host of new configurations you can choose from when buying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ufeByu"&gt;Despite the update, much remains the same. The Fire HD 10 is a good, inexpensive tablet for consuming content from Amazon, including Kindle books, Prime Video movies and TV shows, and Audible audiobooks. It also has access to other popular streaming services, like Netflix, Disney Plus, Hulu, and HBO Max. The Kids editions are great for parents who want to limit what content their children have access to or how long they can use a screen each day. But if you’re looking for a tablet to replace your laptop or get serious work done, the Fire HD 10 is not it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nglgnt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The options within the Fire HD 10 range are more extensive than expected&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dtgYX3"&gt;The Fire HD 10 family (yes, it’s a whole three-row SUV full of options now) now includes the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BX7FV5L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 standard model&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F6FYN6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$180 Fire HD 10 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F62DV1Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 HD 10 Kids&lt;/a&gt; model, and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F5MXVYL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 HD 10 Kids Pro&lt;/a&gt; option. (Those are all the full MSRP prices; Amazon frequently discounts its products, and you should probably just wait for a sale if you’re planning to buy one.) Of these, three of them — the Fire HD 10, the Fire HD 10 Kids, and the Fire HD 10 Kids Pro — have the same hardware; the Fire HD 10 Plus adds an extra gigabyte of RAM, a soft-touch finish, and wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9DY845"&gt;The HD 10 and 10 Plus are available with either 32GB or 64GB of storage; the Kids models are only available with 32GB. All of them have support for microSD card storage expansion up to 1TB. The Fire HD 10 is available in four muted color options, while the 10 Plus only comes in black and the Kids versions come with a variety of colorful cases. Lastly, the HD 10 and 10 Plus include Amazon’s lock screen ads by default; you can pay $15 more to remove them either when you buy the tablet or after the fact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUtghl"&gt;Not only has Amazon expanded the configuration options available for the Fire HD 10, but it’s also increased the number of accessories you can opt for. The big new thing is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Keyboard-detachable-Generation-release/dp/B08SB72Q8F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 detachable keyboard case&lt;/a&gt; that works with either the Fire HD 10 or 10 Plus. You can get it in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XMBMW3H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a “Productivity Bundle”&lt;/a&gt; that includes the tablet, the keyboard case, and a year of Microsoft 365 for $220 or $250, depending on which Fire HD 10 you choose. It’s clearly Amazon’s answer to the iPad Pro and other tablets that aim to be more than just laid-back consumption devices. You can also opt for a $40 wireless charging dock made by Anker that’s specifically designed for the Fire HD 10 Plus and turns it into an Alexa smart display. And then there’s the usual suite of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L9T15CV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$40 color-matched snap-on cases&lt;/a&gt; that work with either model and provide protection and a vertical or horizontal kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfjVS2"&gt;It’s a whole lot of choices for what most would consider to be a simple, almost impulse purchase. I’ll go into more depth below, but if you are looking to buy one and want the TL;DR, my recommendation is to get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BX7FV5L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB Fire HD 10&lt;/a&gt; in whatever color you prefer and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-microSDHC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GYBBBBH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;separate microSD card&lt;/a&gt; to expand its storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="U1Cpu3"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rcaIOR"&gt;Amazon Fire HD 10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WduEDmeqiSEqFKJYervFSt7yvwo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719520/dseifert_4649_fire_hd_10_2021_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire HD 10 is the default model and the one most people should opt for.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cXpken"&gt;This year’s Fire HD 10 lineup comes with an appreciated improvement to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959152/amazon-fire-hd-10-2019-review-tablet-alexa-price-specs-features-photos"&gt;design released in 2019&lt;/a&gt;: the bezels around the screen are now uniform, making it easier to hold and giving it a more modern look than before. The bezels on the long side are actually slightly bigger, but the bezels on the short sides are smaller than they were, with the net effect being a noticeably smaller overall footprint. Amazon has also rounded the corners more, giving it a more iPad-like silhouette, and it’s about eight percent lighter, tipping the scales at just over a pound. It’s still got a hard plastic chassis that feels a bit cheap, but the finish fortunately masks any fingerprints. I wish Amazon had found a way to add some kind of fingerprint scanner or biometric authentication because typing in a PIN code every time you need to unlock the tablet feels like you’ve time-traveled back a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbNSGr"&gt;Inside those slimmed-down bezels is a 10.1-inch 1080p display that the company claims is 10 percent brighter than the prior model. It’s a good screen, especially for this price point: it’s plenty sharp, has good color and saturation, and works well indoors. It’s still not great in direct sunlight — 10 percent brightness bump or not — and it won’t compare to the best displays from Samsung or Apple, but I don’t think anyone buying this tablet will complain about the screen’s quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G3t5FE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10654151"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kyHJ7o"&gt;There is no active stylus support on any of the Fire HD 10 models, so none of them are great options if you plan to take notes on the screen or create artwork. If that’s a feature you want, you’ll have to pay a lot more for one of Samsung’s or Apple’s tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RQzdCB2-UExBNLAAIRuf_Sthg2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719518/dseifert_4649_fire_hd_10_2021_8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A USB-C port is for charging, and there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ptfww2_cLk2kk4PRLogS2E-AoV0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719516/dseifert_4649_fire_hd_10_2021_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The back of the Fire HD 10 is a hard plastic, which doesn’t show fingerprints and should be durable if not the most premium.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eCM4hY"&gt;Amazon moved the front-facing camera from the short edge, like it is on iPads, to the long edge, so video calls in landscape orientation are much less awkward. The 2-megapixel camera still isn’t very good, with lots of image noise, smeared details, and low color saturation. The same can be said for the upgraded 5-megapixel camera on the back. It might work fine for scanning the occasional document, but the phone you have in your pocket almost certainly has a better camera attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iatUTJ"&gt;Inside the new Fire HD 10 is the same 2GHz octacore MediaTek MT8183 processor that was used in the prior model. But this time, it’s paired with 3GB of RAM (a 50 percent increase), which provides a noticeable improvement in the tablet’s performance. Apps open quicker, navigating between home screens and menus is faster, and it’s generally less annoying to use than it was before. It’s still by no means a &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; tablet (4K video stutters in the browser), but it doesn’t get in its own way nearly as much as the last model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b0ETZ6"&gt;Amazon claims up to 12 hours of battery life between charges, and though I didn’t do a formal rundown test, my experience leads me to believe that’s accurate. The Fire HD 10 can easily handle a few consecutive movies, and it doesn’t lose much battery life when it’s sitting idle, unlike Apple’s latest iPads. A USB-C port is there for charging, but it doesn’t charge quickly at all. Amazon says it will take four hours to completely recharge the tablet using the included 9W charging brick. You can shorten that time by using a faster charger; it took about two hours to fully charge with a 30W USB-C charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNBk5H"&gt;Amazon did not change the speaker situation, which consists of two speakers on the top edge (when you’re holding the tablet in landscape orientation), and I wish it had, as it’s the weakest part of the movie experience with the Fire HD 10. The speakers get loud enough, but they don’t sound nearly as full or clear as those on other tablets and aren’t as pleasant to listen to. Fortunately, there’s still a 3.5mm jack and Bluetooth support for using the headphones of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/loSHNszYFlK8LpM_lh4_q4oOEmI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719521/dseifert_4649_fire_hd_10_2021_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best feature on the Fire HD 10 remains its display, which is better than expected from a $150 tablet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JCyZaB"&gt;The other thing Amazon hasn’t changed in a long time is the software. The Fire HD 10 runs the company’s Fire OS fork of Android, the latest version of which is based on the years-old Android 9 platform. That makes it feel dated compared to a current Android phone. There’s no gesture-based interface, for example, just the old home, back, and recents apps buttons at the bottom, nor is there a light mode and dark mode that switches automatically in the software or some of the other niceties we’ve become accustomed to in more recent versions of Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPyHbq"&gt;Amazon also uses the home screen to promote content, apps, videos, and more in a spammy way. The For You tab, which is meant to be a personalized page, is basically one big ad for apps and videos you don’t own. Once you are in an actual app, these annoyances fade away, but it’s not a fun road getting there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9l6hq"&gt;The bigger software problem remains: Amazon does not have access to the Google Play Store and is therefore lacking many of the apps you are familiar with on a phone (think Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, Google Docs, etc). Amazon’s own Appstore has never been well-stocked, and it is even worse than it used to be in terms of having the latest, most popular apps and games available. In fact, Amazon’s own Luna subscription gaming service doesn’t work on it. That’s less of a problem if all you want to do on the tablet is watch movies or TV shows, but if you’re trying to get stuff done, it’s hard to do it without the apps you need. (I’ll cover this more in the section on the HD 10 Plus.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnVKBz"&gt;In general, the Fire HD 10 is the default model and the one I’d recommend most people buy if they are looking for an inexpensive tablet for watching movies or reading books. You can absolutely get a better tablet that’s more capable and has more options for apps, but you will have to pay considerably more for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="3ztTWx"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oDhHTR"&gt;Amazon Fire HD 10 Plus Productivity Bundle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MDdh_rqZ1EO4wh9ByBaB05cJ4Bs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719515/dseifert_4649_fire_hd_10_2021_11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Productivity Bundle includes a detachable keyboard and a year of Microsoft 365, so you can use apps like Word in split-screen on the Fire HD 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cA9u6o"&gt;As noted above, the Fire HD 10 Plus is the same as the standard model, but with 4GB of RAM instead of 3GB, a soft-touch finish, and wireless charging. None of these things are worth the extra cost: the RAM didn’t make an appreciable difference in performance because Amazon’s software is the bottleneck for productivity; the soft-touch finish is slightly grippier, but anyone who puts a case on the tablet won’t even experience it; and the wireless charging is convenient but slow, and finding a charger that’s big enough for the tablet and not awkward to use is a bit of a challenge. (Amazon tells me the Anker stand I tested it with is currently unavailable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nkn3E3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10654155"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D1diwZ"&gt;I tested the Fire HD 10 Plus with the $250 Productivity Bundle, which includes a detachable keyboard case and a year of access to Microsoft’s Office apps. It’s Amazon’s acknowledgment that people are using tablets for more than just media consumption, especially as many workers and students were stuck at home during the pandemic and had to do everything remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gI0F43"&gt;The keyboard case is made by Fintie, but it’s designed to the specifications of the Fire HD 10. Half of it is a detachable Bluetooth keyboard that pairs wirelessly with the tablet. The other half is a snap-on case that connects to the keyboard via magnets to form a familiar clamshell look. I like that you can easily detach the keyboard when you don’t want to use it, but it’d be nicer if it didn’t use Bluetooth and instead communicated directly with the tablet like most other designs do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z__zhToZqD-20krvX-PMgNK9Plo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719513/dseifert_4649_fire_hd_10_2021_12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard is small and plasticky, but it’s not the worst thing I’ve ever typed on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_e8DCBIlzeZyf6L8ntM-vH5IO00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719512/dseifert_4649_fire_hd_10_2021_13.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The back of the Fire HD 10 Plus has a soft-touch finish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kNsrHX"&gt;The keyboard is small, has no backlight, and the keys themselves are plasticky. It’s not the worst thing I’ve ever typed on, but it’s far from the best, and I would only want to use it for short emails and not much more. It does have a useful function row for media controls, brightness, and volume, plus there’s a shortcut to open the Fire HD 10’s split-screen mode so you can use two apps at the same time. There is no trackpad or pointing device, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M31JWI"&gt;But the hardware is not the main thing holding the Fire HD 10 Plus back — it’s the software, or, more accurately, the lack of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgAw9T"&gt;Amazon has worked with Microsoft to get its suite of Office apps into the Amazon Appstore, including Outlook, Word, Excel, and Teams. There’s also Zoom for video calls. But if your work demands any other productivity apps, you’re going to have a hard time finding them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Tayco"&gt;Here’s a list of productivity apps I use daily for work that are nowhere to be found on the Fire HD 10 Plus (or any other Amazon tablet):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="iu3OtS"&gt;Slack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Zhybck"&gt;Asana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CroWcR"&gt;Google Meet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aB0Rfr"&gt;Feedly (the poorly rated third-party app I tried crashed on login)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vuiiY0"&gt;Todoist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qUkijJ"&gt;SwiftKey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tOKdvn"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;NY Times&lt;/em&gt; (the app in the Amazon store is just a bookmark to the website)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4vcrPM"&gt;Bitwarden (Also missing are LastPass, 1Password, and Dashlane. Logging in to apps with my passwords requires juggling my phone and the tablet, and it’s a huge pain.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="K57z2m"&gt;Two-factor authentication apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jFGZwe"&gt;Pocket (Pocket &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to be in the Amazon Appstore, but the company has removed it and now instructs Fire tablet owners to &lt;a href="https://help.getpocket.com/article/1161-installing-pocket-for-android-via-direct-download"&gt;sideload the app from its website&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="tm3atN"&gt;You can get around this problem by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/8/20681267/amazon-fire-tablet-google-apps-gmail-maps-drive-play-store-how-to-get"&gt;sideloading the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt; and its related services onto the Fire HD, but that requires disabling security features, downloading software from sites that don’t have authorization to distribute it, and installing it in a specific order. Frankly, it’s not something most people are going to do, and if Amazon wants to market something called a “Productivity Bundle,” it needs to do a much better job at making its tablet more useful for work tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fV6L9A"&gt;Should you find all the apps you need in the Appstore, you’ll still run into wonky problems trying to use them in split-screen mode. I was able to pull up the Office app and a browser window at the same time, but in order to create a new Word doc, I had to exit the split-screen mode. The tablet’s relatively small screen and widescreen aspect ratio also make things quite small to work with when you have two apps open.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CLnCysrTuvz9EQLurS6F_8FRuZE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719511/dseifert_4649_fire_hd_10_2021_14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire HD 10 Plus supports wireless charging and can act as an Alexa-powered smart display when it’s on a dock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bPdIcc"&gt;The Fire HD 10 Plus and the Productivity Bundle are just a token acknowledgment of the trend to use tablets for work. The Fire HD 10 Plus is not a good device for getting work done. It’s inexpensive, but you’ll most likely be able to get a lot more done with a Chromebook or Chrome OS tablet, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;excellent Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;, for not much more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="qKjAh5"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7tWMa1"&gt;Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids and HD 10 Kids Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YSUuVJAn2xhWXup4FJo_FYcGqKs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719522/dseifert_4649_fire_hd_10_2021_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kids line of the Fire HD 10 now has two different models for different age groups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="81W3OX"&gt;As with prior Kids versions, the new models come with a year’s subscription to Amazon’s Kids Plus content service, a two-year warranty against damage, and a kid-friendly case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2aCANZ"&gt;Despite their names, the Kids and Kids Pro models are, in fact, the same hardware, just wrapped in a different case. The Kids model, which Amazon says is designed for ages 3 to 7, comes with a chunky, spongy rubber case that’s easier for little hands to hold on to and will protect the tablet from tumbles and drops. The Kids Pro model is meant for children ages 6 to 12 and comes with a slimmer plastic case that’s more akin to a standard tablet case. As mentioned before, both cases can be had in a variety of colors and designs and come with built-in kickstands that double as carrying handles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oHpkIQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10654157"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f2cg7k"&gt;The other difference is found in the software interface. The home screen and app grid on the HD 10 Kids is the same as before, but the HD 10 Kids Pro features a cleaner interface that’s more similar to a phone, with a search bar at the top and more grown-up-looking app icons. Amazon started rolling out this new interface last fall, and it’s determined by the age range you select for your child’s profile, not the hardware; you could put the new interface on the standard Kids tablet if you so desire.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sFNUORTAZGstycZ-sdon6KweNzg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719526/dseifert_4649_fire_hd_10_2021_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kids model cases have a built-in kickstand that doubles as a handle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LIOwjI"&gt;I’m not a kid, so I handed the Fire HD 10 Kids and HD 10 Kids Pro tablets to my six- and nine-year-olds to get their take on them. They’ve been using 2017-era Fire HD 8 Kids tablets for a few years, so they have a good perspective on how the new models might be different from older tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmNd6t"&gt;Both kids appreciated the larger screen and better sound from the 10-inch tablet compared to their older 8-inch models. Also popular was the built-in kickstand on the case that let them put the tablet down when watching a video. Both kids noticed and remarked upon how much faster it was downloading games and launching episodes of &lt;em&gt;SpongeBob SquarePants&lt;/em&gt; — my nine-year-old said they were able to download “ten apps in like three seconds.” (Kids may be prone to exaggeration.) Given how slow and frustrating their old tablets are whenever I have to use them for anything, I think parents considering upgrading to new models should probably just go ahead and do it. I also appreciated having a USB-C port for charging, which is a lot easier to deal with and works more reliably than the Micro USB port on their old tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nu1hLal80hbc-2oMl3cXpM9zqW8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719524/dseifert_4649_fire_hd_10_2021_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kids edition for younger children has a chunky, spongy case; the model for older kids has a slimmer plastic one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gb39KJ"&gt;As much as I dislike using the Fire tablets for my own entertainment or work, I do like the Kids editions for my kids. Unlike an iPad, the Kids Plus software allows me to easily restrict the content available to them to age-appropriate levels. I don’t have to worry about in-app purchases or ads for scammy games popping up. I can selectively adjust how much time they have playing games, reading books, or watching video before the tablet locks them out for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIMFay"&gt;The interface available for younger kids doesn’t have a web browser at all, and I can control whether the camera can be used. For older kids, a web browser with built-in content filters is available, though that too can be turned off by the parent. Apps that aren’t available in Amazon’s Kids Plus library can be selectively requested and enabled for the kids’ profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LDCbd"&gt;Parents can control all of this, including the screen time limits, from a web dashboard on any device, making it very easy to manage. It’s something you can set up and then just hand to your kid and not worry about what they are accessing or who they might be communicating with. If you have multiple kids sharing a single tablet, each can have their own personalized profile accessible right from the lock screen. It’s baffling that Apple hasn’t done anything along these lines for the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Fs6JYc"&gt;Still, when it comes time to do schoolwork, the Kids edition tablets have the same problems as the standard models. These aren’t great schoolwork companions — they are really just for entertainment (and maybe a little bit of edutainment in the mix).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next big social network trend? Shortform audio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tsw7sU9ZBf9KVXS_qblzhHzlpao=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69590311/acastro_210709_4664_micropodcasting_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Forget long Clubhouse convos, these founders see voice notes as the future&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="AuPOki"&gt;“So I’ve identified a few metrics and KPIs that I’m going to start tracking in order to better my overall life experience,” Farbod Nowzad says, seemingly seriously, into his phone microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xIpQlz"&gt;He lists his KPIs, or key performance indicators: the number of smoothies he drinks per week, the amount of time he spends listening to live techno music, and the number of rooftop bars he visits. I tap through to hear more. Someone named Nikolai recommends people maximize the “number of water fixtures that come into your line of sight on a daily basis” and the “number of times that you can say, ‘I’ll have the usual’ and have someone else understand it.” More people chime in, all in audio clips under 90 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYspo0"&gt;This, to multiple founders and investors, is the future of audio: shortform recordings that are social, shareable, and thought-provoking, or, at a bare minimum, make you want to listen and say something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hji0oK"&gt;Multiple startups, including &lt;a href="https://beams.fm/"&gt;Beams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://quest.audio/"&gt;Quest&lt;/a&gt;, and Nowzad’s app &lt;a href="https://pludo.xyz/"&gt;Pludo&lt;/a&gt; are betting their efforts, and investors’ cash, that there’s business to be had in this user-generated audio. Even the world’s largest social platform sees this as a possibility; Facebook announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391551/facebook-audio-podcasts-clubhouse-competitor-spotify-live-rooms"&gt;Soundbites&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, a forthcoming product also built around shareable, short audio clips. They all see what’s happening on TikTok — masses of people creating viral video clips — and want to repeat that success with just sound. It could be the next viral frontier, and a medium that mints new stars and makes everyone lots of cash, should any of these apps actually take off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WzOPyY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Can solely audio go viral?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SUeyf1"&gt;The best way to think of these efforts is as apps for voice notes, except your voice notes have a time limit and people can respond to them with more voice notes that also have a time limit. Oh, and the voice notes aren’t edited, either. It’s like taking the social aspect of Clubhouse but limiting it with a time constraint, although the analogy that keeps coming up when I talk to the founders is Twitter, and &lt;em&gt;blogs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUkZ5O"&gt;“[Once we had blogs] we then had tools like Twitter and Tumblr that removed all of the complexity and just said, ‘You don’t need to think of yourself as bloggers, just type words into the box and press publish,’ and that led to this unlock of so much creativity,” says Austin Petersmith, the founder and CEO of &lt;a href="https://racket.com/c/help"&gt;Racket&lt;/a&gt;, another shortform audio platform that’s currently in beta and has raised an initial seed round of funding, although Petersmith wouldn’t disclose the amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ME0Uz"&gt;Giving people an online microphone and a time constraint, he says, makes podcasting easier to approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtX8XK"&gt;“Hundreds of millions of people are making TikToks actively, hundreds of millions of people are blogging actively, and there are less than a million people podcasting actively,” he says. “I think it makes no sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WyhfF12YjnPHllHD0bGfu1v4HPE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22720086/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_2.08.25_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of the Racket interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Pjy05z"&gt;Racket limits people to nine minutes of recording, which right now, they can only do on the web. An app is in development, though, as are plans to make the platform open to everyone. Petersmith says 18,000 minutes of audio have been published since the company’s launch this year; 70,000 people have listened to a Racket, which is what they call the audio snippets; and 17,000 people have signed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0RD8a"&gt;But why the audio mania now? Alan Sternberg, co-founder of Beams, which he and his co-founder say has raised $3 million, says the apps’ arrivals come from a confluence of factors: the improvement of phones’ microphones, Clubhouse popularizing the idea of social audio, and rapid speech-to-text transcription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWctkg"&gt;Notably, none of these apps offer RSS feeds to distribute content to other apps, essentially setting them up as proprietary vehicles through which people can consume and create content. They very much are not podcasts. Sternberg says RSS is a problem, even, because it doesn’t allow for a social network to grow in one app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y96mUZ"&gt;“I think the problem with RSS, when you look at podcasting, it’s like a decentralized technology that wasn’t made to be a social network,” he says, suggesting that’s why apps like Beams need to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pELJYk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5zy-QZHzWYE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2K7Z6z"&gt;Meanwhile, for investors, the shortform audio trend makes sense as a way to build on the success of live social audio apps and improve on them, at least in one investor’s mind. Jake Chapman, an investor in Racket, points out multiple issues he sees with live audio. Namely, conversations veer off track from the promised room topic, as is the nature of conversation, and because they’re live and not recorded, at least in Clubhouse’s case, the app can’t optimize for discovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8yctm"&gt;“I think the short snippet audio companies have a much better chance of success [than apps like Clubhouse],” he says. “I think they can scratch the same kind of itch. So Racket, for instance, because rackets are prerecorded, so they’re asynchronous, and because they’re short, the signal-to-noise ratio is completely flipped.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nrq1ev"&gt;He also says apps that specialize in longform audio will have higher costs when transcribing hours-long conversations and optimizing discovery around them, versus shortform.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bPIeoZsOJgUWMn_owtNaWYnGgTs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22720077/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_2.06.59_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Quest&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshots of Quest, a shortform audio app focused on career advice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LDR7gy"&gt;Of course, podcasting has already existed for years and is having &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; Big Tech moment now, too. Amazon recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549391/amazon-music-art19-hosting-platform-advertisers"&gt;purchased&lt;/a&gt; a podcasting hosting company, in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22098312/amazon-music-wondery-acquire-buy-podcast-industry"&gt;the podcast network Wondery&lt;/a&gt;, and Spotify has spent upward of a billion dollars on exclusive content deals and acquiring companies across the space. No one really thought podcasting was broken, but Big Tech saw an opportunity to cash in on it, mostly through serving and targeting ads against shows, and seized it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0Lp5A"&gt;Spotify notably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition"&gt;bought&lt;/a&gt; Anchor in 2019, arguably the app that pioneered the idea of mobile audio recording. It didn’t focus on shortform audio, however, and was more designed to democratize podcast creation, as it still tries to do today. Anchor attempted to make its app a place to listen, as well as create, but failed to ever make it a destination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YTdno"&gt;That’s the real hurdle for these startups. Podcasts thrive when they’re available across platforms — some shows do well on YouTube, others find an audience on Apple Podcasts, and still others do well on Pocket Casts. But these new apps and their founders see locked-down content as the way forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VIMYZU"&gt;These startups face two main hurdles, though: Facebook, which is going to enter the space soon and plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577242/facebook-1-billion-payments-creators-2022"&gt;pay out $1 billion&lt;/a&gt; to creators across its platform over the next year, and the outstanding question that exists, of whether people want to hear this audio format. Will anyone actually listen to a stranger give them ideas of KPIs to optimize their life? Or would they just prefer a tweet?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b9pekq"&gt;Whether you’d like to admit it or not, school is quickly approaching. And if you’re in need of a reliable laptop that won’t force you to completely deplete your savings, Chromebooks aren’t a bad way to go. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; deliver great value for the money, and many offer terrific performance for far less than you would pay for a more premium machine. Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is one such device, even if the high-end convertible is one of the more expensive Chromebooks on the market right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEUc0Y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746320001237385626#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Currently discounted at Best Buy to $619&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 model packs in 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i5, which is more than enough processing power for most people. Moreover, it boasts a great keyboard and a brilliant 3:2 screen, along with two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports and enough battery life for a full day in the classroom — virtual or otherwise. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Apple’s pint-sized answer to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Mini&lt;/a&gt; still produces good sound for its size, though, and Siri remains a viable alternative to Alexa and Google Assistant, despite lagging behind when it comes to features and functionality. The compact smart speaker also plays nice with HomeKit-compatible devices and Apple Music, rendering it a device really built for those who are already entrenched in the Apple ecosystem. Normally $100, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1598683-REG%2Fapple_aphomepmsg_homepod_mini_space_gray.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F16%2F22577815%2Facer-chromebook-spin-713-apple-homepod-mini-microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is offering a rare $10 discount&lt;/a&gt; on Home Pod Mini, bringing the price down to $90 for a limited time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="xpKyaN"&gt;With COVID-19 restrictions easing and in-person gatherings become more commonplace again, now might not be a bad time to pick up an extra controller for your Xbox One, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, or Windows 10 machine.

    <title>The stakes for fighting misinformation are life and death</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d06Dira6zg7uruBcr2H57tZYZv8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69590117/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DSZ6HM"&gt;The United States surgeon general &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578431/white-house-surgeon-general-facebook-youtube-twitter-covid-19-misinformation-vaccines"&gt;published a report&lt;/a&gt; this week calling for a whole-of-society response to health misinformation, calling it a “serious threat to public health.” It took a sweeping look at a wide range of misinformation, on everything from masks to unproven drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qpfBV"&gt;But the focus of Surgeon General Vivek Murthy’s remarks &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/15/politics/surgeon-general-vaccine-misinformation-advisory/index.html"&gt;circled back&lt;/a&gt; to vaccines. Daily vaccination rates have stalled out at around 500,000 shots per day, and in many pockets of the country, a majority of people aren’t getting immunized. The US is struggling to bump those numbers up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIRkXH"&gt;Misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines spreads fast, and so do the accompanying consequences. The rapid spread of the more transmissible Delta coronavirus variant makes them even easier to see. Case counts are going up around the country, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/7/13/22576416/nyc-covid-cases-rise-in-areas-with-low-vaccination-rates"&gt;in areas&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/12/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html"&gt;low vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/unvaccinated-covid19-los-angeles-county-hospitalizations/10887037/"&gt;Every person hospitalized&lt;/a&gt; with COVID-19 in Los Angeles County is unvaccinated. &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/6242"&gt;In Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, 94 percent of COVID-19 cases since May were among the unvaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="FN2rL7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e1XuIz"&gt;In Missouri, the new center of the Delta-driven US surge, health care workers are exhausted by the avoidable COVID-19 cases and deaths they see every day. They’re frustrated that people in their communities aren’t getting vaccinated. In addition to fighting the virus, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/15/springfield-missouri-delta-outbreak/"&gt;health officials are battling&lt;/a&gt; theories that the vaccine is causing the spike in cases, apathy from young people who think they don’t need to get vaccinated, and the false idea that the vaccine contains a microchip. With &lt;a href="https://data.news-leader.com/covid-19-vaccine-tracker/missouri/29/"&gt;much of the population&lt;/a&gt; in the state avoiding shots, the virus is inevitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oP9KfY"&gt;“We are going to see more people get really sick. We are going to see a lot of people die,” Katie Towns, the acting health director at the Springfield-Greene County Health Department in Missouri, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/15/springfield-missouri-delta-outbreak/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UV4CNX"&gt;Misinformation is also winning &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578519/vaccine-politicization-tennessee-covid-hpv-flu"&gt;in Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, where the health department stopped all vaccine outreach to young people after pressure and backlash from conservative lawmakers. Anti-vaxxers and others opposed to public health measures have the ear of people in power, and it’s frightening, psychologist and anti-vaccine researcher Seth Kalichman &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578519/vaccine-politicization-tennessee-covid-hpv-flu"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oorVGY"&gt;Vaccines are some of the most powerful public health tools at our disposal. Because they’re so good, and particularly because the COVID-19 vaccines are so good, the fallout from any drops in vaccination rates is predictable. When people don’t get vaccinated, people get sick, and people die. That means the stakes for &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-misinformation-advisory.pdf"&gt;proposals and efforts&lt;/a&gt; to curb vaccine misinformation — crack down on social media platforms, distribute correct information, develop health literacy programs — couldn’t be higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sx6qGZ"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gHfsse"&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lFW43s"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/12/flu-jab-may-reduce-severe-effects-of-covid-suggests-study"&gt;Flu jab may reduce severe effects of Covid, suggests study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;COVID-19 patients who had a flu shot were less likely to have a stroke or admitted to emergency departments than patients who didn’t, a new study found. It’s not a substitute for COVID-19 vaccine. (Ian Sample/&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F4CJZO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/12/opinion/covid-unusual-cases-study.html"&gt;Why the most unusual Covid cases matter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unique, outlier cases can help researchers and doctors understand the disease. Studying people who don’t respond to the COVID-19 vaccine, for example, can help us understand the immune system. (Roxanne Khamsi/&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MAVbj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bat-scientists-warn-that-the-world-may-never-know-covid-19-origins-11626026153?st=xzj3j18omaz5awx&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;Bat Scientists Warn That the World May Never Know Covid-19 Origins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Research that tries to track down a smoking gun is challenging and often fails. Scientists also often disagree on what various data means. (Amy Dockser Marcus/&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="odMcn4"&gt;Development &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="km92xC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01893-0"&gt;Quarter-dose of Moderna COVID vaccine still rouses a big immune response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;A smaller dose of the vaccine could still help protect people from COVID-19. That could make limited supplies of the shot stretch further. (Elie Dolgin/&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WB6tnb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/07/12/when-and-how-will-we-know-covid-19-booster-shots/"&gt;When and how will we know if we need Covid-19 booster shots?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pfizer and BioNTech are pushing for a third shot in the COVID-19 vaccine regimen. Federal agencies in the United States are pushing back, saying that the data doesn’t show a need yet. The booster debate also raises issues of vaccine equity. (&lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0efwX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574180/fda-johnson-warning-covid-vaccine-guillain-barre"&gt;FDA adds warning about a nerve condition to the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;People who got the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot have slightly higher rates of a condition called Guillain–Barré syndrome, which can cause weakness and coordination problems, than would be expected in the general population. (Nicole Wetsman/&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="grbPRu"&gt;Perspectives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pcWjDM"&gt;And I went back and forth about it for a while. It’s almost like I was paralyzed from trying to do the right thing, if that makes sense……… it was torture. But it just seemed like the advice about vaccinations and pregnant women, at that time, it was still up in the air. It was still a situation where no one was telling me, you know, It’s undisputed, Cheyenne, these are the facts, this is what you should do. So I just tried to make the right choice, the best I could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="XfR5U2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/cheyenne-parker-wnba-basketball-atlanta"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Player’s Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Atlanta Dream star Cheyenne Parker wrote about grappling with whether to get a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IOqaIp"&gt;More than numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4tzoD2"&gt;To the people who have received the 3.5 billion vaccine doses distributed so far — thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdsoGE"&gt;To the more than 188,726,053 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbHqHe"&gt;To the families and friends of the more than 4,062,486 people who have died worldwide — 608,336 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYEI4E"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80ZwyN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aB5sN7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="md64mw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alexa’s latest celebrity voices are Shaq and Melissa McCarthy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HF_RUPVYLFPlsZavLvWBi8YHrcE=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69590087/dseifert_201025_4263_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kFQPfL"&gt;Shaquille O’Neal and Melissa McCarthy are the latest celebrities to lend their voices to Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant, the &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/alexa-introduce-me-to-melissa-and-shaq"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The two voices can provide weather reports, jokes, and personal stories when asked using the wake words “Hey Melissa” or “Hey Shaq.” Both voices cost $4.99 individually, and are rolling out in the US now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2ahqG"&gt;Amazon kicked off its celebrity Alexa voices initiative &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21013145/amazon-echo-alexa-samuel-l-jackson-celebrity-voice-now-available-price"&gt;with Samuel L. Jackson in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and says this Alexa voice skill was the top selling digital purchase on Amazon.com the day it was launched. In 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436292/amazon-alexa-amitabh-bachchan-celebrity-voice-india-bollywood-star-pricing-release-date"&gt;followed up with Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan&lt;/a&gt;. None of these celebrities replace Alexa’s default voice, but instead offer responses to specific requests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4dkC45"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5o_vmcCbrkE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="2O3MXP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fnb451SHPMI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MXbTVc"&gt;If you’re after a new Alexa voice for all of your requests, then Amazon says it’s also releasing a new voice option, which you can enable with the command “Alexa, change your voice.” Separately, there’s also a new wake word, “Ziggy,” if you’re tired of the existing selection (which currently includes Alexa, Computer, Echo, and Amazon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lf7qIj"&gt;To enable either celebrity voices, you can ask Alexa for an introduction. The commands “Alexa, introduce me to Shaq,” or “Alexa, introduce me to Melissa” should do the trick. Alternatively, you can manually enable &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XW88QZB/ref=sxts_spks_0_0_fe93319a-8afe-47d4-a26b-1cf04483ed5e?pd_rd_w=O2qZB&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=fe93319a-8afe-47d4-a26b-1cf04483ed5e&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=V1632KG3BYWC589939XH&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=eb63b2db-1485-4d9e-9bda-67920148236d&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=tvO3c&amp;amp;qid=1626434273&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;each&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Melissa-McCarthy-celebrity-personality-Alexa/dp/B08XVTH3ZP/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=melissa+mccarthy&amp;amp;qid=1626434258&amp;amp;s=digital-skills&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; via Amazon’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epomaker’s NT68 is a mechanical alternative to your MacBook’s keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HUxPZgYzqkoT1Ka7IjdDlKL6tXg=/1x0:1113x741/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69589947/nt68_photo_3_min_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The NT68 is designed to sit on top of your laptop’s existing keyboard.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epomaker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JVmp5b"&gt;If you can’t stand to type on a Macbook’s scissor switch keyboard, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;let alone a butterfly model&lt;/a&gt;, and you don’t fancy lugging around one of the small number of laptops with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7495073/msi-mechanical-keyboard-gt80-titan-laptop-ces"&gt;full-on mechanical keyboard built in&lt;/a&gt;, then Epomaker’s new wireless keyboard might be one for you. The NT68 is designed to sit on top of a MacBook or other laptop’s existing keyboard so your fingers don’t have to put up with their rubbery key switches for a single second longer than they need to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmFEpo"&gt;It’s not an entirely new idea (&lt;a href="https://nuphy.com/products/nutype-f1"&gt;Nuphy’s NuType F1 keyboard&lt;/a&gt; is another recent example) but the quality and specs of Epomaker’s previous keyboards make the NT68 worthy of attention. It can be hardwired over USB-C, connected via Bluetooth to up to three devices, and its switches are hot-swappable so you can modify the keyboard’s typing feel without having to get a soldering iron out. It uses what’s known as a 65 percent layout, which means you only get five rows of keys and no dedicated function row. It’s compact, but at the cost of some extra keys. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dKTDkD0nwXyIUXqmKrjFjcNCwGc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721291/nt68_bg3_min.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Epomaker&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ah yes. Ergonomics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tnrX0w"&gt;Oh, and there’s also RGB backlighting if you care about that sort of thing. The NT68 features what Epomaker is calling an “invisible stand,” and its magnetic case can prop up any phones or tablets you want to pair it to. Its 1,900 mAh battery is rated for between two and five weeks of wireless use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sa4tKx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If &lt;/em&gt;I was ever going to go to the effort of carrying around a little mechanical keyboard to use on top of a laptop, then I’d be giving the NT68 serious consideration. But that’s a big “if.” For starters, even as someone who owns around half a dozen different keyboards, it still seems straight up inconvenient to carry around an extra keyboard to replace the perfectly functional one built into my laptop. Even then, I couldn’t see myself bothering to put the keyboard &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;on top of&lt;/em&gt; a laptop’s keyboard when it’s much more ergonomic and comfortable to sit it on the desk in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VszF3O"&gt;But hey, I’m not going to tell you how to live your life. Epomaker is yet to announce a release date or pricing for the NT68, but it’s inviting people to sign up for updates &lt;a href="https://nt68comingsoon.epomaker.com/"&gt;over on its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi overtakes Apple as number two smartphone vendor for first time</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F52BFY"&gt;Xiaomi is now the second largest smartphone vendor based on worldwide shipments in the second quarter of 2021, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-market-q2-2021?ctid=2143-0b9f92413ead631983febced55e12cd8"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from Canalys. The Chinese company captured 17 percent of global market share, according to the research firm, just behind Samsung’s 19 percent but ahead of Apple’s 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gn7Ak"&gt;BBK’s Oppo and Vivo rounded out the list of top five vendors at 10 percent apiece. All five companies grew their shipments year on year, but what’s notable is just how much Xiaomi has managed to increase its volume — it shipped 83 percent more phones than in Q2 2020, whereas Samsung grew shipments 15 percent and Apple by just one percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vxj4as"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We've moved up one more spot! Just in from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Canalys?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Canalys&lt;/a&gt;, we are now the 2nd largest smartphone brand worldwide in terms of shipments. This amazing milestone couldn't have been achieved without our beloved Mi Fans! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoMiWithoutYou?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NoMiWithoutYou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RT with ✌️from your Xiaomi smartphone :) &lt;a href="https://t.co/kKfuTK8K7J"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kKfuTK8K7J&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xiaomi (@Xiaomi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xiaomi/status/1415731357368471553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iXhzMt"&gt;“Xiaomi is growing its overseas business rapidly,” Canalys Research Manager Ben Stanton says, citing sales boosts in regions including Western Europe, Africa, and Latin America. “It is still largely skewed toward the mass market, however, and compared with Samsung and Apple, its average selling price is around 40% and 75% cheaper respectively. So a major priority for Xiaomi this year is to grow sales of its high-end devices, such as the Mi 11 Ultra.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McMFbf"&gt;Canalys says global smartphone shipments grew by 12 percent last quarter. Much of the growth seen by smartphone makers is at the expense of Huawei, however, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21114885/huawei-overtakes-apple-2019-analysts-strategy-analytics-counterpoint-research-canalys"&gt;itself overtook Apple in 2019&lt;/a&gt; but has since been essentially shut out of the worldwide market due to US-imposed sanctions and trading bans. So far, Xiaomi appears to be the biggest beneficiary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter adds captions to voice tweets more than a year after they first launched</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/foo8fxaVSe1QVmIBW-o5TtzioFg=/0x200:1200x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69589056/E6XiiGlWQAYISTV.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captions on a voice tweet.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7UAdrN"&gt;Twitter is now rolling out captions for voice tweets, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1415806764113670145"&gt;the company announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter first launched voice tweets &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294481/twitter-audio-tweets-now-available-iphone-ios"&gt;in June 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296032/twitter-audio-tweets-accessibility-volunteers"&gt;quickly criticized at the time&lt;/a&gt; by accessibility advocates for not having captions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8W0cfd"&gt;Now, when you make a voice tweet (something you can only do on the iOS app right now), captions will be automatically generated in supported languages, which are English, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish, Arabic, Hindi, French, Indonesian, Korean, and Italian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npgjyG"&gt;To see the captions on a tweet, you can click or tap the CC icon in the top-right corner of the voice tweet window. Captions only appear on new voice tweets, Twitter tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;so you won’t see them on older ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLFdhH"&gt;Below is a screenshot of what the captions and the CC icon look like on the web, taken from a voice tweet that I made while writing this article:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_YD_udtL0AuyfYaYiESAUCkVZaY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22720808/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_4.26.51_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6X7WpS"&gt;You can also try to listen to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jaypeters/status/1415814919669260288"&gt;my voice tweet here&lt;/a&gt; and follow along with the captions, though I will warn you that my tweets eventually auto delete. If you’re reading this article a little while after it was published, the voice tweet might be gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bOVXE"&gt;When voice tweets launched, it also came to light that there wasn’t a dedicated team at Twitter for accessibility at the time — instead, employees had to volunteer their own time for accessibility work. The company has since fixed that, announcing that it had formed teams &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/making-twitter-more-accessible"&gt;to focus on accessibility&lt;/a&gt; in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8r3sWB"&gt;“As part of our ongoing work to make Twitter accessible for everyone, we’re rolling out automated captions for Voice Tweets to iOS,” Twitter’s head of global accessibility Gurpreet Kaur said in a statement. “Though it’s still early and we know it won’t be perfect at first, it’s one of many steps we’re taking to expand and strengthen accessibility across our service, and we look forward to continuing our journey to create a truly inclusive service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FamdOk"&gt;Twitter also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;offers captions in Twitter Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, its Clubhouse-like social audio rooms. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel is reportedly in talks to buy the $30 billion foundry company AMD spun off a decade ago</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QnbEjP14IxQo_G8xnQoaIGIf9UQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69588670/acastro_210120_1777_intel_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CQfD9C"&gt;In 2008, chipmakers Intel and AMD took two distinct paths: Intel kept manufacturing its own chips to maintain full control, while AMD decided to spin off its semiconductor business as GlobalFoundries, relying on it and other manufacturers to provide the actual silicon. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-is-in-talks-to-buy-globalfoundries-for-about-30-billion-11626387704"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Intel is looking to snap up AMD’s former fabs as well, in a deal that could value them at $30 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6mSOK"&gt;It’s clear from the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; story that the deal isn’t a sure thing, and GlobalFoundries outright denied that it was in talks with Intel. But it’s possible Intel’s negotiating with the investment firm that owns GlobalFoundries instead, as the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;points out. It’s also intriguing that the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have a “no comment” from Intel itself — that’s sometimes a canary to indicate a company &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; comment, just off the record or on deep background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kha7ys"&gt;(“We will decline to comment on rumor and speculation,” an Intel spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="481eGh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel’s pushing fabs on multiple fronts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vcJsmf"&gt;There’s an obvious reason why Intel might want GlobalFoundries — Intel is actually ramping up its foundry business now. In an attempt to turn around the struggling company, new Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;announced in March that Intel would no longer go it alone&lt;/a&gt;, outsourcing more of its chip production to third-party foundries, agreeing to produce more chips for other companies using its own foundries, and also investing in new fabs itself. That included a $20 billion investment in new facilities in Arizona, but it could take many years for new buildings to get constructed and ramp up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RSQWX"&gt;In the meanwhile, it could snap up GlobalFoundries, the #4 foundry in the world (&lt;a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20210224-10675.html"&gt;according to TrendForce&lt;/a&gt;), one that accounts for 7 percent of all foundry business by revenue. That won’t put Intel on the same footing as a giant TSMC or Samsung (which together account for an estimated 74 percent), but it’d be a start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Txhn4J"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; took &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/07/making-semiconductors-is-hard/"&gt;a tour of GlobalFoundries’ facility in Malta, NY&lt;/a&gt; just last week, if you’d like to hear what it’s like.&lt;/p&gt;
