    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zXFrPb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; is a good time of the year to consider upgrading your phone. Whether you’re looking for a deal through a carrier or you’d rather get an unlocked phone, you can save during the holiday season. The best deals on phones for Black Friday are on Android devices, including newer models from Google, Samsung, OnePlus, and more. Predictably, these big price cuts don’t apply to iPhones. Nothing new there, but there is a gift card promo happening if you are interested in picking one up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMRuMl"&gt;Below, you’ll find the best deals we’ve found so far. If you buy an unlocked phone, there won’t be any strings attached to the purchase. If we include a carrier promotion, we’ll be sure to thoroughly list out each requirement necessary to get the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fBJR1Q"&gt;Apple iPhone deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UqdK1t"&gt;Let’s get this one out of the way: Apple isn’t offering price cuts on any of its iPhone models, but &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fgifts%2Fshopping-event&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21583458%2Fblack-friday-phone-deals-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you’ll get a $50 Apple gift card with the purchase of one&lt;/a&gt;. This offer applies to any iPhone purchase made from its site between November 27th (Black Friday) and November 30th (Cyber Monday). The gift card can’t be applied to your iPhone purchase, though. It’s for future use.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5 (right) next to the Pixel 4A 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wfdabz"&gt;The Pixel 5 is $50 off its usual $700 price at several retailers, including the Google Store, Amazon, Best Buy, and B&amp;amp;H Photo. For $650, you’ll get the unlocked version of the phone in either the “just black” or “sorta sage” colorway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7I4I1J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503881"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="73BXis"&gt;If you’re on Verizon and don’t mind activating a phone on Verizon to get a deal, you can save an extra $150 on top of that $50 discount at Best Buy. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724683047154502935" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can either opt to pay $500 for the Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; or $20.86 each month for 24 months through a Verizon device payment plan. Taking $200 off the Pixel 5’s regular price is great. You’ll just need to keep the phone on Verizon service for 60 days before it becomes unlocked.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMo6F22IkzAcoSh7DKWTLYxIdjQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21956766/akrales_201013_4137_0263.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G is $200 off for new Google Fi customers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1QAWHG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/pixel-4a-5g"&gt;The Pixel 4A with 5G is $200 off when new customers&lt;/a&gt; purchase it through the Google Fi MVNO service, resulting in a $299 final price. If you’re an existing Google Fi subscriber, you can upgrade to the 4A with 5G and get $150 off, knocking the price down to $349. Not bad, considering that’s the same price as the standard Pixel 4A that doesn’t have 5G support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xu_OpYVoT8q99rvDk68KwlAcCE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21903263/Galaxy_S20_FE_All_Colors.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S20 FE 5G comes in many different colors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;aside id="BJ50ce"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Black Friday deals on Google devices","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21583838/google-android-black-friday-deals-phones-speakers-cyber-monday"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="CDj9op"&gt;Samsung Galaxy phone deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bAr8uD"&gt;The biggest price drops we’d seen to date on Samsung’s Galaxy S20 range of phones happened last week at eBay via the Microsoft Store, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/19/21575049/samsung-galaxy-s20-phones-android-deal-sale-ebay-amazon-bh-photo"&gt;those deals&lt;/a&gt; have yet to be beaten. Currently, the best deal on a new Samsung phone is on the S20 FE 5G, the most affordable option. Normally $700, it’s down to $550 at several retailers, including Amazon, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Best Buy, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MBvGGN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kAf8g5"&gt;I expect (or maybe hope is the better word) to see more price drops on Samsung flagship phones, as well as more budget-friendly options like the Galaxy A51. Though, outside of some carrier discounts with trade-ins, there aren’t many appealing offers now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5PBwp5"&gt;OnePlus phone deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JltxuA"&gt;The OnePlus 8 Pro is $200 off its usual price at Amazon and from OnePlus’ online store. Normally $1,000, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08723GJ2T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $800&lt;/a&gt;. This is OnePlus’ most feature-packed phone yet, containing a 120Hz refresh rate display, wireless charging, 5G support (sub6GHz only for this model), the Snapdragon 865 processor, 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. This deal is available for the “onyx black” and “ultramarine blue” colorways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hhboN3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9628882"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PVErBw7qxKiTr3Cmv3ti313PWXU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19895602/vpavic_042009_3967_0079.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A few variations of the OnePlus 8 are $200 off during Black Friday week, starting at $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KeOREQ"&gt;At the OnePlus site, you can get the standard OnePlus 8 for $200 off its usual price, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Foneplus-8%3Ffrom%3D8&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21583458%2Fblack-friday-phone-deals-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costing $599&lt;/a&gt;. It shares a few similarities to the 8 Pro above, like the Snapdragon 865 processor, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. Though, it doesn’t have wireless charging and its camera array doesn’t quite stack up as favorably. Also, it has a 90Hz refresh rate display compared to 120Hz on the 8 Pro, and the display itself is smaller (about 6.5 inches versus 6.8 inches).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMPXh7"&gt;There’s an even cheaper version of the OnePlus 8 with the same specs, aside from the bump down from 12GB of RAM to 8GB, and from 256GB of storage to 128GB. If you’re cool with that, you can select the “glacial green” color on the same page &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Foneplus-8%3Ffrom%3D8&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21583458%2Fblack-friday-phone-deals-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;to see the price drop to $499&lt;/a&gt; (usually $699).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rhuzzs"&gt;Other phone deals&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The rear cameras on the TCL 10 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k6TnLTo5hshp1MJUM0rCVBlIvzk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19969375/jporter_200507_4019_0001.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jon Porter / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nQPzJs"&gt;You can save on the TCL 10 Pro, one of our picks for the best budget-friendly phones you can buy. Normally $450, it’s $315 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087LZNMYB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724681990259178825" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1567411-REG%2Ftcl_t799b_2alcus11_10l_unlocked_smartphone_128gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21583458%2Fblack-friday-phone-deals-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FTCL-10-Pro-Smartphone-with-128GB-Memory-Unlocked-Ember-Gray%2F574129340&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. This is a very affordable price for a phone with an OLED screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLs7gd"&gt;TCL has also discounted the TCL 10 5G UW on Verizon. If you’re adding a new line of service to your account, you can get this 5G-ready phone that supports both sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G networks for $5 per month for 24 months, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Ftcl-10-5g-uw%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21583458%2Fblack-friday-phone-deals-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;totaling $120&lt;/a&gt; versus the normal $400 cost. This offer is available online only and will last through Cyber Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M30LPX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Flight Simulator gets a big US update just in time for Thanksgiving</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qPxtP6a4M6g282B9Q1Kc3wJiYJs=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67883046/grandcanyon.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="09TouH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is getting one of its biggest updates for the US today, adding nearly 50 points of interest. The White House, Fort Knox, Hoover Dam, and the Las Vegas Strip are among many areas across the US that are &lt;a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/release-notes-1-11-5-0/"&gt;getting updated&lt;/a&gt; with high-resolution points of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="johVCG"&gt;A trailer for the update shows just how detailed some of these updated areas are. The Las Vegas Strip now has a night mode, where the entire strip lights up and it looks incredible from the virtual sky above. The nearby Grand Canyon looks like it will be worth touring inside&lt;em&gt; Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, too. Kennedy Space Center in Florida is also part of the update and looks incredibly intricate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wFbjwYnlWH9iJsFu52xCNz0IV9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22073966/grandcanyon.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grand Canyon in Microsoft Flight Simulator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UQF2ce"&gt;The update arrives just days before Thanksgiving in the US, allowing players to relax at home and fly virtually instead. Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575436/cdc-thanksgiving-coronavirus-covid-19-travel-guidance"&gt;advised people not to travel&lt;/a&gt; for Thanksgiving, citing the spread of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations across the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sl0Wgj"&gt;Alongside the points of interest updates, there are four new airports and a range of performance and stability fixes. Asobo, the developers behind &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, have been gradually improving the PC game in recent months to make it run more smoothly. Today’s update will also improve how streetlights are randomly placed in smaller streets and roads across &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;’s virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon defeats eBay lawsuit over seller poaching</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i7w8SWT4ZEFRUroeWoyJ8OJGfys=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67882624/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="esr8Oo"&gt;Amazon has prevailed in a lawsuit claiming it secretly poached eBay sellers. The companies and a group of Amazon managers filed arbitration updates for two complaints, one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/18/17995636/ebay-suing-amazon-poaching-third-party-sellers-marketplace"&gt;from 2018&lt;/a&gt; and another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/2/20751705/ebay-amazon-managers-lawsuit-poaching-racketeering-fraud"&gt;from 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The complaints alleged that Amazon employees signed up for eBay accounts under false pretenses, then lured eBay merchants to their platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wzoMQ"&gt;In both cases, eBay convinced an arbitration panel that there was a breach of its user contract. But it couldn’t prove it suffered harm as a result, according to documents filed with the &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22072229/2020_11_24_Stanta_Clara_County___Joint_Status_Report_Re_Arbitration_Conclusion.pdf"&gt;Superior Court of Santa Clara&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22072306/d877e6bf_5cf1_423d_8dfa_fb62b9946082.pdf"&gt;California district court&lt;/a&gt;. More generally, eBay was unsuccessful in arguing that Amazon had coordinated a poaching campaign against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCMFc7"&gt;The decisions come as Amazon faces an antitrust probe &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;in Europe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/congress-tech-antitrust-agenda-30a7bcc7-22ee-4897-93ec-99f6aaf577d4.html?utm_campaign=organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=socialshare&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;prospect of greater regulation&lt;/a&gt; in the US. This includes scrutiny of whether it unfairly competes with third-party sellers on its own platform — but not whether it unfairly recruited them from other sites. Amazon declined to comment on the case; eBay didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google says it’s got 400 games in the pipeline for Stadia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6SlH8NSAyZF8Ye-s7CPLjPbkedM=/0x0:1475x983/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67876854/stadia.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eyZPG8"&gt;Google has around 400 games on the way for its Stadia game streaming service, according to Jack Buser, the service’s director of games. Buser gave the figure in an &lt;a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2020/11/19/google-stadia-jack-buser-director-of-games-anniversary-interview/"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;MobileSyrup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where he said that the company has “a roadmap of about 400 games in development from 200 developers” for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CjJXDf"&gt;Buser stopped short of giving specific information on individual games but said that most would be arriving in 2021 and beyond. This list of Stadia games &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/10/stadia-game-list/"&gt;maintained by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, however, includes around 50 unreleased games that have been announced for the service, alongside another 100 or so that are already available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t8S2l7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have a very exciting many years ahead of us.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XZ9exp"&gt;The director used the number of games on Stadia’s roadmap as evidence for Google’s long-term commitment to the platform. Buser said that Google’s planning for Stadia extends into 2023 at this point. “We are looking many years out into the future,” the director says. “Gaming is one of the biggest businesses at Google … Which is why you see us investing so much time and energy to support all these hundreds of developers building all these games. We have a very exciting year ahead of us. And, in fact, we have a very exciting many years ahead of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSET7A"&gt;These games in development include exclusive titles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931295/google-stadia-cloud-gaming-first-party-studios-jade-raymond-interview-exclusive-games"&gt;produced by Google’s own internal game studios&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21323326/google-stadia-exclusive-game-deals-harmonix-rock-band-supermassive-until-dawn"&gt;partners like Harmonix&lt;/a&gt;. The company has made some big hires as part of its first-party development efforts, including ex-Ubisoft and EA producer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18272996/google-stadia-studio-games-entertainment-exclusives-gdc-2019"&gt;Jade Raymond&lt;/a&gt; and ex-&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164801/google-stadia-shannon-studstill-playa-vista-studio-sony-santa-monica-god-of-war"&gt;Sony Santa Monica studio head Shannon Studstill&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tnzYD"&gt;“You’re going to see the amount of exclusive content on our platform scale pretty rapidly,” Buser says. He adds that some “cloud native” titles will be able to do things that aren’t possible on current systems because they’re “free from the limitations of a network appliance in your living room, like a PC or a game console.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMkvQp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Red Dead Online will be a standalone game starting on December 1st</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eSRx5w4RtxpLy_R-eEFpRhjBpSw=/56x0:664x405/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67875884/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TOmDGW"&gt;The multiplayer portion of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18021082/red-dead-redemption-2-review-xbox-one-ps4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will be a standalone game starting next month. Developer Rockstar Games &lt;a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/61801/get-red-dead-online-as-a-standalone-game-on-december-1st"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the mode, called &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Online&lt;/em&gt;, will be available to purchase separately on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC starting on December 1st. (It’ll be playable on the next-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X via backwards compatibility.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvF2Ze"&gt;To start, the game will be relatively cheap: Rockstar will be selling &lt;em&gt;RDO&lt;/em&gt; at an “introductory” price of $4.99. Starting on February 15th, 2021, that price tag will shoot up to $19.99. You may also need to clear out some hard drive space to fit the game, which will clock in at up to 123GB of space. It will also include the option to purchase the main story campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cF8a9s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Red Dead Redemption 2 is the most convincing open-world game ever made","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18021082/red-dead-redemption-2-review-xbox-one-ps4"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mDjIgs"&gt;The news shouldn’t be too surprising, as Rockstar followed a similar strategy with the massively popular online offering for &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; has been a huge success, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21288378/grand-theft-auto-v-5-gta-ps5-2021-release"&gt;a standalone version is coming next year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook tweaked the News Feed to highlight more mainstream news sources for the election</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3KUdPu3nCCcZUP4dnWaTxkVABxw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67871354/akrales_180614_1777_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6x25Yo"&gt;Facebook, in the days after the US election, decided that an uptick in viral misinformation related to election results and President Donald Trump’s refusal to concede needed an extreme measure to be dealt with. So the company made a temporary change to its News Feed algorithm to favor mainstream news outlets, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/technology/facebook-election-misinformation.html"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;published on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKHjhm"&gt;Facebook specifically tweaked how much weight the News Feed gives to “news ecosystem quality” scores, an internet metric designed to quantify the trustworthiness and quality of a news source. That way, users of Facebook would see more news from publishers like &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, CNN, and NPR and less of the hyper-partisan pages that tend to peddle in inflammatory and sometimes downright false or misleading content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LKOBnP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook tweaked the News Feed to favor mainstream news publishers in the days after Election Day&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eIwQFC"&gt;Many of those publishers with poor news ecosystem quality scores happen to be right-wing sites, and many of those right-wing sites have been spreading Trump’s false claims and countless other misleading and dubious election fraud and conspiracy theory stories far and wide on the social network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHZjgS"&gt;The company had been signaling for months that it was preparing for worst-case scenarios like what eventually unfolded when President-elect Joe Biden was declared the winner of the election earlier this month, but Trump to this day continues to try to undermine and overturn the results. Facebook described these scenarios and its tools for combating them as “break glass” plans, according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPN0WS"&gt;One of those plans involved manually tweaking the News Feed. CEO Mark Zuckerberg ultimately authorized the change when presented with findings that right-wing news publishers were seeing huge swells in engagement from unverified stories about election fraud and how Democrats were trying to steal the election from Trump, the report states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnDiXi"&gt;Facebook employees are now asking company leadership whether the changes could stay in place to help promote a healthier and less divisive news ecosystem on the social media network. But executives like News Feed chief John Hegeman tell &lt;em&gt;The Times &lt;/em&gt;that there are no plans to implement any election-related tweaks as permanent changes to the platform. Rather, Facebook plans to study the experiments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3aHmMp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MIVQMa"&gt;Today, let’s talk about the deceptively bold way in which &lt;a href="https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/introducing-spotlight-on-snapchat"&gt;Snapchat has reimagined TikTok as part of its new feature, Spotlight&lt;/a&gt;. A new milestone on TikTok helps to explain the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KT1RP1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PB84hb"&gt;Over the weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/22/21571189/charli-damelio-100-million-tiktok-followers"&gt;TikTok saw its first creator reach 100 million followers&lt;/a&gt;. The creator is Charli D’Amelio, who hit that mark just 18 months after she created her account. That speaks to the broad appeal of her personality and her videos, which often feature popular dances of the moment. The mark also reflects the rapid growth of TikTok, whose shortform videos are rapidly taking over all social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80L2SS"&gt;But in another way, D’Amelio’s achievement wasn’t remarkable at all. In fact, in many ways, it was textbook: a fast-growing new platform, a young and beautiful creator, and recommendation algorithms that drive more and more attention to the early winners over time. YouTube once had human editors choosing videos to go on its homepage; later, it added recommendation algorithms. Both contributed to the rise of early YouTube stars. Instagram often promoted new creators on its own Instagram account; later stars emerged through its recommendations-driven “explore” tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUZSAG"&gt;TikTok’s approach to promoting videos differs from its predecessors in notable ways. It opens to a feed of videos that have been chosen for you based on whatever the app has gleaned about you, whether you follow anyone or not. This following-optional model has meant that the app is as likely to make a star out of a dance or a snippet of audio as it is to make one out of a human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0mVtS"&gt;That’s a primary reason why TikTok now feels like a vital engine of culture in a way that other social networks don’t. Instagram mostly knows how to promote influencers; TikTok, on the other hand, spreads dances, sounds, and jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qieswB"&gt;All of this has had a democratizing effect on the kinds of videos that go viral. The app’s For You feed is one of the most delightfully unpredictable spaces in social networks — even as it learns your preferences, TikTok still manages to surface truly strange and compelling new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qv1EOs"&gt;Yet, despite those differences, TikTok’s influencer economy looks much like any other platform’s. A handful of creators attract many millions of followers; those creators get sponsorship deals; and thus, the rewards to individual users follow a rich-get-richer distribution. Even &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/30/tiktok-creator-fund.html"&gt;TikTok’s plan to pay US creators $1 billion over the next three years&lt;/a&gt; seems designed more to retain top creators than to establish new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ceVnSs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Rc8rSD"&gt;What Snap is asking with Spotlight, the company’s own take on shortform video, is whether you can build an engine for culture that benefits many thousands of people, rather than hundreds. The company’s idea is to replace public follower counts, likes, and comments with something that more closely resembles a lottery — and at least through the end of this year, the company will pay out $1 million a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkvy7S"&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-23/snap-to-pay-1-million-a-day-to-creators-for-spotlight-videos?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Sarah Frier explaining Spotlight in &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="QSkInw"&gt;To earn the money, video submitters to Spotlight don’t have to have large followers — or even have public profiles. Instead, an algorithm will determine what to show Snapchat users based on how often others view the post. If others view the same video repeatedly, for instance, that’s a signal it’s catching on and will spur the algorithm to distribute it more widely. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vFFQZ"&gt;It’s unclear whether the random chance for a big payout will pull users’ great ideas away from TikTok and Instagram, but Snap provides a unique option: a video’s maker can choose to be private, offering a break from influencer culture. Snap has previously benefited by betting on a product that lowers pressure for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ja0cni"&gt;For TikTok to succeed over the long term, it has to retain D’Amelio and its other top creators even as their success continuously brings them new opportunities. For Snap to work, it only has to regularly convince average people to play the lottery in between messaging their friends. This bears close watching. Messaging is the stickiest user behavior that exists, and people &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2012/08/15/health/psychology-playing-lottery-powerball/index.html"&gt;really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like lotteries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOqo3q"&gt;Snapchat has a lot of potential entrants in its daily talent show: 249 million daily users, the majority of which likely live in the countries in which Spotlight will initially be available: the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0rEJt"&gt;The app’s popular map feature has already shown that Snapchat’s community will contribute public posts to the network. Now, with Spotlight, they’ll have an ongoing (if fuzzy and possibly only theoretical) financial incentive to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2Sqnm"&gt;Notably, that incentive is placed at the level of the content, rather than the creator. While some Spotlight posts bear the creator’s name, many really are anonymous — allowing people to profit from their posts without having to develop (and eventually become boxed in by) Snapchat-specific personas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zKQ03Y"&gt;That’s not to say Snapchat couldn’t develop an influencer ecosystem that closely resembles its peers. In fact, the company keeps taking steps in that direction. Earlier this month, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/11/03/snapchat-creators-public-follower-counts/"&gt;Snapchat began allowing its creators to publicly display their follower counts&lt;/a&gt;. Creators with large followings would seem to have an initial advantage in the daily lottery; it remains to be seen how many average citizens will win big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k01b31"&gt;I hope that many do. The real opportunity for Snap here isn’t that it incubates the next Charli D’Amelio in Spotlight — it’s that thousands of creators make real money on the platform, either once or a large handful of times, and we never learn their names at all. That would be something truly new in social networks — intermittent financial rewards just for using the platform as intended. And it would create a popular destination for Snapchat to show ads, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="edmBzE"&gt;Is it possible that daily rewards paid directly to creators could create a healthier network than our current marketplaces for attention? I don’t know — and when I chatted with folks at Snap last week, they admitted to not knowing themselves. But they very much felt that something like this was worth a shot, and so do I. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valorant Champions Tour is a global season-long esports competition for 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wUoA8_2GxtUBGV11AY6nLV5vy_k=/151x0:1770x1079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67870577/Guiding_Light.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="STlEZs"&gt;The professional &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; esports scene is about to get a lot more structured. Today, developer Riot Games announced its plans for competitive &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; in 2021, and it includes a new global tournament series that will see teams play in regional competitions before making their way up to play the best in the world. Riot calls it the &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; Champions Tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wv7ZSm"&gt;While no specific competitions or dates have been announced yet, the competition is divided into three tiers. There are regional “challengers” events, and the best teams from these will move on to three different “masters” competitions, which will serve as the qualifying round for the final global championship event where 16 teams will compete. Riot says tournaments will take place in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YzIRziO89nzfDddzmHPtmIwYm7g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22071928/01_overview_vct_2021_structure_v1.1__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mb2cNp"&gt;The structure sounds similar to &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, also from Riot, which has professional leagues across various regions, and the top teams qualify for the prestigious World Championship at the end of the year. “We’ve spent a couple of years now talking to players, teams, fans, prospective partners, and other stakeholders, and we’re extremely excited to launch our first official season,” Riot’s senior director of esports Whalen Rozelle said in a statement. “Our focus will be on elevating and showcasing the creative and talented players who are shaping this game across the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkIvGl"&gt;Ever since its launch in June (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21249936/valorant-esports-competitive-gaming-sentinels-rob-moore-interview"&gt;and even before&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21280796/valorant-riot-games-launch-overwatch-league-blizzard-esports-competitive-gaming"&gt;the potential for &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; as the next big competitive game has been clear&lt;/a&gt;. The game combines the tactical shooter elements of &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; and the colorful characters of &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240497/overwatch-league-sinatraa-leaving-sf-shock-valorant"&gt;has managed to lure top players from both games&lt;/a&gt;. The esports scene has grown fairly slowly, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292718/valorant-ignition-tournament-series-esports-riot-games-date"&gt;starting with team-run events over the summer&lt;/a&gt;. The first Riot-managed event is slated to take place from December 3rd–8th, with the First Strike tournament, featuring eight teams competing for a pool of $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
