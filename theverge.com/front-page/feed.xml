    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T1uGn4"&gt;Ubisoft and Netflix on Friday shared a first look at a new series based on &lt;em&gt;Far Cry&lt;/em&gt; and announced that &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; is set to debut on the streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdVg4l"&gt;One &lt;em&gt;Far Cry&lt;/em&gt; series is an anime based on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/30/4285712/far-cry-3-blood-dragon-hands-on"&gt;cyberpunk-themed &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;em&gt;Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/far-cry-anime-series-netflix-captain-laserhawk-a-blood-dragon-remix-1234994383/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; describes the show as&lt;/a&gt; “an original anime featuring alter egos of Ubisoft characters in a highly-referenced homage to the early 80s.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgHNl0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix&lt;/em&gt; has been given a six-episode order, according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;. You can get a look at it in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adishankarbrand/status/1403387378874601472"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adishankarbrand/status/1403387541978599429"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt; from creator and executive producer Adi Shankar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qJPqbX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thank you Hugo, Helene, Gerard, and Claire for allowing this Elseworlds inspired craziness to happen. Thank you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Netflix&lt;/a&gt; for seeing the potential in a cyberpunk dystopia set in 1992. After Castlevania I felt it was time to take a big, unexpected, Bootleg Universe pivot. 2/3 &lt;a href="https://t.co/49dm8IyqGg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/49dm8IyqGg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Adi Shankar (@adishankarbrand) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adishankarbrand/status/1403387541978599429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lLoItm"&gt;In addition, Netflix announced that &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Far Cry&lt;/em&gt; series is in the works but didn’t share any details beyond the fact that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1403389020143505410"&gt;it’s in development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rfMzcv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Netflix and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Ubisoft&lt;/a&gt; are developing a brand new Far Cry animated series.  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeekedWeek?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GeekedWeek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/BX4FkS9v5r"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BX4FkS9v5r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1403389020143505410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jkub6h"&gt;Netflix also shared the first look at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348468/netflix-splinter-cell-animated-series-adaptation-witcher-castlevania-john-wick"&gt;upcoming &lt;em&gt;Splinter Cell &lt;/em&gt;animated series&lt;/a&gt; — but it was just the image that you can see &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1403385940031254532"&gt;in the tweet below&lt;/a&gt;. We still don’t know when it’ll be out. I like the style of this one image, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i0j7aE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's your first look at the Splinter Cell animated series, an adaptation of the bestselling &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Ubisoft&lt;/a&gt; game. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Derek Kolstad, creator of the John Wick franchise, is onboard to write the series. &lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeekedWeek?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GeekedWeek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/c3vjJV0wfR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/c3vjJV0wfR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1403385940031254532?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eXAsjS"&gt;The updates on Ubisoft and Netflix’s shows hit as part of Netflix’s Geeked Week event, which also included teasers of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22466235/netflix-the-cuphead-show-geeked-week-teaser-wayne-brady-king-dice"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cuphead Show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22515435/arcane-league-of-legends-show-trailer-netflix-geeked"&gt;animated &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;show &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. One thing Netflix and Ubisoft didn’t talk about was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536079/netflix-assassins-creed-live-action-series"&gt;upcoming live-action &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt;. Seems we’ll have to wait for more details on that show.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple admits why its own Files app was ranked first when users searched for competitor Dropbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GS-K3T8YZ5YQPqrOFrucrnVG1Xk=/0x0:1947x1298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69440655/apple_app_store_wwdc_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qdrjqi"&gt;In 2019, facing down extensive investigations &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-dominates-app-store-search-results-thwarting-competitors-11563897221?shareToken=st44e68b42ce5f45f5bd573dae5f8f0f5c"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/09/technology/apple-app-store-competition.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that showed Apple’s App Store clearly and consistently ranking its own apps ahead of competitors, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20707323/apple-app-store-apps-favor-own-competitors-search-results-deny"&gt;claimed it had done nothing wrong&lt;/a&gt; — a secret algorithm containing 42 different variables was working as intended, top executives told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, insisting that Apple doesn’t manually alter search results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0Q5kC"&gt;Why do I bring this up? An intriguing email chain has surfaced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt; where it sure looks like Apple did the exact opposite — admitting it manually boosted the ranking its own Files app ahead of the competition for 11 entire months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z1mj2y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Who green lit putting the Files app above Dropbox in organic search results?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XUC3pE"&gt;“We are removing the manual boost and the search results should be more relevant now,” wrote Apple app search lead Debankur Naskar, after the company was confronted by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney over Apple’s Files app showing up first when searching for Dropbox. “Dropbox wasn’t even visible on the first page [of search results],” Sweeney wrote. You can read the whole email chain embedded a little ways below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0x5c0n"&gt;As you’ll see, Naskar suggested that Files had been &lt;em&gt;intentionally&lt;/em&gt; boosted for that exact search result during the “last WWDC.” That would have been WWDC 2017, nearly a year earlier, when the Files apps first debuted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUbFBh"&gt;The email chain actually reflects fairly well on Apple overall. Apple’s Matt Fischer (VP of the App Store) clearly objects to the idea at first. “[W]ho green lit putting the Files app above Dropbox in organic search results? I didn’t know we did that, and I don’t think we should,” he says. But he does end the conversation with “In the future, I want any similar requests to come to me for review/approval,” suggesting that he’s not entirely ruling out manual overrides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5WMd4u"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20805886-epic-v-apple-internal-email-chain-re-tim-sweeney-and-app-store-search/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="Epic v. Apple internal email chain re: Tim Sweeney and App Store search (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="990" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b9z2fE"&gt;But Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that what we think we’re seeing in these emails isn’t quite accurate. While Apple didn’t challenge the idea that Files was unfairly ranked over Dropbox, the company says the reality was a simple mistake: the Files app had a Dropbox integration, so Apple put “Dropbox” into the app’s metadata, and it was automatically ranked higher for “Dropbox” searches as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BE236b"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple manually boosts its first-party apps in search results? Funny, I feel like somebody testified under oath that that never happens &lt;a href="https://t.co/mTgnw8d8CK"&gt;https://t.co/mTgnw8d8CK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Troughton-Smith (@stroughtonsmith) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1401905981085343749?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CLrqtE"&gt;I’m slightly skeptical of that explanation — partially because it doesn’t line up with what Naskar suggests in the email, partially because Apple &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; told me it immediately fixed the error (despite it apparently continuing to exist for 11 months, hardly immediate), and partially because the company repeatedly ignored my questions about whether this has ever happened with other apps before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJqqIF"&gt;The most Apple would tell me is that it didn’t &lt;em&gt;manually&lt;/em&gt; boost Files over competitors, and that “we do not advantage our apps over those of any developer or competitor” as a general rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="220iuT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Best case, Apple didn’t notice it was giving itself an unfair advantage until another CEO pointed it out&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CbOYWR"&gt;But honestly, it may not matter whether Apple &lt;em&gt;manually&lt;/em&gt; boosted its own apps or not. What matters is the result: for 11 months, Apple’s new Files app owned exact searches for its competitor Dropbox, a company &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-once-vowed-to-kill-dropbox-now-its-worth-2013-11"&gt;Steve Jobs reportedly swore he would kill off&lt;/a&gt;, and it took the CEO of a prominent Apple partner emailing the company before Apple did something about it. And based on &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s investigation, Apple may not have done much: the Files app still ranked #1 in the App Store for cloud storage in June 2018, a month after this email chain was resolved, according to an infographic that accompanied &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-dominates-app-store-search-results-thwarting-competitors-11563897221?shareToken=st44e68b42ce5f45f5bd573dae5f8f0f5c"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJYQuX"&gt;Besides, the distinction between a “manual” boost and any other kind of boost may be purely academic. Algorithms are written by people, after all. If Apple can build a 42-factor algorithm that gives its own apps favorable results, why would it need to override that algorithm and risk its emails getting caught up in a lawsuit years from now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqVtQu"&gt;It could just tweak that algorithm at will — which is exactly what it did to resolve the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; NYT&lt;/em&gt;’s scrutiny two years ago. It only took a single engineer to change the algorithm in July 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/09/technology/apple-app-store-competition.html"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple’s own apps immediately fell in App Store rankings. But that time, executives said the previous formula wasn’t a mistake. Apple simply wanted to make it look less like its own apps were getting special treatment. So it “improved” the algorithm to achieve the new result it wanted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHf6Te"&gt;Apple provided this statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Vr2d2K"&gt;We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for all developers. App Store Search has only one goal — to get customers what they are looking for. We do that in a way that is fair to all developers and we do not advantage our apps over those of any developer or competitor. Today, developers have many options for distributing their apps and that’s why we work hard to make it easy, fair and a great opportunity for them to develop apps for our customers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>McDonald’s suffers data breach in the US, South Korea, and Taiwan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="INDONESIA-SKOREA-FOOD" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k5ER0XCeH1VBGNS52Mz5cn88Jp0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69440605/1233351203.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KJxIZB"&gt;The fast food mega chain McDonald’s is the latest company to have private data stolen by a third party, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcdonalds-hit-by-data-breach-in-south-korea-taiwan-11623412800?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other recent attacks on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446388/cna-insurance-ransomware-attack-40-million-dollar-ransom"&gt;CNA Financial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;the Colonial Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, McDonald’s claims it isn’t dealing with ransomware, but store information in the US was taken, along with some customer information in South Korea and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DACLL"&gt;The company discovered the data breach after hiring consultants to “investigate unauthorized activity on an internal security system” McDonald’s tells the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;. In the US, the data accessed included business contact information for franchises, the seating capacity of stores, and the square footage of play areas. The South Korean and Taiwanese arms of McDonald’s “had customer personal data accessed” and the company “will be taking steps to notify regulators and customers listed in these files,” the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;McDonald’s stressed that “no customer payment information was contained in these files.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QClik"&gt;McDonald’s says business operations were not interrupted by the data breach and “in the coming days, a few additional markets will take steps to address files that contained employee personal data.” &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;writes these other markets include South Africa and Russia, which were both flagged in the security consultants’ initial investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56eR2Y"&gt;A breach of non-payment data from a restaurant chain like McDonald’s is not as catastrophic as someone swiping credit cards or shutting down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463621/jbs-cyberattack-russia-largest-meat-supplier"&gt;one of the world’s largest beef suppliers&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s yet another example of how large corporations also make large, frequently easy targets for hackers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s an incredibly brief first tease of The Witcher season 2 on Netflix</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Witcher" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g0H3iHXjTu9BZXUKNbvzJICXmGY=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69440495/Witcher_108_Unit_03151_RT.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YmEjzO"&gt;Geralt of Rivia is coming back, and you can get the first look at &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;’s second season in the incredibly brief clip below. It’s focused primarily on Ciri, though it appears there are some secrets hidden in the teaser. You may want to watch it a few times to catch everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8ZNBU3"&gt;

&lt;p id="kjfzRi"&gt;Based on the novels by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;the first season of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; proved to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075927/netflix-the-witcher-viewer-numbers-length-metrics-q4-2019-earnings"&gt;one of Netflix’s biggest hits&lt;/a&gt; when it released at the end of 2019. (It also helped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21043014/netflix-the-witcher-3-henry-cavill-game-steam-twitch"&gt;reinvigorate the &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; video game&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21076980/toss-a-coin-to-your-witcher-stream-spotify-apple-music-netflix-soundtrack"&gt;spawned a viral song&lt;/a&gt;.) Since then, the streaming service has gone about expanding the fantasy universe. In addition to a second season of the main show, there’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21340050/netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-live-action-prequel-announced"&gt;a live-action spinoff set 1,200 years before Geralt’s time&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21077253/witcher-netflix-anime-korean-studio-mir-henry-cavill-live-action-show"&gt;an upcoming anime called &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3CvPU"&gt;Filming of season 2 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/witchernetflix/status/1377971770964242435"&gt;wrapped up in April&lt;/a&gt;. The news was announced as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22448313/netflix-geeked-week-event-the-witcher-sandman-cuphead-resident-evil"&gt;the first week-long Netflix Geeked event&lt;/a&gt;. More info on the show is coming July 9th at an event called Witchercon, helmed by both Netflix and developer CD Projekt Red.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the first teaser for Netflix’s gorgeous Cuphead show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vPDs2QWM2PH4Nwz4GxrGAC57vJE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69440344/Screen_Shot_2021_06_11_at_9.09.41_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;King Dice, voiced by Wayne Brady, in&lt;/em&gt; The Cuphead Show. | Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9rhiP2"&gt;Netflix showed off a brief teaser of its upcoming show based on the game &lt;em&gt;Cuphead &lt;/em&gt;at its Geeked Week event on Friday&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; and just as you’d expect, the game’s old-school animation style looks to translate perfectly into an animated series. Netflix also announced that Wayne Brady will voice the dastardly King Dice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcSnxl"&gt;You can check out the clip, which features Brady’s King Dice, in the video above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0xScZ"&gt;Studio MDHR, developer of the &lt;em&gt;Cuphead&lt;/em&gt; game, first announced that &lt;em&gt;The Cuphead Show&lt;/em&gt; was in the works nearly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687439/cuphead-netflix-cartoon-studio-mdhr-animation"&gt;two years ago&lt;/a&gt;. “Witness the wondrous Inkwell Isles as you’ve never seen them before in an original series inspired by classic animation styles of the 1930s,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StudioMDHR/status/1148577617873920000"&gt;Studio MDHR said in a tweet at the time&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvojbu"&gt;The animation in this teaser looks fantastic, and I think that Brady will be a perfect fit for the role of King Dice. We still don’t know when the show is coming out, but after this clip and the reveal of Brady’s casting, I’m even more excited than I was before. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arcane, Netflix’s animated League of Legends show, is full of grit and rage in new clip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mCMIcQ8ZqK2sEsFxgfQc0wTXB3c=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69440307/E3nMV5vVcAMmo3t.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dhKDV9"&gt;The sprawling fantasy realm of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; is expanding in a big way. At its Netflix Geeked Week, the streaming service showed off a new two-minute clip for &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;, the first animated series set in the world of Riot’s popular strategy game. The show has been in the works for some time: it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915338/league-of-legends-animated-series-fighting-game-cards-arcane-runeterra-project-l-trailers"&gt;first revealed in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417254/league-of-legends-animated-series-arcane-netflix"&gt;earlier this year, Netflix confirmed its partnership with Riot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVjVE8"&gt;According to Riot, the new show is “set in the utopian region of Piltover and the oppressed underground of Zaun, the story follows the origins of two iconic &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; champions-and the power that will tear them apart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXJDYF"&gt;While this is Riot’s first foray into television, &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; is part of a bigger plan to turn &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; into an MCU-style behemoth spanning multiple mediums. There are the games, of course (in addition to the main &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, there’s also a card-collecting spinoff, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358213/league-of-legends-wild-rift-iphone-android-preview"&gt;a recently launched mobile iteration called &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22187980/riot-games-league-of-legends-mmo-greg-street"&gt;a much-anticipated MMO&lt;/a&gt;), along with comic books, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408504/league-of-legends-tellstones-board-game-spinoff"&gt;board games&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336218/league-of-legends-yone-anime-cinematic-riot-games"&gt;shorter cinematics&lt;/a&gt; to introduce new characters or story elements.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jedi: Fallen Order’s next-gen update will let you go from disc to digital</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/osBxaDVg5JFVC1qeBDL_kc-Au7Y=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69440284/DXRYZanw.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tpTQ4Y"&gt;EA released a free next-gen update for&lt;em&gt; Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/em&gt; on Friday, and the announcement comes with good news for people who own a physical copy of the game but have a discless next-gen console: EA will let you convert your physical copy to a digital one so you can take advantage of the upgrade, &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi-fallen-order/news/next-gen-release-details"&gt;the company says in an FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOtDhP"&gt;If you want to upgrade your disc version to digital, &lt;a href="https://help.ea.com/en/contact-us/?product=star-wars-jedi-fallen-order"&gt;click this link to EA’s support website&lt;/a&gt;. If you click on the Digital Edition PS5 or Xbox Series S icons, then “Codes and promotions,” then “Replace disc with code,” then “Select Contact Option,” you’ll be taken to a form to fill out to request your digital code. The form says an EA support representative will email you within 72 hours after you fill it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zw9Pxo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're proud to announce that the next-gen upgrade of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StarWarsJediFallenOrder?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StarWarsJediFallenOrder&lt;/a&gt; is available starting today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get it now on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Already own a copy of the game on console? Your next-gen upgrade is free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Full details: &lt;a href="https://t.co/5dr52XgSvO"&gt;https://t.co/5dr52XgSvO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/sTRJGy2zu9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/sTRJGy2zu9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Respawn (@Respawn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1403353463443034116?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hy44kF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/em&gt;’s next-gen update adds 4K / HDR resolution, improved 60fps performance, and “significantly faster” loading speeds, according to EA. It also adds a performance mode on PS5 and Xbox Series X that runs at a 1440p resolution and 60fps — when turned off, the game runs at a 4K resolution at 30fps. Those options might be disappointing for players who were hoping for a way to play in 4K &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; 60fps on next-gen consoles. And Xbox Series S players won’t be able to pick from either mode; the Series S version of the game will be capped at 1080p / 60fps, EA says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GC3QZq"&gt;You’ll also be able to transfer your saves, and if you do that, unlocked trophies and achievements will carry over, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Air taxi startup Archer shows off small electric aircraft but no flight test</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SnfPxTf6z1z583CTmt8rE46l3yo=/0x0:4884x3256/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69440242/Archer4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rZgwmM"&gt;Archer Aviation, a Santa Clara-based aviation startup, unveiled a new electric aircraft Thursday that it says will serve as the basis for a future fleet of air taxis that will criss-cross cities and help alleviate traffic. But much like the majority of these startups, the company was not able to demonstrate its flying taxis doing the thing they’re supposed to do: flying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvU5Iw"&gt;At an event in Los Angeles Thursday, complete with dramatic lighting, soaring visuals, and even a pair of drummers, the company showed off the 12-rotor aircraft, which it is calling Maker. Clocking in at 1,508kg (3,324lbs), the gleaming silver vehicle looks like an airplane / helicopter hybrid, with two wings sporting six rotors each jutting out from an egg-shaped fuselage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t1SXNz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the gleaming silver vehicle looks like an airplane / helicopter hybrid&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9IAzXP"&gt;It will have a range of 60 miles thanks to a 75kWh battery, and a top speed of 150mph. The entire wingspan is 40 feet. And when cruising 2,000 feet in the air, Archer says that the aircraft will be “100X quieter than a helicopter, generating only 45 decibels of sound” — similar to a loud bird call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PRlusy"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QLC_JNMeLdk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GQuN8t"&gt;Maker is a “full-scale, two-passenger demonstrator aircraft,” said Adam Goldstein, one of Archer’s co-founders. “Its purpose is to serve as a certification test bed, and also to keep pushing our key enabling technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aS7xza"&gt;Archer did not demonstrate Maker’s flight capabilities, though, nor did it say when it anticipated receiving certification for test flights. The company has said it expects to eventually build a five-seater aircraft to serve as the main vehicle in its eventual commercial operation, which it plans to launch in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0VZ31j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The type of aircraft Archer is developing is typically called a “flying car”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8AidXH"&gt;The type of aircraft Archer is developing is typically called a “flying car,” though they rarely resemble actual cars. They are electric-powered, able to carry only a handful of passengers,  and intended for short flights within a city or regionally. Using tilt-rotors, Maker is designed to take off and land vertically like a helicopter and then transition into forward flight like a plane. There are dozens of similar startups building these types of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, but they have yet to be rolled out for commercial service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoMcHJ"&gt;Archer has recently made news for raising $1.1 billion by &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/archer-lands-1-1b-order-from-united-airlines-and-a-spac-deal/"&gt;going public through a reverse merger&lt;/a&gt; with a special acquisition company, or SPAC. The merger, which is valued at $3.8 billion, is also backed by Stellantis, the parent company of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, and United Airlines. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/united-airlines-orders-electric-vertical-aircraft-invests-in-urban-air-mobility-spac.html"&gt;United has placed a $1 billion order&lt;/a&gt; for 200 Archer electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, with an option to purchase 100 more for $500 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzlEpa"&gt;It has also found itself the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22369921/wisk-sues-archer-trade-secrets-theft-flying-taxi"&gt;target of a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; from rival aviation startup Wisk Aero, which accused Archer of stealing its trade secrets and infringing on its patents. Wisk, which is a joint venture between Boeing and Kitty Hawk, recently filed a preliminary injunction to block Archer from using its technology and the US government opened an investigation into the matter. Archer countersued Wisk over “false statements” regarding the criminal probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rv0T5i"&gt;Asked for a reaction to Archer’s unveiling, a spokesperson for Wisk said, “Nothing new was revealed in tonight’s launch. We look forward to continuing our case in court.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2SxBPx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VeM8bX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is trying to dominate watch parties, but it needs more help</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ft-o9a0LPyS-oG4BM2_sWZNV3ZQ=/0x59:941x686/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69440167/download.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SharePlay displayed on an iPhone.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3QfG3e"&gt;Apple is bringing one of streaming’s trendiest features to iPhone users with the debut of SharePlay in iOS 15 later this year, allowing FaceTime users to stream music, online videos, and movies together with friends. The move positions FaceTime to compete more directly with platforms like Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and Houseparty, which all offer ways to video chat while watching things as a group.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It offers Apple a chance to hook a new generation of users on FaceTime — but the service is still missing some key integrations to make that happen, particularly for the teens most likely to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AR91ld"&gt;SharePlay, announced earlier this week and likely arriving in the fall, will allow FaceTime users to share and stream media in real time from an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV. It’s a neat tool for the pandemic era, and it takes inspiration from the watch party modes that &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/hidden-code-on-the-disney-site-suggests-a-watch-party-1844906374"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307519/amazon-watch-party-prime-video-virtual-parties-streaming-netflix-disney-hbo-scener-twitch"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22092452/hulu-watch-party-now-available-all-subscribers"&gt;streaming&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452744/sling-tv-watch-party-live-tv-beta-chrome-available-now"&gt;platforms&lt;/a&gt; — including Disney Plus, Hulu, and Prime Video, among others — added themselves in the last year. For services where it’s not supported, like Netflix, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21307583/watch-videos-movies-online-friends-streaming-netflix-hulu-amazon-scener-extensions"&gt;there are popular extensions&lt;/a&gt; that enable simultaneous streaming and chatting as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WHxU0"&gt;The goal isn’t to compete with those native platforms, though. After all, you’re still watching Hulu, just in a different space. Instead, the update puts FaceTime square against services like Facebook Messenger that dominate messaging and have already been trying to build out co-watching experiences, but without as robust of a service list as Apple has the ability to line up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3uFYit"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SharePlay makes sense for teen streamers, but the feature needs wider app support if it’s going to work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HvQexT"&gt;SharePlay particularly makes sense for the next generation of iPhone users, as teens are more &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/young-americans-watching-online-videos-spike-to-the-highest-rate-ever-2019-10-29"&gt;inclined to watch videos&lt;/a&gt; on their phones. Video-based social media apps like Instagram and TikTok are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/31/17382058/youtube-teens-preferred-platform"&gt;immensely popular&lt;/a&gt; among teens, and an &lt;a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/uploads/research/2019-census-8-to-18-key-findings-updated.pdf"&gt;overwhelming majority&lt;/a&gt; of teens have access to these apps on their own personal smartphones. Video chatting is hugely popular, too, with a &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2015/08/06/teens-technology-and-friendships/"&gt;2015 survey&lt;/a&gt; from Pew Research finding that 59 percent of US teens video chatted with their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DrWEL"&gt;The introduction of SharePlay also jibes with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/apple-plans-notifications-ipad-home-screen-upgrades-for-ios-15?sref=i3mD6rA5"&gt;reported plans&lt;/a&gt; to make iMessage compete more directly with Facebook-owned WhatsApp by becoming more of a social network. It makes a lot of sense that the company would similarly invest in developments for its video-calling product as well, which is just a couple of taps away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCdLPN"&gt;But if Apple wants SharePlay to be a success among the demographic of consumers most likely to use it, it’ll need to expand the number of apps that support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jDU2mj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fewer than a dozen services were included on Apple’s SharePlay slide at WWDC&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fnpZzZ"&gt;Apple said that at launch, Disney Plus, ESPN Plus, HBO Max, Hulu, MasterClass, Paramount Plus, Pluto TV, TikTok, and Twitch will be supported on SharePlay, which is a somewhat limited grab bag of streaming options. Granted, there’s plenty of time for that list to get longer before iOS 15 officially rolls out to users in the fall. And Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that SharePlay will be available to any streaming app that wants to support it, so we’re likely to see wider adoption down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2z7kOl"&gt;Some of the best applications of this feature failed to make their way into Apple’s initial slide of supported services, though. Netflix is perhaps the most obvious of these simply on the basis that virtually everyone has a Netflix login, whether they’re actually paying for it or not (at least until the inevitable &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-netflix-password-sharing-crackdown-has-begun-1846460641"&gt;password crackdown&lt;/a&gt;). But YouTube was not mentioned either, and neither company had comment to share about potential support down the line when contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this week. A spokesperson for Peacock, however, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that SharePlay support was on its “roadmap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7TPW8"&gt;YouTube, in particular, seems like a huge miss for Apple, especially &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/young-americans-watching-online-videos-spike-to-the-highest-rate-ever-2019-10-29"&gt;where teens are concerned&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube hosts just about every digital media format imaginable — music, movies, news, personalities, tutorials, live feeds, etc. — but most importantly, it’s free. As video callers &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2010/10/13/video-calling-and-video-chat/"&gt;tend to skew younger&lt;/a&gt; already, apps with highly shareable content like livestreams seem like the best use case for SharePlay outside of live sporting events. That’s particularly true given that for paid services, each participant in a SharePlay streaming session will need a login for the app. After all, if the tool didn’t require credentials and allowed just anyone to drop in a FaceTime stream of content from a paid service, SharePlay would be a piracy nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="M0YGcs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Are users prepared to pay up just to stream a title with friends?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XiHmsQ"&gt;But that’s part of what makes the practical application of SharePlay a bit of a puzzler. Streaming the game or a movie premiere could get expensive fast. If your friends are watching NFL coverage on Sling TV, you’ll need a $35 subscription to join in (assuming the content is included in one of the service’s base plans). If you wanted to watch a Premier Access release like &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; on Disney Plus, you’d need to pay the $8 monthly subscription cost &lt;em&gt;on top of&lt;/em&gt; an additional $30 early access ticket fee. (A spokesperson for Disney Plus confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that SharePlay users still need to pay for access to watch.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfmiOk"&gt;It’s hard to imagine that most users would pay for a service just to be able to FaceTime while they’re watching a title. Then again, based on recent media consumption trends among teens, maybe SharePlay is part of the future of how entertainment is consumed, at least for the younger subset of Apple users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kWNNec"&gt;It makes sense that a company investing heavily in its services offerings would jump on the watch party trend, if not a little late, and it does feel like a natural way for Apple to not only stay relevant but also sell subscriptions and hardware — even if right now, SharePlay alone seems unlikely to balloon numbers for streaming services. Free, social-leaning services and streaming titans are most likely to see success with this feature, and livestreaming apps seem likely to perform best. But they’ll actually have to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; SharePlay for that to work. As it currently stands, many are not.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney and Starz are in a slap fight over the launch of Star+</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Disney logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eRHm8UO7J3bRudSBnLOolIuYOnQ=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69437050/Disney.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fzm7vK"&gt;Disney is set to launch its standalone Star+ streaming service in Latin America in August, but Starz has filed complaints in Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina alleging Disney is infringing on its brand identity and that the soon-to-launch service will only confuse consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7gmVJ"&gt;In an English language translation of the complaints seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/starz-disney-copyright-suit-star-streaming-service-name-latin-america/"&gt;previously reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wrap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Starz argues that Disney’s “Star Plus” service — which will host content from Disney, FX, 20th Century Studios and National Geographic, as well as Star originals — sounds too phonetically similar to its own StarzPlay offering also available in the regions where it filed its complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohwAQu"&gt;Starz, a premium cable offering and streaming app, has been operating under the name since the mid-1990s and now has a presence in 58 countries. Its own service, StarzPlay, has been available in Latin America since 2019. Disney’s Star — a service offered in international markets and nested within Disney Plus — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165950/disney-star-streaming-service-hotstar-international-movies-tv"&gt;officially launched&lt;/a&gt; in December. Star+, meanwhile, is &lt;a href="https://dmedmedia.disney.com/news/star-plus-arrives-in-latin-america-august-2021"&gt;set to launch&lt;/a&gt; as a single service offering in Latin America on August 31st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zf1RJA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Starz claims Disney’s “Star Plus” sounds too similar to its own StarzPlay service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qwfw3b"&gt;“Both companies are currently direct competitors in the Mexican market, which causes an unfair competition to materialize, especially if it is considered that we are talking about the same services,” the complaint filed in Mexico states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAa0QQ"&gt;Reached for comment, a spokesperson for Starz said the company “had no choice but to defend its rights and attempt to forestall any further customer confusion by filing trademark infringement suits” in Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina against Disney for its use of “Star” and various iterations of the service title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePzdhD"&gt;Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPeJDl"&gt;The company announced in May that its Star+ service would officially roll out to consumers at the end of August. At the time, Diego Lerner, president of The Walt Disney Company Latin America, said in a statement that the service would deliver “a never-before-seen customized experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wy8Ry"&gt;“The strength of the content, that will include all of ESPN, makes Star+ a unique and relevant offering with its own identity that will become a recognized digital service, independent from Disney Plus,” Lerner said. “Having said that, its arrival will represent a service that is complementary to Disney Plus and it will consolidate The Walt Disney Company’s presence in Latin America’s streaming market.”&lt;/p&gt;
