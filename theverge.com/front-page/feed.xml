    <title>Google staffs up to build OS for unknown ‘innovative AR device’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9frQMG"&gt;Google is hiring an “Augmented Reality OS” team focused on building software for an “innovative AR device,” according to job listings &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/13/google-augmented-reality-os/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The team is led by Mark Lucovsky, who announced he’d &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marklucovsky/status/1470528993984081921"&gt;joined the company this week&lt;/a&gt;. Lucovsky previously worked at Meta developing an in-house alternative to Android to power the company’s hardware, and also co-authored the Windows NT operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvN979"&gt;According to Google’s job listings, the Augmented Reality OS team is building “the software components that control and manage the hardware on [its] Augmented Reality (AR) products.” This is far from Google’s first stab at developing AR software, and follows the company’s work on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/29/16219696/google-arcore-augmented-reality-platform-announce-release-pixel-samsung"&gt;ARCore for Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/9/11895368/google-project-tango-name-change-ar-atap"&gt;Tango&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s Google Glass, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21121472/google-glass-2-enterprise-edition-for-sale-directly-online#:~:text=%E2%80%9CGlass%20Enterprise%20Edition,developing%20for%20Glass.%E2%80%9D"&gt;aimed at the business and enterprise market&lt;/a&gt;, is currently built on Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0REbMj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This morning I became a Noogler. My role is to lead the Operating System team for Augmented Reality at Google.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are interested in joining me on this journey, I'd love to talk. Here is a link to one of the many positions I'm working to fill: &lt;a href="https://t.co/a4glyeFxVD"&gt;https://t.co/a4glyeFxVD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/hVAVKcZvQJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hVAVKcZvQJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— mark lucovsky (@marklucovsky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marklucovsky/status/1470528993984081921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GevAyQ"&gt;“We’re focused on making immersive computing accessible to many people through mobile devices,” reads &lt;a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/98805776622985926-senior-software-engineer-embedded-systems-augmented-reality-os/"&gt;one job listing&lt;/a&gt; for a senior software engineer on the team, adding that they’ll be responsible for helping “create compelling AR experiences on highly-customized hardware platforms.” There are other listings for developers focused on camera and input hardware, and some that mention “real-time operating system (RTOS) development.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93CXph"&gt;While most of the positions are based in the US, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes that some are based in Waterloo, Canada. It’s here that North, the augmented reality company behind the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18223593/focals-smart-glasses-north-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Focals smart glasses&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308281/google-north-focals-glasses-purchase-acquire"&gt;Google acquired last year&lt;/a&gt;, is based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bq17fc"&gt;Between that acquisition and these open job positions, it looks like Google is increasingly serious about developing and releasing more AR hardware. The renewed interest can’t come soon enough, with Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;rumored to be releasing a mixed-reality headset&lt;/a&gt; of its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318239/apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022-analyst-kuo"&gt;as early as next year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ma7cgx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAY9QK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo announces Air Glass ‘assisted reality’ device</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LUTMMFUjNxNB3mfUvNkzsXAGqaY=/47x0:1874x1218/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268392/3._OPPO_Air_Glass_Weather_Notification.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2OECP5"&gt;Oppo has announced the Air Glass, an AR device that’ll go on sale early next year. Oppo describes the Air Glass as an “assisted reality” product, as opposed to augmented reality, meaning it projects 2D information into your field of view rather than overlaying 3D objects onto the real world. (Yes, sort of like Google Glass.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZB2rG"&gt;The Air Glass has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 4100 processor and weighs just 30g (about 1oz) in total. Oppo says it should last for 3 hours of active usage and 40 hours on standby. There are two frame designs, a silver half-frame and a black full-frame, and each is available in two sizes. The inside of the frame has a magnetic port that allows it to be attached to more conventional glasses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzzcU6"&gt;The waveguide display uses a tiny projector with Micro LED tech capable of up to 3 million nits peak brightness, though Oppo says the actual brightness will be up to 1,400 nits in average conditions. It can be operated via touch, voice, hand tracking, and head tracking, as well as through a Smart Glass app on a smartphone running Oppo’s ColorOS 11 or above.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lC-mTEjw8u4q7kiM-3yEWhgA6-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086596/4._OPPO_Air_Glass_Teleprompter.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FcQK7P"&gt;Oppo’s proposed use cases for the Air Glass are relatively modest. The company says it can be used for notifications and directions, as you’d expect, as well as features like teleprompting and real-time translation. The display is monochrome with either 16 or 256 levels of grayscale depending on the mode, so the Air Glass isn’t going to be beaming rich content into your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1nrgz"&gt;That said, it probably isn’t going to be a mature, mainstream product, either. Oppo says the Air Glass will receive a “limited release” in Q1 2022, and at least at first it’ll be only sold in mainland China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkNTm1"&gt;The Air Glass was announced as part of Oppo’s ongoing annual Inno Day event. Oppo also revealed its first in-house NPU chip to boost machine learning-related imaging performance; it’s called the MariSilicon X and will feature in Oppo’s next Find X flagship in the first quarter of next year. Last week Oppo confirmed the debut of its first folding phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22825716/oppo-find-n-foldable-inno-day-2021"&gt;the Find N&lt;/a&gt;, though that hasn’t broken cover just yet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nike just bought a virtual shoe company that makes NFTs and sneakers ‘for the metaverse’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="RTFKT made these A16Z sneakers to celebrate a round of venture capital funding" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sdS8bBhL_SCJR28JpM0BInoHx0o=/103x0:1897x1196/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70267765/a16z_rtfkt_sneakers.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;RTFKT made these A16Z sneakers to celebrate a round of venture capital funding | Image: RTFKT&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yzEOPC"&gt;One comparison I’ve heard repeatedly over the last year is that buying NFTs to “flex” on people in the metaverse is just like collecting sneakers, and now Nike is apparently trying to make sure it’s ready for the literal version of that possibility. The apparel giant &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.nike.com%2Fnews%2Fnike-acquires-rtfkt&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22833369%2Fnike-rtfkt-nft-sneaker-shoe-metaverse-company" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just announced the acquisition of RTFKT Studios&lt;/a&gt;, which it calls “a leading brand that leverages cutting edge innovation to deliver next generation collectibles that merge culture and gaming.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vG96Rb"&gt;RTFKT claims that in February, a collaboration with teenage artist FEWOCiOUS to sell real sneakers paired with virtual ones &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLzsM1epvFH/"&gt;managed to sell some 600 pairs/NFTs in just six minutes&lt;/a&gt;, netting over $3.1 million at the time. This was around the same early spring period when most of us were hearing about NFTs for the first time, as Grimes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22308075/grimes-nft-6-million-sales-nifty-gateway-warnymph"&gt;sold some $6 million worth of digital artwork on March 1st&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not clear if any of these digital items are worth as much now; looking at &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/collection/fewocious-x-rtfkt"&gt;OpenSea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/marketplace?artistId=44586&amp;amp;collection=0x948b3515d81034a3c16d5393c6c155946c93c103&amp;amp;niftyType=8&amp;amp;sortBy=recent"&gt;Nifty Gateway&lt;/a&gt; right now, I see a number of them are either listed for or have recently sold for less than their original prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IcfPEE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;RTFKT is now a part of the NIKE, Inc. family.   ‍  &lt;a href="https://t.co/5egNk9d8wA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5egNk9d8wA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— RTFKT Studios (@RTFKTstudios) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RTFKTstudios/status/1470502799498792963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5VYNa"&gt;But forget the past — and that time it photoshopped a pair of its sneakers onto Elon Musk — RTFKT is moving forward, and just yesterday the A16Z-backed startup launched the Clone X NFT collaboration with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, offering up a number of metaverse-ready digital avatars styled with various collectible traits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="d8XGpB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6kp9X"&gt;The company’s website immediately asks visitors to link their Metamask wallets, which is one of the ways NFT owners can verify their purchases, with the idea that at some point in the future you’ll play games or enter other sorts of VR spaces where your items can materialize, once those spaces have read the blockchain to assess which items you own the rights to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbWydT"&gt;This is the kind of vision that Nike is buying into, crediting the company’s founder Benoit Pagotto, Chris Le, and Steven Vasilev with leveraging “the latest in game engines, NFTs, blockchain authentication and augmented reality to create one of a kind virtual products and experiences.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IzT_X4EWOMd3u0EYEvfWABzrO7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086140/logo_lockup_original.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6EZ8Vi"&gt;While announcing the deal — without revealing how much it spent — Nike positioned RTFKT’s lightning bolt-style logo alongside its own iconic swoosh, Jumpman, and Converse marks. Those brands have decades of history, built on high-level athletic endorsements, distinctive designs, and a grassroots culture that actually exists in the real world. RTFKT, meanwhile, was founded in January 2020. It &lt;a href="https://rtfkt.com/aboutus"&gt;says that&lt;/a&gt; “the human development in consciousness has accelerated faster than anticipated. We are here to accelerate our digital future now.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Don’t buy a monitor or TV just for HDMI 2.1 — read the fine print or you might get fooled</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="HDMI cable shutterstock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NoiLrld_4soWZm9maUZYdOLPLwk=/0x2:1000x669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70267757/shutterstock_123837283.1419979871.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;HDMI cable shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UZ1BE5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/6/14189066/hdmi-2-1-specification-8k-10k-vrr"&gt;Four years running&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve been jazzed by the potential of HDMI 2.1 — the relatively new video connector standard that can provide variable refresh rates (VRR), automatic low latency connections (ALLM), and of course, a giant pipe with 48Gbps of bandwidth (and fixed rate signaling) to deliver &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/11/28/16710568/hdmi-new-specification-10k-resolution-future-proof-standard"&gt;up to 10K resolution&lt;/a&gt; and up to a 120Hz refresh rate depending on your cable and compression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G9jw5i"&gt;But today, I’m learning that &lt;em&gt;not only&lt;/em&gt; are all of those features technically optional, but that the HDMI standards body owner &lt;em&gt;actually encourages&lt;/em&gt; TV and monitor manufacturers that have none of those things — zip, zilch, zero — to effectively lie and call them “HDMI 2.1” anyhow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHPdwo"&gt;That’s the word &lt;a href="https://tftcentral.co.uk/articles/when-hdmi-2-1-isnt-hdmi-2-1"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;TFTCentral&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which confronted the HDMI Licensing Administrator with the news that Xiaomi was selling an “HDMI 2.1” monitor that supported no HDMI 2.1 features, and was told this was a perfectly reasonable state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlrNop"&gt;It’s infuriating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Me9HM0"&gt;It means countless people, some of whom we’ve encouraged in our reviews to seek out HDMI 2.1 products, may get fooled into fake futureproofing if they don’t look at the fine print to see whether features like ALLM, VRR, or even high refresh rates are possible. Worse, they’ll get fooled for no particularly good reason: there was a perfectly good version of HDMI without those features called HDMI 2.0, but the HDMI Licensing Administrator decided to kill off that brand when it introduced the new one. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TQsPABErI_3fOzdaoVOa5nebE_w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086035/featuresupport.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See all those “Yes” in the rightmost column? They should read “Maybe”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jy6VwA"&gt;Very little of this is actually news, I’m seeing — &lt;a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1606135005"&gt;we technically should have known that HDMI 2.1’s marquee features would be optional&lt;/a&gt; for a while now, and here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; we’ve seen many a TV ship without full support. In one story about shopping for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;the best gaming TV for PS5 and Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, we characterized it as “early growing pains.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNPCFm"&gt;But now it’s looking like those pains might have just been the start — now that Xiaomi has dipped a toe into murky waters and the HDMI powers-that-be have expressed their support. We confirmed with the HDMI Licensing Administrator that, in fact, Xiaomi is actually doing the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; thing as far as it’s concerned. “Devices can no longer be certified for 2.0,” writes HDMI.org spokesperson Douglas Wright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ADO75T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are all dependent on manufacturers and resellers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vD3MAX"&gt;“Does HDMI have any comment about the consumer confusion that would likely lead to?” I ask via email. “We are all dependent on manufacturers and resellers correctly stating which features their devices support,” Wright adds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0UOuC"&gt;Do you trust your manufacturer or reseller, who fundamentally try to upsell you as often as they can? Or do you think maybe, say, &lt;em&gt;the standards body &lt;/em&gt;should be responsible for making a label that actually means something instead of helping or even pushing companies to mislead you? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkg0YC"&gt;“What about USB?” you might ask. Yep, we’ve been similarly annoyed by USB-C branding, where a single cable &lt;em&gt;could theoretically&lt;/em&gt; let you charge your laptop, transfer up to 20Gbps of data, hook up multiple monitors and even connect to an external graphics card, but might &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; do none of the above. We’ve seen some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/27/18243425/usb-3-2-standard-names-connectivity-cables-innovators-forum"&gt;similar branding shenanigans&lt;/a&gt; from USB, too — like when the USB Implementer’s Forum decided to make USB 3.0 and USB 3.1 suddenly look way better at retail by calling them “USB 3.2 Gen 1” and “USB 3.2 Gen 2”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J320Jh"&gt;But usually, I get the feeling that the USB-IF is at least &lt;em&gt;trying &lt;/em&gt;to allay consumer confusion with new sets of logos and names, even if it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702453/usb-c-pd-240-watt-charging-usb4-data-transfer-logo-branding-standard"&gt;winds up making far too many of them for them to be remotely practical&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXPgqY"&gt;As someone who has twice helped family members understand that the number of megapixels has nothing to do with the processing speed of your phone, this sucks. And that’s before we even consider that buying cables for these devices is also a bit of a shitshow, with very little guarantee that you’ll get a quality HDMI or USB-C cable that can actually offer enough bandwidth (and in the case of USB-PD, enough wattage) to power all the features even if your TV, monitor, and laptop offer them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjHHr0"&gt;Please do better, standards bodies. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG made a battery-powered TV that you can wheel around on a stand</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G3YmNAu4Cw7WAaZGXSAAkReak-Q=/0x0:1977x1318/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70267629/LG_StanbyME_Kitchen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vBexnm"&gt;CES 2022 is only a few short weeks away, and you can bet we’ll see a ton of news surrounding the latest, flashiest TVs with OLED, Mini LED, MicroLED, and more. But before we get there, LG is making an early announcement to put a spotlight on two unconventional TVs that are coming next year in addition to whatever the company has in store for CES. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJvCmz"&gt;To me, the standout is the LG StanbyME, a 27-inch TV that can operate wirelessly on battery power and be wheeled around on its height-adjustable stand. (You can also detach the screen from the stand if you want to plop that sucker onto your lap.) When attached to the stand, the display can swivel, tilt, or be rotated to portrait orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mFLRPL1m3WipfkEQmQkxzaco4vE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084681/LG_StanbyME_Living_Room.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stand has concealed wheels for easy movement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="j5Rgap"&gt;LG says the StanbyME can last for up to three hours on a charge, so while it’ll handle a movie or two without issue, you’ll have to be mindful of runtimes and keep it plugged in for &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; marathons. LG doesn’t make 27-inch OLED panels, so we’re looking at an LCD screen here. The company isn’t yet sharing details on its resolution or other features like HDR.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPk6ImFQcybA8jAvVy488xSKr1o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084689/LG_StanbyME_Patio.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who cares if the display is only 27 inches when you can watch it on a hammock?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wHFzNK"&gt;The StanbyME has a touchscreen interface and will offer streaming apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube. It will also support NFC for smartphone mirroring. As for connectivity, there’s a USB port and at least one HDMI input. And the back of the set has a fabric finish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5SpxLt"&gt;LG is also tonight announcing the Objet, a high-design OLED TV that’s meant to be leaned against a wall instead of mounted or put on a traditional stand. The fabric cover under the 65-inch screen can be raised or lowered with the remote. According to LG, it’s interchangeable and will come in three colors that are all the work of “Danish textile innovator, Kvadrat.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ROSZpXEiyo5nRxsUxNaALG_gbH0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085640/LG_Objet_TV_65Art90_Angle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Object is designed to be leaned against the wall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PwQjqi"&gt;Similar to the ultra-luxury rollable OLED, this gives the TV different modes including Full View, which is self-explanatory, and Line View, which shows widgets like the weather and music when part of the display is covered by the stylish fabric. The Objet feels like an attempt from LG to further take on Samsung’s “lifestyle” TVs like The Frame.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tKGMXD3bCwgEa6Ur8RfmdoiojpY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085645/LG_Objet_TV_65Art90_Front.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fabric cover can slide up so that only a small area of the display is shown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SjhRuj"&gt;The Objet uses an OLED Evo panel, which first debuted in 2021’s G1 Series and offers higher peak brightness than LG’s older OLEDs. As for audio, there’s a 80-watt, 4.2-channel sound system built into the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2juoXb"&gt;LG isn’t announcing pricing or release details for either the StanbyME or Objet right now; we should hear more about them when they’re available to stand around in homes in the months to come. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It seems even Apple’s Eddy Cue can’t find an Xbox without Twitter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Allen &amp;amp;amp; Company Sun Valley Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-sWFywH5tBMJXy4KWTF3Xf80TvY=/0x0:4416x2944/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70267619/996307784.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w2ZUar"&gt;More than a year after their release, the Xbox Series X and Series S consoles are still very difficult to find — and it seems that even Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services, is looking for some tips on Twitter on how to snag one of the elusive consoles. According to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BigTechAlert/status/1470544825212669953"&gt;Big Tech Alert Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, he followed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxStockAlerts"&gt;@XboxStockAlerts&lt;/a&gt;, an account that posts about Xbox console restocks, on Monday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hschjZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cue?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@cue&lt;/a&gt; (SVP Internet Services &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt;) is now following &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxStockAlerts?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@XboxStockAlerts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Big Tech Alert (@BigTechAlert) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BigTechAlert/status/1470544825212669953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0dV5Y9"&gt;There could be any number of reasons why he decided to follow the account. The simplest is that he wants to get a new Xbox; maybe he’s looking to give one as a holiday gift, or perhaps he wants to jump into &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer now that a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829744/halo-infinite-playlists-slayer"&gt;dedicated Slayer playlist is being added to the game&lt;/a&gt;. (Eddy, if you want to play &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; sometime, let me know.) It’s also possible he’s just doing some market research — maybe he wants to see how dire the console shortage really is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VH5586"&gt;That said, I do find this follow quite funny. Cue, as a very senior Apple executive, presumably has contacts or the means to scrounge up an Xbox Series X without the need to rely on a Twitter account. But maybe things are bad enough that he really does have to use this account to procure a &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; machine for the holidays. (After all, playing big Xbox- exclusive games on an iPhone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826297/microsoft-xbox-xcloud-streaming-exclusives-iphone-ipad-gamepas"&gt;isn’t as easy as it could have been&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air and new iPad Mini have the same design and shape as the iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OqDG5sf2dQljUBF65yxBXRiy6oE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select iPad models go on sale quite regularly.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;We saw some of the best iPad deals of the year during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but if you missed out, there are still a couple of decent discounts available. Whether you’re after the high-end iPad Pro or the most affordable Apple tablet, the entry-level iPad, there’s a sale going on somewhere you may be interested in. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed each iPad model that is currently available, some of which are outgoing models with freshly introduced replacements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ehglg9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="jzeS15"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10754964"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best iPad (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;Announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;the September iPhone 13 event&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"&gt;2021 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s latest entry-level tablet and replaces the outgoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;eighth-gen model from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, this would leave the older model ripe for the picking as retailers may drum up some fire sale pricing to get rid of old stock, but at this time, there are no good deals to be found on the eighth-gen model, if you can even find it. As a result, you can feel comfortable steering clear of the 2020 version and get the latest and greatest of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZ13y"&gt;The new, ninth-generation iPad starts at $329, just as its predecessor, though the base model now has &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; instead of 32GB. You can also still opt for the model with &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWwO2PdJE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $479. If you prefer your iPad to include cellular connectivity, the 64GB, LTE-equipped configuration runs $459 and the 256GB variant is $609. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMpIom"&gt;The updates for the 2021 model include a faster A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP ultrawide camera with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt;, a feature designed for keeping you framed up and centered while on video calls. Many other features carry over from its predecessor; the new entry-level model has the same 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qnjdLM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1219877/9383?subId1=TheVergeBestiPadDealsDecember&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Silver%2F674982024&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have previously discounted both Wi-Fi models of the new iPad by $30, which is the steepest discount we’ve seen yet. While Walmart’s listing with that price is still up, the deal appears to have sold out, and other retailers aren’t currently offering comparable sales. If you’re looking for a deal, however, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWwO2PdJE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is selling the new 256GB variant with six-month subscriptions to both Apple Music and Apple News Plus. Note that these freebies are only available to new subscribers, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MKkmFl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the $329 iPad compares to its last-gen predecessor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"},{"title":"Apple says the iPad Mini’s jelly scrolling isn’t a problem that needs to be fixed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698590/apple-ipad-mini-jelly-scroll-issue-response-fix-lcd-technology"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2019) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KUcr6D"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; from 2019 has the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations but with refreshed internal specs. It could be a good choice for fans of the classic home button, Touch ID, and a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;We’ve seen the outgoing 64GB iPad Mini with its older A12 Bionic processor drop to as low as $299, and the 256GB model was recently on sale for $495 instead of $550. At the moment, however, we’re not seeing any discounts on the older iPad Mini. Many retailers have discontinued selling the last-gen model, and even refurbished versions are becoming more difficult to find. If you have your eyes set exclusively on the 2019 model, however, Apple is currently selling a refurbished, Wi-Fi-equipped model with 256GB of storage in rose gold for &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1186596/7613?subId1=TheVergeiPadDealRoundup121321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FFUQY2LL%2FA%2FRefurbished-iPad-mini-5-Wi-Fi-64GB-Gold" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$469&lt;/a&gt; instead of $549.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6tfbCt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="njqbEo"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jTw4HZ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sixth-generation iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; has a larger screen, a top-of-the-line processor, support for USB-C, and options for 5G. It has sadly forfeited its headphone jack in the process, but overall it’s a solid device that brings a fully refreshed design to Apple’s small tablet form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBkkEE"&gt;The changes and refinements to the new iPad Mini come at a heftier price, however, and the new 64GB Wi-Fi model now starts at $499. Electing 256GB of storage brings the price up to $649, while the 5G cellular models are $649 for 64GB and $799 for 256GB. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want the latest and greatest from Apple in a smaller format, this is where the action is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NMDW5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zw4xQv"&gt;Right now, there are no discounts to be had on the sixth-gen Mini. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUz2VOgrdA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, however, will throw in six months of Apple Music and Apple News Plus — as well as three months of Apple TV Plus —when you purchase the iPad Mini at full price, assuming you’re a new subscriber. If the prior-generation iPad Mini has given any indication, deals on the 2021 iPad Mini might be light and infrequent moving forward, partly because it has such minimal competition in its product segment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KGao5s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;The best iPad Air (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. Apple has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, too, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-generation iPad Air comes in 64GB and 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at around $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than the prior gen. The units equipped with LTE start at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2yrbb"&gt;We’ve previously seen the base model drop to as low as $489. While it’s currently not available for that cheap, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B08J6FD94H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wi-Fi-equipped model with 64GB of storage in green for $569.98&lt;/a&gt;, a modest 5 percent off the typical list price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-generation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; came out earlier this year, which means there are many deals to be had on the prior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-generation iPad Pro looks nearly the same as the 2018 model, when this design was first established, aside from a dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike some of the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10917835"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance but only if you’re interested in buying the massive 1TB variant. Right now, Best Buy is selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcpPjgDOGe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB, Wi-Fi-equipped variant&lt;/a&gt; for $1,099.99 instead of $1,299.99. Additionally, Best Buy will throw in a six-month subscription to Apple News Plus and Apple Music, if you’re a new subscriber, as well as three months of Apple TV Plus. If you prefer the 12.9-inch, 256GB model with Wi-Fi, it’s currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553828-REG%2Fapple_mxat2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; for $929 instead of $1,099.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important factor to your purchasing decision, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch 2021 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-gen model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to produce deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — as well as new features like Center Stage. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12.9-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kIHPXF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mini LED display reportedly coming to 11-inch iPad Pro next year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569690/mini-led-11-inch-ipad-pro-macbook-air-2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="I5hP3e"&gt;If the latest model is what you desire, the 11-inch, 128GB iPad Pro with Wi-Fi starts at $799. While we’ve previously seen the price of this model drop to as low as $649.97, right now Amazon is only selling it in silver for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-11-inch-Wi%E2%80%91Fi-128GB/dp/B0932B5NVD?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$749&lt;/a&gt;, which is a modest $50 discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yhnrgA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10840379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Hyundai Ioniq 5 pricing starts at $39,700</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B0cCFmZkcJS7bof-LOA3dUBzIgc=/0x343:8272x5858/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70267438/Large_45017_HyundaiIONIQ5RedefinesElectricMobilityLifestyle.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RaOw13"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"&gt;The Ioniq 5&lt;/a&gt; is Hyundai’s first electric car built on the company’s new E-GMP platform, and its price tag has finally been confirmed. A &lt;a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3466"&gt;press release from Hyundai&lt;/a&gt; reveals that the Ioniq 5 could set you back anywhere from $39,700 to $54,500, depending on which model you choose (via &lt;a href="https://www.evpulse.com/news/hyundai-prices-2022-ioniq-5-and-its-right-on-the-money"&gt;&lt;em&gt;EV Pulse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9ZLbp"&gt;And although Hyundai recently announced the Ioniq 5 has an &lt;a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3463"&gt;EPA-rated range of 300 miles&lt;/a&gt;, that range is only available with select models (which we’ll go over here). It’s also important to note that the prices listed here don’t include the vehicle’s $1,225 destination charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="F3blCz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The base SE Standard Range is the cheapest of the bunch, but won’t be available until next year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kjcLOi"&gt;In total, there are seven different variations of the Ioniq 5, and three trim packages: the SE, SEL, and Limited. The base SE Standard Range is the cheapest of the bunch, as it comes with a 168 horsepower (HP) rear motor, and a 58kWh battery that’s estimated to last 220 miles on a full charge. This model is set to become available sometime in the spring of next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnEaPK"&gt;The rest of the lineup comes with a larger, 77.4kWh battery, and your choice between rear-wheel drive (RWD) and all-wheel drive (AWD) drivetrains. The AWD versions are more expensive and come with dual motors, as well as have 320HP and an EPA estimated range of 256 miles. On the other hand, the RWD versions have 225HP and are expected to last 303 miles on a single charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4a62T"&gt;The mid-range Ioniq SE costs $43,650 for the RWD version and $47,150 for its AWD counterpart. Meanwhile, the SEL has a $45,900 price tag for the RWD variant and $49,400 for the AWD model. On the higher end of the scale, the Ioniq Limited RWD will cost you $50,600, while the AWD version is priced at $54,500. Unlike the SE Standard Range, the rest of these models should be available later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Xzyi6"&gt;Despite the difference in prices, all trims still come with 350kW DC fast charging, along with a “vehicle-to-load” system, which lets you charge electronics, power small appliances, as well as juice up other EVs. It’s also important to keep in mind that you may be able to receive up to $7,500 in tax credit after purchasing an Ioniq, making its price even lower.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SharePlay is now available on Macs as part of the latest macOS Monterey update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-VtpFJH48wkOgRJHiBnaNot5ctU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70267350/akrales_211028_4820_0680.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a8AOYW"&gt;Apple has brought SharePlay to the Mac as part of macOS Monterey 12.1, which was released Monday. With SharePlay, you can now enjoy entertainment like movies, music, and games synchronized with your friends over FaceTime while on your Mac. (You can see a list of &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1583059388"&gt;some supported apps here&lt;/a&gt;.) And if you want to share your screen with your group, SharePlay supports that as well. My colleague Monica Chin ran &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;into some issues&lt;/a&gt; with SharePlay on Mac while the feature was in beta, however, so hopefully it works more smoothly now that it’s available widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rvlAc"&gt;macOS Monterey 12.1 adds some features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22828226/apple-ios-15-2-iphone-update-digital-legacy-music-macro-app-privacy"&gt;also found in iOS 15.2&lt;/a&gt;. There’s the new Apple Music Voice Plan, a more affordable tier of the music streaming service that lets you access music with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734185/new-apple-music-voice-plan-price-features-app"&gt;just your voice and Siri&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll be able to designate people as Legacy Contacts who can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774873/apple-digital-legacy-program-comes-to-ios15-iphones-macs"&gt;access your iCloud data when you die&lt;/a&gt;. And Apple will now let parents enable warnings that appear when their children receive or send iMessages with nude photos.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLznrt"&gt;The new version of Monterey is still missing one big feature, though. Universal Control, which lets you use one mouse and keyboard across Macs and iPads, was supposed to launch this fall, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832765/universal-control-apple-macos-monterey-ipad-delay-spring"&gt;Apple delayed it Monday to “this spring.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp will hide your ‘last seen’ status from strangers by default</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Ocq41MK2VZ91EjhSM1nGbWy9sk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266874/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gdFpBh"&gt;WhatsApp is rolling out a new privacy measure that hides your “last seen” status from people you don’t know or haven’t chatted with in the app (via &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-enabling-new-privacy-measures-to-protect-users/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Previously, WhatsApp set the feature on “Everyone” by default, allowing anyone on WhatsApp to see your status. WhatsApp’s new update limits the visibility of your status to the people you’ve added on the platform, and sets the feature to “My Contacts” by default instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e0R8XP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It’s a new security feature. Got this reply from support today. If the person has not got your number in their contacts, or you haven’t sent one message between you, last seen/online is no longer visible. &lt;a href="https://t.co/qLPtC6rPOA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qLPtC6rPOA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PsyColette     (@NiHaolain) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NiHaolain/status/1468281924057763849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9cK1lf"&gt;In a post on Twitter, a user explains that you may not be able to see other people’s statuses on the platform anymore, and also includes an email from what appears to be WhatsApp support that describes the new feature. “We’re making it harder for people you don’t know and haven’t chatted with from seeing your last seen and online presence on WhatsApp,” the email reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M8eSq1"&gt;The “My Contacts” option for your “last seen” status was already available, but it’s never been the default on the app. It’s also worth noting that WhatsApp already has a “Nobody” option as well, preventing all users from seeing your status. Your status on WhatsApp lets other contacts know when you were online last, or if you’re currently using the app. While this may seem like a harmless way to keep track of your friends and family (and vice versa), &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; points out that some third-party apps actually exploit this feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iGOPT"&gt;These apps can aggregate the statuses of certain users, which may enable some to keep a little too close of an eye on others using the platform. Turning on the “My Contacts” options prevents third-party apps from logging your online status, as an app isn’t considered one of your contacts, and therefore, it won’t be able to see your status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuetcX"&gt;This isn’t the only change WhatsApp is making to its “last seen” status. In November, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp-new-last-seen-privacy-option"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that the messaging app began testing an option, called “My Contacts Except ... which lets users hide their status from certain contacts. WhatsApp has also been working to bolster user privacy by introducing an option to make its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820138/whatsapp-disappearing-messages-by-default-24-hours-90-days"&gt;disappearing messaging feature the default&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJ6gt4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
