    <title>Uber is buying alcohol delivery service Drizly for $1.1 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ff93fbRwjs80mdvjuOeICx1SSpc=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756963/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xBY8kV"&gt;Uber &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210202005693/en/Uber-to-Acquire-Drizly"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s buying alcohol delivery service &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrizly.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F2%2F22262155%2Fuber-drizly-alcohol-delivery-service-eats-postmates#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Drizly&lt;/a&gt; in a deal worth $1.1 billion, as the ride-sharing company continues to build out its stable of food and other delivery services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDUnmd"&gt;The eventual plan is for Drizly’s marketplace of beer, wine, and liquor to be integrated into the existing Uber Eats application, giving Uber users a one-stop shop for both food and drink deliveries. The existing Drizly app will stick around, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IiyziZ"&gt;Drizly is effectively an online delivery storefront for existing local liquor stores. The company partners with local sellers and then enlists delivery drivers — similar to Uber Eats — to actually handle the delivery. The service is now available in over 1,400 cities across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="inNQlC"&gt;The deal marks the latest delivery-focused move on Uber’s part in recent months, even as it’s begun to sell off the less profitable parts of its business. Last year alone saw Uber sell off its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;autonomous vehicle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22086597/uber-sells-flying-taxi-elevate-joby-aviation"&gt;flying taxi divisions&lt;/a&gt; as it sought to be more profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFa1JV"&gt;Those moves, however, followed Uber’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287128/grubhub-just-eat-takeaway-merger-uber-deal-antitrust"&gt;failed attempt&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21255936/uber-grubhub-offer-buying-all-stock-delivery-service-eats-meals-merger"&gt;purchase GrubHub&lt;/a&gt; last year, along with a successful acquisition of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21312447/uber-postmates-acquisition-announced-food-delivery"&gt;Postmates over the summer&lt;/a&gt; for $2.65 billion. The company has also recently started to move into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315159/uber-grocery-delivery-launch-cornershop-latin-america-canada"&gt;on-demand grocery delivery&lt;/a&gt;, beginning in Latin America and Canada, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fuber-health-expands-to-include-prescription-delivery%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F2%2F22262155%2Fuber-drizly-alcohol-delivery-service-eats-postmates#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;expanded its Uber Health service&lt;/a&gt; to add prescription delivery. The acquisition of Drizly would fit neatly into the expanding delivery-focused approach for Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQHCSb"&gt;It’s a strategy that makes sense. While futuristic projects like self-driving cars or on-demand flying taxis sound cool on paper, neither has resulted in any real profitable products. And in a bruising 2020 that saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551683/uber-q3-2020-earnings-revenue-loss-delivery"&gt;Uber post record losses&lt;/a&gt; as travel plummeted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, delivery services remained a bright spot on Uber’s ledger, growing massively, thanks to a similar COVID-induced spike in customers wanting to order in more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sCNY4"&gt;Notably, these new delivery services are all businesses that rely on contract workers. Uber recently spent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551136/uber-prop-22-victory-national-q3-2020-earnings"&gt;millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; as part of a lobbying campaign in California to avoid classifying those workers as employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;through Prop 22&lt;/a&gt; (A group of Uber and Lyft drivers are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227042/uber-lyft-prop-22-lawsuit-overturn-drivers-california"&gt;currently suing&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that it “illegally” excludes drivers from California’s workers’ compensation program.) That’s in contrast to the parts of the company that Uber is winding down, like the autonomous vehicle program, which relied on full-time employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qau3U9"&gt;Uber and Drizly expect the deal to close sometime in the first half of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eero’s Wi-Fi 6 mesh router bundle is back down to its Black Friday price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mx-AgO4e23KUuYC6t-T4AOirH4E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756937/dseifert_191008_3720_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8OCEr0"&gt;Black Friday 2020 saw many great deals, especially on Eero’s products. If you are looking to improve your Wi-Fi situation at home, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-eero-6-3-pack/dp/B085WSCTS4?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=be0daa10b51fb94192247b0f9b3fa744&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725880696356465941" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have the Eero 6 mesh router three-pack (which includes one mesh router and two extenders) back down to its Black Friday price of $223, a nice drop from its usual cost of $279. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkQbdA"&gt;When planning your setup, keep in mind that while the Eero 6 mesh router includes two Ethernet ports, the two Eero 6 extenders that come in this bundle do not include any. Alternatively, you can buy two &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eero-6-Router/dp/B085VM9ZDD?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=0f0775c8ab5999fe980102572df0f698&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eero 6 routers&lt;/a&gt; for $206 if you want to wire Ethernet to your routers across different areas in your home. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Glitch in the Matrix is quirky, creepy, and way too unreal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Glitch in the Matrix screenshot" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Jbo2v6RGy54k9tzfbwNIZ9K3Vw=/286x0:2014x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756897/50610561366_c27761b7b5_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sundance Institute&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tVA928"&gt;In February 2003, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/story/the-matrix-made-me-do-it"&gt;a 19-year-old named Joshua Cooke&lt;/a&gt; shot his parents to death in their Virginia home. Cooke told his lawyers that he believed he was living in the Matrix, a simulated universe outlined in the 1999 Keanu Reeves blockbuster of the same name. Cooke pleaded guilty, and the defense was never used. But years later, he still offers a chilling, painful account of the moment he realized that killing another human being felt nothing like an action movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZNELH"&gt;This is arguably a spoiler for &lt;em&gt;A Glitch in the Matrix,&lt;/em&gt; a new documentary about the simulation hypothesis — the idea that our reality is actually artificial. But it’s key to explaining why the movie never comes together. &lt;em&gt;A Glitch in the Matrix&lt;/em&gt; is a quirky overview of a popular and intriguing philosophical conundrum: what if we’re living in a video game? It’s also a film about people who take that conundrum &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; seriously. But it never reconciles those elements. It’s like watching a dinner party conversation about paranormal activity where one guest is sharing wrenching stories about the spirits of dead loved ones and the other is quoting lines from &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6y5WhG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The most interesting sections describe how believing in a video game can change your life&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9Iv6nc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Glitch in the Matrix&lt;/em&gt; is directed by Rodney Ascher, known for acclaimed documentaries &lt;em&gt;The Nightmare&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Room 237&lt;/em&gt;. The film is framed by a &lt;a href="https://www.openculture.com/2014/02/philip-k-dick-theorizes-the-matrix-in-1977-declares-that-we-live-in-a-computer-programmed-reality.html"&gt;1977 lecture from&lt;/a&gt; science fiction author Philip K. Dick, who became convinced of the simulation hypothesis after an anesthetic-fueled religious experience. Its core is extended interviews with a few present-day believers who have had metaphysical epiphanies, appearing through Zoom calls where they’re obscured by sci-fi cartoon-character overlays. Gradually, they lay out their own reasons for believing in a virtual world where other people may or may not actually exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n98nHg"&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;Room 237&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/12/4216422/room-237-director-rodney-ascher-weird-world-shining-conspiracy-theories"&gt;gave obsessive &lt;em&gt;Shining&lt;/em&gt; fans space&lt;/a&gt; to present elaborate theories about its meaning, &lt;em&gt;A Glitch in the Matrix&lt;/em&gt; offers a smorgasbord of justifications for a simulated universe. You’ll find sober probability estimates from philosopher Nick Bostrom, who &lt;a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/symbsys205/BostromReview.html"&gt;popularized simulation theory in a 2001 essay&lt;/a&gt;, alongside speeches from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837874/elon-musk-says-odds-living-in-simulation"&gt;well-known proponent Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; and clickbait pseudoscience like the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory#Manifestations_and_types"&gt;Mandela Effect&lt;/a&gt;, which posits that widely misremembered pop culture references are evidence of parallel realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCkOcR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Glitch in the Matrix&lt;/em&gt; suffers from having woefully little reality, though&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The Zoom interviews are understandable during the COVID-19 pandemic, but they’re frustratingly abstract, offering no sense of what it means to actually live your life convinced the world is fake. Instead, the film is mostly spliced together from low-budget animations and copious movie and video game clips. The most compelling details get only a passing mention — like a participant who mentions motivating himself to “level up” in life and try new things, reasoning that this will make him more interesting to an otherworldly observer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sbSfoH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Why can’t you make friends? Because nobody else is human&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BwUdYA"&gt;Beyond any factual arguments, the simulation hypothesis seems to offer reassuring answers in a scary and irrational world. Why do celebrities senselessly drain their bank accounts or torch their reputations? Because they’re being controlled by a bored player character. Why would a suicidal man &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/authorities-probe-how-airline-employee-could-steal-plane/"&gt;steal and crash an empty plane&lt;/a&gt;? Because he knew he could just log out. Why can’t you make friends? Because nobody around you is really human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p49pcU"&gt;As the last question suggests, this path can lead to some very dark places. At least one participant acknowledges that his convictions might stem from social anxiety. &lt;em&gt;A Glitch in the Matrix&lt;/em&gt; briefly references &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/17991274/npc-meme-4chan-press-coverage-viral"&gt;the nihilistic 4chan “NPC” meme&lt;/a&gt;, which (although the film never mentions it) far-right partisans adopted to paint political enemies as literal automatons. And then there’s Cooke — whose killings seem motivated more by straightforward mental health problems than sci-fi delusions, but who methodically details how &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; consumed his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxHWrw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Glitch in the Matrix’s&lt;/em&gt; version of simulation theory is basically intelligent design for sociopaths. The film’s most interesting parts are about why people believe it, not whether it’s true. But it spends far too long on scattered and remarkably unconvincing arguments  presented with a tone of wide-eyed, innocent fascination — a tone that, as figures like Cooke enter the picture, feels increasingly distracting and downright creepy. And if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think other people are real, &lt;em&gt;A Glitch in the Matrix&lt;/em&gt; probably won’t persuade you otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney’s bundle that includes Disney Plus, ESPN Plus, and ad-free Hulu is widely available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Disney Plus ESPN Plus Hulu bundle" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6SyVFika6QNAtrsLfP3BnsLZZ1E=/0x35:1396x966/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756862/disney_plus.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qAanMQ"&gt;Disney’s latest bundle combining Disney Plus, ad-free Hulu, and ESPN Plus for $18.99 per month is now available. This package was first announced in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168484/disney-streaming-bundle-ad-free-hulu-disney-plus-espn-price-release-date"&gt;December 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and it actually first started rolling out for new subscribers to Hulu. The news today is that the &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/707630/9358?sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sign-up page is accessible to more people&lt;/a&gt; looking to subscribe. The cheaper bundle that includes Hulu with ads sprinkled in is still available for $12.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeI8jl"&gt;This is a good value for people who’ve been patiently waiting (since Disney Plus launched in late 2019) for a bundle that includes the ad-free version of Hulu. With this one, you’ll save about $6 per month by getting all three of these services. Purchased outside of a bundle, Disney Plus costs $6.99 per month, ESPN Plus is at $5.99, and ad-free Hulu is $11.99 each month. So, it’s like you’re getting the ESPN Plus service for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbocjK"&gt;Now is an especially good time to consider jumping on, as Marvel Studios’ debut TV show, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/disney"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is running through its first season and seems to be worth watching. The next big Disney film to hit the service (and theaters simultaneously), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22250271/raya-and-the-last-dragon-trailer-watch-disney-plus-premier-access-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;will launch on March 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="YaRPtx"&gt;

    <title>PS5 exclusive Destruction AllStars is the next generation of car crashing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PUKLj1tgEL-LMDGLwCrX6YZnkb4=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756633/destruction_all_stars_screenshots_21_disclaimer_ps5_en_15oct20.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h3OjN9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; is a game about smashing cars. It’s right there, the first word in the title. It’s also a major milestone for the PS5 — a huge exclusive that’s solely on the next-gen console that isn’t a remake or stretching across generations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEbQgr"&gt;It’s a title that will, by necessity, be used to showcase what kind of games developers can make when given free rein of the PS5’s new features and firepower. But smashing is still the heart of &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt;: so much so that the seed of the game was a simple idea. “Imagine how awesome we can make damage on PS5,” John McLaughlin, a senior producer at Sony XDev, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OOBacu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Imagine how awesome we can make damage on PS5.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j0Rifx"&gt;It was a short jump from there to partnering with Lucid Games for development, given the studio’s heritage. Game director Colin Berry had previously worked on Sony’s &lt;em&gt;Wipeout&lt;/em&gt; series, while other Lucid members came from other classic car games, like &lt;em&gt;Metropolis Street Racer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Project Gotham Racing&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;MotorStorm&lt;/em&gt;. “One thing that was for sure was that these guys knew cars,” says McLaughlin. “And then we basically went to those guys with that seed and said ‘We want to do something on PS5, with lots of destruction and cool stuff — what’s your idea, what’s your pitch?’”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vXKOdQzjfzAyreLvpNVZ0H-IBAo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22274479/50566903546_1016acafc5_k.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oweytX"&gt;The Lucid team returned with a different kind of combat car game. As McLaughlin explains, “They came to us, not so much with &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; — the name came later on — but they came with the pitch of a game that featured cars, featured loads of destruction, [and] encouraged destruction. It wasn’t about hiding from the destruction, it was all about smashing and racking as fast as you can, and so on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWD0aG"&gt;The other goal was to raise the bar for a destruction derby-style game. While older games would cheat at showing damage or debris, hiding behind texture swaps or low-resolution polygons, &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; tries to offer a better experience, according to Berry. “Regarding the PlayStation 5 and what we were told about the specs early on, that we could look at doing deformation and damage and the physics in a way that we haven’t done before, and to a level that we haven’t done before. So, the crumpling of the cars, the amount of parts of each car is made up, all of these wrecks, we can really push the bolt on those kinds of things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XjZ0rn"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6kP3G5vO49A?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2IoEDQ"&gt;That level of detail in the titular destruction is a big part of why &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; is limited to just the PS5 — even when a PS4 port would have opened up the game to more players, a key thing in a game that’s heavily focused on multiplayer modes. A PS4 version just “wouldn’t have performed the same in terms of the damage and the defamation and the physics, actually in the game,” says Berry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRWg9T"&gt;The flip side of that exclusivity, of course, is what happens to &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; next. As a free PS5-exclusive title on offer through PlayStation Plus for the next two months, it’ll be virtually guaranteed a huge opening audience, much in the same way that previous PS Plus hits like &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355586/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-pc-ps4-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have achieved. &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; went on to become an internet sensation, with massive esports tournaments that are still popular even years after release. &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, has largely faded into the background, hamstrung by new content that trickled out too slowly to keep most players’ interest after the first few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7If8bX"&gt;“We have a plan, we have a roadmap, not just for the ... launch window of the game, but for the first three, four weeks down the line, for a couple of months down the line, for the next year,” says McLaughlin, with new characters, new game modes, and more all planned for free in the future. “We’ve got a plan on a schedule of content over the coming year that I think is going to keep people entertained and engaged and keep them coming back and wonder what they’re dropping this week, and wonder what they’re dropping next week.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZ7Svu"&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;em&gt; is available as a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534475/destruction-all-stars-ps5-launch-title-delayed-ps-plus-february-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;free download for PlayStation Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; subscribers on the PlayStation 5 for the months of February and March. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7IMip"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comcast is doubling the speed of its low-income internet plan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nxGNPSXrwQv2VD0ZCuBVCe-jrQI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756638/acastro_180525_1777_comcast_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yXyH2U"&gt;Users of Comcast’s Internet Essentials plan will be getting a significant speed increase on March 1st. The service, which currently runs at 25Mbps, will be automatically upgraded to 50Mbps without requiring additional fees or action from customers. Upload speeds are also being increased from 3Mbps to 5Mbps. Faster access for the same price should be a relief for many families struggling to adapt to having work, school, and entertainment largely shifted to the internet during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXdqVN"&gt;The Internet Essentials plan is Comcast’s $9.95 per month (plus tax, of course) internet service provided to qualifying low-income households &lt;a href="https://www.internetessentials.com/get-help#mostasked&amp;amp;all_Documentsneeded"&gt;eligible for assistance&lt;/a&gt; from programs like SNAP, Medicaid, or WIC. This is the second time in a year that Comcast’s program is getting a speed bump: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21177524/comcast-internet-essentials-speed-increase-coronavirus"&gt;it was upgraded from 15Mbps in March of last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7IpW5"&gt;Comcast upgrading its cheapest plans to 50 / 5Mbps is somewhat of a rebuke to former FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242635/fcc-ajit-pai-internet-speed-advanced-telecommunications-3mbps"&gt;who last month claimed that 25 / 3Mbps speeds are&lt;/a&gt; “an appropriate measure by which to assess whether a fixed service is providing advanced telecommunications capability.” It seems even Comcast disagrees with Pai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6hxnGZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Somewhat of a rebuke to former FCC Chairman Ajit Pai&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jsZ5mv"&gt;The upgrades are part of Comcast’s response to the coronavirus, but the faster speeds should stick around after the pandemic is over. In March, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/20/21296913/comcast-free-wifi-hotspot"&gt;made its public Wi-Fi hotspots free&lt;/a&gt;, and in September it started the “Lift Zone” program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21441222/comcast-wifi-community-centers-low-income-students"&gt;which provides access to Wi-Fi and educational resources&lt;/a&gt; for people living in low-income areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtfBhp"&gt;With COVID-19 shutdowns having a &lt;a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/11/30/covid-19-shutdowns-disproportionately-affected-low-income-black-households"&gt;disproportionate impact on low-income households&lt;/a&gt;, it’s good to know that the people who need it most will be getting faster internet service without having to pay any additional cost. Of course, there will still be people who need internet access &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;that won’t have it&lt;/a&gt;, but the announcement is one bright spot in a news category that often doesn’t provide feel-good stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lonFK7"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla agrees to recall cars with failing displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vhzo6nBci5dLWjTKfzRYcC3oBEw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756584/akrales_170414__1610_0149.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1oqnhz"&gt;Tesla has agreed to recall more than 134,000 Model S sedans and Model X SUVs that will eventually suffer from faulty displays after pressure from the leading US safety regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Tesla announced the recall to customers in an email, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/02/02/tesla-will-finally-voluntarily-recall-model-s-x-touchscreen-problem-arm-twisted-nhtsa/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and said a software update could allow them to keep accessing crucial features like the backup camera in the meantime if their displays fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OE3iDx"&gt;The problem that prompted the recall has to do with the 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory device that Tesla used in its massive touchscreen displays on most 2012–2018 Model S sedans and 2016–2018 Model X SUVs. These chips eventually wear out, as &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvgxqp/worn-out-flash-memory-is-suddenly-bricking-tesla-cars"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first reported back in 2019, and when they do, it bricks the entire “media control unit” — cutting off access to not only the backup camera (which is now federally required), but also HVAC controls and everything else that Tesla has routed through the touchscreen. It also affects the turn signal lights, according to the agency. NHTSA says all of this increases the risk of a crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGlbcL"&gt;NHTSA started an investigation into the failures last year, and during that process, Tesla eventually told the agency that every car with the flash chip “will inevitably fail.” Tesla told NHTSA that it could take as long as eight years to swap all the defective parts if a recall wasn’t issued, with most failures happening around 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqqSV6"&gt;Tesla did not appear to want to recall the cars initially, prompting NHTSA to take the unusual step of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229854/tesla-recall-model-s-x-touchscreens-bricked-failure-nhtsa"&gt;publishing a public letter “requesting” the recall last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knt6fn"&gt;Now, Tesla has committed to the recall. On February 1st, NHTSA sent &lt;a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCAK-21V035-5245.pdf"&gt;another letter&lt;/a&gt; confirming that Tesla will begin a recall on March 30th, covering an estimated 134,591 vehicles. (NHTSA notes in this letter that Tesla still does not believe the bricked displays cause a safety risk.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O98saR"&gt;Owners can call Tesla customer service at 1-877-798-3752 for more information, and the company’s reference number for the recall is SB-21-21-001. They can also call NHTSA’s “Vehicle Safety Hotline” at 1-888-327-4236 or go to &lt;a href="http://www.safercar.gov"&gt;www.safercar.gov&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVG8F9"&gt;In the email to owners, Tesla says it will upgrade the eMMC chip free of charge with an “enhanced 64GB eMMC.” The company says it will notify owners when “parts become available” and asks that they not schedule a service appointment unless their vehicle’s display bricks or they get an alert about the memory storage. Owners who already paid Tesla to repair the issue “may be eligible for reimbursement,” which the company says it will share more information about by the end of March. Tesla has been offering to &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/01/22/tesla-slashes-price-media-unit-upgrade-amid-controversy/"&gt;swap the media control unit altogether for $1,500&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for a more powerful version with new features — and which, presumably, won’t fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRXOBY"&gt;In the meantime, Tesla says owners will not lose access to the backup camera, turn signal, and a base setting for windshield defogging and defrosting if the chip fails as long as owners upgrade their vehicle’s software to version 2020.48.12. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Small launch startup Astra to go public at $2.1 billion valuation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bFR1XrXEoy5S7fAZvNmD1ZfH87Y=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756438/EpedCU2XIAIwTiJ.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Astra’s 3.2 rocket launching from Alaska | John Kraus/Astra&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dYUf86"&gt;Astra plans to become the first small rocket maker to go public, the company announced Tuesday, after reaching space for the first time in December. It’ll become the second publicly traded space venture &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936896/virgin-galactic-public-offering-nyse-spce-space-tourism"&gt;after Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8YUWR"&gt;The Northern California-based rocket firm’s “3.2” launch vehicle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178110/astra-small-satellite-launcher-rocket-3-2-alaska-success-orbit"&gt;blasted to space for the first time&lt;/a&gt; in December from its Kodiak, Alaska launch site, a key test mission that “far exceeded our team’s expectations,” Astra CEO Chris Kemp told reporters at the time. The launch demo, though just barely missing orbit, propelled Astra into a small group of firms that have reached space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpB8k5"&gt;The company has 50 customer launches lined up, and over $150 million of contracted launch revenue so far. Now, Astra is merging with special purpose acquisition company (or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;SPAC&lt;/a&gt;) Holicity Inc. to take its launch business public in a deal that would value Astra at $2.1 billion. Astra’s ticker will be ASTR when the deal closes in the second quarter of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6QQDM"&gt;Kemp, NASA’s former chief technology officer, said the merger and public filing unlocks a new stage for the company: “over the next 2-3 years, we will dramatically increase our launch schedule with a goal of daily launches by 2025,” he tweeted Tuesday. It also marks “a step closer to our mission of improving life on Earth from space by fully funding our plan to provide daily access to low Earth orbit from anywhere on the planet.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnY1H8"&gt;The SPAC merger teams Kemp’s Astra up with billionaire Holicity CEO Craig McCaw, who’s expected to join the company’s board of directors. It also allows Astra to tap into $500 million in cash after the deal closes. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One day, your home could be made with mushrooms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/msHNwwtYUC8qxe3b9hFrsCVSwV0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756421/Article.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K1g3P1"&gt;Mushrooms are helping architects and engineers solve one the world’s biggest crises: climate change. These fungi are durable, biodegradable, and are proving to be a good alternative to more polluting materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vCb1I"&gt;“Our built environment needs these kinds of materials,” says David Benjamin, founding principal architect at the firm The Living. “Different countries have really ambitious climate change goals, and this material could really help jump-start some of that progress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KShs5G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;”Our built environment needs these kinds of materials.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6joEzO"&gt;Building materials and construction make up about a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178481/buildings-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climate-change-united-nations-report"&gt;tenth&lt;/a&gt; of global carbon dioxide emissions. That’s way more than the global &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-shipping-environment-imo/shippings-share-of-global-carbon-emissions-increases-idUSKCN2502AY"&gt;shipping&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/environment/climate-change/"&gt;aviation&lt;/a&gt; industries combined. And the problem is getting worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9dn7c"&gt;Materials made with mycelium, the fungal network from which mushrooms grow, might be able to help turn that around. They produce far less planet-heating carbon dioxide than traditional materials like &lt;a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-why-cement-emissions-matter-for-climate-change"&gt;cement&lt;/a&gt;. An added bonus is that mushrooms are biodegradable, so they leave behind less harmful waste than traditional building materials. Mushrooms can even help with clean-up efforts, feeding off things that might have otherwise ended up in a landfill, like sawdust or agricultural waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKfnnI"&gt;Construction materials made from mushrooms are still in pretty early stages of research and development. But they’re showing potential as an insulation material and even as a replacement for concrete blocks. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with some of the people leading the mushroom revolution. We even made our own mushroom brick and put it to the test. Check out the video above to see how well mushrooms performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D94LW2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pink Cloud is an eerily prescient sci-fi movie about being stuck in quarantine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TmKFgF_dc7TaS5SfyuG1vPM04jE=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756408/50611073667_dee4285ed3_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Pink Cloud. | Photo: Sundance Institute.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qhBZRj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like most recent events, the 2021 edition of the Sundance Film Festival has shifted from an in-person showcase to a virtual one. Despite the change, we’ll still be bringing you reviews on the most interesting experiences we find, from indie films to VR experiments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApHo1Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud &lt;/em&gt;starts with a message that underlines the distressing ludicrousness of where we are: it’s a movie about people stuck in a never-ending quarantine because of a deadly threat outside their doors. It’s also an early prescient one, as it was written in 2017 and filmed in 2019. It has no purposeful connections to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it’s impossible not to draw parallels between &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud &lt;/em&gt;and our current reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hI82Fn"&gt;The movie is set in a Brazilian city where a mysterious pink gaseous cloud hovers over residents and kills people if they’re outside for longer than 10 seconds, trapping them in whatever building they’ve found shelter in for years at a time. That said, &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud &lt;/em&gt;is less about the deadliness of their situation and more about the devastating monotony that follows. Quarantine is seen through a relationship between Giovana (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1056455/?ref_=tt_cl_t1"&gt;Renata de Lélis&lt;/a&gt;) and Yago (Eduardo Mendonça), a one-night stand that turns into something much longer-term when they’re forced to move in together. Over the course of the next several years, Giovana and Yago navigate becoming a couple, having a child, separating without leaving the apartment, virtually dating, and getting back together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JAByW"&gt;It’s the quiet moments that are &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud&lt;/em&gt;’s most powerful. FaceTime calls become tedious, eating the same thing day in and day out becomes a drag, and the only other person in people’s lives starts to grate on every nerve. We aren’t meant to suddenly stop physical contact with the rest of the world, and the cataclysmic effects of being cut off from everyone and anyone is quietly destructive. Life seems to suddenly speed up and slow down all at once. Giovana goes from being staunchly against children to having one, waiting for the lethal cloud to go away while settling into domestic routines because there’s no other way to live. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9TeUzI"&gt;At the center of it is the internal battle between the never-ending hope things will get better and the sinking realization there’s no end in sight. People switch careers to find something they can do at home, learn new skills, watch way too much TV, play too many games, find virtual boyfriends and girlfriends, and go to school at home. Children are born into the void knowing nothing about the outside world other than what they can see from their windows. Adults who remember life pre-cloud dream of getting back to the world they once knew while working to make their new living conditions the best they can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpcjYR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud &lt;/em&gt;is supposed to be a science fiction story, a dystopian world that quietly asks, “How would you cope in this situation?” Watching the movie in 2021, the answer is obvious: I don’t have to wonder how I’d cope, I know exactly how I’ve dealt with not being able to see family members or certain friends for nearly a year. But even with the “fiction” aspect of &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud&lt;/em&gt;’s science fiction setting removed, the movie still hit home the hardest part of Giovana and Yago’s ordeal, one that I’m still struggling with and I’m sure millions of other people are, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8SEJGY"&gt;When does it all end? How much optimism can someone have that eventually the pandemic — the pink cloud — will just disappear and life will return to normal? What does return to normal even &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;? At a time when I’ve turned to movies to try to escape or find answers to problems that I have no control over, &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud &lt;/em&gt;is a reminder of our daily life these past 300 or so days, and it provides no immediate answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="573Da5"&gt;Turns out, &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud &lt;/em&gt;was exactly the movie that I needed. I devoured watching this couple struggle with the same internal battle of hope and acceptance, desires and settling, fond memories of the before time and preparation for what comes next. &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud&lt;/em&gt;, a movie written some 1,100 days before the pandemic, ironically became a way for me to process so much of what happened in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
