    <title>Porsche’s Taycan Cross Turismo is a wagon-y follow-up to its first EV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FWo_c5fNu69gbPKPgXRY8JixzNk=/1x0:2040x1359/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913740/P21_0013_a3_rgb.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Porsche&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MJFmje"&gt;Porsche has finally &lt;a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2021/products/porsche-taycan-cross-turismo-first-electric-cross-utility-vehicle-world-premiere-livestream-23784.html"&gt;unveiled&lt;/a&gt; the wagon-y sibling of the Taycan EV. Originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/6/17084244/porsche-mission-e-cross-turismo-geneva-motor-show-2018"&gt;teased in concept form in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and due out this summer, the Taycan Cross Turismo is a more utility-minded version of Porsche’s first EV with a hatch rear, more interior space, greater ground clearance, and off-road-oriented options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4o1S7c"&gt;The new crossover EV starts at $90,900, plus delivery fees. Much like the regular Taycan sedan, there are four different versions with increasing price and performance: the Taycan 4 Cross Turismo, the Taycan 4S Cross Turismo, the Taycan Turbo Cross Turismo, and the Taycan Turbo S Cross Turismo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NJFfHM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More space than the sedan, with similar performance&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HZvZUi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike&lt;/em&gt; the regular Taycan, all four versions of the Cross Turismo come fitted with Porsche’s larger 93.4kWh battery pack and a dual-motor, all-wheel drive setup. Each trim of the Cross Turismo is about a tenth of a second slower from 0 to 60 miles per hour than its sedan counterpart due to the extra size and weight, though the base model is 0.3 seconds quicker than the regular Taycan 4S. The more you pay, the more powerful the motors, with the top-tier Turbo S Cross Turismo reaching a peak 750 horsepower in launch control mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mZIAu0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10374938"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8YrRho"&gt;The Cross Turismo also offers 0.39 inches (10 mm) of extra headroom in the front seat and 3.62 inches (92mm) more in the rear seat than the Taycan sedans. There’s more space throughout, really, thanks to the hatch and the fact that the Cross Turismo is about a half-inch longer and an inch taller than the sedan. That results in a few extra cubic feet of storage in the Cross Turismo, too, though the front trunk remains the same size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxDlE4"&gt;The Cross Turismo isn’t really&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;going to be an off-roader like the &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/39291/rivian-is-not-messing-around-with-its-off-road-tests-of-the-r1t"&gt;forthcoming Rivian pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;the Hummer EV&lt;/a&gt;, though Porsche clearly wants to make buyers &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like they could handle some rough terrain if push comes to shove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnqywF"&gt;All four versions of the Cross Turismo come with adaptive air suspension, which can be used to quickly raise the vehicle’s clearance by 0.39 inches (10 mm) and stiffen up the ride when in “Gravel Mode.” Switching to this mode also ramps up the traction and stability control and the torque management to make it easier to drive on “loose surfaces” like mud, sand, and — of course — gravel. Beyond that, buyers can opt for an “off-road design package” that adds some black trim around the Cross Turismo and defaults to the Gravel Mode ride height. Roof rails and a bike rack (which would hold &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313508/porsche-electric-bike-ebike-sport-cross-specs-price"&gt;Porsche’s pricey new e-bikes quite nicely&lt;/a&gt;) are options as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="unzaRI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Driving the Taycan, Porsche’s first electric car ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20983836/porsche-taycan-turbo-electric-car-first-drive-hands-on-photos-video-range"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xEtb8a"&gt;With these wan off-road aspirations, it’s not surprising that Taycan Cross Turismo buyers won’t have to sacrifice typical Porsche amenities or features like wireless Apple CarPlay, or the same kinds of upgrades found on the Taycan sedan (adaptive cruise control, lane keeping, heads-up display, 14-way adjustable massage seats, Bose and Burmester audio systems, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EikHvc"&gt;This was essentially the core promise when the Cross Turismo debuted: a slightly bigger, more SUV-ish version of what was then called the Mission E. And while some people may be disappointed that the final production Cross Turismo doesn’t look as ready to rally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/6/17084244/porsche-mission-e-cross-turismo-geneva-motor-show-2018"&gt;as the concept did&lt;/a&gt;, it should certainly help Porsche sell more EVs until &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/26/18240862/porsche-macan-electric-ev-production-taycan"&gt;its legitimately popular SUVs make the switch to electric power, too&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Diablo II: Resurrected will let you import your 20-year-old savegames</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MVgjNxXuQ7Tc8erAmG6ex6Avtbk=/0x173:1280x1026/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913413/diablo_2_boxart.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LW1o0t"&gt;Blizzard wasn’t kidding &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/19/22289916/diablo-2-resurrected-blizzard-features-upgrades-updates"&gt;when it told &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the new remastered &lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt; would be faithful to the original. You’ll even be able to pick up where you left off with your 20-year-old savegames, &lt;a href="https://me.ign.com/en/pc/182380/interview/what-it-takes-to-remaster-a-cult-classic-like-diablo-ii"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN Middle East&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDkPOq"&gt;“Yes! Yes, keep those!” producer Matthew Cederquist told journalists, saying that the team called it “the best feature ever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsB8XE"&gt;As a lapsed player myself, the very idea is giving me chills — dangerous ones, ones that I imagine are akin to what Gollum felt in &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings &lt;/em&gt;when he decided to pull The One Ring off his brother’s throttled corpse. I thought I could &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1362905167515906048"&gt;safely leave this game behind&lt;/a&gt;, but no. It seems I may need to track down an old friend soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hWt3bj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Staying the hell away from this. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;True story: I had to give my fairly valuable account and discs to a friend sworn to never, ever return them, because I kept seeing unique items in my dreams&lt;a href="https://t.co/t7V7Oa26SH"&gt;https://t.co/t7V7Oa26SH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1362905167515906048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kHb5Hj"&gt;For the rest of the original game’s fanbase, though, this might be incredible news: players like me spent large amounts of time grinding &lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt;’s bosses and levels to dust searching for unique items, not to mention selling them online and trading them inside a game that wasn’t really designed for that sort of thing. (One particular rare item, the Stone of Jordan, was actually used as a makeshift form of currency.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yloqC"&gt;Now, all of that progress is theoretically yours instead of having to start from scratch, and it might even be portable, too: theoretically, the game’s cross-save abilities across PC and console mean you could even load up your OG save on a Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCRSO"&gt;Blizzard &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/19/22289916/diablo-2-resurrected-blizzard-features-upgrades-updates"&gt;told our sister site &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the remaster basically &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the original game, so it’s not too surprising that original saves still function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="gMbHoN"&gt;This isn’t a remake,” said Fergusson. “We’re not reverse-engineering it; we’re not rebuilding it and trying to make it look and sound like [&lt;em&gt;Diablo 2&lt;/em&gt;]. This &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Diablo 2&lt;/em&gt;]. [...] It’s right there, underneath the surface. The entire simulation, the engine for this game, that lifeblood of this game, is [&lt;em&gt;Diablo 2&lt;/em&gt;] right underneath. So there’s a toggle switch, a legacy toggle, that when you press the button, you’ll see behind the curtains, and there is &lt;em&gt;Diablo 2&lt;/em&gt; in 2D sprites running right there, and you can play the way that you played 20 years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5YXDpl"&gt;“[W]e kind of shoved it in and it worked!” the team told&lt;em&gt; IGN Middle East&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve has ended development on Artifact</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oDXmKHRVGVk71m9RO20BUbUT530=/0x0:990x660/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913397/artifact_dota_teaser.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Topdf4"&gt;Valve is &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/583950/view/3047218819080842820"&gt;ending development on &lt;em&gt;Artifact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, following over a year’s worth of work on rebooting the troubled virtual trading card game (TCG) based in the &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; universe. It originally launched in 2018, designed by famed &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt; creator Richard Garfield. Despite “good initial sales” during a time when Blizzard’s &lt;em&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/em&gt; was at peak popularity, Valve says its player count fell off “pretty dramatically.” At launch, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2018/11/28/18115031/artifact-review-dota-2-card-game"&gt;our sister site &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;said the game was “deep, but burdened by its marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWqYi4"&gt;Both versions of the game, &lt;em&gt;Artifact Classic&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Artifact Foundry&lt;/em&gt; (also known as &lt;em&gt;Artifact 2.0 beta&lt;/em&gt;), are now free to play. All cards and packs that were previously available for purchase can now be earned just by playing the game. The company says all card art that was in development has been released. Steam Marketplace’s integration for buying and selling cards&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has been removed from both versions of the game, but paid cards in &lt;em&gt;Artifact Classic&lt;/em&gt; can still be sold. Here are &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/583950/view/3047218819080850140"&gt;the final patch notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCfulT"&gt;Valve says both games will remain playable but not to count on any updates to gameplay. To that end, it says that &lt;em&gt;Artifact Foundry&lt;/em&gt; is technically “an unfinished project” that has core gameplay but is missing some polish and art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zewaE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artifact &lt;/em&gt;was one of Valve’s only new titles in the past half-decade, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22167726/half-life-alyx-valve-vr-game-of-the-year-2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Dota Underlords.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeep’s 2022 Wagoneer will have Amazon Fire TV built in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S89Jq5OzrO1fdtYqruZjUdErHYU=/110x0:1244x756/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913288/Screen_Shot_2021_03_04_at_1.30.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LvX6Xz"&gt;Amazon’s Fire TV entertainment platform is going to hit the road in Jeep’s 2022 Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs, which will be the first to feature built-in Fire TV support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1etrO"&gt;The upcoming Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer are set to be formally revealed on March 11th, but Jeep’s parent company, &lt;a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=22562&amp;amp;mid=1"&gt;Stellantis, has given a preview&lt;/a&gt; by announcing the new Amazon integration today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7GW26"&gt;Amazon’s software will be accessible from both the main display and rear seat screens. (Jeep says a &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-computer-screen-privacy-filters-work-1788615130"&gt;privacy filter&lt;/a&gt; will prevent the driver from watching Prime Video content while driving, although they’ll be able to watch when the cars are parked.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ljGflw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 2022 Jeep SUVs are getting Alexa&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fjyBSn"&gt;Fire TV for Auto is designed to work alongside Uconnect 5, with added support for Amazon’s Alexa Auto technology for things like smart home controls. There’s also a custom Fire TV remote with an integrated Alexa microphone and a Uconnect button to easily access things like in-car temperature controls or maps. Users will also be able to download compatible content for longer trips where they’re not able or willing to use data to stream their favorite shows and movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5jDZ0K"&gt;The addition of Fire TV is the latest in a trend of carmakers being increasingly on board with including software from major tech companies. This includes the expansion of Android Auto and Apple’s CarPlay to deeper integrations like the Polestar 2, which runs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537200/google-android-auto-volvo-polestar-2-hands-on-demo-io-2019"&gt;Android Automotive natively&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3acfZM"&gt;Fire TV for Auto will be available in fall 2021 in the US, Canada, and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hey now lets users create blogs and newsletters right from their emails</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/48w23Y1Jh_g1e41EIAagRl8zUgw=/103x0:1698x1063/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913285/step3_4bf2eee711da77caba47d89a17885308ba422ef94f020fe948c302f7e7ad43c2.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ugEaY4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch"&gt;Alternative email provider Hey&lt;/a&gt; is expanding its offering with a new blog and email newsletter service, called Hey World, which is being offered as a free addition to all personal Hey subscribers, the company announced today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxRO0X"&gt;Using Hey World is incredibly simple: Hey users just need to send an email to &lt;a href="mailto:world@hey.com"&gt;world@hey.com&lt;/a&gt;. The subject of that email then becomes the post’s headline, while the body text is the blog post itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nLvdng"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Hey is a wildly opinionated new email service from the makers of Basecamp","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WhmaKK"&gt;Once you’ve sent the first email, Hey will automatically create a blog for you, at “world.hey.com/yourusername,” which collects all of your posts and offers both an RSS feed and an email subscription box for followers to keep up with your latest missives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqoQM6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/hey-world-b02a6f2e"&gt;In a Hey World blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the feature, Hey co-founder Jason Fried explains that the feature was borne out of a desire for a place to share thoughts online in a longer-form context than a short Twitter post or tweetstorm, without the contentious public square of a place like Twitter. Fried also notes that the Hey World blogs are an experiment for now, and the company is going to “play for a while,” with the new feature. Additionally, as “a shoutout to simpler times,” Hey World pages feature “no javascript, no tracking, no junk.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WA5un4"&gt;Hey World likely won’t replace more premium newsletter services like Substack, which allow writers more robust tools and monetization tools; but for more casual writers looking for a place to share thoughts, it could be a good option. Plus, the simplicity of writing posts using the same UI and editor as Hey’s regular emails means there’s an incredibly low barrier to entry (assuming one is a Hey subscriber, at least).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppuQOT"&gt;Hey World blogs are available now for paying Hey subscribers with personal accounts; users on business accounts or with free trials aren’t eligible for the new feature. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple clarifies that iOS 14.5 won’t let you permanently choose a new default music service</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pceXmG"&gt;iOS 14.5 is in beta right now, and the first beta appeared to have a long-awaited feature: it seemed you would be able to set Spotify and other music services as the default for Siri requests. But Apple has clarified &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apple-clarifies-you-cant-actually-set-a-default-music-service-in-ios-14-5/"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the feature doesn’t actually work that way. Instead, selecting a music service for Siri requests is apparently intended to improve Siri’s smarts so that it can better know your audio-listening preferences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="penUze"&gt;In our testing of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272460/apple-ios-14-5-default-music-streaming-service-siri-spotify"&gt;the first iOS 14.5 beta&lt;/a&gt;, when you would ask Siri to play a song, it would show a list of music services to play a song from. After you made your choice, Siri song requests would then play from the service you selected without requiring you to pick again. But you’re not actually picking a default service, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnCp6L"&gt;“The feature is an attempt to help Siri to learn the listening apps you want to use for different types of audio content — not just music,” according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. “Perhaps you want to use Spotify to listen to music, but prefer to keep up with your podcasts in Apple Podcasts or some other third-party podcasts app. And you may want to listen to audiobooks in yet another app.” Apple’s assistant may even ask your preference again in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyDZHb"&gt;Apple also noted to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;that there’s no setting in iOS where you can set your music service default, unlike the options available for setting a default email service or browser. (We also observed this when we tested the feature with the first beta of iOS 14.5.) However, you can still ask that a song play from a specific service as part of your Siri request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PAXYrI"&gt;Apple still seems to be tweaking the feature, as it was &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/17/hands-on-with-ios-14-5-beta-2-changes-and-features-video/"&gt;dropped from the second beta&lt;/a&gt; before being reintroduced this week with the third. And because it is still in beta, there’s always the chance the feature could change ahead of the final release, though we’ve asked Apple if it can confirm that it will appear in the public version of iOS 14.5.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senators ask FTC to fight stalkers exploiting people search sites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Continuing Resolution" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hhtkIwzJojXpKsyoGI_3uQitLfw=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913088/908866726.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CfcPDF"&gt;Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) want the Federal Trade Commission to take steps to protect people who have experienced abuse and stalking from invasive people search sites, potentially including measures to help them remove their addresses from data brokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2aZzJE"&gt;“We write to express serious concerns about recent reports that data brokers are publicizing the location and contact information of victims of domestic violence, sexual violence, and stalking,” the senators wrote in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrisismills/status/1367521239049392136"&gt;the letter&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/541616-klobuchar-murkowski-urge-ftc-to-protect-domestic-abuse-victims-data"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt; reporter&lt;/a&gt; Chris Mills Rodrigo posted online. “We have serious concerns that third-party data brokers play a role in revealing [a] protected address and providing access to personal information that can lead to continued abuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NgOiom"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;here's the bipartisan letter in full &lt;a href="https://t.co/jDxs2xsjlZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jDxs2xsjlZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— chris mills rodrigo (@chrisismills) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrisismills/status/1367521239049392136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dcD8VU"&gt;The letter cites &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/personal-information/i-tried-to-get-my-name-off-peoplesearch-sites-it-was-nearly--a0741114794"&gt;a 2020 &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; story&lt;/a&gt; about the risks of data brokers like Intelius and Spokeo — which are promoted as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/21/14945884/people-search-sites-history-privacy-regulation"&gt;modern-day phone books&lt;/a&gt;, offering phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, and other information. These sites have takedown policies, but the sheer volume of services — as well as the way they automatically scrape personal data — can make it almost impossible to permanently keep phone numbers or addresses offline. That’s despite some state laws regulating data brokers or offering confidentiality programs to people threatened by stalkers or abusers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOKXAT"&gt;Murkowski and Klobuchar ask the FTC to outline how it could coordinate with other agencies to keep violent abuse perpetrators from accessing personal information, as well as its current measures to help educate victims about data broker services and help them in the event of a privacy breach. The letter also asks if the agency has plans to prevent brokers from “collecting, buying, or selling lists of vulnerable populations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5qiNg"&gt;The letter could be a precursor to more congressional action around abuse and privacy online. Klobuchar, for instance, recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22268368/democrats-section-230-moderation-warner-klobuchar-facebook-google"&gt;sponsored the SAFE TECH Act&lt;/a&gt; — which adds legal liability for sites that host harassment or stalking-related content.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube will lift Trump’s suspension when ‘the risk of violence has decreased’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TUDz3rk2RLalFXGJvmQ-1pMQV-A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913077/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FzdKUy"&gt;YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki says the site will lift former President Donald Trump’s suspension when the risk of him inciting violence decreases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obbmQI"&gt;Trump was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251338/twitter-facebook-youtube-election-misinformation-ban-trump"&gt;temporarily suspended in January&lt;/a&gt; after encouraging supporters to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, just before a violent attack on the US Capitol. Unlike similar suspensions on Twitter and Facebook, however, his YouTube channel suspension was &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/19/youtube-extends-trump-suspension-for-another-week.html"&gt;described as temporary&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Nl-pl667U&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;In a new interview&lt;/a&gt; with the head of the Atlantic Council think tank, Wojcicki offered a more concrete description of how — although not precisely when — Trump could return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEPUhR"&gt;“The channel remains suspended due to the risk of incitement to violence,” Wojcicki said. “Given the warnings by the Capitol Police yesterday about a potential attack today, I think it’s pretty clear that that elevated violence risk still remains. However, I do want to confirm that we will lift the suspension of the channel. We will lift the suspension of the Donald Trump channel when we determine that the risk of violence has decreased. That’s per our policies, that’s how our three strikes system works. But when the channel is reinstated, it will be subject to the same policies that every other channel follows.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dgKHvt"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_0Nl-pl667U?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=1700&amp;amp;start=1700" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W0lmEE"&gt;Wojcicki noted that Trump could be given a second or third strike if he uploads more content that incites violence or violates YouTube’s election integrity policies; after three strikes with a 90-day period, a channel is removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XH2TOR"&gt;Trump was permanently suspended from Twitter and Facebook. However, it’s possible he will also return to Facebook in the future — since the semi-independent Facebook Oversight Board is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256821/facebook-trump-ban-oversight-board-public-feedback"&gt;reviewing his ban&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6ytBA"&gt;Meanwhile, federal investigators are still investigating the January attack on the Capitol, reportedly including &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/20/us/politics/justice-dept-roger-stone-capitol-riot.html"&gt;the potential role&lt;/a&gt; of Trump associate Roger Stone. Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/03/us/politics/capitol-riot-qanon-trump.html"&gt;police warned&lt;/a&gt; of a “possible” follow-up plot by right-wing militia members — possibly inspired by the QAnon conspiracy movement, which has circulated false claims that Trump will return to the White House on March 4th. Congress canceled the day’s session in response.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Porsche unveils a pair of ridiculously expensive electric bikes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3A0tKVFXcG0Hc3DD0jWmEBMCgSQ=/0x108:2560x1815/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68912976/Porsche_eBike_SPORT_CROSS_mood_outdoor_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tHBhu0"&gt;Porsche is the latest automaker to try its hand at making and selling electric bikes, and the result looks very interesting and very expensive. The Volkswagen-owned company announced that it would start selling a pair of full-suspension e-bikes this spring. The bikes were announced alongside the Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo, which was just unveiled today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwNiWZ"&gt;There are two models of Porsche e-bike, the Sport and the Cross. The Sport is a road bike intended for everyday use, with a full-suspension carbon fiber frame, integrated front and rear lights, Shimano mid-drive motor, and a price tag that would make Jeff Bezos blush. The Sport, which weighs a little less than 48 pounds, will set you back about $10,700, which is just an astonishing price for an e-bike. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8cHqeSp8896lBAx9FflLzPMHV4s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345773/Porsche_eBike_SPORT_mood_urban_scaled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4qySVU8s6JpVVz9-qvQLRGffTlo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345783/Porsche_eBike_SPORT_angle_view_front_scaled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IJPwzQ"&gt;But then again, carbon fiber frame bikes are traditionally more expensive than other bikes, and the Porsche badge on the head tube is worth a premium to a certain cross-section of bike rider. (I’m often reminded of how much money serious racing bike enthusiasts will spend, not just on the bike itself, but on all of the gear that goes with it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ucupwb"&gt;The Cross is more for off-roading adventures, Porsche says. It also sports a Shimano mid-drive, carbon fiber frame, and full suspension, in addition to Magura-MT Trail hydraulic disc brakes that are extra-large and “heat resistant.” It weighs 48.7 pounds and will retail for $8,549. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/khCASodcfMLH_L8vXH7c_QXUdBc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345784/Porsche_eBike_CROSS_mood_outdoor_scaled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ici2P03qv1W8kV8CIu3ADjyzN_s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345777/Porsche_eBike_CROSS_angle_view_front_scaled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hWWWrZ"&gt;The Shimano EP8 motor that is featured in both bikes is smaller than previous versions — Porsche describes it as “ultra-compact” — and provides up to 25 km/h of pedal-assisted support. (Seems slow, but that’s the legal top speed allowed under European Union regulations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVOs7T"&gt;Porsche is the latest company specializing in combustion engine vehicles to dip a toe into the world of electric two-wheelers. Aside from the price, there’s some reason to be skeptical. Often, when you hear about car companies releasing their own electric bikes, most of the time, it’s just a brand licensing deal. (Think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161230/jeep-ebike-electric-bike-quietkat-manufacturer-preorder-price-specs-date"&gt;Jeep’s e-bike&lt;/a&gt; or those &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/news030317-humbike/"&gt;Hummer bikes&lt;/a&gt; from last decade.) Other times, it’s a much-hyped project that ends up falling victim to larger corporate cost-cutting, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256722/gm-ariv-shuts-down-ebike-production-covid"&gt;General Motors’ Ariv e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7za3ip"&gt;But occasionally, something interesting emerges, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22179185/harley-davidson-serial-1-ebike-test-hands-on-specs-price"&gt;Harley-Davidson’s recently released Serial 1 e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;. Porsche’s bikes are sure to find an audience among the same people who love the 911 or Taycan, but it remains to be seen whether it will be a long-term business for the automaker. Both bikes will be available for purchase starting in spring 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
