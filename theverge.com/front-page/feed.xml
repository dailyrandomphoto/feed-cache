    <title>CES 2022 loses another key exhibitor as Intel pulls out of in-person show</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wVt9Aq"&gt;CES 2022’s exodus of exhibitors over rising COVID-19 concerns continues, with the latest withdrawal coming from Intel. The company typically has one of the biggest presences of major tech companies at the show. Intel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;joins a slew of other key companies&lt;/a&gt; skipping this year’s show in-person, which also includes Lenovo, Hisense, T-Mobile, AT&amp;amp;T, Amazon, Waymo, Meta, Twitter, Pinterest, and iHeartRadio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mor969"&gt;“The health and safety of our employees, partners and customers is always a top priority. After consulting with health officials and in the spirit of Intel’s safety policy, our plans for CES will move to a digital-first, live experience, with minimal on-site staff. We encourage you to join us as we deliver all our CES content and experiences virtually via the Intel Newsroom,” Intel commented in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="f3anmm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"CES 2022 seemingly falling apart: Lenovo joins T-Mobile, Amazon, AT&amp;amp;T and others in bailing out","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="X8c2Bw"&gt;The Consumer Technology Association remained committed to hosting this year’s conference in Las Vegas as recently as Wednesday, with Jean Foster, head of marketing and communications at the company, commenting to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “[our] mission remains to convene the industry and give those who cannot attend in person the ability to experience the magic of CES digitally.” Foster also noted that while the conference had received 42 cancellations at the time (for “less than 7% of our exhibit floor”), CES 2022 also added 60 new exhibitors recently, too, along with thousands of additional registrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zgfM5v"&gt;And while many major companies have pulled out of attending this year’s conference in person, key participants like GM and Samsung (who are both currently still set to present keynotes at the conference) remain onboard with CES 2022, at least for now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES 2022 seemingly falling apart: Intel, Lenovo, Waymo, and Hisense join T-Mobile and others in opting-out</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zjBRnX"&gt;CES, the world’s largest technology show, appears to be in jeopardy due to rising COVID-19 cases in the United States. On Wednesday evening, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lenovonews/status/1473824084018360321?s=21"&gt;exhibitor Lenovo announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would “suspend all on-site activity in Las Vegas,” following announcements from T-Mobile, Amazon, Meta, and others that they’d be ditching as well and despite CES organizers’ statements today that the show would go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CFpmOw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel says it will move to a “digital-first” experience with minimal on-site staff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NgTirG"&gt;So far, T-Mobile has been the most prominent exhibitor to bail. CEO Mike Sievert, one of the Consumer Electronics Show’s featured speakers, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065"&gt;publicly announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that he would no longer be doing a keynote and would “significantly limit our in-person participation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jiJmu"&gt;Amazon decided not to attend the show in-person entirely, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1473486307657539584?s=21"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, and AT&amp;amp;T also dropped out on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inafried/status/1473755300092002304"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Axios’ &lt;/em&gt;Ina Fried&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL1S9o"&gt;Hisense typically has a large press conference and significant presence in the LVCC’s central hall, but on Thursday morning, Hisense announced it has decided to make its January 4th press conference fully virtual “to ensure the health and safety of our team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixYeKu"&gt;It was followed closely later in the day by Waymo, as Alphabet’s self-driving car company &lt;a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/12/meet-waymo-at-ces-2022.html"&gt;updated its blog post&lt;/a&gt; to explain the decision. “Based on quickly rising COVID-19 infection rates, Waymo has made the difficult decision not to participate in person at CES 2022. We are aiming to still virtually participate in some CES-related events. In particular, as part of our Self-Driven Women series, our co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana and our Global Head of Public Policy Michelle Peacock will speak at several virtual panel discussions with the Female Quotient, the official equality partner of CES 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEQ22e"&gt;The most significant change so far, however, is probably Intel. The chipmaking giant said on Thursday afternoon that “[after] consulting with health officials and in the spirit of Intel’s safety policy, our plans for CES will move to a digital-first, live experience, with minimal on-site staff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5tzXmA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;CES UPDATE: After closely monitoring the current trends surrounding COVID, it is in the best interest of the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners, and our communities to suspend all on-site activity in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;— Lenovo Stories &amp;amp; News (@LenovoNews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LenovoNews/status/1473824084018360321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gHrSsq"&gt;Meta, Twitter, Pinterest, and iHeartRadio also all announced this week that they won’t attend this version of the annual Las Vegas expo in light of a new wave of COVID-19 cases in the US, as have major tech publications including &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/makejdm/status/1473092737457176577"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanaWollman/status/1473336456932470798"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dewalt/status/1473694554322784263"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bheater/status/1473365588672225286"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LanceUlanoff/status/1473376084582445069"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mspoonauer/status/1473379627380977665"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Guide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;But T-Mobile was the first major attendee to bail, with companies like Twitter and even Meta having a far more muted presence at the show in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7H53V"&gt;“T-Mobile will continue to serve as a CES sponsor and title sponsor of the DRL Championship Race but the vast majority of our team will not be traveling to Las Vegas,” reads &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fbusiness%2Ft-mobile-announcement-about-ces-2022&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F21%2F22849223%2Fces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company’s press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Additionally, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert will no longer be offering a keynote in-person or virtually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jLod2S"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m sorry we’ll miss seeing everyone at CES this year, but we are prioritizing the safety of our team and other attendees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our statement here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7"&gt;https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Sievert (@MikeSievert) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yqsd2L"&gt;Lenovo typically has a medium-sized presence at CES, typically making an array of announcements, though most of its activity generally happens on the Las Vegas Strip and in private meeting rooms rather than a public booth on the show floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmVmpc"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, by comparison, had a seemingly tiny presence at this year’s show. While the company’s “AT&amp;amp;T Business” division is listed as a featured exhibitor, the company was not expected to have a keynote. AT&amp;amp;T Business also only appears &lt;a href="https://ces22.mapyourshow.com/8_0/floorplan/?st=keyword&amp;amp;sv=at%26t&amp;amp;hallID=A"&gt;to have one very small booth&lt;/a&gt; in the Health and Wellness section of the Las Vegas Convention Center’s North Hall, with no booths for AT&amp;amp;T in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4jdF50"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies like Samsung, GM, Intel, LG, Panasonic, Sony, Nikon, Canon are the likely tipping point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DgCexR"&gt;Other companies that might make a sizable impact if they ditched CES 2022 include Samsung and GM, which have featured keynotes like T-Mobile, and companies that generally rent a lot of prominent space on the show floor, like LG, Panasonic and Sony. Intel typically rents a lot of prominent space as well, but this year their huge booth appears to be MIA, replaced by Canon, Razer, and other smaller companies. “We are currently revisiting our plans for CES and will provide an update as soon as possible,” an Intel rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwuYQr"&gt;We’ve asked some key companies if they’re still committed; a Sony rep suggested to us that the company still plans to attend as of Tuesday, and LG said Tuesday that “Unless CTA says otherwise,” it’s “still on board.” CES maps show that LG has a very large booth at CES, but the company’s said it’s taking a hybrid approach, making use of QR codes and AR to show off its wares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHHS0K"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-21/meta-twitter-scrap-plans-for-ces-in-las-vegas-after-covid-surge?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that AMD and Samsung are still planning a limited presence, Nvidia will have a virtual-only keynote, and that Qualcomm, OnePlus and HTC still plan to attend. Sony, Samsung and Google are all listed as “monitoring local conditions,” which could be read as a meaningless platitude but also gives those companies an easy out if they decide the conditions have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWcwdj"&gt;On Tuesday morning, the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES, stated that it still plans to host an in-person show. “At this point, we’re very much focused on having this show and doing it safely and putting the right protocols in place to ensure that people feel comfortable with it,” &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/ces-plans-to-push-forward-with-an-in-person-conference-despite-omicron-concerns/"&gt;a CTA exec told &lt;em&gt;Adweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRyNeA"&gt;As of Wednesday, the CTA says it’s received 42 exhibitor cancellations but has also added 60 new exhibitors in that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnjIMB"&gt;Here is the CTA’s full statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; from Jean Foster, head of marketing and communications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="X8c2Bw"&gt;CES will be in person on January 5-8 in Las Vegas with strong safety measures in place, and our digital access is also available for people that don’t wish to, or can’t travel to Las Vegas. Our mission remains to convene the industry and give those who cannot attend in person the ability to experience the magic of CES digitally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLnfPt"&gt;While we recently received 42 exhibitor cancellations (less than 7% of our exhibit floor), since last Thursday, we’ve added 60 new exhibitors for our in person event. Registrations for both our digital access and our Las Vegas event are continuing to show strong momentum, with thousands more registrations in the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1X0BM"&gt;CES 2022 will go forward as important innovation for world health and safety, mobility and solving problems will be exhibited. Furthermore&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt; thousands of smaller and medium sized companies rely on CES for their business. We have increased our official count to over 2200 exhibitors and as &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.ces.tech_News_Press-2DReleases_CES-2DPress-2DRelease.aspx-3FNodeID-3D5c6782e3-2D7c62-2D4028-2D8e2a-2D827a1c58cba6&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=XbPQjtdhJg1hC5-IccTkDxSrqhL0VWnmU2huSyK6TFc&amp;amp;m=dQ0shU35BhNLRgThHTf0QckcsMkcwMRMPdLqg7ETJTibsQxGxH9RNCOVK5RsfJwX&amp;amp;s=J4H1QKA0t9EvNmzUV1I4ySVKFQ2D9X0nI2yoJ60Bq0I&amp;amp;e="&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; many of our top elected officials from both political parties will be at CES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tctO7m"&gt;Given CES’ comprehensive health measures — vaccination requirement, masking and availability of COVID-19 tests — coupled with lower attendance and social distancing measures, we are confident that attendees and exhibitors can have a socially distanced but worthwhile and productive event in Las Vegas, as well as a rewarding experience on our digital access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4Y3xVw"&gt;In the recent past, we’ve seen the question of “will they or won’t they cancel due to COVID” take a while to resolve. Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the first big tech show to go on after the COVID-19 pandemic initially hit, held out for quite some time even as partners continued to cancel. Eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21127754/mwc-2020-canceled-coronavirus-trade-show-phone-mobile-world-congress-gsma-statement"&gt;organizers did have to cancel MWC 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Major tech companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430649/samsung-mobile-world-congress-mwc-barcelona-remote-covid"&gt;ditched the in-person version of MWC 2021&lt;/a&gt; as well. CES 2021, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344977/ces-2021-online-cta-las-vegas-conference-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;was all virtual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDMUvY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:41 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional company replies via Bloomberg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kZhLB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 10:09 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Amazon and LG.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6P8sia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 22nd, 4:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added new information about AT&amp;amp;T, Intel, and a statement from the CTA, which organizes CES each year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVBWcH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 22nd, 9:57PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added information about Lenovo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c33chn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 23rd, 9:56AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Hisense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8vEK5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 23rd, 2:09PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statements from Waymo and Intel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Matrix Resurrections has an incredibly smart take on showing video games in movies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Morpheus in The Matrix Resurrections" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/17CdU8BQGZ-03zrwHgqd_xoEH9I=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70311488/rev_1_MX4_31141r_High_Res_JPEG.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pqwAzF"&gt;Movies and TV have a notoriously tough time depicting video games. They tend toward presenting games as either generic arcade titles or as impossibly full-featured virtual realities, neither of which captures the typical experience of playing one. But &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections, &lt;/em&gt;a film that’s all about virtual reality, has managed one of my favorite takes on it yet by embracing its own world’s unrealism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fE2yp"&gt;Below, I’m going to talk about a few specific plot points from &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;, which premiered yesterday in theaters and on HBO Max. It’s a movie I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22841582/matrix-resurrections-lana-wachowski-keanu-reeves-carrie-anne-moss-review"&gt;found a lot of problems with&lt;/a&gt; but that many of my colleagues at &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22847211/the-matrix-resurrections-review"&gt;other publications enjoyed&lt;/a&gt;, and if you don’t want some light spoilers, you should stop reading now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yb5NLj"&gt;All right. Let’s talk about games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wo3BMR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What exactly are the Matrix games? We have no idea&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hpn2iO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; opens with protagonist Neo living inside a new iteration of the Matrix, a simulated reality designed by machines to keep captive humans docile. In an early twist, we learn that &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; itself now exists inside the Matrix — but not as a film. Instead, Neo (living as Thomas Anderson, just like in the first film) is a renowned game designer who created a world-famous trilogy of video games with the same plot, characters, catchphrases, and stylistic elements as the first three &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTQJKE"&gt;But although a large chunk of the movie is devoted to discussing these games, the film stays away from specifics. We know the first installment won an award in 1999, the graphics are detailed enough that a Matrix-trapped Trinity can recognize her in-game counterpart two decades later, and it’s implied to have some kind of linear narrative with a main character, so it’s presumably not a version of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Online"&gt;real-world &lt;em&gt;Matrix Online&lt;/em&gt; MMORPG&lt;/a&gt;. (Maybe a third-person shooter? An &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/18/12539476/what-makes-an-immersive-sim-and-why-are-they-staging-a-comeback"&gt;immersive sim&lt;/a&gt;? A point-and-click adventure game?) When characters reference scenes from the games, director Lana Wachowski makes liberal use of old &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; film footage to illustrate them; these could be live-action cutscenes, but they’re never explicitly described as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWO52y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resurrections &lt;/em&gt;probably&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;leaves the games’ details vague because they’re a symbolic part of a story about art in general and the Wachowskis’ experiences specifically. But intentionally or not, it’s an interesting choice within the fiction of the series. It’s one of the rare times we can envision the Matrix’s rough edges beyond being an excuse for superpowers — a moment that’s potentially unrealistic in a very&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;realistic way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ggf79R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If the first film’s Matrix was a perfect simulation, this one is all about quick and dirty shortcuts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6aMAN7"&gt;In our world, virtual spaces are usually about evocative symbols, not precise simulation. Developers &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/8/16263050/game-design-magic-tricks"&gt;bend supposedly objective rules&lt;/a&gt; to create realistic-feeling tension. Prestige narrative games — the genre Neo seemingly works in — are full of what game designer Robert Yang has &lt;a href="https://www.blog.radiator.debacle.us/2013/08/ludonarrative-dissonance-doesnt-exist.html"&gt;referred to as “primal gameisms”&lt;/a&gt;: illogical conventions that people stop noticing as they focus on progress and achievements. Players can run around a first-person shooter (even in a VR headset!) without constantly wondering why they don’t have a full body. They implicitly grasp that a &lt;a href="https://dimbulbgames.itch.io/museum-of-mechanics-lockpicking"&gt;lockpicking mechanic&lt;/a&gt; is a simplified representation of finagling a door open, and depending on the game, that they can’t open the door by kicking it or reaching through a gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vety7p"&gt;The original &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; portrays its simulation as a hyper-realistic space that can be hacked to expose its unreality. But &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; hints at an eminently recognizable world of quick and dirty shortcuts. For all we know, there’s never been a literally playable &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; installment — just something that produces an after-impression of moments from the most amazing game you’ve ever seen. The film footage isn’t purely a metatextual device for the audience — it’s a translation of how people inside the Matrix remember the experience, the way many of us remember our own favorite games having better graphics or more intuitive controls. (Unfortunately, that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; deprive me of imagining Trinity struggling through a convoluted 20-year-old point-and-click interface to learn the truth about reality.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMs0Jd"&gt;This would mirror all the principles that &lt;em&gt;Resurrections’&lt;/em&gt; villain — a program dubbed The Analyst — suggests his Matrix is based on. It’s a place where, to some extent, people understand they’re being fooled and just don’t care. They like the comfort of fondly remembering old stories at the expense of anything new or real. They experience things the way someone has told them to experience them, even when there’s nothing actually there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qc5jqy"&gt;To reiterate, I think &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t do a great job of developing a lot of its themes. But it handles this particular piece in a perfect marriage of style and story — even if I would have loved watching Carrie-Anne Moss play a real fake &lt;em&gt;Matrix &lt;/em&gt;game.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s nationwide NLRB settlement makes it easier for workers to organize</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WrB8HUXRk-1DHFmatP7ss7E1D8E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70311446/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="534oAk"&gt;Amazon has reached a nationwide settlement for six National Labor Relations Board cases, agreeing to notify workers of their rights and let workers organize on company property outside of their shift time. According to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/23/technology/amazon-labor-deal.html"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company previously didn’t allow employees to be around its warehouse, delivery, or other facilities more than 15 minutes before or after their shifts, making it more difficult to organize with co-workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbS0q0"&gt;The agreement, which &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21169264-amazon-nlrb-agreement-december-2021"&gt;you can read here&lt;/a&gt; or below, requires Amazon to notify its workers that it’s legally obligated to let them create or join a union and that it can’t retaliate against them for protected actives or staying on company property after their shift for organizational activities. The settlement also stipulates how Amazon will post the notice — the company will have to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="pxgJcB"&gt;Email the notice to anyone who worked at its facilities since March 22nd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8UO3yG"&gt;Post it “in prominent places” in its US “fulfillment centers, sortation centers, receive centers, specialty, and delivery stations.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4WnFpT"&gt;Make it available on the news alert page of its A to Z app for workers and its website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nKUBAq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon isn’t allowed to briefly post the notice and have it count&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LYbUZT"&gt;The settlement also looks to prevent Amazon from only posting the notice during a holiday period where workers aren’t actually present (like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826620/apple-labor-cher-scarlett-settlement-nlrb-complaint"&gt;Apple allegedly did&lt;/a&gt; with a notification about workers’ rights to discuss pay and working conditions). The agreement requires Amazon to keep the notifications up for “60 consecutive days” when most employees are working. It’ll also have to prove to the NLRB that it’s complying with the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="86At54"&gt;Amazon faces a growing workers’ rights movement. Earlier this month, warehouse workers in Staten Island walked out to protest the company’s labor practices and filed a petition to run a unionization election. Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377142/bessemer-amazon-labor-union-loss-warehouse-rwdsu"&gt;voted against unionizing in April&lt;/a&gt;, but the NLRB &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22565851/amazon-bessemer-union-vote-nlrb-appeal-overturned-second-election"&gt;recently said the election has to be re-done&lt;/a&gt;, citing objections claiming Amazon had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22445940/amazon-union-nlrb-hearing-mailbox-bessemer"&gt;inappropriately interfered with the election&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyXrJL"&gt;While it’s hard to say how much this new settlement will any current or future union drives, it seems like a clear signal from the NLRB that it has a close eye on Amazon to make sure the company is following labor laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meZT3X"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; request for comment on the settlement. NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo said in an emailed statement that “this settlement agreement provides a crucial commitment from Amazon to millions of its workers across the United States that it will not interfere with their right to act collectively to improve their workplace by forming a union or taking other collective action. Working people should know that the National Labor Relations Board will vigorously seek to ensure Amazon’s compliance with the settlement and continue to defend the labor rights of all workers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Astronomers discover largest group of ‘rogue planets’ yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="artist’s impression of a rogue planet in space" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6afn7G_P2nCEe64o2jvFHlMhBVc=/90x0:1190x733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70311422/eso2120a.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An artist’s impression of a rogue planet  | Image: ESO/M. Kornmesser&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1Wyjui"&gt;Astronomers &lt;a href="https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2120/"&gt;just discovered&lt;/a&gt; a treasure trove of “rogue planets” — free-floating planets that don’t orbit a star but exist all by their lonesome in the depths of space. With masses comparable to that of Jupiter, the 70 or more rogue planets spotted throughout the Milky Way galaxy are the largest such group of cosmic nomads ever found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9kRn5"&gt;Located within the Scorpius and Ophiuchus constellations, the planets were spotted using a suite of telescopes on both the ground and in space. Typically, rogue planets are difficult to image because they aren’t close to any stars to make them visible. However, with &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01513-x"&gt;data compiled&lt;/a&gt; over 20 years from European Southern Observatory (ESO) telescopes, the European Space Agency’s Gaia satellite, and more, Núria Miret-Roig, an astronomer at the Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Bordeaux, France and the University of Vienna, Austria, and her team were able to capture faint heat signatures emitted from planets that formed within the last several million years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YaFTPt"&gt;The team published its findings on Wednesday in &lt;em&gt;Nature Astronomy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ts55QAUBg4UOF_sX_Y-PXwoEh1g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23122827/eso2120c.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ESO/N. Risinger (skysurvey.org)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Location of discovered rogue planets&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D8AFIv"&gt;Despite the record-breaking observation, their findings suggest that far more rogue planets are waiting to be seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQqTs7"&gt;“There could be several billions of these free-floating giant planets roaming freely in the Milky Way without a host star,” Hervé Bouy, an astronomer at the Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Bordeaux, France and co-author on the study, said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d30E0x"&gt;The discovery is a step toward figuring out how these mysterious objects form in space, according to an ESO press release. It’s possible rogue planets initially formed around stars before being violently ejected from their solar system. Alternatively, they could have formed from collapsing gas clouds too small to lead to the birth of a new star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNnVTz"&gt;Astronomers are currently awaiting completion of ESO’s &lt;a href="https://elt.eso.org/"&gt;Extremely Large Telescope&lt;/a&gt; (ELT), a giant observatory that will play a “crucial” part in finding further information about rogue planets, according to Bouy. The ELT is set to begin observations at the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SkCxVw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJmQJd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest trailer for the Uncharted movie displays a borderline contempt for the laws of physics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/72xEEYES-XzFc6tSxRxU9jBtJu8=/458x0:1961x1002/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70311197/Screen_Shot_2021_12_23_at_12.31.13_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ADTH0z"&gt;Impossible as it once may have seemed, but &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738187/uncharted-movie-trailer-tom-holland-nathan-drake-mark-wahlberg"&gt;the long-awaited film adaptation&lt;/a&gt; of the Naughty Dog game series) is actually set to hit movie theaters early next year, barring any other delays for the decade-in-the-making film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PD2sJ"&gt;The new trailer also gives a better idea of what to expect from the movie: as teased, the film is a spiritual prequel of sorts to the characters players know and love from the PlayStation games. Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) is just at the start of his career as a globe-trotting treasure hunter (although the trailer already shows that he’ll be donning the character’s trademark henley and holsters by the end), while a ‘stache-less Sully (Mark Wahlberg) is his gateway to the world of thieves. The duo will be facing off against a new villain, Moncada (played on Antonio Banderas), squaring off to find $5 billion worth of loot from the explorer Magellan. Table stakes for an &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; storyline, really. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/giAnpKLBpyirMrzPhCOp8SAKLKM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23123001/Screen_Shot_2021_12_23_at_12.30.46_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Pretty sure that’s not how boats or helicopters work&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mTE0aG"&gt;And while there are still some big question marks about how different &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt;’s characters look from their game counterparts, the movie is clearly taking heavy inspiration from the series’ high-flying action sequences, with flying man of wars and a crate-hopping plane sequence inspired by &lt;em&gt;Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5xZUf6"&gt;Uncharted is set to hit theaters on February 18th, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822130/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection-ps5-remaster-price-release-date-upgrade"&gt;Sony offering free tickets&lt;/a&gt; for customers who either buy or upgrade to the upcoming PS5 remaster of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22661816/sony-playstation-showcase-uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection-ps5-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s massive Odyssey G9 gaming monitor is down to its lowest price yet</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pbNqlB"&gt;With the current end-of-year promotion happening at B&amp;amp;H Photo, you can get the massive Samsung Odyssey G9 gaming monitor for its lowest price ever. This monitor’s list price is $1,599 and it typically retails around $1,500, but you can currently grab it for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1578217-REG%2Fsamsung_lc49g97tssnxdc_49_monitor_hdr_color.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F12%2F23%2F22850641%2Fodyssey-g9-gaming-monitor-razer-keyboard-smart-frames-epic-games-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$999 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggEtIsHp4q" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2F49-odyssey-g9-gaming-monitor-lc49g97tssnxdc%2Fp%2FN82E16824022902%3FItem%3DN82E16824022902" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This same discount is also available at Newegg&lt;/a&gt; when you check out using promo code &lt;strong&gt;YEAREND3&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1jbJG"&gt;This curved 49-inch monitor sports a 1440p resolution and a blistering 240Hz refresh rate. The display is compatible with both AMD Freesync and Nvidia G-Sync to help cut down on screen tearing and comes equipped with a pair of Display Port and USB inputs, as well as a single HDMI port. The stand thankfully supports height, tilt, and swivel adjustments, so you shouldn’t have to make use of the 100x100 VESA mount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NvRqk9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10885851"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fXpTtS"&gt;With the days finally getting a little longer, investing in a pair of slick shades may not be a bad idea. At Best Buy, you can currently grab Razer’s Anzu smart frames in a variety of styles for a steep discount. These stylish shades typically retail for $199.99, but you can currently grab the rectangular, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggCYIA2EGa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wayfarer-inspired model for $129.99&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggCWz2kcyx" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the more rounded version for just $99.99&lt;/a&gt;. Both models are available in either medium or large sizes and come packaged with blue-light filtering and tinted lenses. While prescription lenses don’t come packaged with the glasses, you &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.lensabl.com/Razer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can order them for a 15 percent discount at Lenabl&lt;/a&gt; when you use the code RAZER15 at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nv69h0"&gt;These smart frames have Bluetooth speakers integrated into both temples and touch-based playback controls that can also summon your device’s voice assistant capabilities. While they only have around five hours of battery life, the Anzu frames will automatically power off whenever they’re folded up, allowing you to get the most out of a single charge.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MibmEB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10945749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="oheHi5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10945754"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KedrYU"&gt;Razer’s first 60 percent keyboard, the Huntsman Mini with clicky switches, is currently available at &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=VergeBlackFridayPCDeals2021&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fdesktops-laptops%2Fkeyboards%2Fproducts%2Frazer-huntsman-mini-mercury-edition-60-percent-optical-purple-switches-wired-gaming-keyboard%2F221667.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Huntsman-Mini-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08BFF4C7J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $79.99. This is a solid $20 price break on this $100 gaming keyboard. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Huntsman-Mini-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08B3JSKGR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The linear switch version is also available for $89.99&lt;/a&gt;. Just like other 60 percent keyboards, the Huntsman Mini eliminates the number pad entirely and consolidates the directional arrows and function row, reducing the footprint of this peripheral down to its bare essentials. Both the linear and clicky models are equipped with Razer’s optical switches, PBT keycaps, and a detachable USB-C cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QkCibv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361276"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0asrmZ"&gt;If you’re not quite ready to sacrifice that function row or need fewer wires in your life, you can currently find the linear, clicky, and tactile versions of Logitech’s tenkeyless G915 Lightspeed keyboard for $179.99 at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Tenkeyless-Lightspeed-Mechanical-LIGHTSYNC/dp/B085RFFC9Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fdesktops-laptops%2Fkeyboards%2Fproducts%2Flogitech-g915-tkl-lightspeed-wireless-carbon-linear-switches-gaming-keyboard%2F259262.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. This discount knocks a healthy $50 off the regular $229.99 MSRP. This low-profile wireless keyboard can be paired either via Bluetooth or through the included 2.4GHz wireless dongle and can last up to 40 hours at maximum brightness. The keyboard can also remain tethered to your PC via a micro-USB connection if you’d prefer. In addition to the function row and directional keys, the G915 TKL also features dedicated media playback buttons and a volume scrolling wheel.    The one unfortunate oversight on this otherwise excellent keyboard is the lack of any PBT coating on the keycaps, which causes them to accumulate fingerprints and grease rather easily.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where is Spotify HiFi?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2kETxhomBnZFKFxFSLWHVA7NFs0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70310893/acastro_180213_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b3QgbI"&gt;2021 will have been the year that Apple finally embraced lossless music streaming and prices for hi-fi listening came down at Amazon and Tidal. But the biggest subscription music service of all, Spotify, seems likely to miss its original target for launching a higher-quality streaming plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ah5iHE"&gt;Spotify HiFi, first announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;all the way back in February&lt;/a&gt;, has yet to roll out despite the company’s early estimate that it would debut “later this year.” At the time, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-02-22/five-things-to-know-about-spotify-hifi/"&gt;Spotify said HiFi would be available in select markets&lt;/a&gt; and that the company would “have more details to share soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VNL0s"&gt;Over the next 10 months, those details never came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jy4yF7"&gt;Meanwhile, Spotify’s competitors didn’t wait around. Apple Music rolled out lossless and hi-res playback in June, offering the improved audio quality at no extra charge. Before that shift, services like Amazon Music Unlimited and Tidal had been demanding an added premium for the feature. But on the same day that Apple announced its plans for lossless streaming, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440058/amazon-music-hd-price-cut-apple-lossless-audio"&gt;Amazon said it would ditch the higher subscription price&lt;/a&gt; and include HD quality as part of the regular premium plan. It’s officially table stakes now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUL3wP"&gt;There have been occasional signs of Spotify HiFi throughout the year; a “HiFi” button could (very briefly) be spotted in the app back in May — complete with explainers on using the feature. And an onboarding video for HiFi &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWq5CFQ5gng"&gt;was leaked in August&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u9ordr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Spotify HiFi could be near.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Open the iOS app and QUICKLY maximize the song title bar at the bottom: see that “HiFi” icon that briefly appears at the bottom right corner? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you manage to tap it in time, it shows these explainer menus. &lt;a href="https://t.co/xAhdInzY7c"&gt;pic.twitter.com/xAhdInzY7c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Welch (@chriswelch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chriswelch/status/1394474839793090562?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3U1vN4"&gt;As 2021 stretched on, Spotify had a lot to say about podcasts but kept mum on the subject of HiFi and declined comment whenever &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked about its status. Barring a last-minute holiday surprise, it seems we’ll be waiting until sometime in 2022 for Spotify HiFi. Hugely popular platforms tend to avoid launching major new features at the tail end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ZX3Lef"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10945839"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5A2iOV"&gt;It’s possible that Spotify has had second thoughts about launching the feature — or at least is no longer in a rush to deliver it. You could argue that the company doesn’t need to bother with HiFi at all. Spotify already enjoys powerful mindshare with consumers for its playlist algorithms and user experience; the recent wave of Spotify Wrapped posts across social media was another fresh reminder of that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YvE4c"&gt;Plus, there’s no longer any financial incentive. Apple has essentially forced Spotify’s hand to offer CD-quality streaming without wringing more money from customers. And if it’s not contributing to the bottom line, what’s the point? There’s also the possibility that Spotify ran into a legal quagmire in trying to update its music deals for HiFi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o28Ypf"&gt;
&lt;div class="reddit-embed" data-embed-media="www.redditmedia.com" data-embed-parent="false" data-embed-live="true" data-embed-uuid="90427e8e-640f-11ec-a4b3-82b6884be148" data-embed-created="2021-12-23T16:44:14.920027+00:00"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/rb451q/spotify_hifi_officially_dead/hno3l19/"&gt;Comment&lt;/a&gt; from discussion &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/rb451q/spotify_hifi_officially_dead/"&gt;whackawhoroo's comment from discussion "Spotify HIFI Officially Dead?"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://www.redditstatic.com/comment-embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XHhc8r"&gt;Lossless music is fundamentally a niche feature that’s at odds with how music is often consumed these days. In a world of Bluetooth headphones and earbuds, Apple and Amazon are far more interested in hyping spatial Dolby Atmos audio than higher-bitrate streams that only shine on expensive gear. Even then, some people just can’t distinguish it from the standard, lossy quality they’ve been listening to for years. Spotify has yet to confirm whether it too will offer Atmos tracks — or even hi-res audio that exceeds 16-bit/44.1kHz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hObEZ"&gt;Personally, I still hope Spotify HiFi does eventually launch. There’s a significant ecosystem of speaker hardware that’s compatible with Spotify Connect, making it easier and more convenient to enjoy the extra fidelity. And as we progress further into the streaming era, it feels like the option to enjoy music at higher quality &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be there for those who want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymMOTp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Spotify for an update on where things stand with HiFi as 2021 comes to a close.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Take a look at this delicious lickable screen to see the future we knew was coming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1p6BztjpMYzdjQgU7wA9w2gCwrw=/177x0:2286x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70310755/Screen_Shot_2021_12_23_at_10.31.40.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See the menu. Taste the menu.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Meiji University&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nyhtDX"&gt;If you’ve ever thought, “This &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20973993/tv-buying-guide-oled-qled-lcd-hdr-dolby-vision-atmos-nits-backlighting"&gt;4K HDR OLED TV is great&lt;/a&gt;, but I sure wish it tasted better when I licked it,” we may be getting closer to a world where that’s the case — a professor has created a device he calls “Taste the TV,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/lick-it-up-japan-professor-creates-tele-taste-tv-screen-2021-12-23/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it does exactly what the name implies. Homei Miyashita says he hopes his “TTTV” will let people experience things like far-away world-class restaurants without leaving their own home, which has become an increasingly understandable desire in the past two years of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWYAYV"&gt;According to a demonstration video, which you can see below, researchers blended up various foods and used sensors to “taste” them. Then, chemicals are sprayed onto a rolling plastic sheet (or a disposable tray for those who don’t feel comfortable licking a plastic-covered screen) in combinations that recreate the flavor. The sheet is then rolled out over the display so you can lick those sweet chemicals and rolled away once you’re done for easy disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="92SKN8"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I5Gu1WgqTTw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EY4yQd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hopefully, you enjoy the screen with your real tongue, though, rather than a demonstration one like they use in the video. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c62iMw"&gt;The video shows off all sorts of practical ideas for how TTTV could be used — as a menu that gives you an idea of what the food will taste like, a way to train wine testers, or a device that lets you add flavoring to crackers. But personally, I want to use it to taste things from movies or all those food TV shows I watch. Would it be a gimmick like 3D movies at home or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/30/14439362/samsung-curved-tv-review-un40k6250af-mistake"&gt;curved TVs&lt;/a&gt;? Almost certainly, but come on, who among us hasn’t wished we could lick our screens while &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-srqwgCg-Ls"&gt;watching internet cooking videos&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFkKC2"&gt;Miyashita thinks he could make a commercial version of the Taste the TV for $875, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. Even if that price had a hefty markup, it’s still quite a bit less than I’d expect — though there’s always room for a printer ink-style business model where the real cost is in the flavor cartridges. But I’m willing to pay any price for the ultimate &lt;em&gt;Great British Bake Off&lt;/em&gt;-watching experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgQReM"&gt;Okay, I know watching a show or movie on the version of the device shown in the video probably wouldn’t be ideal, given that it’s more like a kiosk than a television. And yeah, trying to watch something while being close enough to the screen to lick it would be a literal pain in the neck. But why should we let “practical considerations” get in the way of being able to taste what Remy Ratatouille’s talking about when he describes how well cheese and strawberries go together? (Yes, I’m aware you can just buy these foods, but the TTTV would ensure I was tasting the right type of cheese and strawberry — wouldn’t want to throw off the experience by accidentally trying it with cheddar instead of gouda.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y7ugC7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rLXYILcRoPQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q44wnc"&gt;Perhaps Miyashita’s idea of an actual, lickable screen is more suited to information systems than entertainment. But it’s easy to imagine that you could someday disconnect the taste system from the TV and just have a little flavor dispenser that sprays the delicious, delicious chemicals onto a tray at appropriate moments during a show. Or maybe even someday, movie theaters could install mini versions of them to flavor your popcorn in ways that pair well with the scene — who wouldn’t want to eat spice and sand flavored snacks while watching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22739098/dune-part-two-denis-villeneuve-timothee-chalamet-paul-atreides-spice-sandworm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; part two&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;After decades of work, the launch is here&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="YYXVwl"&gt;On Christmas Day, NASA is slated to launch one of its most anticipated spacecraft in decades: a next-generation observatory dubbed the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST. It’s taken roughly 25 years for NASA to get this vehicle ready for launch, and sending it to space is an incredibly complex endeavor. But if everything works out just right, JWST promises to see deeper into the Universe than ever before, peering at some of the most ancient stars and galaxies while deepening our understanding of astrophysics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6FanL"&gt;Follow along with all of our updates as NASA prepares to send this massive new telescope into space.&lt;/p&gt;
