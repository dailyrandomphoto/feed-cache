    <title>Here’s the never-before-seen Simpsons video game dreamt up for Sega Dreamcast</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X7wlZgNjH-BdxFZbamWwE8h1T1s=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68554528/vlcsnap_2020_12_19_15h42m10s760.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="InRtDq"&gt;As a lowly Wired Magazine intern, one of my first assignments was reviewing 2007’s &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-simpsons-game-review/1900-6181997/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Simpsons Game:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a groundbreaking self-referential parody of the entire gaming industry that, sadly, suffered from as nearly as many tropes as it lampooned. But it turns out that Fox had been interested in a three-dimensional Simpsons game long before that — one that could have appeared on the Sega Dreamcast if things had worked out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6p7gkA"&gt;Today, the DreamcasticChannel&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on YouTube (via &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/someone-found-a-weird-unreleased-simpsons-game-on-an-ol-1845919560"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) is showcasing &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TC4nD0qxUM"&gt;an unreleased tech demo&lt;/a&gt; from the year 2000 for a title tentatively called “The Simpsons: Bug Squad!” It’s from the long-defunct &lt;a href="https://www.mobygames.com/company/red-lemon-studios"&gt;Red Lemon Studios&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s remarkable how much the game’s cel-shaded graphics look like the show. Apparently, a Dreamcast-Talk forum user by the name of sreak &lt;a href="https://www.dreamcast-talk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=141620#p141620"&gt;found this demo just sitting on a broken Dreamcast dev kit’s hard drive&lt;/a&gt;, and with a bit of help, the forum figured out how to make it playable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nqLOOF-hOU47Fg9KTk_3gJW1-1w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22185135/vlcsnap_2020_12_19_15h42m10s760.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot of DreamcasticChannel (YouTube)&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2AzalT"&gt;Less understandable is the whole &lt;em&gt;Bug Squad&lt;/em&gt; thing. Were you really going to play a bug? Why? Who would your squad be compromised of? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzrWnr"&gt;Hopefully, some of the original developers (or Fox executives) will come forward so we can find out. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Queen Elizabeth will deliver her Christmas Day message via Alexa this year, if you ask</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Queen Elizabeth II Delivers Her Christmas Speech" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_2FNAG39vYU5ibWDLtJ4tJog2lw=/0x6:2910x1946/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68554427/1074649268.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by John Stillwell - WPA Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tixsU3"&gt;“Alexa, play the Queen’s Christmas Day message” will soon be a thing — even if you don’t live in the UK. Starting December 25th at 3PM GMT (or 10AM ET, 7AM PT), that phrase will deliver the Queen’s traditional Christmas Day broadcast, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/19/alexa-to-summon-the-queen-as-amazon-echo-airs-christmas-broadcast"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JRTxD"&gt;If you’re curious what the Queen’s message might contain, you can check out transcripts of all her previous Christmas Broadcasts (going back to 1952!) at &lt;a href="https://www.royal.uk/history-christmas-broadcast"&gt;The Royal Household’s website.&lt;/a&gt; No doubt this one will spend some time on the COVID-19 pandemic, whose latest variant is currently forcing London to impose &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/19/world/europe/coronavirus-uk-new-variant.html"&gt;its harshest lockdown yet&lt;/a&gt;, but perhaps it’ll be a bit of an escape from the harsh reality, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLXba6"&gt;Amazon seems to think it might be: “After a challenging year, millions of people from across the Commonwealth will be eagerly awaiting Her Majesty the Queen’s message on Christmas Day. By creating this world-first innovation, just as we did in 2012 with the release of the Queen’s Christmas speech on Kindle, we hope that even more people will be able to enjoy the uplifting words of Her Majesty,” reads a statement from Eric King, director of Amazon Alexa Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDZsHW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just temporarily closed all 53 stores in California and over a dozen in London</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Store SoHo STOCK" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RrGZwPSsEtFW25xPILUVPvG_ylk=/6x0:1020x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68554340/apple-store-soho-stock-logo_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iyFjdG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac’&lt;/em&gt;s Michael Steeber &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelSteeber/status/1340288965841219584"&gt;noticed a interesting coincidence today&lt;/a&gt;: the company has temporarily closed every single retail store in California, many more across the US, both stores in Mexico, both stores in Brazil, and is about to close 16 additional stores across the UK. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/19/apple-retail-stores-closed-holiday-season/"&gt;As Steeber points out&lt;/a&gt;, that’s nearly 100 stores if we include ones it closed in Germany and the Netherlands last week, leaving nearly a fifth of the company’s locations now closed worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ceDpeM"&gt;I checked &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fretail%2Fstorelist%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F19%2F22190895%2Fapple-close-retails-stores-covid-19-london-california-pandemic#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s complete list of stores&lt;/a&gt; to confirm, and sure enough: every California store, all four in Tennessee, all three in Utah, all four in Minnesota, two in Oklahoma, and the stores in Portland, Oregon; Anchorage, Alaska; Omaha, Nebraska; and Albuquerque, New Mexico are all closed this upcoming week — as well as the 16 additional stores in the UK, Mexico and Brazil starting tomorrow, December 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DwrbkE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stay home, wear a mask&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bhZgnS"&gt;It’s not hard to guess why the stores are reclosing, particularly in California &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-19/california-coronavirus-record-cases-deaths"&gt;where COVID-19 saw its four deadliest days yet in a row last week&lt;/a&gt; as part of an ongoing surge, and in London where Prime Minister Boris Johnson &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-19/london-put-in-emergency-lockdown-as-u-k-fights-new-virus-strain"&gt;has just put the city in emergency lockdown starting midnight&lt;/a&gt;. Apple confirmed the gist&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;of it in a statement: “Due to current Covid-19 conditions in some of the communities we serve, we are temporarily closing stores in these areas,” the company &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-12-19/apple-temporarily-shuts-all-california-stores-as-covid-surges?__twitter_impression=true"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qdDRh"&gt;Yesterday, California activated its emergency alert system in the SF Bay Area for the first time since the pandemic began, sending a message directly to every phone to help people understand that a stay-at-home order is now in effect. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Twitter is publicly declaring Joe Biden the winner of the US election — on Trump’s own tweets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eQV159QFImmb3bKS8Rs4wCnpzW8=/0x0:1590x1060/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68554063/1230199305.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by CBS via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NOFpKs"&gt;If you read my previous post, you might have noticed a brand-new Twitter label &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/19/22190698/trump-downplay-solarwinds-hack-russia-china-mike-pompeo"&gt;on Trump’s latest wildly misleading tweet&lt;/a&gt;: “Election officials have certified Joe Biden as the winner of the U.S. Presidential election.” Yes, Twitter is now calling the election for Joe Biden on Trump’s own tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g07mcv"&gt;Twitter tells us it’s simply an update to its existing label, designed to “reflect the latest information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uB9hjE"&gt;But there’s a staggering difference between this label and Twitter’s previous one, which simply said “Multiple sources called this election differently.” That left room for doubt. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1318573265820921857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1340333619299147781%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2020%2Fdigital%2Fnews%2Ftwitter-donald-trump-label-1234867067%2F"&gt;Now that the Electoral College has voted&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter not only accepting the result, but using it to visibly challenge the president’s ongoing lie that he won the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jO0LgL"&gt;You can see the first new example below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AipWTIOBwShiqVtEMnmByxjzQE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22184820/trump_tweet.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BituSo"&gt;Will this keep Trump from repeatedly tweeting “I won”? Doubtful, but I wouldn’t be surprised if his tweets get a little more creative, if he vents more anger at Twitter, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zm2x9"&gt;Here’s how Trump’s same misleading statements look on Facebook today, for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/leEw7xuiMLqzoLTMdY89x_VRbVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22184905/trump_facebook.jpg"&gt;

    <title>Nothing makes me worry more about the SolarWinds hack than Trump now saying it’s ‘under control’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dp-FaDLAWHZxMMX18hD0VvgFwaM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68553937/acastro_170621_1777_0006_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FCHwkX"&gt;“We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. We have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.” — &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/timeline-of-trumps-covid-19-comments/"&gt;President Donald Trump on COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, January 22nd, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="33lJNL"&gt;“The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA.” — Trump on COVID-19, February 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5FNwPi"&gt;“It’s incredible. But it’s something that we have tremendous control over.” — Trump on COVID-19, March 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1PhMT"&gt;Here’s Trump today, on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188060/microsoft-president-solarwinds-orion-hack-breach-brad-smith"&gt;the massive SolarWinds hack that targeted federal agencies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176053/solarwinds-hack-client-list-russia-orion-it-compromised"&gt;could have exposed 425 of the companies on the Fortune 500&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;“I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tyxTm"&gt;You don’t say.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AipWTIOBwShiqVtEMnmByxjzQE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22184820/trump_tweet.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UEUF0n"&gt;Here are a few perspectives on the SolarWinds hack from entities that do not currently have negative credibility:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RA9uf2"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/item/2175-joint-statement-by-the-federal-bureau-of-investigation-fbi-the-cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-cisa-and-the-office-of-the-director-of-national-intelligence-odni"&gt;The US government’s leading security agencies&lt;/a&gt;: “The FBI, CISA, and ODNI have formed a Cyber Unified Coordination Group (UCG) to coordinate a whole-of-government response to this significant cyber incident”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zVQPSn"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-352a"&gt;CISA in particular&lt;/a&gt;: “CISA has determined that this threat poses a grave risk to the Federal Government and state, local, tribal, and territorial governments as well as critical infrastructure entities and other private sector organizations”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nTJxyB"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/19/948318197/pompeo-russia-pretty-clearly-behind-massive-solarwinds-cyberattack"&gt;Trump’s own Secretary of State Mike Pompeo&lt;/a&gt;: “we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MbE0Cg"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/16/opinion/fireeye-solarwinds-russia-hack.html"&gt;Former Trump DHS advisor Thomas Bossert&lt;/a&gt;: “The magnitude of this ongoing attack is hard to overstate. The Russians have had access to a considerable number of important and sensitive networks for six to nine months”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zXzZy0"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/C_C_Krebs/status/1340358772540100609"&gt;Former CISA director Christopher Krebs&lt;/a&gt;, who was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21562844/us-cybersecurity-election-official-christopher-krebs-fired-president-trump"&gt;fired by Trump&lt;/a&gt; for calling out his lies about election fraud:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="9supM0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Do not conflate voting system security and SolarWinds. The proof is in the paper. You can audit or recount again to confirm the outcome. Like they did in Georgia. And Michigan. And Wisconsin. And Arizona. Can't hack paper.&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Krebs (@C_C_Krebs) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/C_C_Krebs/status/1340358772540100609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 19, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="sgXc3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2020/12/warner-on-the-solarwinds-hack-that-has-compromised-u-s-federal-agencies"&gt;Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee&lt;/a&gt;: “The SolarWinds hack is a devastating breach of U.S. networks and once again shows that the President and the White House are not taking this issue seriously enough.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="c1AuRx"&gt;Here’s hoping the SolarWinds hack turns out to be a big nothing! Certainly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dnvolz/status/1338565201138999296?s=20"&gt;doesn’t seem like it&lt;/a&gt;, though.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="4qOySW"&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556154/apple-supplier-pegatron-student-labor-violation"&gt;the second time in two months&lt;/a&gt;, Apple is putting one of the companies it hires to build the iPhone on notice for violating labor laws. &lt;em&gt;Reuters, Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; and others are reporting that Apple has put Taiwanese manufacturing giant Wistron on “probation” — meaning it won’t receive any new business from Apple until it sorts things out — after the supplier was found exploiting workers at a plant in India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krl426"&gt;The reason we’re hearing about this at all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/13/22172383/workers-protest-wistron-iphone-se-plant-india-pay"&gt;is rather incredible&lt;/a&gt;: on December 12th, some 2,000 workers decided to protest unpaid wages by rioting at one of Wistron’s offices, smashing up the lobby and overturning vehicles. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TOIBengaluru/status/1337615298761912321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1337615298761912321%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F13%2F22172383%2Fworkers-protest-wistron-iphone-se-plant-india-pay"&gt;There’s video&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7w7lnr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Karnataka: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Violence?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Violence&lt;/a&gt; at iPhone production plant run by Taiwan-based &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Wistron?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Wistron&lt;/a&gt; Corp at Narasapura (in Kolar district) near &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bengaluru?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Bengaluru&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Employees allege they have not been paid properly. &lt;a href="https://t.co/GKbeFeyRKc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/GKbeFeyRKc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— TOI Bengaluru (@TOIBengaluru) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TOIBengaluru/status/1337615298761912321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 12, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ib8q0g"&gt;It now turns out that the workers’ complaints were legitimate: &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/indian-iphone-factory-apologizes-to-workers-for-mishandling-wages-11608388075?mod=mhp"&gt;Wistron is admitting as much&lt;/a&gt;, and the local government found serious labor violations in its preliminary investigation, &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3114491/wistrons-apple-factory-india-committed-serious-violations"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-india-wistron/apple-supplier-wistron-could-not-manage-scaled-up-india-plant-government-report-says-idUSKBN28T0C9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;They say Wistron was indeed underpaying wages and forcing some people to work overtime. And that’s just Wistron itself. The &lt;em&gt;SCMP &lt;/em&gt;reports police are also investigating middlemen who are targeting Apple’s contract workers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="RITUTM"&gt;There have also been allegations of middlemen exploiting the contract workers and skimming their wages, with police looking into the role of six contractors who acted as go-betweens for Wistron. They reportedly lured workers by promising them an additional allowance if they forewent breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="S3BeRM"&gt;The investigation also reportedly reveals that 8,500 of the Wistron factory’s 10,500 workers were contractors rather than full-time employees, and that the plant may have only been permitted for 5,000 workers to begin with. (Wistron started assembling iPhones in India &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15651842/apple-iphone-india-assembling-begun"&gt;back in 2017.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLKjkZ"&gt;Wistron &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chandrarsrikant/status/1340205614484504576"&gt;issued an apology&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it’s “enhancing its processes and restructuring our teams to ensure these issues cannot happen again,” adding that it’s already established “a 24-hour grievance hotline” and “an employee assistant program.” The company says it also sacked its VP of business in India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFlr7E"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to our request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybNMYx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MlkRf"&gt;The question now is whether Apple will do anything meaningful to keep its suppliers from exploiting workers now that they’re making headlines yet again. The company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/12/8024895/apple-slave-labor-working-conditions-2015"&gt;a notable history of being associated with labor violations&lt;/a&gt;, and a recent report suggested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166286/apple-china-labor-violations-temporary-workers"&gt;that Apple turns a blind eye to them&lt;/a&gt; even when it knows there’s a problem. Did Apple know about this? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube had the mostly unremarkable year it was looking for</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="YouTube Brandcast Presented By Google - Presentation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w3bs_RCe4qj4Did548TJKlU2vyk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68553440/528526206.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Taylor Hill/FilmMagic for YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zk7m8O"&gt;YouTube started the last few years off with nothing short of catastrophic headlines about some of its creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TcBdQ"&gt;2017 saw Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg receive global criticism for a video in which he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/13/14605060/pewdiepie-disney-deal-lost-nazi-anti-semitic-imagery"&gt;displayed anti-Semitic imagery&lt;/a&gt;; 2018 found Logan Paul uploading footage of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/2/16840176/logan-paul-suicide-video-apology-aokigahara-forest"&gt;dead body to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;; 2019 ushered in loot crate controversies and dangerous stunts by top personalities like Jake Paul who took part in the &lt;em&gt;Bird Box&lt;/em&gt; challenge by driving while blindfolded, leading to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18184382/bird-box-challenge-youtube-policies-tide-pods-thumbnails-external-links"&gt;fundamental policy changes&lt;/a&gt; at the company. Those events were only within the first few weeks of each year, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zt4kap"&gt;2020 was much quieter. The year has gone by without a cascade of egregious misdeeds and public relations disasters. That’s not to suggest YouTube had a perfect year; the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562910/youtube-2020-election-trump-misinformation-fake-news-recommendations"&gt;faced ongoing misinformation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52662348"&gt;plagues on its platform&lt;/a&gt;, faced intense scrutiny for its lack of action around governing the platform &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/technology/youtube-under-pressure-over-election-falsehoods-suspends-oan-for-covid-19-misinformation.html"&gt;during the federal election&lt;/a&gt;, and is still figuring out how to handle a &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/09/google-faces-3-2b-lawsuit-over-claims-it-violated-childrens-privacy/"&gt;number of issues&lt;/a&gt; with videos featuring kids. YouTube did not have a great 2020, but it wasn’t driven by a never-ending whirlwind of creator chaos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdgHwJ"&gt;It may have been factors brought on by the pandemic and the arrival of an enormous new rival that helped YouTube. The pandemic made it harder for creators to get together to film (although that didn’t stop some of YouTube’s more popular stars from &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/jake-paul-interview-party-coronavirus-calabasas-mayor-2020-7"&gt;throwing parties at their Los Angeles mansions&lt;/a&gt;). Prank videos reliant on collaborations or travel diaries that can go astray were forced to transform into videos that could be filmed inside. Members of the “Vlog Squad,” one of YouTube’s most popular collaboration groups, worked on creative sketches that didn’t require them to be in each other’s space all the time, and Logan Paul mostly focused on his podcast that records in his California home.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v3dr0a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The year has gone by without a cascade of egregious misdeeds and public relations disasters&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WlLSE6"&gt;If YouTube had a quieter year, part of that is because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/6/10/21285309/tiktok-2020-user-numbers-revenue-smash-hit-mea-culpa"&gt;TikTok exploded in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. YouTubers also turned to TikTok as a way to continue making videos, staying on people’s radars, and having fun within a new ecosystem. Prominent YouTubers like Trisha Paytas, David Dobrik, James Charles, and Cody Ko have all been posting to TikTok regularly, building big audiences and even partaking in TikTok’s first creators program to earn additional revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1QUbv"&gt;Focus shifted to TikTok and a new class of creators who were experiencing meteoric rises to mainstream fame. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433195/tiktok-influencer-addison-rae-miramax-gender-swapped-shes-all-that-remake"&gt;Addison Rae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21438111/charli-damelio-tiktok-triller-app-rival-dixie-marc-heidi"&gt;Charli D’Amelio&lt;/a&gt;, Chase Hudson, Josh Richards, and countless others found their way into the spotlight — and it was TikTokers whose questionable behavior was highlighted throughout the year. A pair of popular TikTokers was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405427/tiktok-parties-los-angeles-criminal-charges-bryce-hall-blake-gray"&gt;charged by the city of Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; for throwing parties in a mansion, high-profile breakups and cheating scandals became &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/style/tik-tok-drama-taylor-lorenz.html"&gt;part of the “TikTokpocalypse,”&lt;/a&gt; and the possibility of everything disappearing after President Trump called for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559677/tiktok-cfius-court-petition-ban-deadline"&gt;TikTok to be shut down&lt;/a&gt; sent the creator community into a panic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGUz1L"&gt;For years, YouTube has been the center of young creators doing dumb things and receiving global press for their antics. It was a never-ending cascade of pranks gone bad, mindless stunts, and fake drama spun up to generate hundreds of millions of views. It worked. Between 2016 and 2019, YouTubers were constantly in the news for the wrong reasons. The heyday of weird content on YouTube that attracted comedy lovers and people who lived online was replaced by a new era of teenagers with access to a lot of cash, no boundaries, and friends all trying to generate lucrative views on every video they posted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zT5NYW"&gt;YouTube didn’t introduce a slew of new policies that suddenly made every creator on the platform start behaving. YouTube got lucky — people weren’t able to get into the same hijinks they could before. The company &lt;em&gt;has &lt;/em&gt;tried over the years to mitigate poor behavior, but what helped the platform this year is the thing that, ironically, helped creators grow in the first place: making collaborations in very public, packed spaces became nearly impossible to do. CEO Susan Wojcicki once referred to the period between early 2017 and mid-2018 as &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wired-25-susan-wojcicki-youtube-moderation/"&gt;YouTube’s “growing up years.”&lt;/a&gt; The executive wanted to find a way to move past the endless headlines about antics performed by popular creators on her platform. 2020 showed what a year of sensibility could do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HLRufC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;By happenstance, YouTube was no longer the only kid on the block people were paying attention to&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kduqVh"&gt;YouTube hasn’t grown up; its stars are still bickering with each other and getting into boxing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22158034/floyd-mayweather-logan-paul-fight-date-announced"&gt;matches with Floyd Mayweather&lt;/a&gt;. And YouTube creators were caught in various scandals this year. Old videos of Shane Dawson using blackface and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308288/shane-dawson-youtube-suspends-monetization-channels-blackface-older-videos"&gt;derogatory language resurfaced&lt;/a&gt;, leading to his channel being demonetized for a period of time. Jenna Marbles left the internet altogether after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21306858/shane-dawson-jenna-marbles-youtube-blackface-racism-content"&gt;racially insensitive videos resurfaced&lt;/a&gt;. Beauty mogul and YouTuber Jeffree Star found himself in a world of drama over &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/jeffree-star-sexual-assault-allegations-violence-accused-predator-myspace-payments-2020-9"&gt;alleged inappropriate past behavior&lt;/a&gt;. Jake Paul, well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21721881/jake-paul-interview-youtube-boxing-nate-robinson-ppv-controversy"&gt;continued to be Jake Paul&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CvgEB"&gt;The platform’s culture didn’t change in one year — but by happenstance, YouTube was no longer the only kid on the block people were paying attention to. In the early days of the pandemic, YouTube felt like old-school YouTube again. &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;videos, always popular, seemed to soar even more as people had more time to play and make videos; people returned to daily vlogging; and lo-fi chillhop streams became hangouts for people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21222294/lofi-chillhop-youtube-productivity-community-views-subscribers"&gt;stuck at home and trying to work&lt;/a&gt;. It was a quieter period for YouTube’s creators and a weird moment for anyone who’s tracked the site’s culture. For once, I’m not regularly talking about a severe incident to which a creator contributed. Instead, the greatest problems YouTube faced this year were on the policy side relating to misinformation and polarizing content — in many ways, problems of YouTube’s own making. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4gsVmb"&gt;I have no doubt that when YouTubers can start hanging out with each other there’ll be more headlines about antics. But for the first time in a few years, a year is ending without a YouTuber’s cataclysmic news cycle as the story of the year within the creator community. I genuinely didn’t think it was possible. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals of the week, holiday edition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6FHvRtY0nbt2l1VIO3f7kdVrRT8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68553232/acastro_191108_3782_blackfriday_guidebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GtAplY"&gt;The holidays can be overwhelming — even during years like this one when most of us aren’t actually traveling to visit family and friends. If buying gifts is still looming on your to-do list, you certainly aren’t alone. It’s tough to find the right kind of gift for everyone, especially people who have an affinity for tech. That’s where we come in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGmkv8"&gt;Below, there are a few great deals you can take advantage of now, and better, they’ll get where they need to be by December 25th. If you’re mailing packages yourself, we’ve pulled together all of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22168049/shipping-deadlines-free-delivery-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target"&gt;the crucial shipping dates for USPS, UPS, and FedEx right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="EAMK6P"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mQpV6Y"&gt;Deals on noise-canceling headphones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JOCnLo"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds with noise cancellation slipped $10 below its best-ever price recently, and you can still get them for $158 at a few retailers, including Amazon, Best Buy, and B&amp;amp;H Photo. These originally sold for $230, and this is a great deal if you value excellent sound quality in addition to being able to cancel out some sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IxTYfv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9740037"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ngq5qw"&gt;Also discounted in Sony’s catalog of headphones are the newer WH-1000XM4 flagship over-ear and wireless model. We cover them frequently because they’re very much worth the investment based on their superb sound quality, comfort, and battery life. Normally $349, they’re down to $278 at Amazon and Best Buy, making the purchase a little easier to swallow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g1PCpP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9523565"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="eQhw3f"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KDI3V8"&gt;Gaming deals&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g49_f5YexqqnIddxDrfopGoOliQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22015304/vpavic_4278_20201030_0247.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aNIIQk"&gt;Whether you’ve been lucky enough to get a PS5, or are still rocking a PS4, there’s a great deal for both crowds this weekend on a PlayStation Plus subscription. Normally, one year of the service that allows for online multiplayer and savings on games costs $60, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but you can get it for about $36&lt;/a&gt; at digital storefront Eneba. The price actually fluctuates, so you may, in fact, get a better deal when you click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WePCrN"&gt;Target is ensuring that its exclusive bundle that combines two great Nintendo Switch games,&lt;em&gt; Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Party&lt;/em&gt;, will arrive by Christmas (of course, you can pick it up in person if you prefer). Normally $120 if you purchase them separately, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fmario-kart-8-deluxe-super-mario-party-double-pack-nintendo-switch%2F-%2FA-80960673&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;this bundle costs just $80&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s a fantastic deal if you’re trying to build up your (or a loved one’s) library of Switch games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1L0LKm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10230502"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Qx84G6"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xgQjVd"&gt;Other deals you might like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="w6P2S6"&gt;The latest Mac mini desktop with Apple’s new M1 processor is seeing a few small price cuts. At B&amp;amp;H Photo, the entry model with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD is $669 ($30 off). For more storage, the Mac mini with 512GB of storage is $849 ($50 off).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QmLgUm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9712859"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YRR3jx"&gt;Another good gift idea comes in the form of Amazon’s Echo Show 8 smart display. What makes it particularly worthy of your consideration right now is that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;it now supports Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;, as if you couldn’t get enough of those during work hours. Seriously, though, this new feature makes it great for talking with family and friends during the holidays — especially since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22176502/zoom-lifting-40-minute-meeting-limit-holidays-free-hanukkah-christmas-eve-new-years-kwanzaa"&gt;Zoom temporarily lifted the 40-minute time limit on calls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W3si2a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cIAlcV"&gt;Lastly, if your home Wi-Fi network needs a boost in terms of coverage, Eero’s three-pack of mesh Wi-Fi routers is a relatively inexpensive way to improve it. Normally $250 during the off-season, it’s $175 right now. You can place them around your home to ensure that it’s as blanketed over in Wi-Fi signal as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5TUkod"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536532"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A pandemic makes pushing your players outside impossible&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="17Tu0A"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; was ready to kick off a new major event in March. Battle League — which asks players to walk in order to gain entry — was similar in spirit to many of Niantic’s initiatives within its game, one that encourages players to leave home and socialize. But outside, COVID-19 was beginning to take hold. “I remember being like there’s no way that this could be, there’s no way that this is anything,” says Veronica Saron, Niantic’s product marketing manager. “I was so stupid. I had no idea. None of us had any idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HoBMx4"&gt;By March, companies were beginning to send their employees to work from home. For Saron, her last day in the office included a meeting with the company’s CEO and a series of talking heads via video call. She hasn’t been back to the office since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ec4LdB"&gt;Video games have thrived &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328298/us-video-game-spending-high-npd-group-amount"&gt;in the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, with sales hitting all-time highs in roughly a decade. Development, like many other jobs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222465/coronavirus-game-developers-work-from-home-bungie-riot"&gt;has continued from home&lt;/a&gt;. Even with some delays, studios like Naughty Dog, Insomniac, Sucker Punch, and more have managed to successfully release their big budget games this year. Stuck at home, audiences have been even more eager for experiences to pass the long hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TkUwRp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The pandemic only makes the stakes higher&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QfotLJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; is not like most games. Where titles that found popularity this year, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163356/2020-pandemic-video-games-social-animal-crossing-fall-guys-twitch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21453499/among-us-2-sequel-popular-canceled-developers-innersloth"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, are perfectly suited to sitting on the couch, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; is about getting up, heading outside, and socializing in real life; look no further than Niatnic’s focus on in-person events every year. That won’t work in a pandemic. Even outdoors, large gatherings can still pose health threats. And though its development now proceeds through continued updates to an existing product, as opposed to the work required for a big, initial launch, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; has a unique pressure point: a moral obligation to its players to keep them safe. This has always been the case, as the game has a list of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12637878/pokemon-go-driver-kills-woman-japan"&gt;accidents and tragedies&lt;/a&gt; tied to its name. The pandemic only makes the stakes higher. It’s ethically dubious to encourage any of your players to get outside, when medical professionals have asked them to not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yb7Eus"&gt;“The current issue [of COVID] is existential to our game,” senior product manager Matt Slemon tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And if we just continue on as we’ve been continuing on and build features and sit on them until COVID’s over, that wouldn’t be right by our players.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tlwA8p"&gt;In the early days of COVID, Niantic — a global company with offices through the US and abroad in places like Japan and Germany — had a better picture of how the virus was spreading than most. In late January, Slemon recalls, the team began to discuss how COVID was impacting places like South Korea, Japan, and Italy, the last of which was already in lockdown. By &lt;a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/367428/How_Pokemon_Go_evolved_in_response_to_the_COVID19_pandemic.php"&gt;pulling data&lt;/a&gt; from resources like Apple’s mobility maps, Niantic was able to track the decline in players’ walking and get a clearer picture of just how little its players were moving. “For us, walking is sort of the base thing,” Slemon says. “It’s a good trend line to follow just to see how the world generally has responded to COVID, because that app actually doesn’t motivate people to do things. It just kind of helps them do what they’re already doing. It’s a good read on how culture is changing around walking.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="307lI1"&gt;Initially, Niantic tweaked its walking requirements and changed its rules around legendary pokémon and raids. “That lasted us maybe two and a half, three weeks,” Slemon says. More countries were experiencing a surge in cases or even locking down. “We realized that we didn’t have the expertise or staffing to keep up with the levels of changes that were happening per country around the world.” Niantic, which weeks before had been rolling out local updates to accommodate COVID, shifted its focus to changes worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ux3O6o"&gt;As our understanding of the virus, its impact, and how to best combat it has changed rapidly this year, so too have protection measures. States shut down as hospitalizations swell. Cases rise and fall, making different locations hotspots at different times. The state of the world has changed at a breakneck pace, making everything more difficult. Niantic’s work was no exception. The developer created what Slemon calls strike teams, groups to quickly brainstorm and enact new ideas they could roll out in sprints. It can take as much as nine months for some features to go into effect. During COVID, that cadence simply doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="PDbWZd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We were first at a little bit of a loss”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kBxTyT"&gt;“When COVID first happened, one of the things that it necessitated — it wasn’t necessarily a change in day-to-day working, it was more of a strategy style change,” Slemon says. “Because of the unpredictability of the situation, we found that the best way to manage things right now is to be as flexible as possible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4sJdTs"&gt;Part of that involved canceling the game’s community events and embracing remote play. “We were first at a little bit of a loss ... this is a huge component of what makes &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;unique,” says Saron. “While it will never be the same as an in-person event where we activate a park, we were able to take a lot of those best elements and encourage communities to come together and have their own Go Fest, whether they needed to stay socially distanced or stayed quarantined.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRNVXi"&gt;Typically an in-person event takes months to plan. Saron says the team now has weeks to execute their ideas. Niantic has relied on features like remote raids and Team Go Rocket Balloons — air balloons that bring fights to players, rather than make them travel — to make things feel a little more normal. “Over time we had to go from that local approach to the global approach of ‘let’s make a bunch of universal changes that will allow people to play no matter their circumstances,’” she says. “And of course if they’re able to go outside, go for a walk, socially distance, that’s great — but if they’re in a situation where they have to quarantine, we also want to make the game accessible for them, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zSvzp7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We built [what] we did knowing we’d be in a world with the pandemic for a while&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kLULir"&gt;These updates haven’t been painless or even without fair criticism. Advocates like AbleGamers COO Steven Spohn have been &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/18/12214664/pokemon-go-players-with-physical-disabilities-want-better"&gt;asking for accessibility options&lt;/a&gt; since 2016. In March, in response to Niantic’s feature changes, Spohn &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevenspohn/status/1244718368600580096"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “The fringe reality that ‘only a few players’ (46 mil, btw) experience is suddenly everybody’s reality. Now, people are finally understanding what disabled gamers have been saying for years: Being Socially Isolated SUCKS. Leaving your house whenever you wanted was a privilege.” In a follow-up &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevenspohn/status/1244718374116036608"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, Spohn added, “I’m sad it took a global pandemic to bring these accessibility options to life and teach this lesson.” When asked directly why it took a pandemic to add these features, Slemon said that’s not “really how we look at some of these changes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnwVIM"&gt;“We know the cultural norms have changed all around the world,” Slemon says. “So what it means to be doing things like going outside, exercising, socializing, have all changed. Zoom chats are common now instead of face-to-face chats, even with friends or family. We wanted to stay responsive to those times.” Slemon added that Niantic does “take seriously problems with accessibility,” pointing to issues like mobility and color blindness. “There are accessibility challenges that we do take seriously and we do want to handle. But this set of changes is really intended to focus on the changes to basically the entire world’s cultural norms. Over time, I think we probably want to have specific changes that target those types of accessibility problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="z75cuB"&gt;Niantic plans to keep many of the changes it’s brought to the game this year, like remote raids, permanently. This year it celebrated its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344717/pokemon-go-fest-2020-stats-numbers-niantic"&gt;biggest Go Fest&lt;/a&gt; yet, despite being online only. “We built all of the feature changes that we did knowing we’d be in a world with the pandemic for a while,” Slemon says. The game means many things to different people, whether it’s as a collection tool, exercise, or staying connected with friends. “We tried to find the path that ... whatever we meant to our players, we could continue to be that for them. At the end of the day, we hope that regardless of how you use &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; you’re still able to find you can do the things that you really wanted to do, regardless of the situation you’re in.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A COVID-19 vaccine gets a little bit extra</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bCIRUnfe3TOVGgvPM0_lmvGF51A=/0x0:5324x3549/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68553001/1230186439.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kem7wP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antivirus will be taking a break over the holidays. We’ll be back on January 9th. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DjAtHp"&gt;When healthcare workers started administering the first shots of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the US this week, they noticed something strange. There was an extra dose lingering at the bottom of the small glass vial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mv7SZG"&gt;“They initially thought that they had incorrectly done it because there was so much left in the vial after they pulled up the five doses,” Erin Fox, Senior Pharmacy Director at the University of Utah&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/16/health/Covid-Pfizer-vaccine-extra-doses.html"&gt; told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “They sent us a picture and were like, can we use the extra?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEdGT8"&gt;On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1339363304825905152"&gt;announced on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that yes, the pharmacists can use the extra. They can use every single full dose in a vial, but, the FDA added, they can’t cobble together a dose from multiple vials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FaUjnf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;At this time, given the public health emergency, FDA is advising that it is acceptable to use every full dose obtainable (the sixth, or possibly even a seventh) from each vial, pending resolution of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;— U.S. FDA (@US_FDA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1339363304825905152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rPlLAp"&gt;Slipping extra vaccine into vials might seem weird for a company to do — especially with something as precious as this. But it’s a standard practice for injectable drugs and products like vaccines. Just like molasses gets stuck on the sides of a measuring spoon, liquid can cling to the sides of the sterile vials. The syringe used to give the shot can also cause tiny bits of a vial’s contents to be lost — those &lt;a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/68463/WHO_VB_03.18.Rev.1_eng.pdf"&gt;losses can be on the order of microliters&lt;/a&gt;, but every little bit adds up. Putting in &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; enough for, say, five doses runs the risk of leaving some vials short, and a patient without the shot they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkNcCz"&gt;But leaving too much in can also be a problem in certain circumstances. If there’s too much of a drug in a vial, there’s the potential to give a patient the wrong amount of a drug, and it presents a temptation to misuse the leftovers. It also gets &lt;a href="https://bioprocessintl.com/manufacturing/fill-finish/minimizing-variation-of-volume-withdrawn-from-a-vial-drug-package-312301/"&gt;extremely expensive&lt;/a&gt; for pharmaceutical companies to include a lot of leftovers in their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="gijYQs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LhLrGY"&gt;That’s partially why back in 2015, the FDA came up with &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/88138/download"&gt;guidelines for the pharmaceutical industry&lt;/a&gt; to help them figure out how much ‘overfill’ was acceptable for their products. The guidance is pretty vague — since there are lots of different types of drugs or vaccines that can be injected, there’s no one prescription for how much extra can be included. For single-dose vials, they say it’s probably best not to include enough for a full second dose, but for multi-dose vials (like the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine) the recommendation is simply that they “should contain no more than 30 mL of drug product except under specific circumstances.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyZcm8"&gt;The vials of the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine easily fall within that range. Each one holds just &lt;a href="https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/fda-moderna-advisory-committee-vaccine-coronavirus/592333/"&gt;0.45 mL of vaccine material&lt;/a&gt;, which then gets diluted with 1.8 mL of a saline solution. Since each dose is only 0.3 mL, that’s definitely enough for an extra dose or two, but still far less than the 30 mL limit that the FDA recommends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aea1cO"&gt;The fate of the extra vaccine doses is still being decided. Between Monday, when the first vaccines were distributed in the US, and Wednesday, when the FDA said they could be used, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/16/labeling-confusion-led-to-wasted-doses-of-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-in-first-days-of-rollout/"&gt;many extra doses were simply discarded&lt;/a&gt;.  Health care systems are also worried about the two-dose nature of the vaccine. Shipments of the vaccine across the US &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/18/948030235/pfizer-says-millions-of-vaccine-doses-are-ready-but-states-say-shipments-were-cu"&gt;are still uncertain&lt;/a&gt;, and health care providers want to have enough on hand to give everyone who gets a first dose the recommended second dose three weeks later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hohpxX"&gt;There still aren’t a lot of answers yet. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1339363303185854470"&gt;The FDA&lt;/a&gt; says it is “working with Pfizer to determine the best path forward.” Pfizer is asking institutions to figure it out for now: ”Vaccinators need to consult their institution’s policies for the use of multidose vials,” a spokesperson for Pfizer &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/16/labeling-confusion-led-to-wasted-doses-of-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-in-first-days-of-rollout/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;STAT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofkE84"&gt;The US has ordered 100 million doses of the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/health/pfizer-vaccine-authorized.html"&gt;enough to vaccinate 50 million people&lt;/a&gt;. More than 200 million doses of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22185507/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-fda-authorized"&gt;just-authorized Moderna vaccine&lt;/a&gt; are on the way. But with a population of more than 328 million, and a pandemic still spiraling out of control, every extra dose counts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMSQee"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="bFSODq"&gt;“I almost could cry talking to you now... I feel like I didn’t just get a vaccine, I got a shot of hope. It’s hope that this is the beginning of the end of this terrible pandemic that we’ve all been experiencing — but us on the front line have really seen the suffering and the tragedy associated with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ssGZ7x"&gt;Dr. Jeff Toll, who has admitting privileges at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, one of the first hospitals to stock the vaccine, recalled a patient asking: “If I donate $25,000 to Cedars, would that help me get in line?’” Toll said no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="NhmNGR"&gt;—Laura J. Nelson and Maya Lau report on the wealthy people trying to squeeze to the front of the vaccine line &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-18/wealthy-patients-scramble-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;in The &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4arb10"&gt;More than Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HUKUH8"&gt;To the more than 75,508,468 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dHTDfz"&gt;To the families and friends of the 1,671,772 people who have died worldwide — 313,246 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
