    <title>Anti-Asian hate is spilling over to LinkedIn</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UJ6jj5pB39BtlZRp-EhN-FORZKw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69050079/VRG_ILLO_4053_003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6KJZTe"&gt;Ingrid Fung hadn’t anticipated that her post on LinkedIn would cause a stir. She’d written about escalating anti-Asian violence, reposting a graphic that said attacks on Asian Americans had risen dramatically in the past year. The message might have drawn racist comments on Twitter or Facebook, but this was the world’s biggest &lt;em&gt;professional&lt;/em&gt; social network — one where people had to use their real names and list their employer. What was the worst they would say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xK3H6n"&gt;“This statistic is crap and from a questionable source,” wrote one user who took issue with the data collected by the nonprofit Stop AAPI Hate. “...I would not be surprised if AAPI isn’t [Chinese Communist Party] backed.” Another user said she was propagating “CCP narratives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IlUjvH"&gt;Fung, a venture capitalist, was shocked. “It felt like a violation,” she says. “You wouldn’t expect this to happen in a professional space.” She reported the first post to LinkedIn, only to be told it did not violate the company’s community policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyLRq4"&gt;(LinkedIn told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it had reversed its decision and took action on the post, noting that its “Community Policies make it clear what is and is not ok on LinkedIn.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uNLPFN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The model minority myth has wreaked havoc on our communities”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UfF99h"&gt;Fung’s experience is part of a growing wave of hate directed at Asian American and Canadian professionals. The trend reveals the extent to which anti-Asian racism has been normalized — in part because of the misleading idea that the Asian population is homogenous. “We have been very clear about the ways in which the model minority myth has wreaked havoc on our communities,” says Manjusha Kulkarni, co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate. “It suggests that Asian American communities don’t have problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFUwBQ"&gt;Indeed, the income gap in the United States is greatest among Asians, &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/07/12/income-inequality-in-the-u-s-is-rising-most-rapidly-among-asians/"&gt;according to the Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1970 to 2016, economic gains made by low-income Asians lagged behind other poor communities. Yet, overall, Asians are still the highest-earning racial group in the US — a fact some LinkedIn users chose to cite when dismissing anti-Asian violence.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Obhh6X"&gt;“Statistics show Asians are the most successful immigrant group in the USA,” wrote one. “I don’t buy that Asians are targeted more than any others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3l83r"&gt;Kulkarni says the xenophobia is linked to language used by former President Donald Trump, who called &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/with-kung-flu-trump-sparks-backlash-over-racist-language%E2%80%94and-a-rallying-cry-for-supporters/2020/06/24/485d151e-b620-11ea-aca5-ebb63d27e1ff_story.html"&gt;COVID-19 the “kung-flu,” “China virus,” and “Wuhan virus”&lt;/a&gt; on multiple occasions. &lt;a href="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.69.231/a1w.90d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/210312-Stop-AAPI-Hate-National-Report-.pdf"&gt;Stop AAPI Hate’s 2020 national report&lt;/a&gt; documented incidents of harassment and assault where attackers directly quoted Trump’s ideas. “A number of the people have weaponized Trump himself,” Kulkarni says. “These people get their direction from their former President.” The CCP conspiracy theories in Fung’s replies support that claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jie7z7"&gt;On LinkedIn, the comments are made possible by the platform’s determination to become more than just a resume repository. Years ago, it rolled out a personalized news feed, and in 2020, it inexplicably launched its own version of Snapchat Stories. The features were largely home to cheerful corporate missives until Black users began posting about racial discrimination in the workplace amid the George Floyd protests.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5d0lkM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s OK to bring your whole self to work when you’re white”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BT2VLQ"&gt;The posts put LinkedIn content moderators in the “incendiary position of determining what manner of race-related speech is appropriate for its virtual workplace of 706 million users,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/business/black-linkedin.html"&gt;wrote Ashanti M. Martin in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company did not appear to welcome the challenge, and Black users told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; their posts were vanishing under “vague rules of decorum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7nmUIq"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Greg Snapper, a LinkedIn spokesperson, said that in the past year, there have been some “significant shifts” in how members discuss workplace issues. “And at the same time, we’ve seen an increase in the volume of member reports on posts, comments and messages,” he added. “We’ve taken a number of actions to protect our members who have a high bar for safe conversations given the professional context of LinkedIn and we couldn’t agree more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dMt0XR"&gt;The issue about what language is accepted on LinkedIn is reminiscent of the ongoing debate about bringing your “whole self” to work. Mike Robbins, a self-described thought leader, wrote a book on the topic, saying that people can “work better, lead better, and be more engaged and fulfilled” if they show up “fully and authentically,” rather than hide who they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVM8OI"&gt;Unfortunately, he quickly realized the reality was far more complicated. “It’s OK to bring your whole self to work when you’re white. And cisgender. And male. And straight. Or whatever,” &lt;a href="https://digiday.com/media/the-boundaries-have-broken-employers-deal-with-the-reality-of-workers-bring-their-whole-selves/"&gt;he said in &lt;em&gt;Digiday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But such acceptance didn’t always extend to other identities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LIm8gf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;He was jumped by three men who said, “You gonna try some kung-fu on us?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a9lUVg"&gt;Some Asian professionals who spoke to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; said they’d been taught to do the opposite: keep their heads down and focus on their work. “From my own experience, the way you’re brought up is very goal-oriented,” says Kane Ma, a former UNC at Chapel Hill basketball player and chief technology officer at Kamo Digital. “Sometimes I think it leads to minimizing other topics like talking about racism or discrimination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGq5LL"&gt;After the Atlanta spa shooting, more people began to speak out condemning anti-Asian violence. Ma posted about a hate crime he’d experienced in Chapel Hill, where he was jumped by three men who said, “You gonna try some kung-fu on us?” before fracturing his skull. “As an Asian American and person of color, I have experienced the recurring theme of racism in America,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKOq10"&gt;It was the first time he’d spoken publicly about the attack — and he did so to build awareness with executives in the business community. “There are leaders of organizations who have a lot of influence over the people who work for them,” he says. “So I think sparking discussion or at least introspection could be really productive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymsvYX"&gt;Almost immediately, however, Ma realized he’d struck a nerve with white supremacists. “Kane Ma, perhaps you should read this article and stop implying Caucasians are the de facto source of this hatred,” wrote one user. “Yeah, what about the Arab who just killed all of the white people in Boulder?” responded another. “Funny, don’t hear any race hacking about that, huh?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5binOF"&gt;Ma says the comments didn’t surprise him. “If I posted this on Facebook, I’m sure I would have gotten worse,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8D5U4Y"&gt;To Ingrid Fung, what made the LinkedIn comments stand out was that users felt confident using their real profiles. “What made me most uncomfortable was that people were okay attaching their professional identities to what they were saying,” she explains. “They felt so comfortable, they didn’t expect there would be any repercussions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZ1TsI"&gt;In fact, when she emailed the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay to report the man who’d said her statistics were “crap” and suggested Stop AAPI Hate was backed by the Chinese Communist Party, the assistant vice chancellor of policy and compliance responded to say that while the school did not support the man’s statements, it was “limited” in its response because he was just an ad hoc instructor. He then &lt;a href="https://www.uwgb.edu/UWGBCMS/media/Dean-of-Students/files/Civility-and-Inclusion-Statement-17.pdf"&gt;sent Fung a public statement on “civility and inclusion.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MUVGmE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I feel like I’m being held up at these organizations to cover other people’s lack of action and racism”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="en4xcu"&gt;She says the interaction disappointed her. Her goal wasn’t to get the man fired; she just wanted the school to speak with him so he’d know he’d been out of line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPrLim"&gt;The lack of action was made worse by the fact that Fung says she’s received numerous requests over the past year from organizations looking to increase diversity on their boards. “I feel like I’m being held up at these organizations to cover other people’s lack of action and racism,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avySre"&gt;The responses Fung and Ma received on LinkedIn show how difficult it is for people to understand racism against Asian Americans and Canadians. Both were able to speak out in part because they are successful — as a venture capitalist and business executive, respectively, they’re in positions of relative power compared to other parts of the Asian community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeyJoN"&gt;That fact also makes it easy for people to fall back on stereotypes, dismissing their concerns as the complaints of wealthy professionals. These comments imply that certain kinds of employment prevent them from experiencing any form of racism — or that their experience must be representative of the entire Asian community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5B2ddG"&gt;In the case of anti-Asian discrimination, that perceived success has been both the catalyst for resentment and the reason the Asian community’s lived experience has been repeatedly denied, even on a social network for professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is reportedly working on custom networking chips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lbkUBTrpsvxHgfQxv9tnLllxHgE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69049922/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="94Xrs2"&gt;Amazon is reportedly working on custom silicon chips for its hardware network switches, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-steps-up-silicon-ambitions-with-new-networking-chip"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The chips, which could help Amazon improve its internal infrastructure as well as AWS, are said to be the result of &lt;a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/198140-amazon-buys-secretive-chip-maker-annapurna-labs-for-350-million"&gt;Amazon’s $350 million acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of Israeli chipmaking firm Annapurna Labs back in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6Mh6d"&gt;Amazon building the silicon for its switches could help it solve bottlenecks and issues in its own infrastructure, especially if it’s also custom-building the software that runs on them. &lt;a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2015/10/12/the-custom-gear-inside-amazons-cloud/"&gt;Amazon already builds its own switches&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s reliant on Broadcom for the silicon that powers them. It makes sense for the company to want to completely control those machines, especially given how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"&gt;important its web services business is&lt;/a&gt;. It’s possible Amazon could even offer some services it wasn’t able to offer before, powered by the new switches, &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;suggests, citing the machine learning software that Amazon offers that currently runs on Annapurna chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQEWWR"&gt;The reported chips aren’t Amazon’s first custom silicon product. The company has previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453205/amazon-az1-neural-edge-processor-echo-show-10-alexa-voice-on-device"&gt;worked with MediaTek to create a chip for its Echo smart speaker products&lt;/a&gt;, designed to make Alexa respond faster. It also has its &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/01/amazon-debuts-trainium-a-custom-chip-for-machine-learning-training-workloads/"&gt;custom machine learning chips it calls Trainium&lt;/a&gt;, which will become available to AWS customers soon. It makes sense that the company would also want its own chips to power the backbone of its network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZ5gGm"&gt;Custom chip design is also quickly becoming table stakes for big tech companies. We’ve recently seen reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21221062/google-processor-pixels-chromebooks-whitechapel-samsung-qualcomm"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; are building custom processors for their devices, and Apple has been doing it for years now, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;the M1 Macs being an example&lt;/a&gt; of how much more potent a company’s products can be when it controls both the hardware and software. While Amazon may not be a titan in the smartphone or PC space, it’s a giant in the cloud, and that’s where it seems to be focusing on putting new chips to work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon says it will shut down its 3G network — for real this time — on December 31st, 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JsotKMjQE5x4o8PYbbzbbVWUHvM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69049900/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon stopped activating phones on its 3G network several years ago.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rjM2ZN"&gt;After years of delays, Verizon says it will finally &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F3g-cdma-network-shut-date-set-december-31-2022&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F30%2F22358628%2Fverizon-3g-cdma-shutdown-date-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shut down its 3G CDMA network&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2022 — and the company means it this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KIxAK"&gt;Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/11/3488546/verizon-sunset-2g-3g-cdma-2021"&gt;initially targeted 2021&lt;/a&gt; for the shutdown and later revised with a more ambitious goal of 2019. That didn’t happen, and as recently as January 2021, the company said the plan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215453/verizon-3g-shutdown-paused-delay-network-old-phones"&gt;was on hold indefinitely&lt;/a&gt;. Now, Verizon has confirmed an official shutdown date of December 31st, 2022, and a statement that “the date will not be extended again” on the company’s news site leaves no room for ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzdy3l"&gt;This move won’t affect anyone who has activated a phone with Verizon in the past few years; the company stopped activating 3G-only phones in 2018. Verizon is also keen to point out that it will be the last major US carrier to take its 3G network offline. AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334221/att-customer-upgrade-email-3g-shutdown-2022"&gt;says it will shut down its network&lt;/a&gt; in February 2022, and &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/05/t-mobile-3g-shutdown-reportedly-delayed-until-2022/"&gt;T-Mobile is aiming for January 1st, 2022&lt;/a&gt;, which could &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/what-t-mobile-3g-cdma-shutdown-means-for-boost-mobile"&gt;cause serious problems&lt;/a&gt; for millions of Dish Network’s Boost Mobile customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lUxhZH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon stopped activating 3G-only phones in 2018&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H3cshK"&gt;If you happen to still be using a 3G device on Verizon at this point (well done, you!), then you’ll need to upgrade to something 4G-compatible by the end of 2022 to keep using the network — and it might be a good idea to go for a 5G device at this point just to stay ahead of the next curve.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arm’s first new architecture in a decade is designed for security and AI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TAIWAN-IT-ARM" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ESs0sPl2rm3oMayVntuIpaawZ-0=/0x0:6482x4321/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69049703/1146397412.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;SAM YEH/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N5tgzt"&gt;Chip designer Arm has announced Armv9, its first new chip architecture in a decade following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/28/2522146/arm-reveals-64-bit-architecture-armv8-expects-prototype-systems-in"&gt;Armv8 way back in 2011&lt;/a&gt;. According to Arm, Armv9 offers three major improvements over the previous architecture: security, better AI performance, and faster performance in general. These benefits should eventually trickle down to devices with processors based on Arm’s designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWCTbJ"&gt;It’s an important milestone for the company, whose designs power almost every smartphone sold today, as well as increasing numbers of laptops and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300097/fugaku-supercomputer-worlds-fastest-top500-riken-fujitsu-arm"&gt;servers&lt;/a&gt;. Apple announced its Mac computers’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;transition to its own Arm-based processors last year&lt;/a&gt;, and its first Apple Silicon Macs released later in the year. Other manufacturers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20948092/microsoft-surface-pro-x-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; have also released Arm-based laptops in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LQxszL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Benefiting the wide array of machines using Arm-based processors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7iO0ck"&gt;First of the big three improvements coming with Armv9 is security. The new Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA), attempts to protect sensitive data with a secure, hardware-based environment. These so-called “Realms” can be dynamically created to protect important data and code from the rest of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i4j4VN"&gt;Next up is AI processing. Armv9 will include Scalable Vector Extension 2 (SVE2), a technology that is designed to help with machine learning and digital signal processing tasks. This should benefit everything from 5G systems to virtual and augmented reality and machine learning workloads like image processing and voice recognition. AI applications like these &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21435890/nvidia-arm-acquisition-40-billion-ai-cloud-edge-why"&gt;are said to be&lt;/a&gt; a key reason why Nvidia is currently in the process of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435507/nvidia-acquiring-arm-40-billion-chips-ai-deal"&gt;buying Arm for $40 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5qTar0"&gt;But away from these more specific improvements, Arm also promises more general performance increases from Armv9. It expects CPU performance to increase by over 30 percent across the next two generations, with further boosts performance coming from software and hardware optimizations. Arm says all existing software will run on Armv9-based processors without any problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKdbPT"&gt;With the architecture announced, the big question is when the processors using the architecture might release and find their way into consumer products. Arm says it expects the first Armv9-based silicon to ship before the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0j8SQG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhZrFc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Privacy and ads in Chrome are about to become FLoCing complicated</title>

  &lt;p&gt;Google is forging ahead with its third-party cookie replacement technology&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="U3YqX7"&gt;Repent, o ye ad trackers, for the cookiepocalypse is nigh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNP7Co"&gt;If Google sticks to its roadmap, by this time next year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox"&gt;Chrome will no longer allow websites to use third-party cookies&lt;/a&gt;, which are cookies that come from outside their own domains. The change theoretically makes it vastly more difficult for advertisers to track your activities on the web and then serve you targeted ads. Safari and Firefox have already blocked those cookies, but when it comes to market share, Chrome is currently the leader and so its switchover is the big one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fy6BTy"&gt;Blocking third-party cookies means that only websites you explicitly visit will be able to save those little cookie files on your computer, and they should theoretically only do what cookies were originally intended to do: keep track of smaller things like whether you’re logged in or which shopping cart is yours. Blocking third-party cookies also means ad networks can’t figure out who you are and serve you targeted ads, which is a big problem for the ad industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCFctf"&gt;Google, which is the biggest player in online ads, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310332/google-privacy-replacing-third-party-cookies-privacy-sandbox"&gt;has claimed&lt;/a&gt; that it does not intend to replace third-party cookies with “alternative identifiers to track individuals as they browse across the web.” This seems like a win for privacy all around, but if something about the story of Google as the privacy and anti-ad crusader strikes you as a little... off, you are far from alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zkgCd8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google doesn’t want to kneecap the online ad industry&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nt7rfK"&gt;Because of course Google doesn’t want to kneecap the online ad industry — the one it dominates and from which it makes all its money. Instead, Google wants to replace the third-party tracking cookie with a &lt;a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-advertising#ideas-and-proposals-links-outside-this-repo"&gt;complicated set of (bird-themed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/WICG/turtledove"&gt;) technologies&lt;/a&gt; that are meant to let ad companies target specific demographics like age and location, while at the same time allowing the people who are targeted to remain anonymous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHIMox"&gt;Google is trying to avert the cookiepocalypse for the ad tech industry, no repentance necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jLW3d"&gt;And so today, the &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/privacy-sustainability-and-the-importance-of-and/"&gt;company is forging ahead with an “origin trial” for one of these new technologies&lt;/a&gt;, the Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC). In an &lt;a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/OriginTrials/blob/gh-pages/developer-guide.md"&gt;origin trial&lt;/a&gt;, websites are able to begin testing without asking browser users to turn on specific flags. The feature itself will be slowly turned on inside Chrome via the usual process of introducing it into developer builds, then beta, then finally in the shipping version most people use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6ALbh"&gt;But what the hell is FLoC, and does it really protect your privacy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CR5S6t"&gt;FLoC: a Federated Learning of Cohorts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="UnuGjX"&gt;FloC is a proposed browser standard that, in Google’s words, will enable “interest-based advertising on the web” without letting advertisers know your identity. Instead, you’ll be associated with a “cohort,” a group of users sufficiently large enough to make you at least semi-anonymous to the companies targeting you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFgCKf"&gt;That’s the simple explanation. The technical one gets very complicated very quickly. Here’s a quick version. Chrome browsers will use algorithms (the “Federated Learning” part) to create a very large number of “cohorts,” groups of people that share certain qualities and interests. Each person’s individual browsing history is kept private and never shared with anybody, but the browser itself will look at the history and then assign a user to one of those cohorts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cG9z2e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Instead of identifying you individually, FLoC wants to make you part of a “cohort”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BnzzMp"&gt;When you visit a website, Chrome will tell that site that the visitor is part of cohort 198273 (or whatever) and then it’s up to the website to know that cohort 198273 (or whatever) is interested in pickup trucks and shoes with vegan leather. Since Chrome will never assign a user to a small cohort (Google has proposed that it will wait until there are “thousands” in a group), your identity as an animal-loving &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_coal"&gt;coal roller&lt;/a&gt; is theoretically protected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBoWj8"&gt;Chrome itself isn’t assigning any content labels to these FloCs; Google is leaving that to the ad tech industry to figure out. So you won’t be able to open up a privacy page inside Chrome and see what it thinks you’re interested in (though there’s theoretically nothing stopping a third-party website from telling you). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JzTu5"&gt;Since FLoC is structured in this way, it could mean that the powerful players in ad tech could become even more entrenched, because they have the technology to parse what FLoCs mean and what ads to target against them. Or it could mean smaller players could find a way in. We don’t know all the possible repercussions of FLoC, which is why it has both ad industry executives and privacy advocates so unsettled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUHz46"&gt;You can read the whole proposal and even check out the code for how it works at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/WICG/floc"&gt;GitHub repository for FLoC&lt;/a&gt; inside the &lt;a href="https://wicg.github.io/admin/charter.html"&gt;Web Incubator Community Group&lt;/a&gt;. As with most things on the web, it’s being developed out in the open and is part of a process of proposals, critiques, counter-proposals, attempts to get other browser vendors to join, arguments, harangues, screeds, and good-faith efforts to make the web a better place. It’s a party, y’all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X9mQ2C"&gt;The new front in the browser wars: privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PM0Zxy"&gt;No other browser vendor has signaled its intention to support FLoC. The rest are simply blocking third-party cookies and letting the chips fall where they may. And those chips are messy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hc6BTO"&gt;Whatever motivations you want to imbue on the Chrome team, it is already apparent that simply blocking third-party cookies will lead to very problematic new solutions from the ad tech industry. So Google is creating both FLoC and a suite of other technologies to replace the third-party cookie, in order to hopefully forestall even worse replacements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2W2zba"&gt;One of the very bad things Google is trying to forestall is fingerprinting. That’s the generalized term for ways that websites can identify you through little data signals that leak out of your browser when you visit a site. Sites can look at your IP address, the OS you’re browsing from, the size of your window, whether your browser supports Bluetooth controllers, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swJfEu"&gt;Battling fingerprinting is a huge arms race for browser engineers and new, nefarious methods pop up seemingly weekly. Here’s a &lt;a href="https://fingerprintjs.com/blog/audio-fingerprinting/"&gt;new method of fingerprinting I just came across&lt;/a&gt;: playing a very tiny bit of audio and then analyzing how your particular browser and device handle it, and then using that data to individually identify you in milliseconds. (The website that proposed it &lt;a href="https://fingerprintjs.com/why-fpjs/"&gt;sells fingerprint services to legitimate companies&lt;/a&gt; so they can ostensibly use it to better identify potential fraudsters on their sites.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="h3vA9w"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fighting browser fingerprinting is a huge arms race to protect your identity and privacy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3LwbgD"&gt;Apple has very publicly and vociferously advocated for cutting off all methods of individualized tracking, including fingerprinting, and has committed itself to that arms race indefinitely. The Chrome team’s concern is that essentially such a hard line creates an incentive for legitimate ad tech companies to start engaging in fingerprinting, which will then be all but impossible to stop or regulate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t89Rm2"&gt;Here’s how Google puts it in its blog post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qpzLCK"&gt;When other browsers started blocking third-party cookies by default, we were excited about the direction, but worried about the immediate impact. Excited because we absolutely need a more private web, and we know third-party cookies aren’t the long-term answer. Worried because today many publishers rely on cookie-based advertising to support their content efforts, and we had seen that cookie blocking was already spawning privacy-invasive workarounds (such as fingerprinting) that were even worse for user privacy. Overall, we felt that blocking third-party cookies outright without viable alternatives for the ecosystem was irresponsible, and even harmful, to the free and open web we all enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TRvPBc"&gt;It’s hard to separate each company’s financial incentives from their very real philosophical differences. Google prints money with its de facto monopoly on monetizing the open web through ads and is therefore incentivized to keep it going. At the same time, Chrome’s developers are true believers in the power and importance of the open web. Meanwhile, Apple wouldn’t be sad if Google made less money amid a massive online ad tracking reckoning. At the same time, Apple’s developers are true believers in the importance of personal privacy and the urgent need to go all-out in protecting that privacy against constant online assaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJqFdO"&gt;In any case, the problem with fingerprinting is that once you’re identified, it’s much harder to anonymize yourself. A cookie can be deleted, but the way your particular computer processes a milliseconds-long snippet of audio is much harder to change (though Brave has an innovative solution called &lt;a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates-4/"&gt;Farbling&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5SJzZ"&gt;The basic argument from the Chrome team is that erecting a so-called “privacy wall” will entice legitimate ad tech companies into succumbing to the temptation of fingerprinting. Google is hoping that ad tech companies will adopt FLoC as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBfw8T"&gt;If nothing else, there’s one big thing to take away from all this: FLoC is a hell of a lot better than the current status of third-party cookies that directly identify you anywhere you go on the web. But “better than the worst” is a low bar, and it’s hard to know yet whether FLoC just clears it or vaults way over it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZINDvs"&gt;Is FLoC really private?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="lkhzqX"&gt;Instead of a trying to build a metaphorical privacy wall that blocks all forms of ad targeting, Google plans on building a &lt;a href="https://www.privacysandbox.com/"&gt;Privacy Sandbox&lt;/a&gt; inside Chrome. Within that sandbox, websites can still legitimately request to know certain details about your browser as they need. A game streaming site could ask to know if your browser supports a game controller, for example. But ask too much and you’ll exceed the browser’s “privacy budget” and get cut off. Websites can have just a little identifying information, as a treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LbHOiE"&gt;FLoC will be part of that privacy sandbox and further should protect your identity by only associating you with a cohort if that cohort is sufficiently large. Chrome will also change what FLoC cohort your browser is associated with on a regular basis, say once a week or so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWzm7e"&gt;But whether FLoC is actually anonymous is very much up for debate. Bennett Cyphers at Electronic Frontier Foundation recently put up a &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea"&gt;handy post detailing some of the biggest concerns with FLoC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="d3qB4c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;FLoC could potentially identify you as being part of an at-risk group&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AP8jNV"&gt;One of the key aspects of FLoC is that Google isn’t making some giant list of interests and demographics and then assigning you to them. Instead, it’s proposing to use Federated Learning to create a ton of these cohorts algorithmically. Chrome won’t really know what any of them are actually about; it’ll be up to ad tech vendors to understand that over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QtlJPS"&gt;But as Cyphers points out, that algorithm will inevitably create cohorts that could be incredibly dangerous — say, a group of people who have visited sites about getting out of domestic abuse situations. The Chrome team says it recognizes this concern and so will be analyzing the algorithmically created cohorts to see if any are related to what it deems to be &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/143465?hl=en"&gt;sensitive topics&lt;/a&gt; — and then Chrome won’t serve those cohort IDs. But FLoC isn’t centralized, so it’s important to know that if another browser vendor adopts FLoC, it will be incumbent on that browser to create similar block lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXp4M0"&gt;Websites will be able to opt out of participating in FLoC, meaning that visits to their sites won’t contribute to an individual FLoC user’s profile. Similarly, the Chrome team intends to put opt-out toggles somewhere in Chrome’s settings for users who don’t want to provide FLoC IDs to the websites they visit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbojiV"&gt;Could FLoC become just another data point for fingerprinters? It seems likely, and defending against that seems to be another job for Chrome’s privacy budget and privacy sandbox algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWJdL1"&gt;One more thing: FLoC is a very convenient way for the websites you visit to know enough about you to target relevant ads, which means that FLoC is a very convenient way for websites to know things about you. It’s certainly no worse than the current cookie situation, but it’s far from the “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgNrvnY1mo0"&gt;You Shall Not Pass!&lt;/a&gt;” philosophy other browser vendors (like Apple and Brave) apply to allowing access to potentially identifiable information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iMjQpO"&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WOiYUZ"&gt;This first FLoC “origin trial” is designed to help websites learn how FLoC works; some of the testing for Chrome users will come later. Here is how Google describes the way it’s going to work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="vDlLMw"&gt;The initial testing of FLoC is taking place with a small percentage of users in Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines and the U.S. We’ll expand to other regions as the Privacy Sandbox expands globally. In April, we’ll introduce a control in Chrome Settings that you can use to opt out of inclusion in FLoC and other Privacy Sandbox proposals. In the meantime, if you’ve chosen to block third-party cookies, you won’t be included in these origin trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EvtG3R"&gt;If you look at that list of countries, you might notice that something stands out: none of them are in the EU, where GDPR regulations are in effect. Recently, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robinberjon/status/1374389427716321286"&gt;Robin Berjon of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; wondered&lt;/a&gt; whether that meant that FLoC would run afoul of those privacy regulations. According to the product manager for the Chrome privacy sandbox, Marshall Vale, it’s more a matter of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marshallvale/status/1374494962646020098"&gt;limiting the size of the early tests and that his team&lt;/a&gt; is “100% committed to the Privacy Sandbox in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Bfhf19"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"And now, a brief definition of the web","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/24/15681958/what-is-web-definition"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PxhEI3"&gt;Under normal circumstances, a newly proposed web technology wends its way through mailing lists and W3C conference room debates. It gets supported by the browser vendor that championed it and then, if its lucky, other browsers. Thus, the web manages to not become browser-specific in the ways it was back in the bad old days of Internet Explorer 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHxA8W"&gt;But when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox"&gt;Google originally announced its intention to block third-party cookies last year&lt;/a&gt;, I pointed out that the rhetoric between browser vendors was getting sharp. It’s only gotten sharper as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, Brave, and others have gone further down their respective paths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqECse"&gt;It seems unlikely that FLoC will lead to a standard because everybody agrees on a good way to allow targeted advertising. If FLoC does become a standard, it’ll probably be because Chrome will eventually turn it on and it will become the norm just through sheer market share — both Chrome’s within the browser market and Google’s within the ad tech market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="54fTFu"&gt;That possible future might avert the cookiepocalypse, but it could also become a different kind of nightmare for the web: one where websites once again try to push you to use the browser they can best monetize via whatever ad tech platform they’re using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0WrLum"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CD Projekt Red is changing how it makes games after disastrous Cyberpunk 2077 launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JO_jXMdoWt0XhCr6Th8tnQxdk9w=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69049625/screen_ripperdoc_clinic_en.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cdpU1h"&gt;Polish game studio CD Projekt Red announced a sweeping restructuring plan on Tuesday, just months after the disastrous launch of its much-hyped title &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. One of the key goals of the new plan brings “a change in the way [the studio] develops video games,” according to a press release. The changes will allow CD Projekt Red to work on “multiple AAA games and expansions in parallel” starting in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01zpnN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; launched in December after years of hype; the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P99qJGrPNLs"&gt;first teaser trailer&lt;/a&gt; for the game was released in January 2013. And following the huge success of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/22/10636822/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-best-video-game-2015"&gt;CD Projekt Red’s &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, expectations were sky-high for the studio’s cyberpunk RPG, especially following the glitzy and action-packed trailers shown in the months leading up to the game’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KhVkq6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Cyberpunk 2077’ was riddled with bugs when it launched&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="REZjSJ"&gt;But the game, released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069016/cyberpunk-2077-new-release-date-date-delay-september-cd-projekt-red"&gt;after&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295705/cyberpunk-2077-delayed-again-release-date-november-19th-bug-fixes-balance-cd-projekt-red"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536662/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-delay-december"&gt;delays&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494499/cyberpunk-2077-development-crunch-time-cd-projekt-red"&gt;reported six-day workweek&lt;/a&gt; for the developers ahead of the launch, was riddled with bugs and performance issues when it was finally available, &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-12-10-cyberpunk-2077-is-super-rough-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-and-the-memes-have-already-begun"&gt;particularly on older consoles&lt;/a&gt;. The performance was bad enough that Sony took the extraordinary step of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;removing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; from the PlayStation Store&lt;/a&gt; and offering refunds. (More than 100 days later, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; still hasn’t returned to the store.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpbKe2"&gt;In the months since launch, CD Projekt Red has released numerous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22198029/cyberpunk-2077-106-update-patch-corrupted-save-file-crashes"&gt;hotfixes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22239765/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-bug-fixes"&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253990/cyberpunk-2077-new-1-11-update-hotfix-game-breaking-bug"&gt;even hotfixes for the updates&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to shore up &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s&lt;/em&gt; issues and get it running smoothly. (Just yesterday, the studio released an update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356546/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-2-bug-fixes-console-stadia"&gt;with hundreds of fixes&lt;/a&gt;, though there still seem to be &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22358419/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-patch-update-1-2-driving-cars-cops?utm_campaign=polygon&amp;amp;utm_content=chorus&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;some hilarious bugs&lt;/a&gt;.) Many of the plans announced on Tuesday seem to be in service of preventing another high-profile fiasco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQARLf"&gt;One major change is that CD Projekt Red plans to change how its proprietary REDengine game engine is developed, which could improve performance for future games. “The Studio’s REDengine technology will be improved and centralized, while reorganizing the Studio as a set of interdisciplinary agile teams will transform the way games are developed, making its approach more proactive,” CD Projekt Red said. Theoretically, those changes could prevent issues in future games where games run much more poorly on older consoles, like many experienced with &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdBadN"&gt;Single-player RPGs “will remain our priority,” Michał Nowakowski, the studio’s SVP of business development, said in a statement, and you can expect to see more of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;. “We also perceive the huge potential of both &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt;, and we want to expand their reach to include new areas, media and content types,” Nowakowski said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="RvnHWi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Single-player RPGs ‘will remain our priority’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6K4hCV"&gt;Despite the focus on single player, CD Projekt Red does plan to expand its games’ online capabilities, though the studio wasn’t specific about what those features might be. These online features will be gradually rolled out to CD Projekt Red games, the studio said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kh0XcI"&gt;And perhaps recognizing that the years-long promotional campaign for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; may have backfired, CD Projekt Red committed to changing how it promotes its future games. “Future marketing campaigns will be much shorter, with promotional content released closer to the actual release of the given game, presenting its operation on all supported hardware platforms,” CD Projekt Red said. The company is also committing to publishing a new roadmap each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kfbKHX"&gt;The studio also committed to improving working conditions for its employees. “CD Projekt will remain an inclusive and diverse workplace; however, we also want to emphasize the well-being of our employees and provide them with professional and personal development opportunities,” studio head Adam Badowski said in a statement. CD Projekt Red did not provide further specifics about what changes will be made. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amnesia: Rebirth has a new ‘Adventure Mode’ with no monsters, new puzzles, and more lights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amnesia: The Dark Descent cave" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iHpsTCko9Q7jk5L1Ql3VPIGbOGY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69049319/Rift.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Frictional Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xwQM7l"&gt;If you like puzzles and eerie deserts, but not darkness and horrifying ghouls, Swedish studio Frictional has a new version of its game &lt;em&gt;Amnesia: Rebirth&lt;/em&gt; for you. A less stressful “Adventure Mode” is being added to &lt;em&gt;Rebirth&lt;/em&gt; today via GOG, Steam, and the Epic Store. The game’s PlayStation version will get Adventure Mode in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYcWZL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amnesia: Rebirth, &lt;/em&gt;released last year, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21519899/amnesia-rebirth-frictional-games-pc-ps4-horror-review"&gt;a strong sequel&lt;/a&gt; to the notoriously scary &lt;em&gt;Amnesia: The Dark Descent&lt;/em&gt;. Adventure Mode removes encounters with &lt;em&gt;Rebirth&lt;/em&gt;’s numerous monsters, as well as special effects that damaged its protagonist Tasi’s mental state. It also adds light to the game’s spookier levels, so players won’t have to ration matches or face the darkness. And Frictional says it’s adding bonus puzzles to Adventure Mode, so while you might spend less time sneaking and hiding, you’ll theoretically have more classic adventure game mechanics to make up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amnesia: Rebirth Adventure mode comparison shot, showing added light to a dark level" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n1F1lqTA98XvCMDWA9ZgFK5gPoU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408212/OriginalAdventure_Vertical.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Frictional Games&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dCTYFA"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Amnesia: Rebirth&lt;/em&gt; creative lead Fredrik Olsson describes it, “the game still has its very serious theme and sometimes unnerving ambience, but the new mode feels a lot more like an &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt; type of adventure in places where it would otherwise be more of a horror experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ryydd3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Frictional added a similar “safe mode” for ‘Soma’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s3tMLf"&gt;Adventure Mode is comparable to &lt;a href="https://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2017/11/what-is-somas-safe-mode.html"&gt;the Safe Mode that Frictional added&lt;/a&gt; to its 2015 horror game &lt;em&gt;Soma&lt;/em&gt;. But Safe Mode was a relatively simple mod that stopped monsters from attacking players, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/somas-new-safe-mode-takes-the-survival-out-of-survival-horror/"&gt;broadening the appeal&lt;/a&gt; of a world where failure could be seriously frustrating. Games like &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/hades-guide/21456205/god-mode-difficulty-easy-damage-reduction"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/43kadm/celeste-assist-mode-change-and-accessibility"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have adopted similar systems, giving a boost to players who want to enjoy the standard game at a lower difficulty level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZWkUd"&gt;Adventure Mode sounds like a broader aesthetic change to a game that already helped players progress if they “died,” albeit at a subtle narrative cost. It’s aimed at making the overall atmosphere more approachable, or as Frictional puts it, removing “anxiety-inducing and very distressing elements present in the original game.” It sounds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/20/17033024/assassins-creed-origins-discovery-tour-educational-mode-release"&gt;a little more like&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Origins&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;educational mode, which swapped combat for a museum-style tour — although Frictional is still keeping players focused on &lt;em&gt;Rebirth’s&lt;/em&gt; original narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLaPm2"&gt;Frictional expressed ambivalence about giving &lt;em&gt;Rebirth&lt;/em&gt; a “safe mode” before launch, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/884kzb/why-the-developers-of-amnesia-waited-10-years-to-make-a-sequel"&gt;telling &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that removing monsters “wouldn’t make story-wise sense.” Adventure Mode may get around that issue by tweaking the game’s entire world — not just the parts that can kill you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite on the Nintendo Switch will look and run better after its latest update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LyXVznhHET_gLcYd0qQjVoheMZk=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69049175/fortnite_battle_royale_50_on_50_1920.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ztSGlO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; for the Nintendo Switch is getting a patch that will boost performance in portable and docked modes. &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/gpu-performance-and-resolution-boost-for-fortnite-on-nintendo-switch"&gt;Epic Games says&lt;/a&gt; the game will run with a more consistent frame rate across the board “with fewer hitches,” though it’s still not 60 frames per second. And while the game will still use dynamic resolution to make visual adjustments on the fly to keep things running as smoothly as possible, the target resolutions in handheld and docked modes have gotten upgrades, too, seeing a 38 percent boost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZQcKJ"&gt;In handheld mode, the game has gone from 1000 x 560 up to 1170 x 660, which is closer to the Switch display’s 720p resolution. In docked mode, it’ll go up to 1560 x 880 instead of topping out at 1390 x 780. That’s a little closer to native 1080p docked resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4hLuy3"&gt;What this means is that the game will look less blurry, a common problem that many third-party ports encounter. The team provided a quick visual sample comparing pre-patch and post-patch sharpness to let you see what it might look like in-game. It’s definitely a noticeable improvement, even if it’s minor. Anyone squeezing more juice out of the aging Switch hardware gets kudos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jFKQSq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10420122"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EnsGvu"&gt;Lastly, the team says the game will free up 140MB of storage on your console, marking a small reduction in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; file size. Companies seem to be prioritizing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356947/call-of-duty-activision-file-size-shrink-space-savings-warzone"&gt;these kinds of updates these days&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s great for people who are still installing games to the Switch’s internal storage (despite microSD cards being extremely affordable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2ZO5wI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite’s dinosaur eggs have hatched, and now raptors roam the island","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357140/fortnite-primal-update-egg-hatch-dinosaur-raptor"},{"title":"How AI, not just hardware, could make a new Switch more powerful than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22348095/nintendo-switch-nvidia-dlss-graphics-ai-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>How to score a COVID-19 vaccine appointment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_u2r1v0qpkmDCofvfzLEcU6WDG4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68809161/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DzZXIa"&gt;One of the most frustrating tasks for many of us these days is finding how and where to get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. It can be a real exercise in exasperation: the websites are often difficult to navigate and prone to frequent crashes; in addition, after finding an open appointment slot and filling out multiple pages of questions, you are often told that the opening has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vp4Bt"&gt;In view of all this, we’ve tried to gather as much helpful information as we can about ways to research and snag vaccination appointments for yourself and others. We’ll update this as more information presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7JT5j0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Real-world evidence shows that the COVID-19 vaccines work","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358085/covid-vaccines-effective-real-world-infection-protection-cdc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="JYv8ZW"&gt;Research the vaccination qualifications in your state&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jJJ2mU"&gt;To begin with, it’s a good idea to try to pin down if you or the person you are assisting is currently qualified for the COVID-19 vaccine. Find the vaccine information site (or sites) that is being run by your state and / or city. This will also help you figure out when you might be qualified if you aren’t already. If you can’t find it via a quick search, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/plan-your-vaccine/"&gt;NBC News has created a simple website&lt;/a&gt; that lets you find out what the current situation is in your specific state. &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/covid-19/where-to-get-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;Prescription company GoodRx&lt;/a&gt; offers similar information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="N5dWHX"&gt;Find all the places that might offer appointments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XK1Cc0"&gt;There are, fortunately or unfortunately, many different sites where you can go to find out if you can get an appointment to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgvDmn"&gt;For example, here in New York City, we’ve had to navigate separate sites run by the city and the state. Various hospital systems also have their own sites, as do pharmacies such as Walgreens and CVS, which have recently begun offering appointments for vaccinations. It’s a lot to check — and it can be enormously confusing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usTdFX"&gt;As a result, your first step is probably to check your state’s government health website (searching your state name and “COVID vaccine” will probably do it). If you’re an urban dweller, check for your city’s information site as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8ot2F"&gt;While most personal physicians do not have access to vaccines, your doctor may be able to tell you some of the places to check. Other resources include your local hospital system, your union (especially if your employment qualifies you for a vaccination), and, of course, friends and colleagues, many of whom have probably been doing their own searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZ6Bfn"&gt;As you find resources and sites, make sure to bookmark them. I keep a folder on my bookmarks bar called “COVID” — you may want to name yours something more cheerful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lP4_R3np2CX9crqTcg9Mq6I2Js=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13963741/IMG_1653.1419968302.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6uguNM"&gt;Have all your information ready&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1Dt0LZ"&gt;Many of us who have tried to register for vaccination appointments have gone through the experience of filling out several screens of information only to find that, by the time we got to the end, the appointment was gone. So it’s a good idea to have all your data — such as your name, age, address, insurance info, and the registration ID / password for the site — immediately at hand. The faster you can go through the registration process, the more likely you are to actually get an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRD8jU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleague Cory Zapatka says that he highly recommends using a password manager if you have one. He created accounts with all the vaccination sites in his area, even if they didn’t have appointments available at the time, so that if / when the time came, he could just auto-fill and get in right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9bBlc"&gt;And if you do get an appointment, make sure you have the appropriate paperwork already handy — especially since available appointments can be last minute. Necessary paperwork could include proof of employment, proof of age, or proof of a qualifying condition. Since the last one may require a doctor’s note or other record, it’s a good idea to call your doctor now — or if you’ve got access to a doctor’s or hospital website, that may offer you access to the proof you need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dqUcf"&gt;One more thing: check to see if you’ve gotten all the email that has been sent to you by your vaccine supplier. At least one staff member of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; found a necessary consent form hiding in her spam folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wCK4vB"&gt;Watch for news of upcoming vaccination sites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bDlWg4"&gt;Keep an eye on the news. More and more sites and hubs are being added as the US gears up for a stronger push. If you see a news item saying that a hub is about to open, find the site for the hub and keep checking — once it does open, the available slots will probably go quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz172X"&gt;One thing that sometimes helps is to look for patterns in the appearance of new appointments. For example, when I heard that the pharmacy chain Walgreens was going to begin giving out vaccines in my area, I spent a couple of days going onto the site, and suddenly realized that there was a pattern: the company was only scheduling appointments two to four days in advance and was adding new appointments each day just after midnight. Once I understood the pattern, I was able to get appointments for a couple of friends and let others know about it as well. (Note: since vaccine supplies and scheduling methods can change on a dime, this particular strategy may no longer work by the time you read this.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsRia6ki1VqiuNodQvjKHdK9-ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299690/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_8.47.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gz26d4"&gt;Look for help online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PgrwN8"&gt;There are a number of online resources popping up headed by developers and other technology-savvy folks who have taken the time and effort to try to make sense of this confusion. (Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/10/covid-vaccine-appointment-websites/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/nyregion/vaccine-website-appointment-nyc.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for some of these listings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bUR9PN"&gt;California&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="111Dwk"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/"&gt;VaccinateCA&lt;/a&gt; checks pharmacies and hospitals for information about open appointments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="h3AFk9"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WLYqtL"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.macovidvaccines.com/"&gt;MA Covid Vaccine Appointments site&lt;/a&gt; offers lists of and links to sites with available appointments. A volunteer-run site, &lt;a href="https://vaccinatema.com/"&gt;Vaccinate MA&lt;/a&gt;, tries to improve on the state website with a map-based design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BeZogz"&gt;Another site, &lt;a href="https://macovidvaxhelp.com/"&gt;Massachusetts COVID Vaccination Help&lt;/a&gt;, uses volunteers to help eligible state residents book an appointment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="c9OpvY"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZYJAS8"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vaccinatenj.com/"&gt;Vaccinate NJ&lt;/a&gt; also uses volunteers to try to help state residents find vaccine opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ijVYyv"&gt;New York&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Vhk2GI"&gt;An NYC site called &lt;a href="https://www.turbovax.info/"&gt;TurboVax&lt;/a&gt; pulls “the latest appointments from 45 city and state-run vaccine sites in the NYC area” and puts them on Twitter. Followers who set their Twitter notifications for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/turbovax"&gt;@turbovax&lt;/a&gt; can quickly find out about newly opened appointment slots. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c0AX5B"&gt;Another called &lt;a href="https://nycvaccinelist.com/"&gt;NYC Vaccine List&lt;/a&gt; uses a combination of scripts and checks by volunteers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22256167/covid-vaccine-website-nyc-appointment"&gt;scour various sites for openings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YhbTu2"&gt;A site called &lt;a href="https://vaxhelp.nyc/"&gt;vaxhelp.nyc&lt;/a&gt; takes you through step-by-step instructions on how to navigate the New York State-run vaccine site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DyhcNt"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="TFo3y1"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vaccinatepa.org/"&gt;VaccinatePA&lt;/a&gt; uses a team of volunteers to call hospitals and pharmacies for information on where appointments are available, where you can get on a waitlist, and whom to contact.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vRg75P"&gt;Texas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ZJic26"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.covid19vaccinetx.com/"&gt;Covid 19 Vaccine TX&lt;/a&gt; is a crowdsourced resource for registering with local counties and finding locations where vaccines may be available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3D44TY"&gt;If you’re on Slack, you might want to check out &lt;a href="https://www.texasupdates.com/"&gt;Texas Vaccine Updates&lt;/a&gt;, where you can get alerts on availability at various venues and find discussions on topics like how to prove eligibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NEM7f0"&gt;Washington&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="yR8waA"&gt;A volunteer group in the state of Washington has launched the &lt;a href="https://www.covidwa.com/"&gt;WA COVID Vaccine Finder&lt;/a&gt; as an aggregation resource for vaccination appointments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hFMYTz"&gt;General resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="C1YLfR"&gt;There are several sites that aggregate the aggregators: &lt;a href="https://wherecanigetavaccine.com/"&gt;Where Can I Get A Vaccine?&lt;/a&gt; offers a list of sites available for various US states. &lt;a href="https://covidshotfinder.com/"&gt;COVIDShotFinder&lt;/a&gt; lets you select a state or county and look for the various vaccine resources available. &lt;a href="https://www.findashot.org/"&gt;Find A Shot&lt;/a&gt; also shows you possible openings depending on your state, and it has its own &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/findashot/id1556177037"&gt;iOS app&lt;/a&gt;. A site named &lt;a href="https://www.findvaccinenow.com/"&gt;Vaccine Now&lt;/a&gt; offers to find sources not only in the US, but in the UK, Germany, India, Pakistan, and the UAE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jTJTFG"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), together with the Boston Children’s Hospital and other medical institutions, operates &lt;a href="https://vaccinefinder.org/"&gt;VaccineFinder&lt;/a&gt;, which was created to promote flu and other general vaccinations but is now dedicated to helping people find COVID vaccinations. VaccineFinder lets you search using your ZIP code and is singular in that it allows you to filter for the Moderna, Pfizer / BioNTech, and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jdCWU8"&gt;One possible strategy is to use page-change-monitoring tools such as &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/blog/how-to-be-alerted-of-covid-19-vaccine-availability-in-your-local-pharmacy/"&gt;Visualping&lt;/a&gt; to generate alerts for when new appointments become available. These apps watch websites for you and send alerts to your email, text, or even Slack account when new information appears. They can be very useful (and allow you to take time for, say, lunch). But since these are, for the most part, business apps, you may need to pay for the privilege. For example, while &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/pricing"&gt;Visualping does have a free service&lt;/a&gt;, it is limited to pinging you once an hour up to 65 times a month, which may not be often enough if you’re trying to score an appointment.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nhHjOx"&gt;If you’re a developer and / or coder who wants to help, check out &lt;a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/"&gt;US Digital Response&lt;/a&gt;, an independent organization which, according to its website, “connects experienced, pro-bono technologists with local government and non-profit organizations responding to crisis.”&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are able, it’s a good idea to reach out and help those who may not be able to get appointments on their own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8mSy40"&gt;If you can, help others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Kz9AlN"&gt;One of the worst things about the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines is that those who need it the most are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;often the least likely to be able to navigate the technology required to get an appointment&lt;/a&gt;: older people, differently abled people, or those who don’t have or can’t afford computers and / or internet connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2VOR9"&gt;If you have the time and talent, reach out to anyone you know who may not be able to get an appointment on their own. This could be as simple as finding phone numbers they can call to try to schedule an appointment, going online and getting an appointment for them, or helping them get to and from the vaccination site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Evm4o5"&gt;You could also see if there are any groups that are organizing help. For example, a startup nonprofit called &lt;a href="https://www.brydgehealth.org/"&gt;Brydge Health&lt;/a&gt; tries to make connections between those who need help getting an appointment and volunteers who can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rm5plO"&gt;Look for leftover vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M5v0nn"&gt;While the vaccines can last for six months while they’re kept frozen, once thawed and refrigerated, the Pfizer vaccine will last five days while the Moderna vaccine will last for 30 days. As a result, when people don’t show up for their appointments, some centers will &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22229169/leftover-vaccines-random-people-grocery-stores-pharmacies"&gt;offer vaccinations to those who may not immediately qualify&lt;/a&gt; rather than waste vaccines that would otherwise be rendered unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI3933"&gt;However, running to a nearby pharmacy or vaccine hub in the hit-and-miss hopes that there will be some shots waiting at the end of the day isn’t the most effective way to be vaccinated. (Besides, getting hypothermia while waiting in the cold isn’t going to help.) At least one group is trying to ameliorate the situation: a pilot project called &lt;a href="https://vaxstandby.com/"&gt;Vaccination Standby&lt;/a&gt; says that it will monitor providers around the US for word of extra doses and text notifications to those whose zip codes are near the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAc3tM"&gt;There are also local organizations that are offering standby lists. For example, Buncombe County in North Carolina has a &lt;a href="https://www.buncombecounty.org/countycenter/news-detail.aspx?id=19137"&gt;vaccination waitlist and standby list&lt;/a&gt;, as does the &lt;a href="https://www.co.monroe.in.us/egov/documents/1611179705_09719.pdf"&gt;Monroe County Health Department&lt;/a&gt; in Indiana. Check your local government site to see if there’s one in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fg3eNk"&gt;Be persistent!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JTTPvK"&gt;Yes, it’s frustrating as hell, but keep at it. If a website crashes, try again. If you’re dropped from a phone call, call again (and have a game, video, or book ready to keep yourself occupied while you’re on hold). If you can’t find anything during working hours, try late at night or very early in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBXxUO"&gt;Persistence may be one of the most important aspects of getting an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. You may be tempted to give up, especially after hitting the “no appointments available” wall time and time again. But until vaccine production is ramped up enough to cover more of our population, and until distribution becomes more organized and easier to manage, simple stubbornness may be your best tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwiVs8"&gt;And hopefully this article, and all of the advice it contains, will soon be unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Real-world evidence shows that the COVID-19 vaccines work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New York Opens 14 Pop-Up Vaccination Sites Throughout State" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fO5w88qUpMva_wnxOF_Q1KLSbNs=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69049121/1309318485.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aazvjm"&gt;Three months after the United States’ COVID-19 vaccination campaign began, researchers are starting to collect data showing that the vaccines are just as good in the real world as they were in the clinical trials testing them. Recent studies have consistently shown that the vaccines don’t just protect against symptoms — they reduce the risk that someone will get infected with the coronavirus, a signal that they’ll reduce the spread of the virus, not just prevent sickness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6h3vW"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569345/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-efficacy-announcement"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573072/pfizer-vaccine-effective-authorization-fda-safe"&gt;Pfizer / BioNTech&lt;/a&gt; vaccines were both around 95 percent effective at protecting people against symptomatic COVID-19 in large trials. It was never guaranteed that they’d perform just as well when they were distributed to the general public. Despite the best efforts of researchers to closely mimic the real world in a clinical trial, they’re never quite the same. The types of people who volunteer for trials sometimes aren’t representative of the general population. Certain groups, like pregnant people, weren’t recruited for the trials. The dose administration was in a more controlled environment than mass vaccination sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJUa0d"&gt;That’s why it’s so encouraging to see these vaccines do just as good a job protecting people outside of the clinical trials. This week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced encouraging results from a study designed to check how well the COVID-19 vaccines could protect frontline workers against infections in a real-world setting. Just under 4,000 health care workers and first responders &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm?s_cid=mm7013e3_w#contribAff"&gt;swabbed themselves weekly&lt;/a&gt; over 13 weeks to check for the virus. In that group, which is regularly exposed to COVID-19 at work, two shots of the vaccines were 90 percent effective against infection. A single dose was also protective; it prevented 80 percent of infections. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mx3oHg6C39gd0artDq6gbLM_ANw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408006/mm7013e3_COVIDVaccineFieldEffectiveness_IMAGE_29Mar21_v2_1200x675_medium.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fI3sg4"&gt;The CDC’s results build on other research that has had similarly good findings. The first real-world data on vaccines came from Israel, which had a fast start to its COVID-19 vaccination program. &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2101765?query=featured_home"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; from February compared around 600,000 people who had been vaccinated with the Pfizer / BioNTech shots to 600,000 people who had not been vaccinated. It found that it was 94 percent effective against symptomatic COVID-19 a week after the second dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1YAdt5"&gt;In the United States, the first data came from people living in long-term care facilities and health care workers — who also happened to be the first people to get the vaccine in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUwTpc"&gt;A close look at the long-term care facilities was especially important for researchers because the people living in them are elderly and very vulnerable to COVID-19. In addition, vaccines sometimes don’t work as well in older adults. So it was good news to see that just one dose of the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7011e3.htm#contribAff"&gt;63 percent effective&lt;/a&gt; against infection — not just symptoms — of the coronavirus in two long-term care facilities in Connecticut, according to a CDC report from March. &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.15.21251623v1.full.pdf"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; found that the shots were also 88 percent effective against coronavirus infections in a group of Mayo Clinic patients vaccinated between December 2020 and early February 2021, presumably all long-term care facility residents and health care workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuIFUS"&gt;As vaccination campaigns around the world continue, researchers will keep collecting data and tracking their effectiveness in different groups. There are still unanswered questions — experts still want to know how the available vaccines &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/real-world-study-to-offer-look-at-how-covid-19-vaccines-stack-up"&gt;compare to each other&lt;/a&gt;, how long protection lasts, and how well they work in people who are &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/91775"&gt;immunocompromised&lt;/a&gt;, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCCvYP"&gt;But the studies we have so far are early signals that the COVID-19 vaccines are working, and working extremely well. That makes holding off the looming &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/cdc-cases-warning-fourth-surge"&gt;fourth coronavirus surge&lt;/a&gt; in the United States even more important: the more people stay safe now, the more get the benefit of the lifesaving shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BrrOu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0IJIR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
