    <title>The new RadRover is Rad Power Bikes’ first e-bike with an integrated battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bQkdyHc5MZUTRuyTGpGoh5W5eWI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69605187/RoverFarmer_754.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L7KBb3"&gt;The RadRover, Rad Power Bikes’ flagship electric bike, is getting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21049638/rad-power-bikes-radrover-step-thru-new-design-price-range"&gt;another major upgrade&lt;/a&gt;. The bike will be the first from the Seattle-based company to feature a semi-integrated battery. And when it’s released later this year, it will be the most expensive model in Rad Power Bikes’ lineup to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFR9nw"&gt;The RadRover 6 Plus (it’s a mouthful of an official name) comes with a bevy of new parts, including hydraulic disc brakes, a custom geared-hub motor, a new ergonomic frame, and an improved LED display that’s easier to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nDfBdp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the most eye-catching new detail is certainly the semi-integrated battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ik8byN"&gt;But the most eye-catching new detail is certainly the semi-integrated battery, a first for the company. Rad Power Bikes’ batteries tend to be larger (672 amp-hour on average) than a lot of their European equivalents and are therefore harder to integrate into the frame of the bike. As such, the company has opted for externally mounted batteries that can be an eyesore but also practical, thanks to their ability to be removed for easier charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFlrus"&gt;The new RadRover’s battery can still be removed, but it now sits more snuggly inside the down tube of the frame. It’s certainly a cleaner look overall, while refraining from the completely integrated and nonremovable battery of companies like VanMoof, Gogoro, and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="erxeCu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10659395"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rcdxh8"&gt;Like the previous iterations, the RadRover 6 Plus will have fat tires for outdoor riding and recreation. And it will come in two frame types: high-step or step-through. The bike is available for preorder today and will start shipping on September 21st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a67EkB"&gt;The question is whether the new look will help the RadRover win some new customers. The more expensive price tag — $1,999 — certainly won’t help, but e-bike prices have been steadily increasing over the last year. Blame tariffs, supply chain constraints, and other factors for these increases, which is forcing the companies to reevaluate their costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3QWNQ"&gt;Unlike a lot of its competitors, Rad Power Bikes has a comfortable financial cushion, thanks to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266143/rad-power-bikes-investment-electric-ebike"&gt;$150 million investment round&lt;/a&gt; from earlier this year. At the time, the company said the money would help it grow beyond the world of two-wheeled transportation — though it has yet to reveal exactly how. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google TV update adds option to manually clear out ‘Continue watching’ row</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7EKevK6ygszSLmxZh185K9-1ydA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69604917/DSCF2108.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google TV interface first appeared on last year’s Chromecast.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oUOl7v"&gt;Google TV, the new smart TV interface that debuted on Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;most recent Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;, appears to be getting a small but important tweak for its “Continue watching” row. Over &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/comments/onmmeg/hide_from_continue_watching_on_google_tv_had_been/"&gt;on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/19/google-tv-continue-watching-hide/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) user u/Alfatango97 has spotted a new option to manually hide entries from the row, which is designed to let viewers quickly jump back into unfinished TV shows or films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCvbeg"&gt;When it works, the Continue watching row is a convenient way pick up from where viewing was interrupted. But occasionally it can get cluttered with content you started watching and have no intention of finishing, or content that’s finished but whose credits are so long that it still shows up as in-progress. Being able to manually clear out the row should make it easier to see the shows and films you actually want to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yCzd1Q"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created='"2021-07-20T09:55:46.701163+00:00"'&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/comments/onmmeg/hide_from_continue_watching_on_google_tv_had_been/?ref_source=embed&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;Hide from continue watching on Google tv had been added&lt;/a&gt; from
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/"&gt;Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;script async="" src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FZR1Ix"&gt;It’s the latest example of Google’s two TV interfaces — Android TV and Google TV — slowly converging. &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes that the ability to manually prune titles from the “continue watching” list has been possible in Android TV for a while, it’s just now shifting over to Google TV. Meanwhile, Android TV has received a series of updates that have made it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22263131/android-tv-software-update-ui-interface-menus-google-chromecast-refresh"&gt;look&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22580720/android-tv-watchlist-google-tv-features"&gt;perform&lt;/a&gt; more and more like Google TV. The convergence seems inevitable given that Google TV is set to &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/09/30/android-tv-replaced-google-tv-update/"&gt;replace Android TV over the next two years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYA6px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;notes that the feature is yet to widely roll out. We’ve contacted Google to ask when it’s due to be available to everyone, and will update this article if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple pushes back return to offices due to rising COVID cases: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Aerial Views Of Silicon Valley Housing And Tech Campuses" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3z7EP1rVRfy_lkvq4hpAfgGIR10=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69604565/1178079031.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3fqDyv"&gt;Apple is delaying its plan to return to mandatory in-person work because of the increase of COVID cases driven by the Delta variant, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-20/apple-will-postpone-return-to-office-after-covid-19-persists"&gt;according to Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. The company had laid out a roadmap for returning to its offices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;in early September&lt;/a&gt;, with employees expected to come in at least three days a week, but now that deadline has reportedly been extended “by at least a month to October at the earliest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ilw7M8"&gt;Apple’s return to offices was controversial among some of its employees. A group of workers in an internal Slack channel for thousands of “remote work advocates” collaborated on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to CEO Tim Cook and the rest of Apple’s leadership, making the case that the company should embrace a more flexible work-from-home policy. Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s SVP of retail and people, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556615/apple-response-hybrid-work-model-employee-letter-remote"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt; to the request by saying “in-person collaboration is essential to our culture and our future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="D6200r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mark Zuckerberg on taking his massive workforce remote","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21265780/facebook-remote-work-mark-zuckerberg-interview-wfh"},{"title":"Sundar Pichai on managing Google through the pandemic","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21262934/google-alphabet-ceo-sundar-pichai-interview-pandemic-coronavirus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bcQdRv"&gt;Apple was notoriously unfriendly to the concept of remote work pre-pandemic, and while allowing employees to work from home two days a week is a big change for the company, other Silicon Valley giants are giving workers more choice in where they do their jobs. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2020/5/21/21265699/facebook-remote-work-shift-workforce-permanent-covid-19-mark-zuckerberg-interview"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt; that he sees around half of the company permanently shifting to remote work within the next five to ten years. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422518/google-hybrid-work-office-remote-work-sundar-pichai-memo-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;Google has said&lt;/a&gt; that it expects 20 percent of employees to stick with remote work once its offices are open again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yawzey"&gt;Now it appears that Apple is one of the first companies to alter its plans in response to surging COVID cases. Employees will be given at least a month’s warning before they’ll be expected to return to in-person work, according to Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart, Ikea, and Amazon have a dirty shipping problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Consumers Buying Goods Online During The Covid Pandemic Results In Backup Of Tanker Ships At Long Beach Port" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xt5C-IwAAxybVPeY9DQ_tGFUOak=/179x0:7655x4984/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69604474/1299884666.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;SAN PEDRO, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 01: A container ship enters the Port of Los Angeles on February 1, 2021 in San Pedro, California. As of January 28, a record 38 container ships were on standby to offload cargo to the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles amid a wave of online consumer goods purchases in the U.S. amid the pandemic. | Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AnJwKi"&gt;Giant retailers, including Amazon and Ikea, have pledged to go green, but their shipping is still pretty dirty. Now shoppers can now see how much pollution some of the biggest retail companies in the US each generate while bringing goods into the country, thanks to a new report. In 2019, the 15 companies in the report generated almost as much climate pollution as 1.5 million American homes do in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaAXft"&gt;The report looks at greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution caused by shipping piles of cargo around the world and ranks the top 15 biggest polluters by company. Walmart tops&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the list, generating more greenhouse gas emissions than a coal-fired power plant would in a year. Ashley Furniture, Target, Dole, and Home Depot round out the top five. Ikea and Amazon ranked 7 and 8, respectively. Samsung ranked 9th, and LG was 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S86qrJHVS7Gp6z082W3wGVJTp64=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22727322/SIZ_Table_MaritimePolluters.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Pacific Environment, Stand.earth&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HyxFWA"&gt;While experts have known for a while that maritime shipping is the culprit behind three percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, individual retailers responsible for that pollution have largely been able to avoid scrutiny until now. But with the curtain pulled back on companies’ carbon footprints, consumers have more ammunition to demand action on climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCESXz"&gt;“There really hadn’t been an investigation into this pillar of companies’ emissions portfolio,” says Madeline Rose, primary author of the report published today by the nonprofit environmental groups Pacific Environment and Stand.earth. “Quite frankly, with the climate emergency on our doorstep, we just feel like there needs to be disruption of the data system and there needs to be greater transparency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ekEwdU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“With the climate emergency on our doorstep, we just feel like there needs to be disruption of the data system”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HnCNNz"&gt;To track companies’ emissions, the organizations	first looked at a public database called the Journal of Commerce to identify the US’ biggest importers by volume. They then commissioned the University Maritime Advisory Services (UMAS), which has access to other maritime import databases, to cross-reference the public data with their own proprietary information. Together, they matched retailers’ individual shipments to specific vessels. Based on the ships’ voyages, they were able to estimate fuel consumption and the resulting emissions. Their estimates are likely low, because the researchers weren’t able to verify all the cargo voyages made by franchises and shell companies with different names than their parent companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tvz7an"&gt;“Because the data is so opaque, they’re only capturing about 20 percent of the market and then they’re extrapolating upward from there,” says Dan Rutherford, who directs aviation and marine programs for the International Council on Clean Transportation, and who was not involved with the research. “I think that’s appropriate, because the data itself is not available. But it does point to the fact that we need better rules and transparency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tx7nML"&gt;The research also doesn’t take into account emissions from ships’ return journeys after unloading their cargo. Nor does it geolocate the emissions to see where they’re winding up. That could be important for coastal communities that get saddled with the pollution that drifts ashore. It’s estimated that &lt;a href="https://theicct.org/blog/staff/silent-deadly-case-shipping-emissions"&gt;60,000 people&lt;/a&gt; die prematurely each year after being exposed to air pollution from shipping. The 15 companies named in the new report generated as much air pollution in 2019 — including soot, sulfur oxide, and nitrous oxide — as tens of millions of cars and trucks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAZ9Jy"&gt;The study is also limited to US imports, though the US is the largest consumer market in the world. Since supply chains can involve multiple companies spanning several countries, it’s been tricky to assign shipping emissions to any single nation. That’s made regulation of the industry’s pollution really hard because it’s not clear who should be held accountable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="adNCHb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Another giant case of emissions falling through the cracks” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yEMpXd"&gt;“Here you have another giant case of emissions falling through the cracks,” says Jennifer Jacquet, an associate professor of environmental studies at New York University who was not involved in the study. “We knew we needed to do something about shipping, and I don’t think a consensus has emerged exactly on how to deal with it... at least we can say, you know, IKEA is responsible for some of these emissions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2AA08"&gt;Despite their sweeping climate pledges, companies such as Ikea and Amazon are still doing significant damage to the planet, as this report shows. Both companies responded to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; with statements highlighting their sustainability commitments, while Walmart, LG, and Samsung did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21024497/ikea-smart-home-tech-sweden-furniture-sonos-meatballs-bjorn-block"&gt;Ikea&lt;/a&gt; says it wants to draw down more greenhouse gases than it emits by 2030. Amazon is trying to do something similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300427/amazon-climate-change-commitments-greenhouse-gas-emissions-jeff-bezos"&gt;by 2040&lt;/a&gt;, and is working to get more &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873947/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-jeff-bezos-order"&gt;electric vehicles on the road&lt;/a&gt; to slash emissions from its deliveries. Rose wants to see more of that thought put into how goods are moved by sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a1thvR"&gt;“One of the big problems with shipping is that it’s very out of sight out-of-mind pollution source,” Rose says. “If we do not get maritime ship emissions under control, we will not solve the climate emergency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NM3JUX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"New report suggests corporate climate change pledges aren’t that valuable ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575651/corporate-climate-change-pledges-lobbying-report-s-p-100-index"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>HalloApp is a private ad-free social network from two early WhatsApp employees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3UJfDaIP80W70tzujQ82FVVARTA=/0x167:4000x2834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69604234/mockup_phone.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A screenshot of HalloApp. | HalloApp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GDOZAL"&gt;Two of the earliest employees behind WhatsApp have emerged with a new private social network called HalloApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5W2EMY"&gt;Starting Monday, anyone can download and sign up for HalloApp in &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halloapp/id1501583052"&gt;Apple’s App Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.halloapp"&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt; on Android devices. There are many parallels between HalloApp and WhatsApp: the app is designed for group or individual chats with close friends and family, the only way you can find people is by knowing their phone number, the messages are encrypted, and there are no ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M65akw"&gt;While other startups have over the years tried and failed to build successful social networks for close friends (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8683885/daum-kakao-buys-path"&gt;RIP Path&lt;/a&gt;), the pedigree of HalloApp’s two cofounders, Neeraj Arora and Michael Donohue, makes this particular effort notable. They both worked at WhatsApp before and after Facebook bought it for $22 billion. Arora was WhatsApp’s chief business officer until 2018 and a key figure in negotiating the Facebook deal. And Donohue was WhatsApp’s engineering director for nearly nine years before he left Facebook in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dm4R3J"&gt;Both Arora and Donohue declined to be interviewed for this story, citing a desire to avoid press attention so early in the app’s lifespan. But they did recently sit down for an interview on Christopher Lochhead’s &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/christopher-lochhead-follow-your-different/id1204044507?i=1000529348315"&gt;“Follow Your Different” podcast&lt;/a&gt;, in which Arora said, “I think the best way to grow is to create an amazing product that people love to tell their friends and family about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eGdtF6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Imagine not being treated like a product.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WAfISg"&gt;HalloApp is broken up into four main tabs—a home feed of posts from your friends, group chats, individual chats, and settings—and its overall aesthetic is very minimal. There are no algorithms sorting posts or group chats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EtEUtO"&gt;Arora laid out the philosophy behind HalloApp &lt;a href="https://halloapp.com/blog/real-relationship-network/"&gt;in a company blog post&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, in which positions it as the antidote to traditional, engagement-driven social media, or “the 21st century cigarette.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8dDN8"&gt;“Imagine your friends online were your real friends,” he wrote. “Imagine your feed wasn’t filled with people and posts you didn’t care about. Imagine scrolling through meaningful moments and seeing what you wanted you to see—not what the algorithm wanted you to see. Imagine not being treated like a product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1SMVB"&gt;While the blog post doesn’t name Facebook specifically, it’s no secret that WhatsApp’s two cofounders, Jan Koum and Brian Acton, left Facebook over disagreements about plans to monetize WhatsApp with ads. Acton, who now funds the encrypted messaging app Signal, famously tweeted “#deletefacebook” during the height of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. WhatsApp still doesn’t have ads, but Facebook has recently made a push to get businesses selling goods and interacting with customers on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1bafc"&gt;Eventually, HalloApp plans to charge users for features with a subscription, mimicking how WhatsApp originally monetized before Facebook bought it. For now, the 12-person company is running off an undisclosed amount of money the cofounders raised from investors.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will end onsite COVID-19 testing at its US warehouses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/brCts2kGA03tArfq4DNloDA_1wE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69603733/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nuyzTQ"&gt;Amazon has informed workers that it will end on-site COVID-19 testing at its US warehouses, as first &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-to-stop-covid-testing-in-u-s-warehouses"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it will begin ramping down its testing operations in the US by July 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SkJBIi"&gt;Although many in the US are vaccinated — 48 percent of the country is fully vaccinated, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times’&lt;/em&gt; data as of Monday&lt;/a&gt; — the change comes as case rates around the country &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/15/us/covid-cases-rise.html"&gt;are going up&lt;/a&gt;. The significant majority of new cases have been found &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-covid-19-cases-united-states-almost-all-among-people-unvaccinated/"&gt;among unvaccinated people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYrxjm"&gt;Amazon informed staff Monday about its plan to end COVID-19 testing, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. “Free COVID-19 testing is now widely available and our employees have many options available to them, including through health providers and public testing sites,” part of the message reportedly said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ezbvaC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company had instituted a massive testing operation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o4cyio"&gt;The company had instituted a massive testing operation, &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/update-on-covid-19-testing"&gt;saying in October&lt;/a&gt; that it planned to handle 50,000 tests per day across 650 sites by November. And as of May 19th, Amazon no longer required masks for fully vaccinated warehouse workers unless otherwise mandated by local laws, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/19/amazon-says-vaccinated-workers-can-ditch-masks-starting-next-week.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Although the company hasn’t required that warehouse workers be vaccinated, it is encouraging it by offering bonuses of up to $80 for getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aKfn7B"&gt;But workers at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202745/amazon-coronavirus-walk-out-detroit-protests-warehouse-cleaning"&gt;warehouses&lt;/a&gt; walked out early in the pandemic to protest the company’s handling of the virus at its facilities. Sometimes, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/tech/amazon-workers-coronavirus/index.html"&gt;left workers in the dark&lt;/a&gt; when their colleagues had tested positive for the virus, for example. In June, the company also started selling a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535453/amazon-covid-test-consumers-available"&gt;$39.99 at-home COVID-19 test&lt;/a&gt; that is available for consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d82b9L"&gt;Amazon will resume its employee testing program if there is a change in guidance from local or national public health officials, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Louis Vuitton’s $2,890 light-up speaker looks like something Thanos would steal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yztDz0l_5RmyYPGWyoRsgp9rg8M=/0x124:1674x1240/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69603136/Screen_Shot_2021_07_19_at_3.11.06_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tZgyG3"&gt;Louis Vuitton has revealed its next foray into tech products: the $2,890 Horizon Light Up Speaker, which looks less like either a gadget or a piece of high fashion, and more like an artifact of untold cosmic power from the next Marvel movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7E5qkW"&gt;According to Louis Vuitton, the idea is that the Horizon speaker will serve as an artistic centerpiece of your living room or outfit, a unique blend of fashion and technology that aims to challenge what a portable speaker should look like, a goal in which it undoubtably has succeeded. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WnquotRtWDZQNrWjUbPeScV21N8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22727080/Screen_Shot_2021_07_19_at_4.33.37_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PJLrrI"&gt;But between the glass, stainless steel, and leather construction, 35 LEDs, and the brand’s traditional symbols and logos plastered on virtually every surface of the speaker, the overall effect is less the kind of discreet, high-end speaker that companies like Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen are known for and more “eldritch space artifact.” Seeing as I don’t have a cool $2,890 lying around to buy and dismantle a Horizon speaker, I can’t confirm with 100 percent certainty whether one of the Infinity Stones is housed within, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zl1xT8"&gt;The company says that the Horizon speaker is inspired by its similarly extraterrestrial-ly shaped Toupie handbag, which comes in a similar, UFO-esque design (and, incidentally, sold at a similar $2,000-plus price range). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-M6h6Eq7WHGoK2NO48EWliFzocI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22727081/Screen_Shot_2021_07_19_at_4.34.20_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zczBXI"&gt;Despite its bizarre appearance and astronomical price tag, Louis Vuitton does appear to have actually built a pretty nice speaker, at least technically speaking. The Horizon features a three-inch subwoofer, two 0.75-inch tweeters, three microphones for voice calls, up to 15 hours of playback off a charge, an included charging / display dock, and both Bluetooth 5.1 and AirPlay 2 for wireless audio. It even charges via USB-C. Of course, those are all things that you’d hope to see at a bare minimum on a speaker that costs almost $3,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbZdXv"&gt;The Louis Vuitton Horizon Light Up speaker is available to order now from Louis Vuitton’s website, although it won’t ship until July 31st — assuming the Mad Titan doesn’t seize them all first. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Olympics are approaching a danger zone of extreme heat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="OLY-2020-TOKYO-JPN-HEAT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f4Dr3L1ZRmW9hLHlOnQJgxbygdg=/0x0:4611x3074/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69602825/1157638808.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A man cools off at a mist station installed at Shiokaze Park during the beach volleyball test event for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo on July 25, 2019. - Tokyo 2020 Olympics organisers tested everything from misting sprays to air-conditioned tents on July 25 as they trialed heat mitigation measures a year before the Games gets under way.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Behrouz Mehri / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NwMFjV"&gt;Olympic athletes are grappling with another public health threat on top of the pandemic: extreme heat. This year’s summer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Olympics are&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/17/weather/olympics-heat-forecast-climate/index.html"&gt;forecast&lt;/a&gt; to be the hottest in decades. Temperatures expected to rise above 30 degrees Celsius (close to 90 degrees Fahrenheit) this week could put even the strongest athletes in danger of heat stroke or illness. They’ll also have to contend with oppressive humidity, which interferes with the body’s ability to regulate its temperature by sweating, on top of the scorching heat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="TTbCmH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The training is brutal, and the conditions that the athletes are training for are dangerous&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bnp6hT"&gt;Athletes have tried to acclimate themselves to the weather in advance of the games. Team USA, for example, even took inspiration from how the US military gets soldiers ready for desert deployments, according to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2021/07/18/tokyo-olympics-heat-extreme-weather-conditions/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A training regimen might include donning a sweatshirt and beanie while working out in the summer heat. Canada’s women’s rowing team trained indoors and turned the heat all the way up to 35 degrees Celsius inside the sports dome at the Canadian Sport Institute Pacific in Victoria, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/heat-training-athletes-1.6090826"&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s6fVlf"&gt;The training is brutal, and the conditions that the athletes are training for are dangerous, as &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; points out: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qPIALi"&gt;While seeking an advantage, the USOPC also must protect athletes from heat stroke, dehydration and other conditions caused by overexertion. Elite athletes are at acute risk of suffering from those conditions. They separate themselves by their capacity to train and compete through discomfort that would cause others to quit. In extreme heat, such doggedness can transform from admirable to life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TilIkB"&gt;Heatwaves and heat-related illnesses are on the rise as a result of human-caused climate change. In Tokyo last year, 4,759 people required emergency transportation because of heat illness in July and August. That’s thousands more compared to the same time period in 2008, when there were just 905 (&lt;a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/OLYMPICS-2020/SUMMER-HEAT/bdwvkogrzvm/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has helpful data visualizations on the magnitude of the problem). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feFN5W"&gt;We can see some similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/21/20826524/extreme-heat-and-humidity-are-putting-athletes-at-greater-health-risk"&gt;trends in the US&lt;/a&gt;. The Pacific Northwest struggled with extreme temperatures for the region last month, which led to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580120/emergency-department-visits-spiked-june-heat-wave-us-northwest"&gt;huge uptick in emergency room visits&lt;/a&gt;. The late June heatwave interfered with Olympic trials in Eugene, Oregon, where competitions were delayed. Heptathlete Taliyah Brooks&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://thegrio.com/2021/06/27/track-olympics-heat-taliyah-brooks/"&gt;fainted&lt;/a&gt; before the javelin throw and had to be taken off the field in a wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4Bqop"&gt;Some events have been moved this year from Tokyo to nearby Sapporo, where temperatures are typically a little cooler. But experts warn that athletes will need to keep preparing for hotter temperatures in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C0hAjN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s a horrible moment when you see athletes cross the line”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kuDV4Q"&gt;“I think we’re certainly approaching a danger-zone,” Melissa Wilson, an Olympic rower from Great Britain, said in a recent &lt;a href="https://basis.org.uk/rings-of-fire"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the British Association for Sustainable Sport on how heat could affect the 2021 Olympics. The 2019 Tokyo trials had already left three rowers requiring &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/12/concerns-rise-with-tokyo-heat-after-rowers-treated-at-olympic-test-event"&gt;medical treatment for heat exhaustion&lt;/a&gt;, according to the report. “It’s a horrible moment when you see athletes cross the line, their bodies fling back in total exhaustion, and then not rise up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zz3OB0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzvkZS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dish cuts a 10-year, $5 billion deal to make AT&amp;T the primary service provider for its MVNO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vqQWkZfflK3-Dud_Zc1jQyamkjE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69602744/acastro_200804_1777_dish_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dish is on a mission to become the US’ fourth wireless carrier.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D5m5WV"&gt;Dish Network has a new network operator partner for its MVNO brands: AT&amp;amp;T. The companies &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001001082/000100108221000019/dish-20210714x8k.htm"&gt;have signed a network services agreement (NSA)&lt;/a&gt; that will see Dish pay AT&amp;amp;T at least $5 billion over the course of the next ten years to use its 4G and 5G networks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295777/dish-network-5g-q3-2021"&gt;as Dish brings its own 5G network online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1A6h6"&gt;The deal takes effect immediately and comes at a time when relations between Dish and T-Mobile — currently a major network partner — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"&gt;are particularly strained&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a nonexclusive agreement, and Dish says that some of its customers will likely continue to connect to T-Mobile’s network. The arrangement also gives AT&amp;amp;T the right to request access to use some of Dish’s wireless spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Se1Rrl"&gt;Dish owns Boost Mobile, Ting, and Republic Wireless MVNOs, which operate on other carrier networks. Dish &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;acquired Boost Mobile&lt;/a&gt; in the T-Mobile / Sprint acquisition deal, as part of a scheme to set the company up as the fourth wireless carrier in the US. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352496/dish-ting-mobile-acquisition-tucows-network-tech"&gt;Dish’s Ting and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319621/dish-network-acquires-republic-wireless-5g-cell-carrier-mvno-t-mobile"&gt;Republic Wireless acquisitions&lt;/a&gt; also gave the company access to backend infrastructure and subscribers in anticipation of its launch as a full-fledged mobile carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wWwqet"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile’s responses on the matter have had strong “stop hitting yourself” vibes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QK2dvs"&gt;Things haven’t exactly gone smoothly. There’s the impending T-Mobile CDMA shutdown — a network many Boost customers still rely on — that Dish says is happening sooner than expected (T-Mobile’s responses on the matter have had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;strong “stop hitting yourself” vibes&lt;/a&gt;).  Dish has also been &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/financial/dish-sheds-363k-wireless-subs-warns-t-mobile-3g-shutdown"&gt;losing wireless subscribers&lt;/a&gt; in the hundreds of thousands over recent financial quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YpZqw"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T doesn’t operate a CDMA network, so this new deal isn’t meant to address that problem. At the very least it does include a two-year transition period when the agreement ends during which AT&amp;amp;T must cooperate to help users continue their service, so Dish can hopefully avoid additional potential setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRqZce"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JxBidU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap buys another company to make AR shopping a reality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1YngSmx-JtlK3DZ60nzTkJBoHB4=/0x624:3204x2760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69602719/Gucci_x_Snap_Shoe_Try_On_Women_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snap and Gucci recently partnered to let users virtually try on a limited edition pair of shoes. | Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ntRwo0"&gt;Snap is making a big bet on AR shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0PMYnt"&gt;The parent company of Snapchat has bought Vertebrae, a company that lets brands create and manage 3D versions of their goods. Vertebrae’s 50-person team will keep developing the platform for existing and new clients, according to a Snap spokesperson. The idea is that a company can easily upload visuals and other information about an item into Vertebrae and have a 3D version made for shoppers to access, and potentially buy directly, within Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVYRK1"&gt;While Snap first used its augmented reality tech for silly effects like puking rainbows and dancing hotdogs, the company increasingly sees AR as a way to shop. Early tests of AR shopping experiences, such as a recent collaboration with Gucci to let people virtually try on a pair of limited-edition sneakers, have shown Snap that people are &lt;a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/inb32lme5009/hSj5P9vzaox79vlTqXZfj/d6094404212f1327e8b7d69535337941/Snap_Consumer_AR_Research_GlobalReport.pdf"&gt;more likely to buy something&lt;/a&gt; after they interact with it in 3D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yD07WF"&gt;“We’re thrilled to join Snap, where we will strengthen and scale our world class 3D asset platform for retailers and brands,” Vertebrae CEO Vince Cacace said in an exclusive statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The future of AR commerce is bright, and we’ll continue to make it easy for our partners to create, manage, and deploy AR experiences across all customer touch points.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X_9WDt77TkBgpJ3PS31ei7hlOHs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726724/Axis_Press_V2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Vertebrae&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vertebrae’s interface for brands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jjHg70"&gt;Snap declined to say how much it paid for Vertebrae, but the deal was likely small relative to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447150/snap-waveoptics-acquisition-500m-spectacles-waveguides"&gt;$500 million acquisition of WaveOptics&lt;/a&gt;, which makes the AR displays in its Spectacles smart glasses. Vertebrae raised about $10 million in venture funding to date. It lists Toyota, Adidas, CB2, and other well-known brands as clients on its website. It also &lt;a href="https://sparkar.facebook.com/blog/getting-started-ar-commerce/"&gt;worked with Facebook&lt;/a&gt; — Snap’s biggest competitor — on AR shopping tech in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wh9znP"&gt;When you piece together Vertebrae with Snap’s other shopping-related acquisitions and features, including &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/snap-is-taking-a-significant-step-into-fashion-e-commerce-with-its-acquisition-of-fit-analytics/"&gt;Fit Analytics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/snaps-screenshop-scan-shop-clothing-outfits-2021-5"&gt;Screenshop&lt;/a&gt;, it’s easier to get a sense of its ambitions to be a shopping destination. For brands, the company is setting up a self-service system to easily upload and manage AR versions of their goods that people can discover in Snapchat. For Snapchat users, imagine being able to scan just about anything in the real world and turn it into a virtual object that you can manipulate, resize, and then buy without leaving the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQ3tjA"&gt;If people really take to AR shopping with their phones, it will make Snapchat more of a utility in the near term while also making its ads more effective, since someone’s purchases are a strong indicator of other items they’d be interested in. And looking beyond smartphones, AR shopping is more compelling in a future world when more people are potentially wearing smart glasses with displays in them, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445481/snap-spectacles-ar-augmented-reality-announced"&gt;Snap’s latest Spectacles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
