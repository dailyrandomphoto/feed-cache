    <title>Black Ops Cold War is a great game trapped inside Call of Duty</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f9N5IDxXYPQrug1VHQ-bXg9msAs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67926265/BOCW_PC_Trailer_TOUT.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a7qX8Q"&gt;At 17 years old, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;is not quite America’s longest war, but it’s close. When I went into the single-player story mode for &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I knew what to expect: a pleasing shooting gallery with familiar narrative twists (there’s always a nuke about to go off) and re-shuffled scenery (this time the walls are plastered in vintage Doritos ads). But the real twist is that I left feeling frustrated about the game it could have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pb30w8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War &lt;/em&gt;is the kernel of a thrilling and intimate spy story that’s tragically strapped on the front of a runaway train. The game begins in a neon-drenched bar in Amsterdam on New Year’s Eve 1980, where your CIA partner beckons you to quickly follow him away from the party. From the beginning, &lt;em&gt;Cold War &lt;/em&gt;is gorgeous to look at, and I was surprised so much care had been given to decorating a room that you’re expected to rush out of. Moments later, after walking a couple blocks in a beautifully rendered winter town, I found myself in a roaring gunfight with a small army of heavily armed bad guys who improbably pop out of every corner like aliens in an &lt;em&gt;Area 51 &lt;/em&gt;cabinet. That’s entirely normal stuff for &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, but as the scene faded, I wished I was back in the bar talking to New Year’s revelers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iv9fPQ"&gt;A while later in the story, after digital Ronald Reagan orders you to blow up the world to stop a nuclear weapon, you’re tasked with infiltrating Soviet-controlled East Germany. Early in the mission, as I stood on a roof with my CIA comrade and took photos of people passing through the border checkpoint, I noticed myself purposefully trying to stay on the roof as long as possible even when there was nothing left to do there. Instead of hunting down my target, I wanted to go down to the street and play a high-fidelity version of &lt;em&gt;Papers, Please&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Eventually, I advanced through the mission, expecting another bombastic firefight. But there was none. Sure, I later had to take out more than a few guards, but for a &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;level, the visit to East Germany was practically meditative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXnuva"&gt;I later met a contact in a warmly lit bar and felt excited to speak to her. Unfortunately, the conversation was cut short after a couple of dialogue choices, as two Stasi officers quickly entered and forced me to escape prematurely. A short while later, I had to sneak into the apartment of an adversary and tiptoe around his wife and child to plant a device in a briefcase. As soon as I was discovered and knocked out, I knew &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;alternate universe — the one where I imagined it was a compelling spy game based on suspense and relationships — had ended. Cue the explosions and gunfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wplfit"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cold War &lt;/em&gt;is filled with these loud tonal contrasts. A mission where you play as a mole inside of KGB headquarters felt like it was ripped straight out of &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and it’s really fun. Your American friends need to steal the identities of double agents from a bunker under the building, and the only way to get them access is to kill or frame a Russian general who holds the key. (A good sign: I replayed the level several times to try all of the different ways you could ruin the general’s day.) But almost as soon as I got my CIA contacts into the building, the shooting began. What was the point of all that delightful subterfuge if only to blow the place up and kill everyone inside? Just when I thought I was out, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;pulled me back in and set me on its narrow path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3IP9g"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;teaching is the illusion of free will, &lt;em&gt;Cold War&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;penultimate chapter is the series’s gospel. The revelation unfolds when the game starts literally telling you what to do. As your character revisits the past, a narrator starts giving verbal commands about which paths through the jungle you should choose. Though your choices are ultimately futile, you don’t have to follow orders and, in fact, the game expects you not to. (I laughed out loud when I found out there are achievements both for resisting orders and following them unquestioningly.) I’m sure the developers didn’t intend for me to linger disobediently on that roof in East Germany, but here they explicitly asked me to reject the cues they spent two decades teaching me. And so, I resisted playing &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;for as long as I could, until my character was yanked back into reality, where the story ended in a final shooting gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewagk0"&gt;Again, there’s not exactly anything &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; with that. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;is more sport than story, and that’s not a defect. I grew up playing shooters and to me they feel just like playing baseball or hockey, to the extent that the payoff is achieving flow: when your body and its task become one in the same. You don’t need a great story for that connection to feel good, and playing &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;is like doing it in the major leagues. The narrative is just scenery, and to complain that it doesn’t match the gameplay or resemble poetry misses the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KshQZ5"&gt;But as the credits rolled, I felt a strange sense of loss. &lt;em&gt;Cold War &lt;/em&gt;is a perfectly fine dose of video game pulp, but at times it teases something vastly richer. With four huge game modes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21612873/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-review-zombies-warzone-multiplayer-impressions"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; is so big and complicated now&lt;/a&gt; that it would be easy to break off the story mode and try something different without sacrificing the core game’s sales potential. Instead of chasing another nuclear threat, I would have liked if the entirety of &lt;em&gt;Cold War&lt;/em&gt; was set in East Germany and given more time to explore the treachery and horror of the Stasi. And while I admit that expecting the series to jettison its kinetic jingoism is a contrived fantasy, I can’t help but feel like there are double agents inside Treyarch, desperately trying to send a message past the guards at Activision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QH9MKl"&gt;I’ve always wondered what might have happened if the real Ronald Reagan had spent all that nuclear missile defense money on something more meaningful. Now I’m wondering what might have happened if the fake Ronald Reagan did, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity’s designers talk about following up Breath of the Wild</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rN33aOiYOr49DfjlKN3q3bgWxlg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67916620/Switch_HyruleWarriorsAgeofCalamity_screenshot_03_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wo1s54"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572264/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review-nintendo-switch-zelda-botw-prequel"&gt;which launched on the Nintendo Switch last week&lt;/a&gt;, is a curious thing: a blockbuster release that’s both a sequel &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a prequel. It’s a follow-up to  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/17/6251849/hyrule-warriors"&gt;2014’s &lt;em&gt;Hyrule Warriors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a game that mashed together the fantastical realm of Hyrule with the action-heavy gameplay of the &lt;em&gt;Dynasty Warriors&lt;/em&gt; series. But it’s also a game that takes place before the pivotal events of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, making it a key piece of lore for diehard fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JJCaB"&gt;To find out a bit more about how the game came about, and how developer Koei Tecmo partnered with the &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; team at Nintendo, I was able to ask a few questions of &lt;em&gt;Age of Calamity&lt;/em&gt; producer Yosuke Hayashi and director Ryouta Matsushita. Here’s what they had to say about making the game and why weapon durability didn’t make a comeback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmjpIS"&gt; (And if you’re looking for more &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; insight, be sure to check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/11/14881076/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-interview"&gt;our lengthy chat with the directors of &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmTMZj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did the idea of making a prequel to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; come about? What made this timeline / setting a good fit for the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyrule Warriors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-type of experience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vnbX1x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hayashi:&lt;/strong&gt; Nintendo explicitly suggested the idea of using &lt;em&gt;Dynasty Warriors&lt;/em&gt; gameplay to show the Great Calamity in &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;. We also enjoyed &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; as fans, and thought we’d be able to make a really fun game with the idea. So I don’t remember really worrying much while we were solidifying each specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4KU2s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Were there specific ways you wanted to build off of or change things from the original &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyrule Warriors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3dLTsH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hayashi:&lt;/strong&gt; Something we realized with the previous game was that we wanted to create a story that revolved more tightly around the Link, Zelda, and Ganon trio. While I’d like everyone to experience the rest of the details for themselves, I think that we were even successful in achieving that in the first &lt;em&gt;Hyrule Warriors&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7ZlYTS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We needed the complete cooperation of the ‘Zelda’ team at Nintendo.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F7HwVk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since this game is so tightly connected with&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Zelda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; lore, did it require more direct collaboration with Nintendo? How would you describe the way Koei Tecmo and Nintendo work together on a project like this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PAMAz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hayashi:&lt;/strong&gt; Previously, &lt;em&gt;Hyrule Warriors&lt;/em&gt; was a spinoff game where Koei Tecmo had a certain amount of freedom with development. However, since we’re depicting the previously unknown environment of 100 years prior to &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; here, we needed the complete cooperation of the &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; team at Nintendo. While building up the project, we got input on a variety of areas from the &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; team, including visuals, scenario, sound, and the direction of gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCIXKe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matsushita:&lt;/strong&gt; To ensure that the game inherited the worldview and tone of &lt;em&gt;BOTW&lt;/em&gt;, we asked for in-depth reviews starting from the initial design stage. Creating a world that brings together everything in &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild,&lt;/em&gt; at a high level, is impossible without this collaborative effort. For the gameplay system, we aimed to respect the gameplay of Koei Tecmo’s &lt;em&gt;Warriors&lt;/em&gt; series while incorporating new gameplay elements that lived up to the expectations of the &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; team.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FARqOadoRMFkejmzx5Olqn_aERY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22080483/Switch_HyruleWarriorsAgeofCalamity_screenshot_07_copy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mifSK3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s likely a lot of players will be coming to this game after playing &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOTW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and not necessarily &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyrule Warriors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Is this something you took into consideration? Is the game designed in a way to ease in new players?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGlVKG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hayashi:&lt;/strong&gt; Our policy in developing &lt;em&gt;Age of Calamity &lt;/em&gt;was to create a game that would be fun for &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; players. So I think that it’s fun even if you haven’t played the previous &lt;em&gt;Hyrule Warriors&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vLXyR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matsushita:&lt;/strong&gt; It is an action game where you fight enemies, but you can also use creative methods such as items or the environment, in addition to fighting techniques, to defeat powerful enemies. I think we’ve created these elements so that they have hints that are easily recognizable to fans of the &lt;em&gt;Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MM8RGL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aside from the setting, were there any elements specific from &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOTW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; that you wanted to incorporate in this game? Were there key things from &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOTW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; that just didn’t work in a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynasty Warriors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; experience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdWywE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hayashi:&lt;/strong&gt; One system that obviously doesn’t work well is weapon durability. While this was very effective in &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Age of Calamity&lt;/em&gt; assumes that you’re strengthening your weapons as you play, so we’re using a system unique to this game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cuaOO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matsushita:&lt;/strong&gt; Using limited resources, such as weapons or food, was an element unique to Link in &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;. Since this game is about a war that encompasses all of Hyrule, we needed ways to depict a different aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black Ops Cold War is four Call of Duty games all competing to take over your hard drive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GwMb961MnreQZ17Rhas59cyRKMs=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67910046/cod_black_ops_cold_war_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Activision&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The new Call of Duty is a bloated mess, even when the individual parts succeed&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="amdNMx"&gt;It’s impossible to discuss the new &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; game without mentioning its size. The sheer magnitude of the software, in total gigabytes, has become perhaps the most defining and talked-about aspect of the long-running shooter series since the reboot of &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare &lt;/em&gt;last fall and the launch of Activision’s &lt;em&gt;Warzone &lt;/em&gt;battle royale a few months later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSLjuO"&gt;And it’s only growing larger. On PS5, the latest installment, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt; coupled with &lt;em&gt;Warzone, &lt;/em&gt;exceeds 250GB. That is nearly half the available free space of the built-in solid-state drive of Sony’s new console. But that huge file size is more than just a joke: it’s indicative of the state of modern &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPxcZh"&gt;The overall bloat of the experience has become both the franchise’s central selling point and its biggest flaw. In a bid to create the do-everything shooter that can compete with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and other live service games, Activision and the many studios it tasks with making a new &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; every year have created something so monstrously all-encompassing that it is difficult to both literally and figuratively fit other games into your rotation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WZiiVf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Call of Duty’ is so large it’s hard to fit anything else into your rotation or on your hard drive&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zqU1Wh"&gt;That may be the point. I have friends who aren’t playing &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War &lt;/em&gt;and who gave up on &lt;em&gt;Warzone &lt;/em&gt;months ago because they were tired of making space for the software and no longer feel like making storage management part of their daily gaming routine. But for those who buy in and sacrifice huge chunks of their hard drive and free time in the process, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War &lt;/em&gt;has a little something for everyone — enough, at least, to keep you hooked well into next year when the next installment arrives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gfpAcx"&gt;We’re past complaining about the cyclical nature of &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;. It comes out every year, almost always breaks sales records, and keeps chugging along, unphased by real-world conflict and aimed squarely at the type of person who likes to shoot guns fast but also occasionally in slow motion. It is a video game that knows what kind of experience it is. That, in turn, makes it a product with healthy consumer demand that will likely never go away so long as the human brain keeps responding predictably to the feedback loops it creates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mU4gS8"&gt;But last year, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;became something altogether different. Activision yanked its most successful, formulaic moneymaker into the future by tying it together with a fully baked battle royale mode, &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, now one of the most popular on the market. The company promised an ever-evolving &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;that could remain a stable fixture by adding what it needed and subtracting what it didn’t as the annual cycle progresses. Now, a year later, we have &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;, the first fully realized version of this vision of a live service &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdzSeT"&gt;Understandably, it’s kind of a mess as a holistic product, but much more impressive in its individual parts. The challenge now is deciding whether this modern structure for &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;— in which it wants to be the only multiplayer game you play, like &lt;em&gt;Destiny &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; — is worth the time, effort, and storage space it will cost you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7SFoBaxYXUa6lS2wtMQh60ymIg0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22072267/cod_black_ops_cold_war_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Activision&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="RHjPSd"&gt;The campaign isn’t much of a departure from the high-octane, set piece-driven experiences we’ve seen before. But it does have enough narrative surprises and experimental sequences to satisfy the &lt;em&gt;Black Ops &lt;/em&gt;series’s history of twisty, conspiratorial storytelling. Unlike last year’s &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare &lt;/em&gt;reboot, which borrowed some of the muted and murky undertones of wartime thrillers like &lt;em&gt;Zero Dark Thirty&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War &lt;/em&gt;tries its best to blend together different pop culture elements all loosely reminiscent of a 1980s-inspired action movie. The result is about as close to a James Bond-style campaign as &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;will ever get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zz9xNc"&gt;The campaign is most enjoyable when you’re not shooting — though those moments are brief. The standout mission is a stealthy &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt;-style “choose your adventure” escapade as a KGB double agent in which you don’t fire a gun until the final sequence. It does a great job showing you the kind of game &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;could be if its designers felt compelled to commit to one theme instead of just experimenting too briefly with many. I was also disappointed to see truly savvy cryptographic puzzle-solving restricted to just a pair of optional side missions, though I applaud the developers for giving players some agency to choose which missions they played and in what order.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9rDMmJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Multiplayer is the tightest and most impressive it’s ever felt, thanks to next-gen consoles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XliXIw"&gt;But as is the case with every &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, the campaign is there to satisfy a small fraction of the game’s intended audience. Many players might never touch it. The multiplayer is what draws in millions of people each and every year, and it seems the draw, increasingly, is not in actually enjoying it so much as in debating whether it’s worthy of scorn or praise. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;fans love to have strong opinions on whether any new iteration of the series’s multiplayer can re-create the addictive allure of &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare 2&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Black Ops 1&lt;/em&gt; or whatever iteration of the game stands tall in their minds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0qcwE"&gt;I will say, as someone who has played almost every &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;entry&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for more than half of my life, that &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War &lt;/em&gt;is perhaps the tightest and most impressive the game has ever felt. Part of the reason is because it’s been optimized for the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S. I’ve greatly enjoyed the game’s multiplayer on 120Hz mode on Sony’s new console, where it feels like the smoothest and most immersive shooter I’ve ever played. I also found that the game’s more stripped-down class customization and weapon modding to be easier to digest and more accessible, meaning I’m spending less time obsessing about which attachments to use and more time just experimenting with various loadouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXs876"&gt;There is, however, quite a bit to complain about. The multiplayer contains under 30 weapons and none feel particularly interesting or all that different from one another. There are only eight multiplayer maps, some of which I hated for how convoluted and camping-friendly they are and dreaded playing on every time they’d inevitably end up in the rotation. The game also has a throwback feel to it, where your character moves slower and the time-to-kill is longer than last year’s entry. That gives it the feel of an older, stodgier shooter — much more like the &lt;em&gt;Black Ops &lt;/em&gt;games of old. The fast-reflex &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare &lt;/em&gt;camp might find that too jarring to enjoy, and I’m only now getting used to it tens of hours later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tYY2XD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It feels like all of the creative energy went into the fantastic new zombies mode&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7sZbky"&gt;Surprisingly, it feels like all of the best new ideas and creative energy in &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War &lt;/em&gt;went into the zombies mode. And that makes sense: zombies is now more of a signature pillar of the &lt;em&gt;Black Ops &lt;/em&gt;brand than any of the campaign characters or storylines. Zombies could very well be a whole game on its own, and one might wonder why Activision doesn’t spin it out already — except that it gives millions of players a strong reason (perhaps the only reason for some people) to buy a new&lt;em&gt; Black Ops &lt;/em&gt;entry when it comes out every two to three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNrpV5"&gt;The mode is fast-paced, fun, and filled with secrets to uncover and puzzles to solve. It’s perhaps the most refined modern take on the horde mode formula from a major studio I can think of. It’s likely to be the reason why so many players still keep this game installed well into next year and possibly even beyond the inevitable release of the next title in the series, which presumably will not contain a zombies mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cp1Mjs_O4L77xGAYt7XXYq4HUHc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22072269/cod_black_ops_cold_war_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Activision&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="vXLzjg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; is never a commercial failure — it always sells — but that doesn’t mean the developers who make it can’t fail in their attempts to make the best experience possible. My main issue with it now is not that any one of these new modes is subpar, but that they all feel like the disjointed limbs of a Frankenstein video game. &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War &lt;/em&gt;is overflowing with content and covers seven distinct console hardware types, a PC version, and a battle royale, all of it taking up more storage space than pretty much any other game in history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqwxAv"&gt;This is supposed to be freeing — play the new &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; on any platform with any of your friends and only the game types you enjoy. And to a large extent, the cross-gen and cross-platform functions work well and Activision should be applauded for the sheer complexity of the technical feat it pulled off weaving this all together. (A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552437/call-of-duty-warzone-player-progression-weapons-cosmetics-shared-unified-black-ops-cold-war"&gt;planned &lt;em&gt;Warzone &lt;/em&gt;update next month&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled to merge the battle royale with &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;, which may not go as smoothly.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="u2YqGj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Black Ops Cold War’ makes ‘Call of Duty’ feel like a Frankenstein video game&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9U5RnG"&gt;But when I boot up &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;, I find that I’m not so much drawn to any one part of the game as I am overwhelmed by the whole package. It feels like four games all competing for my attention, not to mention all of the extra legwork figuring out who I’m playing with on which platform and whether I have the right mode installed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oFcTKO"&gt;I’ve lost count of the many times my friends and I have agreed to try something new in both last year’s &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare &lt;/em&gt;and this latest one, only for one of us to admit they didn’t have the right multiplayer pack installed or they only downloaded the zombies mode and deleted &lt;em&gt;Warzone &lt;/em&gt;to save space. So we give up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="md9wfs"&gt;It’s an exhausting affair unless you’re willing to make &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;your one and only shooter. And &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War &lt;/em&gt;just isn’t good enough to justify what it asks for in return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GcyO8i"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQDLgj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter verification returns early next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-_8yn3bdMBm-qvmiZ7RwikSmXtY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67907980/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E2sglk"&gt;On Tuesday, Twitter announced that it would relaunch its verification process early next year along with brand-new guidelines for users seeking out that small, blue badge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPsuKV"&gt;Twitter’s announcement confirms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21284406/twitter-verified-back-badges-blue-check"&gt;earlier reporting&lt;/a&gt; in June from app researcher Jane Manchun Wong suggesting that the company was creating a new verification system. In Twitter’s Tuesday blog post, the company confirmed that this new system would roll out in “early 2021.” Twitter is also asking for feedback on a draft proposal for verification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lkvoA8"&gt;If no changes to this proposal are made, the accounts that would be eligible for verification would include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357287/twitter-government-officials-state-affiliated-media-labels-algorithm"&gt;government accounts&lt;/a&gt;, companies, brands, nonprofits, news media accounts, entertainment, sports, activists, organizers, and what Twitter refers to as “other influential individuals.” Each type of account must meet specific requirements, like being profiled in a media outlet, in order to receive verification. The entirety of Twitter’s draft policy can be viewed &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. After receiving feedback, Twitter plans to release the final policy on December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLQuuU"&gt;Twitter also announced new draft rules explaining when a verification badge could be taken away. If a verified user changes their display name or bio to mislead people on their true identity, Twitter could pull their badge. Repeat terms of service violations could also lead to loss of verified status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMJtpG"&gt;“But the blue verified badge isn’t the only way we are planning to distinguish accounts on Twitter. Heading into 2021, we’re committed to giving people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349644/twitter-subscription-service-survey-undo-sent-analytics-feature-ideas"&gt;more ways to identify&lt;/a&gt; themselves through their profiles, such as new account types and labels,” Twitter’s Tuesday blog post read. “We’ll share more in the coming weeks. This is just the beginning of what we have planned for 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1BHFj"&gt;Twitter is asking users to take a survey on its policy before December 8th. If you’d rather tweet your feedback, Twitter asks that you tag #VerificationFeedback in the tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94lQbB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now explore 100 Thieves’ sprawling LA headquarters inside of Fortnite</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sJvdTMNIpGwcD2roO-YbptoNjqA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67904899/1___100_Thieves_Compound_Front_Outside.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: 100 Thieves&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nGv7hz"&gt;100 Thieves has made a virtual version of its sprawling LA headquarters, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21075416/100-thieves-cash-app-compound-headquarters-esports-content"&gt;Cash App Compound&lt;/a&gt;, that you can explore inside of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s &lt;/em&gt;Creative mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4eNrzW"&gt;The map isn’t just an empty virtual building; there are also hidden Easter eggs and quests that “correspond with” popular 100 Thieves streamers Matthew “Nadeshot” Haag (who is also the founder and CEO of the organization), Jack “CouRage” Dunlop, Rachel “Valkyrae” Hofstetter, and Ashley “BrookeAB” Bond. You can see a preview of the map in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/100Thieves/status/1331255852636901376"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; from 100 Thieves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uno2OG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;100 Thieves x &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FortniteGame&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to the 100 Thieves Cash App Compound… in Fortnite! Packed with quests &amp;amp; easter eggs, our Compound is now fully explorable in Fortnite Creative. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drop into the Creative Hub now!&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FNCreate?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FNCreate&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/100TCreative?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#100TCreative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/OaZFrRUmTD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OaZFrRUmTD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 100 Thieves (@100Thieves) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/100Thieves/status/1331255852636901376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 24, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ge7kWq"&gt;I hopped into the map for a few minutes while writing this story, and based on what I’ve seen of the Cash App Compound through watching 100 Thieves’ YouTube videos, this virtual version seems like a pretty impressive re-creation. Getting to explore it virtually is honestly pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hB1bBO"&gt;Along with the launch of the virtual Cash App Compound, 100 Thieves is also holding &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/100Thieves/status/1331261525957349376"&gt;a contest&lt;/a&gt; where participants can enter to win custom &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; gear and real clothes from 100 Thieves’ latest apparel collection. And 100 Thieves is no stranger to using virtual worlds to promote its Supreme-like clothes, having made its apparel available in &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons &lt;/em&gt;earlier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21211236/100-thieves-apparel-collection-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch"&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6bxxX"&gt;The partnership between 100 Thieves and Epic Games is the game studio’s latest in its efforts to create &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21068938/fortnite-ninja-skin-icon-series-metaverse-tyler-blevins-ultimate-virtual-world-star-wars"&gt;the ultimate virtual world&lt;/a&gt;. Not only has Epic released skins of real-world creators like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21065235/ninja-fortnite-skin-announced-stream-tyler-blevins-available-date"&gt;Tyler “Ninja” Blevins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/loserfruit-joins-the-fortnite-icon-series"&gt;Kathleen “Loserfruit” Belsten&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/lachlan-joins-the-fortnite-icon-series"&gt;Lachlan “Lachlan” Ross Power&lt;/a&gt;, but it has also created numerous in-game tie-ins with huge brands like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man"&gt;Marvel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21019726/fortnite-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-rey-finn-sith-trooper-skins-buy-now"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21423004/fortnite-party-royale-concert-series-dominic-fike"&gt;hosted concerts&lt;/a&gt; featuring artists like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234980/fortnite-marshmello-concert-viewer-numbers"&gt;Marshmello&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wr72Lp"&gt;You can check out the virtual Cash App Compound by jumping into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; Creative mode from today until December 1st.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon renews The Expanse for a sixth and final season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8eNi7XB9hXPqaiGtg8hJm9OBXxA=/1x0:700x466/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67904688/expanse.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="imrYek"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Expanse &lt;/em&gt;will come to a (second) end after its sixth season, Amazon Studios announced today. The news arrives ahead of the show’s fifth season premiere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwTWcL"&gt;Amazon first picked up &lt;em&gt;The Expanse &lt;/em&gt;when it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/26/17379736/the-expanse-amazon-prime-season-four-saved"&gt;canceled by SyFy in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the show to its Amazon Prime Video streaming service for a fourth season. The season became the seventh most in-demand title in the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazons-expanse-season-4-is-a-hit-after-amazon-saved-2019-12"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;likely helping Amazon Studios executives’ decision to renew for a fifth season. Now, after a few years, Amazon is moving on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVy1pf"&gt;“We’re very happy we can give the incredibly loyal and passionate fans of &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt; the satisfying conclusion to the series that they deserve,” Vernon Sanders, co-head of television at Amazon Studios, said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytrSZ9"&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;The Expanse &lt;/em&gt;is set to end, it remains one of the notable Amazon original series. The show’s producers claimed that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2019-12-10/the-expanse-syfy-amazon-jeff-bezos"&gt;personally loved the show&lt;/a&gt;, and the team at Amazon worked to bring it over after fans on social media demanded someone save the show. Streaming services have a reputation for picking up canceled series that fans love (&lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2018/06/lucifer-saved-netflix-picks-up-series-season-4-after-fox-cancelation-1202411666/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lucifer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277046/star-wars-the-clone-wars-netflix-disney-april-2019"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and Amazon made quite a splash when it picked up &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Q6rR2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;’s fifth season will premiere on December 16th with the first three episodes dropping at once. Episodes will then be released weekly, concluding on February 3rd, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday phone deals</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aK5v0b2uHuvCjS8ZJpin8G78Iik=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67891715/vpavic_042009_3966_0020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 8 Pro is $200 off during Black Friday week&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zXFrPb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; is a good time of the year to consider upgrading your phone. Whether you’re looking for a deal through a carrier or you’d rather get an unlocked phone, you can save during the holiday season. The best deals on phones for Black Friday are on Android devices, including newer models from Google, Samsung, OnePlus, and more. Predictably, these big price cuts don’t apply to iPhones. Nothing new there, but there is a gift card promo happening if you are interested in picking one up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMRuMl"&gt;Below, you’ll find the best deals we’ve found so far. If you buy an unlocked phone, there won’t be any strings attached to the purchase. If we include a carrier promotion, we’ll be sure to thoroughly list out each requirement necessary to get the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fBJR1Q"&gt;Apple iPhone deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UqdK1t"&gt;Let’s get this one out of the way: Apple isn’t offering price cuts on any of its iPhone models, but &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fgifts%2Fshopping-event&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21583458%2Fblack-friday-phone-deals-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you’ll get a $50 Apple gift card with the purchase of one&lt;/a&gt;. This offer applies to any iPhone purchase made from its site between November 27th (Black Friday) and November 30th (Cyber Monday). The gift card can’t be applied to your iPhone purchase, though. It’s for future use.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wfdabz"&gt;The Pixel 5 is $50 off its usual $700 price at several retailers, including the Google Store, Amazon, Best Buy, and B&amp;amp;H Photo. For $650, you’ll get the unlocked version of the phone in either the “just black” or “sorta sage” colorway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7I4I1J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503881"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="73BXis"&gt;If you’re on Verizon and don’t mind activating a phone on Verizon to get a deal, you can save an extra $150 on top of that $50 discount at Best Buy. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724683047154502935" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can either opt to pay $500 for the Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; or $20.86 each month for 24 months through a Verizon device payment plan. Taking $200 off the Pixel 5’s regular price is great. You’ll just need to keep the phone on Verizon service for 60 days before it becomes unlocked.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1QAWHG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/pixel-4a-5g"&gt;The Pixel 4A with 5G is $200 off when new customers&lt;/a&gt; purchase it through the Google Fi MVNO service, resulting in a $299 final price. If you’re an existing Google Fi subscriber, you can upgrade to the 4A with 5G and get $150 off, knocking the price down to $349. Not bad, considering that’s the same price as the standard Pixel 4A that doesn’t have 5G support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xu_OpYVoT8q99rvDk68KwlAcCE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21903263/Galaxy_S20_FE_All_Colors.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S20 FE 5G comes in many different colors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p id="bAr8uD"&gt;The biggest price drops we’d seen to date on Samsung’s Galaxy S20 range of phones happened last week at eBay via the Microsoft Store, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/19/21575049/samsung-galaxy-s20-phones-android-deal-sale-ebay-amazon-bh-photo"&gt;those deals&lt;/a&gt; have yet to be beaten. Currently, the best deal on a new Samsung phone is on the S20 FE 5G, the most affordable option. Normally $700, it’s down to $550 at several retailers, including Amazon, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Best Buy, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MBvGGN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kAf8g5"&gt;I expect (or maybe hope is the better word) to see more price drops on Samsung flagship phones, as well as more budget-friendly options like the Galaxy A51. Though, outside of some carrier discounts with trade-ins, there aren’t many appealing offers now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5PBwp5"&gt;OnePlus phone deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JltxuA"&gt;The OnePlus 8 Pro is $200 off its usual price at Amazon and from OnePlus’ online store. Normally $1,000, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08723GJ2T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $800&lt;/a&gt;. This is OnePlus’ most feature-packed phone yet, containing a 120Hz refresh rate display, wireless charging, 5G support (sub6GHz only for this model), the Snapdragon 865 processor, 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. This deal is available for the “onyx black” and “ultramarine blue” colorways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hhboN3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9628882"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PVErBw7qxKiTr3Cmv3ti313PWXU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19895602/vpavic_042009_3967_0079.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A few variations of the OnePlus 8 are $200 off during Black Friday week, starting at $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KeOREQ"&gt;At the OnePlus site, you can get the standard OnePlus 8 for $200 off its usual price, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Foneplus-8%3Ffrom%3D8&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21583458%2Fblack-friday-phone-deals-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costing $599&lt;/a&gt;. It shares a few similarities to the 8 Pro above, like the Snapdragon 865 processor, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. Though, it doesn’t have wireless charging and its camera array doesn’t quite stack up as favorably. Also, it has a 90Hz refresh rate display compared to 120Hz on the 8 Pro, and the display itself is smaller (about 6.5 inches versus 6.8 inches).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMPXh7"&gt;There’s an even cheaper version of the OnePlus 8 with the same specs, aside from the bump down from 12GB of RAM to 8GB, and from 256GB of storage to 128GB. If you’re cool with that, you can select the “glacial green” color on the same page &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Foneplus-8%3Ffrom%3D8&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21583458%2Fblack-friday-phone-deals-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;to see the price drop to $499&lt;/a&gt; (usually $699).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rhuzzs"&gt;Other phone deals&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nQPzJs"&gt;You can save on the TCL 10 Pro, one of our picks for the best budget-friendly phones you can buy. Normally $450, it’s $315 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087LZNMYB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724681990259178825" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1567411-REG%2Ftcl_t799b_2alcus11_10l_unlocked_smartphone_128gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21583458%2Fblack-friday-phone-deals-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FTCL-10-Pro-Smartphone-with-128GB-Memory-Unlocked-Ember-Gray%2F574129340&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. This is a very affordable price for a phone with an OLED screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLs7gd"&gt;TCL has also discounted the TCL 10 5G UW on Verizon. If you’re adding a new line of service to your account, you can get this 5G-ready phone that supports both sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G networks for $5 per month for 24 months, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Ftcl-10-5g-uw%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21583458%2Fblack-friday-phone-deals-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;totaling $120&lt;/a&gt; versus the normal $400 cost.

    <title>Microsoft Flight Simulator gets a big US update just in time for Thanksgiving</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qPxtP6a4M6g282B9Q1Kc3wJiYJs=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67883046/grandcanyon.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="09TouH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is getting one of its biggest updates for the US today, adding nearly 50 points of interest. The White House, Fort Knox, Hoover Dam, and the Las Vegas Strip are among many areas across the US that are &lt;a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/release-notes-1-11-5-0/"&gt;getting updated&lt;/a&gt; with high-resolution points of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="johVCG"&gt;A trailer for the update shows just how detailed some of these updated areas are. The Las Vegas Strip now has a night mode, where the entire strip lights up and it looks incredible from the virtual sky above. The nearby Grand Canyon looks like it will be worth touring inside&lt;em&gt; Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, too. Kennedy Space Center in Florida is also part of the update and looks incredibly intricate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wFbjwYnlWH9iJsFu52xCNz0IV9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22073966/grandcanyon.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grand Canyon in Microsoft Flight Simulator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UQF2ce"&gt;The update arrives just days before Thanksgiving in the US, allowing players to relax at home and fly virtually instead. Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575436/cdc-thanksgiving-coronavirus-covid-19-travel-guidance"&gt;advised people not to travel&lt;/a&gt; for Thanksgiving, citing the spread of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations across the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sl0Wgj"&gt;Alongside the points of interest updates, there are four new airports and a range of performance and stability fixes. Asobo, the developers behind &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, have been gradually improving the PC game in recent months to make it run more smoothly. Today’s update will also improve how streetlights are randomly placed in smaller streets and roads across &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;’s virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon defeats eBay lawsuit over seller poaching</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i7w8SWT4ZEFRUroeWoyJ8OJGfys=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67882624/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="esr8Oo"&gt;Amazon has prevailed in a lawsuit claiming it secretly poached eBay sellers. The companies and a group of Amazon managers filed arbitration updates for two complaints, one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/18/17995636/ebay-suing-amazon-poaching-third-party-sellers-marketplace"&gt;from 2018&lt;/a&gt; and another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/2/20751705/ebay-amazon-managers-lawsuit-poaching-racketeering-fraud"&gt;from 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The complaints alleged that Amazon employees signed up for eBay accounts under false pretenses, then lured eBay merchants to their platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wzoMQ"&gt;In both cases, eBay convinced an arbitration panel that there was a breach of its user contract. But it couldn’t prove it suffered harm as a result, according to documents filed with the &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22072229/2020_11_24_Stanta_Clara_County___Joint_Status_Report_Re_Arbitration_Conclusion.pdf"&gt;Superior Court of Santa Clara&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22072306/d877e6bf_5cf1_423d_8dfa_fb62b9946082.pdf"&gt;California district court&lt;/a&gt;. More generally, eBay was unsuccessful in arguing that Amazon had coordinated a poaching campaign against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCMFc7"&gt;The decisions come as Amazon faces an antitrust probe &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;in Europe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/congress-tech-antitrust-agenda-30a7bcc7-22ee-4897-93ec-99f6aaf577d4.html?utm_campaign=organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=socialshare&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;prospect of greater regulation&lt;/a&gt; in the US. This includes scrutiny of whether it unfairly competes with third-party sellers on its own platform — but not whether it unfairly recruited them from other sites. Amazon declined to comment on the case; eBay didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google says it’s got 400 games in the pipeline for Stadia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6SlH8NSAyZF8Ye-s7CPLjPbkedM=/0x0:1475x983/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67876854/stadia.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eyZPG8"&gt;Google has around 400 games on the way for its Stadia game streaming service, according to Jack Buser, the service’s director of games. Buser gave the figure in an &lt;a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2020/11/19/google-stadia-jack-buser-director-of-games-anniversary-interview/"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;MobileSyrup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where he said that the company has “a roadmap of about 400 games in development from 200 developers” for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CjJXDf"&gt;Buser stopped short of giving specific information on individual games but said that most would be arriving in 2021 and beyond. This list of Stadia games &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/10/stadia-game-list/"&gt;maintained by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, however, includes around 50 unreleased games that have been announced for the service, alongside another 100 or so that are already available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t8S2l7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have a very exciting many years ahead of us.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XZ9exp"&gt;The director used the number of games on Stadia’s roadmap as evidence for Google’s long-term commitment to the platform. Buser said that Google’s planning for Stadia extends into 2023 at this point. “We are looking many years out into the future,” the director says. “Gaming is one of the biggest businesses at Google … Which is why you see us investing so much time and energy to support all these hundreds of developers building all these games. We have a very exciting year ahead of us. And, in fact, we have a very exciting many years ahead of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSET7A"&gt;These games in development include exclusive titles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931295/google-stadia-cloud-gaming-first-party-studios-jade-raymond-interview-exclusive-games"&gt;produced by Google’s own internal game studios&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21323326/google-stadia-exclusive-game-deals-harmonix-rock-band-supermassive-until-dawn"&gt;partners like Harmonix&lt;/a&gt;. The company has made some big hires as part of its first-party development efforts, including ex-Ubisoft and EA producer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18272996/google-stadia-studio-games-entertainment-exclusives-gdc-2019"&gt;Jade Raymond&lt;/a&gt; and ex-&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164801/google-stadia-shannon-studstill-playa-vista-studio-sony-santa-monica-god-of-war"&gt;Sony Santa Monica studio head Shannon Studstill&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tnzYD"&gt;“You’re going to see the amount of exclusive content on our platform scale pretty rapidly,” Buser says. He adds that some “cloud native” titles will be able to do things that aren’t possible on current systems because they’re “free from the limitations of a network appliance in your living room, like a PC or a game console.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMkvQp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
