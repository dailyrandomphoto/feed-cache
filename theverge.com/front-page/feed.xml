    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="title"&gt;The weekend has arrived, bringing with it an assortment of great discounts on everything from student-centric laptops to headphones to some games that launched as recently as this week. We’ve rounded up many of the highlights below, and if you’re looking for the best of the best and not just what’s currently on sale, we’ve also updated our comprehensive guides to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"&gt;best streaming devices&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;best gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt;, both of which offer a host of entertainment options for looking to escape the summer heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HTMrDK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N1WW638/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Save $15 on TP-Link’s budget-friendly Wi-Fi Extender&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4rR6I4"&gt;You don’t necessarily need to opt for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20946586/google-nest-wifi-review-mesh-router-price-specs-features"&gt;Google Nest Wifi system&lt;/a&gt; or a similar mesh network in order to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21185759/wi-fi-work-at-home-how-to-router-mesh"&gt;boost your home’s Wi-Fi network&lt;/a&gt; — sometimes a simply Wi-Fi extender like the TP-Link AC750 will do. If you have a &lt;a href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/onemesh/product-list/"&gt;compatible router&lt;/a&gt;, the dual-band device will help boost its signal (not increase its speed), helping to alleviate dead zones in your home via a wired or wireless connection. Right now, you can pick TP-Link’s compact extender &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N1WW638/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Amazon for $20&lt;/a&gt;, a $15 discount and its lowest price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GgewUp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10644849"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VtBJGp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0939SGP51/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=27&amp;amp;imprToken=06bd4661-2452-5d0d-e32&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22334255%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The latest Monster Hunter spin-off is already $10 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ebCLRg"&gt;The Monster Hunter franchise has seen resurgent in the West in recent years thanks to blockbuster hits like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/25/16931366/monster-hunter-world-review-ps4-xbox-one-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22352085/monster-hunter-rise-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, the latest Nintendo Switch spin-off, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0939SGP51/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is less about slaying monsters as it is catching them. The turn-based title is vibrant and a bit cliche, but if you’re looking for a &lt;em&gt;MonHun &lt;/em&gt;game with a lighter tone and tried-and-true JRPG mechanics, &lt;em&gt;Wings of Ruin &lt;/em&gt;is already &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0939SGP51/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $50&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 20 percent of the list price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3TaN4R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10644916"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c89aFO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GBZ4Q68/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=32&amp;amp;imprToken=06bd4661-2452-5d0d-e32&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22334255%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;One of the most budget-friendly gaming mice is even more affordable at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4NWuIz"&gt;If you’re a PC gamer who wants to make the most of titles like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, a competent gaming mouse is a must-have accessory. Thankfully, the Logitech G502 Hero — the wired counterpart to our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;best wireless gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt; — is an affordable way to go, with 11 customizable buttons, programmable lighting, and a flexible weight system that allows you to adjust the resistance to your liking on the fly. Typically on sale for around $50, Logitech’s G502 is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GBZ4Q68?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $38&lt;/a&gt;, the steepest price cut we’ve seen on the popular gaming mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kgKoeA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 38,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="I1ULfA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10644920"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8JCRfs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/.product.1430179.html"&gt;Acer’s Swift 3, a laptop suited for summer fun and school, is down to $490 this weekend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="j5Vchu"&gt;The Acer Swift 3 isn’t our No. 1 pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptop&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s one of our go-to recommendations for college students given checks all the right boxes. It’s lightweight and performs well for the price, and &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/.product.1430179.html"&gt;at Costco&lt;/a&gt;, it’s available with 8GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and an AMD Ryzen 5 processor for $490. Like all configurations, Costco’s members-only variant also touts an integrated fingerprint reader, a healthy selection of ports, and a backlit keyboard for after-hours work. We admit that the Swift 3’s sturdy, aluminum build won’t win any design competitions, but it’s also a budget laptop that won’t break the bank, either. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21377208/acer-swift-3-review-2020-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo refuses to say if the OLED Switch fixes Joy-Con drift</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G3liC21A-IICAhdzTX58pD5d4PI=/110x0:1330x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69564804/joy_con_02.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vTJVOB"&gt;Nintendo revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;a new model of the Switch this week&lt;/a&gt; that adds an OLED screen, enhanced speakers, and a much-improved kickstand. One thing it seems the OLED Switch won’t bring, however, is a fix for the Joy-Con drift issues that have plagued Switch owners for years — and frustratingly, Nintendo won’t even confirm that it won’t. A variety of publications including &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;tried to ask the question, but Nintendo won’t tackle it head-on, despite other helpful answers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565118/nintendo-oled-switch-cpu-ram-bluetooth-audio-headphones-dock-no-4k"&gt;like how the new Switch won’t have a new CPU&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWj6Bs"&gt;Switch owners have been reporting Joy-Con drift problems &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;, and the problem is bad enough that it’s the subject &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-lawsuits-nintendo-is-facing-over-joy-con-drift"&gt;of numerous lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; — though Nintendo will unofficially fix controllers experiencing Joy-Con drift &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20707849/nintendo-will-reportedly-fix-joy-con-drift-for-free-even-out-of-warranty"&gt;for free&lt;/a&gt;, even if you’re out of warranty. One of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22315790/nintendo-switch-pro-4k-oled-upgraded-what-we-want"&gt;top requests for a revised Switch&lt;/a&gt; was a fix for the drift problems, and we hoped that a Switch revision would have been the moment Nintendo finally addressed this major issue. But it seems likely that Nintendo did not take the opportunity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4jhef"&gt;In a statement Nintendo provided to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cecianasta/status/1412443261814382595"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22565241/nintendo-switch-new-oled-model-joy-con-drift"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oled-nintendo-switch-model-has-the-same-joy-cons-nintendo-confirms/1100-6493614/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the company said that the “Joy-Con controller configuration and functionality did not change with Nintendo Switch (OLED model).” But we didn’t ask about the “configuration” or “functionality,” as it was pretty clear from Nintendo’s announcement that the controllers would be the same. We asked about drift, which is a reliability issue. And when we asked the question again in an even clearer fashion, we were referred to the same statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XedZYa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reliability, not configuration or functionality&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6XSrDG"&gt;That seems to suggest there aren’t any changes. An FAQ on the &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Nintendo-Switch-Family/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-model-/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-model%E2%80%942000984.html"&gt;company’s UK website is even more explicit&lt;/a&gt;: “The Joy-Con controllers included with Nintendo Switch (OLED model) are the same as the controllers currently available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xy5WJu"&gt;Nintendo’s statement does acknowledge that there are problems with Joy-Con controllers — “We are aware of reports that some Joy-Con controllers have not responded correctly,” Nintendo said — but merely suggested that customers visit its support site to deal with any issues. That language isn’t new; Nintendo issued a very similar statement &lt;a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/nintendo/nintendo-updates-joy-con-drift-policy-will-fix-def/"&gt;nearly two years ago&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/8xzzva/internal-nintendo-memo-instructs-customer-service-to-fix-joy-con-drift-for-free"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; published an internal Nintendo memo&lt;/a&gt; instructing customer service reps to fix Joy-Con drift issues for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYLR9v"&gt;And Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said that “we apologize for any inconvenience experienced by consumers” because of Joy-Con problems &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2020/qa2006e.pdf"&gt;in an investor Q&amp;amp;A last year&lt;/a&gt;, but added that “I have no information to share about any specific actions we have taken” to fix issues, suggesting his hands were tied because of a class-action lawsuit in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ty5pOB"&gt;Until somebody can open up a set of Joy-Cons included with the new Switch, we won’t know for sure that there aren’t any unannounced fixes for the drift issues. But based on what Nintendo has said, I wouldn’t hold your breath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EdQrSM"&gt;While the OLED Switch may not have been the “Pro” upgrade &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22315790/nintendo-switch-pro-4k-oled-upgraded-what-we-want"&gt;we were hoping for&lt;/a&gt;, the improvements &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;still make a big difference&lt;/a&gt;, according to my colleague Dieter Bohn, who got to try out the new Switch. But if you decide to pick up the $350 console when it launches October 8th, you might want to mentally prepare for the possibility that your new Joy-Cons might end up with the drift issue someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHazQt"&gt;Here’s Nintendo’s full statement on the matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="T0Hwqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Joy-Con controller configuration and functionality did not change with Nintendo Switch (OLED model). The configuration and functionally is the same as that of the Joy-con controllers for the Nintendo Switch console. At Nintendo, we take great pride in creating quality products and we are continuously making improvements to them. We are aware of reports that some Joy-Con controllers have not responded correctly. We want our consumers to have fun with Nintendo Switch, and if anything falls short of this goal we always encourage them to visit &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__support.nintendo.com&amp;amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;amp;c=Ftw_YSVcGmqQBvrGwAZugGylNRkk-uER0-5bY94tjsc&amp;amp;r=B34I4dJ2bWTOkzssAKywV0DkXMjTumgRTZ1yiaNnNrI&amp;amp;m=4QvkfRn1VuitWeL7Rp7Grf9EQKliv5tf9MSvWb5kkcU&amp;amp;s=rOcfPJLh9r2GqzdUrcaeomr11bHPblC22qpzlS_kMJE&amp;amp;e="&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://support.nintendo.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; so we can help.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Samsung quietly launched its free TV service on the web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JNHLWIZitvROTDYEV5iRNFvJ1NQ=/0x0:845x563/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69563857/TV_Plus_main1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung TV Plus displayed on a screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TyGLdg"&gt;Samsung recently launched a web version of its free and ad-supported Smart TV Plus streaming service for live and linear programming as well as added casting support for Chromecast devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wEMhCm"&gt;The streaming product, which was previously limited to Samsung TV and mobile devices, launched as a web service in the second quarter, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/samsung-tv-plus-web-chromecast"&gt;Protocol reported&lt;/a&gt; Friday. It’s a curious new player in the streaming wars and launched with seemingly little fanfare, but the rollout makes an app that was previously limited to Samsung users now widely available to just about anyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QSrfb"&gt;Samsung did not have immediate comment about the launch when reached on Friday. However, a spokesperson confirmed the launch of the web version of the service to Protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwd1Sp"&gt;Samsung TV Plus has been around for years — it’s been available on Samsung smart TVs since 2016 — but the rollout to additional devices outside of the streaming ecosystem places it more directly in competition with ad-supported streaming services like Peacock, the Roku Channel, or any number of linear-programming freebies like Pluto TV or Plex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpawAd"&gt;While it’s unclear why the company seems to have decided to soft launch the web version of its streaming service now, Samsung appears to be exploring ways to bring TV Plus to a larger audience. Choice is always great and you can’t beat the price of free (particularly if you can stand to sit through ads), but if Samsung’s ambitions are to dominate the linear streaming space, it’s a bit late to the party. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden’s executive order puts net neutrality back in the spotlight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks On Promoting American Economy Competition" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EoIfZBozRlhalpVth7GS_OZRTUI=/0x0:4331x2887/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69563803/1233894512.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0dUIWc"&gt;Earlier today President Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569869/biden-executive-order-right-to-repair-isps-net-neutrality"&gt;signed the Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy&lt;/a&gt;, and in it there were several provisions relating to net neutrality. The prior administration’s FCC and FTC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/11/17439456/net-neutrality-dead-ajit-pai-fcc-internet"&gt;rolled back Obama-era rules in those areas&lt;/a&gt;, and now there is a clear agenda to restore them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6rBq7y"&gt;Directives for the FCC from the order:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0UwQn6"&gt; (i)   adopting through appropriate rulemaking “Net Neutrality” rules similar to those previously adopted under title II of the Communications Act of 1934 (Public Law 73-416, 48 Stat. 1064, 47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.), as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, in “Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet,” 80 Fed. Reg. 19738 (Apr. 13, 2015);            &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ft4cBs"&gt;(iv)  prohibiting unjust or unreasonable early termination fees for end-user communications contracts, enabling consumers to more easily switch providers;         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhB00s"&gt;(v)   initiating a rulemaking that requires broadband service providers to display a broadband consumer label, such as that as described in the Public Notice of the Commission issued on April 4, 2016 (DA 16–357), so as to give consumers clear, concise, and accurate information regarding provider prices and fees, performance, and network practices;         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exJ0bQ"&gt;(vi)  initiating a rulemaking to require broadband service providers to regularly report broadband price and subscription rates to the Federal Communications Commission for the purpose of disseminating that information to the public in a useful manner, to improve price transparency and market functioning; and         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ENQir0"&gt;(vii) initiating a rulemaking to prevent landlords and cable and Internet service providers from inhibiting tenants’ choices among providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ooKJes"&gt;The FCC is now tasked with reviving the “Broadband Nutrition Label” that &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/events/2016/04/consumer-broadband-labels-announcement"&gt;was in development in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. The label would provide a standardized format for providers to display their price, data allowances and details on performance, similar to the labels you currently see on food at the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sample “Broadband Nutrition Label”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EzkNZ9FT5XPi2IJHO1ZMdcHar_k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22709245/Fixed_Consumer_Broadband_Label_Sample_500h.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;FCC&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Sample “Broadband Nutrition Label”&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8BrC3V"&gt;The FCC has also been asked to start the process of requiring ISPs to regularly report their prices to the FCC to help “improve price transparency and market functioning.” As &lt;a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/biden-launches-potential-broadband-regulatory-blitz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multichannel News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out, implementing these changes will require adding a third commissioner to the FCC who will vote in favor of these measures, breaking the current 2-2 tie. Current acting FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/acting-chairwoman-rosenworcel-competition-focused-executive-order"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that “I welcome this effort by the President to enhance competition in the American economy and in the nation’s communications sector.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzKbsL"&gt;Republican FCC commissioner Brendan Carr would be expected to have a no vote on many of these policies, and &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/commissioner-carr-statement-white-house-executive-order"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that this order “seems to double down on price controls, government-run networks, and monopoly-style regulations—actions that would only make it harder for smaller providers and new entrants to compete.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FutqJz"&gt;While ISPs like Comcast and Verizon have not yet responded to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, cable industry lobbying groups quickly put out their own information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzqcGc"&gt;Speaking for a group that represents “small and medium-sized cable operators,” American Communications Association president Matthew Polka chose to largely ignore everything in the order. Instead his statement takes aim at what he sees as a lack of competitive market for another target, studios and broadcast stations, in a statement that &lt;a href="https://acaconnects.org/aca-connects-statement-on-president-bidens-executive-order-on-competition-in-communications-markets/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; “Every day our members are unfairly leveraged by large video programmers and broadcast station groups, causing our customers’ video rates to soar...members fear that dominant Internet platforms and powerful streaming services may choose not to make their services available to the subscribers of some smaller ISPs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBKKM4"&gt;The NCTA counts Comcast, WarnerMedia, Disney, Charter and Cox among its members and is ostensibly in favor of an “&lt;a href="https://www.ncta.com/positions/open-internet"&gt;open internet&lt;/a&gt;,” as long as no one tries to classify broadband as a utility or passes any rules that would make sure it stays that way. The cable industry group &lt;a href="https://www.ncta.com/media/media-room/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy"&gt;issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; (with no name attached) that says “we are disappointed that the Executive Order rehashes misleading claims about the broadband marketplace, including the tired and disproven assertion that ISPs would block or throttle consumers from accessing the internet content of their choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8b05l"&gt;Similarly, the CTIA represents the interests of its member wireless carriers and is coming out against the order. In its own statement the association &lt;a href="https://www.ctia.org/news/ctia-statement-on-july-2021-white-house-executive-order"&gt;is claiming&lt;/a&gt; “the highly regulatory approach outlined in today’s order unfortunately risks harming consumers by distracting from bipartisan efforts to close the digital divide, inhibiting new competitive choices and innovation, jeopardizing new job creation, and needlessly risking our nation’s future technological leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1eGRg"&gt;On the other side, Free Press VP of policy and general counsel Matt Wood &lt;a href="https://www.freepress.net/news/press-releases/biden-executive-order-urges-fcc-restore-net-neutrality-and-promote-broadband-competition"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; “the FCC needs to reverse the damage done by the Trump administration, which presided over rising prices and declining investment in broadband while pretending that a do-nothing deregulatory approach would solve these problems... When the Trump FCC abandoned the proper legal framework and policies in 2017, people of every political stripe overwhelmingly opposed that repeal. When we finally have a full and functioning FCC dedicated to promoting the public interest again, the agency can get the job done — taking the kinds of steps outlined in today’s executive order and more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WAhvOt"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

    <title>President Joe Biden’s latest executive order is a huge win for right to repair </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Broken Cellphones" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/egh-aJm5HvcFBkiyM1sh4Ju1yyk=/0x417:5000x3750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69563721/1084203064.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KOFDJA"&gt;A sweeping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424363/ftc-repair-restrictions-report-nixing-the-fix-smartphones-automakers"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; aimed at promoting economic competition and signed Friday by President Joe Biden called on the Federal Trade Commission to institute rules to curb anticompetitive restrictions that limit consumers’ ability to repair gadgets on their own terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yh7X5N"&gt;Tucked into the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; that covered 72 initiatives to promote competition in the US economy, Biden specifically asked the FTC to crack down on “unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair or self-repair of items, such as the restrictions imposed by powerful manufacturers that prevent farmers from repairing their own equipment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jk3en3"&gt;The order is a significant win for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549129/massachusetts-right-to-repair-question-1-wireless-car-data-passes"&gt;right to repair&lt;/a&gt; advocates who have long championed a consumer’s choice to have their technology fixed either by third parties or on their own, rather than solely by the manufacturer. Right to repair argues that anyone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126970/apple-iphone-independent-repair-contract-search-audit"&gt;should have access&lt;/a&gt; to the OEM parts, manuals, and software needed to perform those repairs. Major gadget makers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525542/apple-right-to-repair-bill-california-lobbyist-comptia"&gt;have lobbied&lt;/a&gt; to prevent this kind of repair accessibility, but the right to repair movement has been picking up momentum in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aAIJLz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Proctor said it was “a big day for the right to fix our stuff.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uqn7ff"&gt;Specifically, Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/"&gt;took aim&lt;/a&gt; at cell phone makers and other tech companies, including  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22533735/john-deere-cto-hindman-decoder-interview-right-to-repair-tractors"&gt;tractor manufacturers&lt;/a&gt;, that “impose restrictions on self and third-party repairs, making repairs more costly and time-consuming, such as by restricting the distribution of parts, diagnostics, and repair tools.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tqdiQ"&gt;In a statement, US PIRG’s senior right to repair campaign director Nathan Proctor said it was “a big day for the right to fix our stuff.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ij3n0B"&gt;“More repair choices will protect the environment by cutting down on the amount of new electronics we make and old stuff we toss,” Proctor said. “More choices help save money and cut down-time waiting for the manufacturer’s technician, which is especially important for farmers on tight planting or harvesting schedules. This is a win.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FTC has reportedly opened an investigation into Amazon’s MGM acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mE5hmAjo_g5WuyFkzoHU8tZwjPI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69563710/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J5FrTy"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into Amazon’s acquisition of MGM, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ftc-opens-probe-of-amazons-mgm-purchase-signaling-a-lengthy-inquiry"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported Friday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; describes the probe as an “in-depth investigation into the deal,” which could signal that it will stretch on for many months. The investigation also means the deal will be scrutinized by an FTC newly headed up by Lina Khan, an antitrust advocate and an Amazon critic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYcjaf"&gt;The FTC is focused on “the larger implications of the deal for Amazon’s market power,” &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported based on information from two people who knew of the probe, and that “the FTC is wary of whether the deal will illegally boost Amazon’s ability to offer a wide array of goods and services, and is not just limited to content production and distribution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ct6GPl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was widely expected the deal might get investigated&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oU53uC"&gt;Amazon announced that it had reached a deal to acquire MGM, the studio behind the &lt;em&gt;James Bond&lt;/em&gt; franchise, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22441644/amazon-mgm-acquisition-prime-video-subscription-service-james-bond"&gt;for $8.45 billion on May 26th&lt;/a&gt;, but it was widely expected that the merger would receive extra scrutiny from the government. On June 22nd, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-planned-purchase-of-mgm-to-be-reviewed-by-ftc-11624379614"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; had reported&lt;/a&gt; that the investigation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546106/ftc-investigation-amazon-mgm-acquisition"&gt;was in the works&lt;/a&gt;, and Senator Elizabeth Warren called on the agency to give the deal a “meticulous” review in a letter addressed to Khan and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556369/elizabeth-warren-ftc-review-amazon-mgm-acquisition"&gt;shared exclusively with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on June 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfdu5F"&gt;The FTC declined to comment, and Amazon has not replied to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H37hmn"&gt;The probe is the latest signal of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346828/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-biden-nomination-facebook-google-doj-garland"&gt;increased antitrust scrutiny from the Biden administration&lt;/a&gt;. And Khan has scrutinized Amazon for years, publishing an article titled &lt;a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox"&gt;“Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox”&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;Yale Law Journal&lt;/em&gt; in 2017 that was popular in progressive economic policy circles. (Amazon is, unsurprisingly, not a fan of Khan, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557456/amazon-lina-khan-recusal-petition-federal-trade-commission-antitrust"&gt;has filed a recusal motion&lt;/a&gt; calling for her to restrict herself from proceedings involving Amazon.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPd4RW"&gt;Earlier Friday, Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569869/biden-executive-order-right-to-repair-isps-net-neutrality"&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; meant to promote competition that targets right to repair rules, net neutrality, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Space tourism rivalry gets extremely petty ahead of Branson’s spaceflight </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENxgP0Gg1aT6jQttOQMeH0aqoYw=/0x0:3264x2176/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69563548/Image_from_iOS.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As Richard Branson (left) prepares for his flight to space, the rivalry between his space company Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, owned byJeff Bezos (right) is heating up.&lt;/em&gt; | Left: Bloomberg / Getty Images, Right: Alex Wong / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tj9OHe"&gt;A PR war between two billionaire-owned space companies, Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, is starting to get spicy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRoVVu"&gt;Ever since Virgin announced it’d try to fly its founder Branson to space nine days before Bezos flies on his own rocket, Blue Origin has been on a warpath to discredit Virgin’s suborbital spaceplane, publicly attacking everything from the vehicle’s peak altitude to the size of its windows. Blue Origin’s CEO Bob Smith wished Branson well after Virgin’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559964/richard-branson-space-before-jeff-bezos-virgin-galactic"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;, but alleged he’s not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; going to space — “they’re not flying above the Kármán line and it’s a very different experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIs2KL"&gt;The Kármán line, 62 miles above ground, is the boundary of space recognized by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), a Swiss organization that sets global rules for air sports. Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket launches its crew capsule just beyond the Kármán line for a few minutes of weightlessness, while Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo spaceplane flies 55 miles high — just over the boundary of space defined by the US government. So, both companies say they fly to space, just by different standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zxEZIB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;From the beginning, New Shepard was designed to fly above the Kármán line so none of our astronauts have an asterisk next to their name. For 96% of the world’s population, space begins 100 km up at the internationally recognized Kármán line. &lt;a href="https://t.co/QRoufBIrUJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QRoufBIrUJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Blue Origin (@blueorigin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1413521627116032001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s5YLP6"&gt;Blue Origin tweeted a colorful chart on Friday, two days before Branson’s flight, comparing Virgin Galactic’s spaceplane to Blue Origin’s New Shepard on window size, vehicle type, escape system, and other factors. “From the beginning, New Shepard was designed to fly above the Kármán line so none of our astronauts have an asterisk next to their name,” the company said in its tweet, implying Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo passengers can’t call themselves astronauts. The company continued, suggesting the Kármán line is a legally binding international standard: “For 96% of the world’s population, space begins 100 km up at the internationally recognized Kármán line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="efYqf8"&gt;Asked where it pulled the 96 percent figure from, a Blue Origin spokesperson clarified in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they subtracted the US population from the world’s population, because the US follows a different standard than the FAI, the Switzerland-based organization. “The US Air Force is the only government agency that has consistently recognized a lower altitude as the boundary of space (80 km / 50 miles),” the spokesperson added. In reality, both NASA and the FAA, a US government agency that licenses Blue Origin launches, also use the same 50-mile standard for recognizing the boundary of space. It’s worth noting that Blue Origin is based in the US and is generally required to follow US spaceflight standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SqNnHl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This pissing contest about the Karman line is so childish”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FAPOmE"&gt;Virgin Galactic didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Blue Origin’s tweet. But Nicola Pecile, a Virgin Galactic test pilot, hit back, saying in a now-deleted tweet, “this pissing contest about the Karman line is so childish that is getting really embarrassing to watch. Flying above 100K ft is already so complicated that anyone doing so should deserve a special recognition.” In another tweet, he cited Virgin Galactic’s first spaceflight with humans in 2018 and added that Blue Origin “has flown only mannequins so far.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QySnZmBysDLTP849hCW8A8lnfTs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22709145/Screen_Shot_2021_07_09_at_5.35.13_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="58aXUC"&gt;The “pissing contest” on Twitter was only the latest fight in a month full of snark and sass between the two billionaire-funded space tourism companies as each gears up to fly their respective billionaire founders to space. Virgin Galactic’s decision to fly Branson on July 11th was widely seen as a PR move to beat Bezos’ launch to space on July 20th. Branson was originally poised to fly on a later flight, likely a few months from now. When Branson was asked on CNBC last week whether he’s trying to beat Bezos to space, he replied: “Jeff who?” (It was the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0871VJfvD1c?t=1007"&gt;same initial response SpaceX CEO Elon Musk gave&lt;/a&gt; when asked a similar question in a 2016 BBC interview.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1bnQkp"&gt;Blue Origin’s tweet on Friday reignited online discussion about where the boundary of space should be set. Interpretations vary greatly between fields of study — a meteorologist may argue space begins much lower than where a planetary scientist would set the bar. But for human spaceflight, the US has long maintained that 50 miles is the appropriate altitude for space to begin, and the point where a person can earn their “astronaut wings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="esLUjL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“To say that it’s internationally agreed is a bit of a stretch”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kj3XbH"&gt;Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astronomer and expert tracker of space objects, argues in a 2018 &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07894"&gt;academic paper&lt;/a&gt; that space begins at 50 miles above ground, based on physics and roughly the minimum altitude for orbital objects. In a phone call with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, McDowell pushed back on Blue Origin’s claim that a vast majority of the world’s population believes space begins at the FAI’s 62-mile marker and that it’s an “internationally recognized” standard. While most space-faring nations might agree with the FAI’s standard, it doesn’t represent a large chunk of the world’s population, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EJI9ED"&gt;“A lot of countries don’t have an opinion, a lot of countries have not chosen to rule on it. And international legal bodies, which the FAI is not, have not ruled on it. So to say that it’s internationally agreed is a bit of a stretch.”&lt;/p&gt;

Riot Games announced on Friday that the final two matches of the LCS Championship, the league’s postseason summer tournament, will take place at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, on August 28th and 29th, and fans will be able to attend the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSfeJ2"&gt;During the pandemic, the league shifted to an entirely virtual format where players competed online and casters commentated remotely. It has moved slowly toward a return to events with fans. The final two matches of the Midseason Showdown tournament in April brought the players and production crew onstage at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, but there was no audience in attendance. LCS matches for the Summer Split have taken place in the LCS studios, but like with the Midseason Showdown, fans have been absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KKKTaf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Oh my god, I think we’re gonna be able to do this.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IRoMHw"&gt;As the vaccine rollout has accelerated around the US in 2021, the league realized they might actually be able to host the LCS Championship at a venue with a live crowd, Chris Greeley, Riot Games’ head of esports for North America and Oceania and the interim LCS commissioner, said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We spent a lot of time talking to the folks at the Prudential Center, who were also talking to the state of New Jersey, to get an understanding of what regulations would look like and what the evolving health standards would look like. We got to a point where we all kind of looked around and said, ‘Oh my god, I think we’re gonna be able to do this.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VZjRU"&gt;If you want to attend the LCS Championships, the league is recommending that you are vaccinated against COVID-19 before attending, and says “we’ll post more detailed information regarding health and safety protocols at the Prudential Center as we get closer to the event.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qoMbC"&gt;I asked Greeley if there were any contingency plans in place for a worst-case scenario. “There’s no pandemic playbook, so it’s hard to start to put those contingency plans in place because there’s no known set of variables,” he says. “It’s not like, ‘Alright, well if X happens, we’ll do Y’ because you just don’t know. But we’re spending a lot of time talking to the folks at the Prudential Center or on the ground to get an understanding of where they are in terms of local health regulations to make sure that if things do change, we have the ability to shift and pivot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RPnHWH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The LCS has venues picked out for spring and summer tournaments in 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MY9K9W"&gt;Greeley seems optimistic that live events will continue in 2022, teasing that the LCS already has venues picked out for next year’s Midseason Showdown and the LCS Championship. And he reminded me that the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; World Championship is set to take place &lt;a href="https://lolesports.com/article/le-mondial%C2%A02020-commence-le-25%C2%A0septembre/blt2237ab89da64fb68"&gt;in North America in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, six years after the previous championship was held in North America in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4cmyKX"&gt;Some events in China have welcomed fans sooner than the LCS. While most matches of last year’s &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; World Championships in Shanghai had no in-person audience, more than 6,000 fans &lt;a href="https://esportsobserver.com/lol-worlds-2020-finals-audience/"&gt;were allowed to attend&lt;/a&gt; the final match of the tournament. And the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League’s (OWL) Shanghai Dragons just hosted an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ShanghaiDragons/status/1413383367370891266"&gt;in-person event on Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n1Xcht"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EHB0a9"&gt;Other organizations have announced news this week about esports events that fans can attend. Valve revealed that The International, one of the biggest tournaments in esports with a more than $40 million prize pool, will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567520/dota-2-the-international-bucharest-romania-sweden-october-location-date"&gt;now take place in Bucharest, Romania&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; League (CDL) announced details about the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CODLeague/status/1412486745409662977"&gt;Major V tournament&lt;/a&gt;, which starts on July 29th at Esports Stadium Arlington in Texas, and information about the league’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CODLeague/status/1412818756536000512"&gt;championship weekend&lt;/a&gt;, which kicks off on August 19th at the Galen Center in Los Angeles, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="615Aqg"&gt;Speaking of the Esports Stadium Arlington, the venue is hosting the first in-person OWL event in North America in 2021 on Friday. The Dallas Fuel will be playing a match in front of a 50 percent capacity audience, though they’ll be competing online against their opponents, the Houston Outlaws, who won’t be in attendance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iCoyp"&gt;For the CDL and OWL, getting back to live games is important for teams since events are a part of how they make money. Unlike the LCS, where all teams play in the same venue during the regular season (when they aren’t playing remotely due to the pandemic, of course), the CDL and OWL are modeled more like the NBA or NFL, where teams &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/24/21078871/call-of-duty-league-opening-weekend-esports-activision-blizzard"&gt;host events in the area where they’re based&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vqEEdI"&gt;Friday’s Dallas Fuel event won’t be an official OWL match, but there’s still a lot to look forward to about bringing people together to watch esports live, Justin Rojas, VP events at Fuel owner Envy Gaming, told me this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5xQMJf"&gt;“I’m excited to just see a bunch of people cheering again,” he says. “That is why I do events. To see the look on people’s faces when they are excited and enjoying something you created and made happen. Seeing how that brings people together — no matter how hard the event is, and how much work you put into it — once you see that, it always makes it feel worth it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon reportedly doesn’t want employees to know when they’re on performance plans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4biAcLBF3iH0xG9UicSG3NpWeE4=/0x0:1100x733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69563500/a9f23db3c704569534678e139dff9c1c06_amazon.rhorizontal.w1100.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Lucas Jackson / Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RnvSzh"&gt;Managers at Amazon are instructed not to warn employees that they are being monitored under the company’s “Focus” performance management tool, according to documents obtained by &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazon-tells-bosses-to-conceal-when-employees-are-on-a-performance-management-plan/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKvxxj"&gt;Focus is supposed to be a program where managers document how they are coaching employees and bringing their performance up to snuff. But in documents obtained by the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, managers were instructed to not discuss Focus with employees, and instead they are supposed to more generally explain that the worker isn’t meeting expectations and how to improve. Managers would only be able to tell an employee they’re on the plan if they’re asked directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKmQ8h"&gt;This means an employee could be on track to losing their job without ever knowing that their performance is under intense corporate scrutiny, and some who found out they were in the program said they have never gotten feedback on their deficiencies at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3Rerp"&gt;If Amazon employees don’t improve while unknowingly in the Focus program, they are then placed into the “Pivot” program, according to previous reporting from &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-focus-coaching-plans-unregretted-attrition-2021-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Employees told &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; that if they were placed in Pivot, they were either offered a severance package or given a chance to be put on a performance improvement plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSDHNU"&gt;Performance improvement plans, colloquially known as PIPs in the tech industry, are supposedly meant to bring underperforming employees back into the fold. But previous &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/internal-amazon-documents-shed-light-on-how-company-pressures-out-6-of-office-workers/"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/em&gt; also uncovered that Amazon expects a third of those placed on PIPs to leave the company, furthering its goal to filter out the &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-leaked-memo-focus-performance-review-unregretted-attrition-2021-4"&gt;lowest performing 6 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the company each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQIyJE"&gt;Amazon’s Focus tactic puts both employees and managers in a tough spot. It’s difficult for an employee to know the severity of their situation if they don’t know that they’re formally in the Focus program. And managers told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that they felt that keeping the program secret was counterproductive to employees getting on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zNabN"&gt;“It’s a hidden way of weeding out people who are not part of the clique,” one Amazon employee told the &lt;em&gt;Times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Tencent’s sweeping new facial scans will catch Chinese kids playing past curfew</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tencent To Limit Daily Playtime Of Online Game" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q6Y4VFPqe5dX3tb1HxU9dbCdiAQ=/0x0:4608x3072/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69563401/805984746.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Visual China Group / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yxM89i"&gt;Tencent, the biggest game company in the world, is rolling out facial recognition technology that will likely scan many gamers’ faces every single evening, aiming to catch minors breaking a gaming curfew and help prevent video game addiction (via &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/chinas-tencent-says-itll-use-face-recognition-to-keep-m-1847236584"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). That’s a lot of controversial concepts in one sentence, no?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQcE3D"&gt;Here’s what’s going on, according to the company and China games industry analyst Daniel Ahmad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7s1yB"&gt;In China, video game addiction prevention is literally the law of the land, one that’s been evolving for many years but recently hit some important milestones. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/business/china-video-game-ban-young.html"&gt;China introduced a law&lt;/a&gt; that banned minors from playing video games between 10PM and 8AM or from playing more than 90 minutes on a weekday. And as of June 1st, 2021, every game in the country is required to add a new authentication system that checks a player’s Chinese national identity (including their age) to help block underage players from going past those limits, all in the name of preventing video game addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hCjsPO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Video game addiction prevention is already the law of the land&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7OaV4F"&gt;Tencent had actually already been using Chinese IDs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18065048/tencent-chinese-user-id-age-video-games-playerunknown-battlegrounds-league-of-legends"&gt;for a couple years now&lt;/a&gt;, among &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/5/17080988/tencent-honor-of-kings-video-game-contracts-children"&gt;other attempts&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/4/15918624/tencent-china-gaming-addiction-honor-of-kings-limit"&gt;curb addiction&lt;/a&gt;, but the company tells us that underage players kept finding ways to get around them — like using their parents’ accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvykNd"&gt;The so-called “Midnight Patrol” facial recognition system is an attempt to check that an “adult” is actually an adult. It launched July 5th in over 60 mobile games, including the hits &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Game for Peace — &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18660985/pubg-mobile-monthly-revenue-players-highest-grossing-mobile-game"&gt;aka China’s more patriotic version of &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The facial recognition system is only for China and only for mobile games, the company confirms, so PC games like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;are currently exempt. It’s all part of the company’s ongoing “Balanced Online Entertainment System” initiative, Tencent tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, which also encompasses its “Parental Guardian Platform” and “Healthy Gameplay System” designed to let parents know what their kids are up to and remind users when they’ve played for too long, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGWtZd"&gt;According to Ahmad, whose firm Niko Partners sometimes works with Tencent, here’s how the facial recognition part of the system operates: “It will essentially detect if the person playing the game after midnight is doing so for a long time or spending a certain amount of money in the game, and it will tick a box in Tencent's backend and prompt the user to verify their identity through facial recognition, either through that database or through a database they’ve already used,” says Ahmad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4fGRW"&gt;Tencent says it doesn’t store any of the new scans itself; instead, it sounds like it’s building on China’s already-established state facial recognition surveillance system, and any scans Chinese users will have already given Tencent. Ahmad says all of Tencent’s games in China use WeChat IDs for login, and the “Midnight Patrol” can use China’s national citizen database of face photos to check against as well. China’s surveillance engine has also been used for more troubling things, of course, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570225/us-sanctions-chinese-facial-recognition-silicon-valley-funding"&gt;like the country’s human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fy8LY8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It uses cameras akin to Face ID, we’re told, so not something you’d fool with a photo&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F2YrCG"&gt;Tencent does make it sound like it won’t necessarily be scanning the faces of minors, though. When a user playing games after hours is prompted for a facial scan, they can simply refuse, at which point they’ll be treated as a minor and booted out of the game, according to a machine translation &lt;a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Cr17TKWQ3XcuNzDw085OLw"&gt;of Tencent’s press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvb1CH"&gt;Tencent actually &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45707469"&gt;started trialing this facial recognition system in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and Ahmad says it hasn’t changed much since then. He says the company also started running this kind of check last year when Tencent realized a lot of kids were likely stealing their grandparents’ accounts. “A lot of kids are living with their grandparents, because their parents are working in the city, so they’re likely to use their grandparents’ account without their knowledge,” says Ahmad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sM0kfC"&gt;Ahmad thinks the move isn’t likely to be that controversial within China because, while intrusive, the facial checks primarily impact adults, and that online sentiment so far seems fairly predictable. “If you look online and read the comments, a lot of elderly parents say this is great, because gaming is terrible,” he says. “It’s always the older generations that say games are ruining it for our kids, so there’s a bit of acceptance among the older generation in that this is how it should be.”&lt;/p&gt;
