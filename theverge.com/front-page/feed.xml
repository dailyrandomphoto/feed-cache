    <title>$300,000 Bored Ape NFT sold for $3,000 because of misplaced decimal point</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YjtwNWDGbpouc3kD6ajde-4jV9s=/155x88:995x648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70264945/bored_ape_nft_accidental_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Or just right click &amp;gt; save image to save yourself $$$.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Image via &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://opensea.io/assets/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/3547" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OpenSea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hkcIZT"&gt;How much have you ever lost on a typo? Probably not hundreds of thousands of dollars. But that’s just what happened to one unlucky individual this weekend, who accidentally sold a Bored Ape NFT for $3,000 instead of $300,000 — all because of a misplaced decimal point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSES21"&gt;As first &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/bored-ape-yacht-club-someone-accidentally-sold-a-300k-nft-for-3k/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the NFT’s owner Max (or maxnaut) listed the NFT for sale on Saturday. Max, who describes himself as a “solo-traveller, bored ape, marketing agency owner &amp;amp; NFT investor,” had meant to price the NFT at 75 ether (around $300,000) but accidentally typed &lt;em&gt;0.75 ether&lt;/em&gt; instead (roughly $3,000). Before they could correct the mistake, the NFT had been snapped up, apparently by a bot programmed to find and buy undervalued listings. You can see the drama play out &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/3547"&gt;on the NFT’s OpenSea page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T7xZTQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How’d it happen? A lapse of concentration I guess.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="McZK7p"&gt;“How’d it happen? A lapse of concentration I guess,” Max told &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;. “I list a lot of items every day and just wasn’t paying attention properly. I instantly saw the error as my finger clicked the mouse but a bot sent a transaction with over 8 eth [$34,000] of gas fees so it was instantly sniped before I could click cancel, and just like that, $250k was gone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISJRnq"&gt;These sorts of so-called “fat-finger errors” are &lt;a href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/barclays-flash-crash-and-the-top-five-fat-finger-trades-20210415"&gt;well-known in the world of finance&lt;/a&gt;. In 2015, for example, a junior Deutsche Bank employee &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0546944a-7682-11e5-a95a-27d368e1ddf7"&gt;accidentally sent $6 billion&lt;/a&gt; to a hedge fund client after messing up their calculations. But traditional markets generally have some means of recourse when the worst happens — whether legal in nature or stemming from social pressure. In the case of Deutsche Bank, it seems the hedge fund simply sent the money back the next day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SOi2hL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to sneak into a Bored Ape Yacht Club party","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22824387/bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-party-new-york"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dhqwQy"&gt;For Max, there’s no way to get his cash back. It doesn’t help that the NFT he sold belongs to a particularly valuable collection. There are 10,000 Bored Apes in existence, each mixing and matching certain attributes (laser eyes, sunglasses, etc.) to create a portrait with the aesthetic qualities of a mid-2000s gamer avatar. NFTs aren’t about the quality of the artwork, though: they’re about speculation and perceived value. And Bored Ape NFTs are an exclusive club, with owners including celebrities like Jimmy Fallon and Steph Curry. They originally sold for 0.08 ether, around $320, but now cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ka9xu"&gt;Despite the loss, Max seems to be taking things in stride. “Sometimes you fuck up, make a bad buy, out of gas fail, send Eth to the wrong wallet or fat finger a listing,” he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/maxnaut/status/1469995426652868610"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s going to happen. But, letting it occupy your mind for even one second after you can no longer affect the outcome is purely hurting yourself twice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P58iuB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

    <title>Adobe launches Creative Cloud Express, a new app that simplifies its powerful editing tools</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ylESU7ZovEOTsgW5_Gx0VOQClnY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70264921/CC_Express_Social.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GQoVZv"&gt;Adobe knows there’s a bigger audience of would-be creators out there than full-on pros, so it’s launching a new app that attempts to open up some of its more powerful tools to amateurs. The app, called &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fadobe.com%2Fexpress&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2F22828544%2Fadobe-creative-cloud-express-app-announced-launch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Cloud Express&lt;/a&gt;, offers basic versions of image and video editing tools, letting users work with layers, AI effects, and a huge font library, all with a simplified interface that’s supposed to make the features easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZhGgW"&gt;“A lot of people need something simple and more accessible, and these customers are increasingly content-first and more focused on outcomes than process,” Scott Belsky, Adobe’s chief product officer, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Creative Cloud Express is designed so new users don’t have to “endure the learning curve” of Adobe’s more capable tools like Photoshop and can quickly make something that looks good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kOGvel"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Start to deliver innovation that anyone can access, as opposed to just the creative pros”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pPROOY"&gt;The app seems to be designed for social media managers, small business owners, and anyone else who has something to promote but isn’t a pro at graphic design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTl1HY"&gt;When starting it up, you’ll be able to choose from pre-designed templates made for different purposes: a flier, a Facebook post, an Instagram story, a YouTube thumbnail, a restaurant menu, a book cover, and so on. Once you choose a template, you’ll be able to adjust all the features within it. In a short demo video sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an Adobe product manager showed how you could adjust the text, import new assets from Adobe’s stock image library, and add animation. One particularly clever feature automatically removed the background from a stock image, letting the image focus just on its subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FiUEHy"&gt;The app is free to start, but additional features — like access to Adobe Stock images — are available for a $9.99 per month subscription (they’re also included for existing subscribers of many Creative Cloud plans). It launches today and is available on iOS, Android, and the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dLXz6G"&gt;Belsky sees this launch as a step toward creating accessible versions of all of Adobe’s most powerful tools. “I hope I can tell my teams ... whatever you do that’s amazing for After Effects or Premiere Pro,” Belsky says, “find a light and accessible version of it that might be accessible to everyone else and start to deliver innovation that anyone can access, as opposed to just the creative pros.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Analogue Pocket review: Game Boy games have never looked so good</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A modern handheld that celebrates the classics&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Od0O4K"&gt;For the last week or so, I’ve been buried in cartridges from my youth. I’ve spent hours slicing through cute blue slimes in &lt;em&gt;Dragon Warrior III&lt;/em&gt; and reacquainting myself with a decades-old team of monsters in &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Yellow&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;While all my friends have been raving about &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve instead been reminding myself just how inexplicably good &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater&lt;/em&gt; was on the Game Boy Advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQ502G"&gt;Often going back to play classic games like this can be a reality check. There have been plenty of times when I’ve popped in an old cartridge only to realize that these games I grew up with just don’t look the way I remember them. But that hasn’t been the case this time — in fact, they’ve looked better than ever. This is the promise of the Analogue Pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ip3YBa"&gt;Analogue has made a name for itself by releasing a stream of high-end hardware designed to play old games. It started with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/31/14451542/analogue-nt-mini-nes-review"&gt;the NES&lt;/a&gt; and has since expanded to include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/7/16981722/analogue-super-nt-snes-nintendo-review"&gt;SNES&lt;/a&gt;, Sega Genesis, and soon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21517472/analogue-duo-retro-console-nec-turbografx-price-release-date"&gt;the TurboGrafx-16&lt;/a&gt;. The concept is simple: while many of these older games have aged well, the hardware hasn’t, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18513025/analogue-console-clones-gaming-history-preservation-code-hardware"&gt;Analogue is creating a way to preserve them by making them playable on modern televisions&lt;/a&gt;. And, unlike most retro machines, Analogue consoles utilize &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323002/mister-fpga-project-retro-computer-console-early-pc"&gt;field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology&lt;/a&gt;, which basically means they function just like the original hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DS0Y4w"&gt;The $220 Pocket takes this same philosophy and applies it to handheld games; it might be the company’s most ambitious product to date. It’s also far and away the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wX7kvD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10917195"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CMb2KZf_kcyBbx5a90FT7ueGJ3o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055814/vpavic_211129_4897_0070.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DJULHwsU0QpCkwIxc1iA3trpCBI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055810/vpavic_211129_4897_0050.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pwB6C70tcfeSUHp3FtTeG7Quk6o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055804/vpavic_211129_4897_0013.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jh2naz"&gt;At a glance, the Pocket looks like production on the Game Boy never stopped and Nintendo kept revising it over the past three decades. It has basically the same form factor as the original Game Boy. The Pocket is a plastic brick you hold up vertically, available in either black or white, with a square screen up top, a D-pad and face buttons below, and a cartridge slot in the back. There are a few changes, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahYV0J"&gt;There are four main face buttons instead of two, along with a pair of shoulder buttons on the back of the device, on either side of the cartridge slot. There’s also a home button that sits between the tiny start and select buttons, a USB-C port alongside a headphone jack and the old-style link cable port on the bottom of the device, and a microSD slot on the side for firmware updates and such. It’s powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery instead of AAs, and you’ll get between six to 10 hours of gameplay depending on the brightness settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="H0HVCq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10916744"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qNFoun"&gt;The biggest change, though, is the incredible screen. The Pocket features a 3.5-inch LCD display made of Gorilla Glass, with 1600 × 1440 resolution. That’s &lt;em&gt;10 times&lt;/em&gt; the resolution of the original gray brick Game Boy. In practice, it looks absolutely amazing. Out of the box, the Pocket supports cartridges from the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance (for other supported platforms, see the sidebar on accessories) and it’s hard to overstate just how good these games look rendered at such a high resolution, with such a bright and sharp display. The monochrome look of the original Game Boy is crisp and clear, but it especially shines when you’re playing color games where you can really see the sprites pop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Thh5lM"&gt;It sounds cliche, but the Pocket breathes new life into old games by showing them at their very best. You also have plenty of ways to customize the visuals. In the main menu there are various options, including platform-specific customizations on a system level. So if, for instance, you want to render all of your Game Boy Color games with the original grid of pixels visible, you can do that. Or you can stick to the default option where everything looks nice and clean. Likewise, for original Game Boy games, you can stick with the classic green hue or view things in a more modern-looking grayscale. You can also adjust the sharpness and desaturation or tweak the size and position of the image displayed. I stuck mostly with the default options and kept the brightness jacked to 85 percent, and I had no issues at all. It looked amazing. (I should note that GBA games are rendered slightly smaller, since the Pocket has a square screen and the Advance had a more widescreen display.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="750ylx"&gt;The Pocket doesn’t fundamentally change these games. You’re still playing the same cartridges; they just look a lot better and are more convenient to play. The closest thing to a quality-of-life tweak is one of my favorite features: the sleep option, where you can put the Pocket in a battery-saving mode without losing progress. It’s great for playing old-school RPGs that have a little too much time in between save locations. The handheld also supports pretty much everything the original hardware did, which Analogue says is nearly 2,800 cartridges. I tested more than a dozen games across all three Game Boy platforms, including some oddballs like the gyro-equipped &lt;em&gt;WarioWare Twisted&lt;/em&gt;, Japan-only titles like &lt;em&gt;Densetsu no Stafy&lt;/em&gt;, and even the original Game Boy Camera. Everything worked without any issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3uNRc"&gt;For the most part, the Pocket was also extremely comfortable to use. The matte plastic has a nice feel to it, and there are vertical lines engraved across the back to make it grippier. It gets a little warm during prolonged sessions but not to the point that I found it uncomfortable. I also really love the D-pad on this thing, which is clicky and responsive. The only real quibble I have is with the placement of the shoulder buttons. For games that use them a lot — like &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk&lt;/em&gt; on the GBA — I found my fingers cramping up after long sessions. It’s a bit like playing on the old GBA SP. It’s not a deal-breaker, but I definitely felt the strain. Remappable buttons are coming in a future firmware update, but I wasn’t able to test them for this review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PaYUFb"&gt;(Outside of playing old-school cartridges, the Pocket also has a built-in music tool called Nanoloop and support for DIY game creation tool &lt;a href="https://www.gbstudio.dev/"&gt;GB Studio&lt;/a&gt;. However, given that I have no musical nor game design abilities, I have to admit that these features have been mostly lost on me so far.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/92YKJvQF8htiaqPL4jL4KlvZglg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055808/vpavic_211129_4897_0030.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZHmei"&gt;Really, for all of its features, the Analogue Pocket is a device that’s designed to do one thing: honor the classics. Every aspect of it, whether it’s the brilliant display or the fine-grain customization options or the very welcome sleep button, all works in service of making the cartridges you already own look and play their best. And that’s exactly what the Pocket does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JFCeY"&gt;That might make it something of a niche product, especially considering its premium price tag. For around the same price you could grab &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;a Nintendo Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt;, and many of these games are available elsewhere, whether on modern consoles or smartphones. It’s never been easier or cheaper to play the classics. But for many players, myself included, there’s still something special about playing the original versions of these games, especially given the fleeting nature of digital media. I don’t want to keep buying new versions of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy V&lt;/em&gt;, unsure of what strange tweaks Square Enix may have made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="1dq0Pw"&gt;I already own the perfect port. It came out in 2006 for the Game Boy Advance — and 15 years later, I now have the perfect place to play it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WW4XNS"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Analogue Pocket begins &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22796303/analogue-pocket-preorder-ship-date"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;shipping on December 13th for those who preordered&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;, while &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827971/analogue-pocket-order-price-increase-handheld"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;sales open up again on December 14th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Harley-Davidson’s electric motorcycle brand LiveWire is merging with a SPAC to go public</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MFJMiRVIfDhV3x02cQ-ouWvV5Ng=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70264688/AZ4I5423.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4uKObm"&gt;LiveWire, the electric motorcycle company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428750/harley-davidson-livewire-electric-motorcycle-brand"&gt;spun out of Harley-Davidson&lt;/a&gt;, is going public by merging with a special acquisition company, or SPAC. The transaction will net LiveWire approximately $545 million at a pro forma enterprise value of approximately $1.77 billion, Harley-Davidson says in its announcement. LiveWire is the latest electric vehicle company to go public by merging with a SPAC, which are also known as “blank check” companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5eVdr4"&gt;LiveWire is merging with AEA-Bridges Impact Corp. (ABIC), a SPAC formed by John Garcia and Michele Giddens, two private equity executives based in New York and London, respectively. Garcia and Giddens teamed up last year with the express purpose of merging with a business that is working toward the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aea-bridges-ipo/aea-bridges-partner-for-400-million-blank-check-company-sources-idUSKBN2653BY"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8hgWw"&gt;Unusually, there’s a third partner in the deal: Kymco, the Taiwan-based scooter manufacturer. Harley-Davidson describes Kymco as a “strategic partner” that will help manufacture and distribute LiveWire’s electric motorcycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="0aUiTM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10368711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ECfCV7"&gt;The deal will be financed by “ABIC’s $400 million cash held in trust, a $100 million investment from Harley-Davidson, and a $100 million investment from KYMCO, through a PIPE (private investment in public equity),” &lt;a href="https://investor.harley-davidson.com/news-releases/news-release-details/livewire-become-first-publicly-traded-ev-motorcycle-company-us"&gt;the press release states&lt;/a&gt;. When the deal closes, LiveWire’s stock will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “LVW.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YF9EYS"&gt;Earlier this year, Harley-Davidson decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428750/harley-davidson-livewire-electric-motorcycle-brand"&gt;spin off LiveWire into its own brand&lt;/a&gt;, with the goal of launching multiple electric motorcycles under the nameplate. The first product of that effort is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22566885/harley-davidson-livewire-one-price-specs-order"&gt;LiveWire One&lt;/a&gt;, a $21,999 electric motorcycle with approximately 145 miles of range (depending on the kind of riding).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCrlHS"&gt;It’s a similar move to how the 118-year-old firm approached its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536726/harley-davidson-serial-1-electric-bike-ebike-specs-price"&gt;new e-bike brand, Serial 1&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is that LiveWire continues to benefit from its relationship with its parent company while also forging its own brand identity that is distinct from Harley-Davidson. The company telegraphed this move in its &lt;a href="http://investor.harley-davidson.com/news-releases/news-release-details/harley-davidson-unveils-hardwire-five-year-strategic-plan"&gt;Hardwire strategic plan&lt;/a&gt; to reinvigorate its flagging sales over the next five years. This dedicated division would be “focused exclusively on leading the future of electric motorcycles,” the company said in its plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnYda9"&gt;According to Harley-Davidson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Cv7HRM"&gt;LiveWire plans to redefine motorcycling as the industry-leading, all-electric motorcycle company, with a focus on the urban market and beyond. As a strong and desirable brand with growing global recognition, LiveWire plans to develop the technology of the future and to invest in the capabilities needed to lead the transformation of motorcycling. LiveWire will draw on its DNA as an agile disruptor from the lineage of Harley-Davidson, capitalizing on a decade of learnings in the EV sector and the iconic heritage of the most desirable motorcycle brand in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="r6iptg"&gt;LiveWire is the latest in a growing lineup of EV startups, autonomous vehicle companies, and automotive suppliers to go public by merging with “blank check” companies, which are publicly listed investment vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OARJ0O"&gt;There have been some successes, such as Lucid Motors’ mega-SPAC that valued the luxury EV company at $20 billion. But there have also been some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"&gt;noticeable flops&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;Lordstown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441025/canoo-sec-investigation-spac-merger-projections"&gt;Canoo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599726/nikola-founder-securities-fraud-charge-milton"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt; are among the EV companies that have hit some speed bumps after going public. (Even Lucid is now under SEC investigation.) There is a sense that in rushing to take advantage of the SPAC boom, these startups have been left to cope with the demands of being listed on a major stock exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Surface Laptop Studio is $200 off for the first time at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mYbQ-1OuuKhGCxicXskKmorQ7uk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70264616/microsoft_surface_laptop_studio_4795_24.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yiwLgK"&gt;Microsoft’s intriguing Surface Laptop Studio with an articulating display and a plinth platform to keep cool is seeing its first decent price drop since its release a few months ago. The base configuration that normally costs $1,599.99, and comes with an Intel Core i5-11300H processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgckLqLHhgg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is down to $1,399.99 at Best Buy for today only&lt;/a&gt;. That’s more than a tithe off the plinth, though you’ll need to have a free Best Buy account to get this deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SU5LY3"&gt;This is a good price if you want a laptop that has a display that can be positioned in multiple arrangements, much like the Surface Studio desktop. Though, this deal isn’t for everyone to whom the Surface Laptop Studio tries to appeal, namely creative types who need a lot of horsepower. The discounted configuration has integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics, which are no slouch for some light gaming, but it doesn’t compare to the RTX 3050 graphics (in addition to a more powerful CPU) found in the $2,099.99 configuration. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22716121/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H5CSGC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10917174"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jGh0di"&gt;Also at Best Buy, you can get a huge 75-inch Samsung QN84A Neo QLED 4K TV for $1,100 off its retail price, plus you’ll get a $500 Best Buy gift card with purchase. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgckYHL5ttF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The final cost is $1,699.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is a solid price for a 75-inch TV that — based on its specs — should deliver a lot of bang for the buck. While it lacks HDMI 2.1 ports to play Xbox Series X, PS5, or PC at 4K resolution and 120 frames per second, it has a native 120Hz refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hX5qG4"&gt;More importantly for some, it has full array local dimming for an accurate-looking picture, and its “Quantum HDR 24X” spec claims to reach very high brightness levels of up to 2,400 nits. This TV has four HDMI 2.0 ports, and it supports HDMI ARC, which makes it easy to funnel audio from the TV into a soundbar via HDMI instead of needing extra cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fEVtsb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10917194"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L7ohTQ"&gt;Make way for even more Samsung deals offered at Best Buy. The new Galaxy Buds 2 that released this fall &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgck4N0jcOn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are just about $50 off their original $150 price in the black colorway&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve seen competitive offers at sites like Woot, but that site typically offers the international version of this product, which lacks a one-year warranty for US customers — that’s not the case with the model available at Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oq2ZIn"&gt;In our review, Chris Welch was impressed with the size reduction from generation to generation, along with good audio quality and extra features (that aren’t a guarantee at this price) like active noise cancellation and a wireless charging case. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0ujCY2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10707231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SXn1c0"&gt;The final Samsung / Best Buy combo I’m delivering today is on this Samsung Galaxy Book Flex2 Alpha 2-in-1 laptop that’s steeply discounted. Normally $1,049.99, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgclnh9nSpH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $749.99 today&lt;/a&gt;. The Flex2 features a 13.3-inch FHD QLED screen, Intel’s Core i7-1165G7 CPU, 512GB of storage, and 16GB of RAM. This model released over the summer, and it seems like a capable machine for the price. In terms of ports, it sports one HDMI port, a charging plug, two USB-A ports, one USB-C port, and a microSD card slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YfjsRJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10627416"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Zi6lMn"&gt;Other deals you might be interested in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4CgtAU"&gt;Razer’s Barracuda X wireless gaming headset that includes a USB-C wireless transmitter (and supports Bluetooth and 2.4GHz) &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Barracuda-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset/dp/B096N6Q51N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $79.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, $20 off its usual price.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>How to sneak into a Bored Ape Yacht Club party</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rc2Vop_SwHrdimmfVwDuuokG0Ck=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70264463/acastro_211210_4923_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You need to own an NFT that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. Or do you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="wSjbVn"&gt;As someone who clears out his checking account every month to pay rent, I’ve been a passive observer of the whole NFT phenomenon rather than a participant. When you can’t afford one anyway, it’s much more tempting to see the technology as a gimmick, the scene’s adoptions of language like “democratization” as half-hearted cosplay for assets available mainly to the very rich, and the whole enterprise as a scam by people too rich to get in trouble for scamming, especially when NFTs mostly look like shit. They look like the kind of thing that in the past might have earned you a modest following on DeviantArt — but these things are getting sold at Sotheby’s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pew9hL"&gt;A few weeks ago, though, erstwhile countercultural bible &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; collaborated on a “zine” with the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, saying that they had “built an immersive, fantastical world” and advertised one of their creators comparing themselves to “the Beastie Boys on tour with Madonna.” Steph Curry had one. Another sold for $2.7 million. As of this writing, the cheapest one you can buy is for sale at around 50 Ethereum, about $200,000 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VkxQaz"&gt;I got into a frenzy and skimmed a &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; article. It taught me that when you buy or “mint” one of 10,000 available NFTs, an algorithm sorts a bunch of random attributes to create a cartoon of a monkey (the “Bored Ape”) that, while an instantly recognizable variation on the theme, is unique. One is shooting laser beams from its eyes; the next has 3D glasses. One frowns in front of a cyan background; the next grimaces over a mauve background. By virtue of that uniqueness, it becomes an asset, and membership among the owners (the “Yacht Club”) makes it valuable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FVBDyU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;But what about the NFT, the thing that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="11pbXm"&gt;But the article didn’t &lt;em&gt;explain&lt;/em&gt; their value. What was so meaningful in the apes’ aesthetic, which reminded me of Neopets? What was so compelling about the members of the de facto club that had formed among the owners of the exorbitantly priced avatars? But just when it seemed like I was doomed to my confusion, I found out parties were a part of this whole thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zrOl8Z"&gt;More specifically, a “warehouse party,” held at Brooklyn Steel, which is not so much a warehouse, as it is a mid-size concert venue created and owned by the same people who run Coachella (and who just renamed the Staples Center to the Crypto.com Arena). That’s like saying you went to a supper club at Applebee’s. But I like parties, so I figured if I was ever going to find out what the deal with this NFT stuff was, as a nightlife journalist, “NFT NYC” week was my time. A Twitter employee had posted a picture the previous night of a defeated-looking James Murphy at a BAYC party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QAjr2d"&gt;I went to Princeton on a scholarship, so a lot of my college friends went to high school with James Murphy. So it was uncanny to see their hometown hero, a veritable titan of New York nightlife, DJing for… whatever this was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4yCkn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGhNUv"&gt;But my proximity to that kind of privilege made me think someone I knew might have a Bored Ape. You needed one to get in, and the blockchain is purportedly so impregnable that people are using it to unlock their apartment doors. But I’d been guested into country clubs before, and this seemed like something similar. Even in college, I always got a voyeuristic thrill from watching how the wealthy behave when they let loose and enjoyed mooching off their open bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNgFVU"&gt;My first move was to ask a friend who has posted Instagram Stories of her crypto-trading brother-in-law staring into multiple screens at a standing desk. “Don’t have one, friends sold as well,” the brother-in-law replied to her curtly. “Depreciating asset.” I tweeted, I ‘grammed, I texted college friends who had gone into the tech industry — nothing doing. Mostly, people just wondered what I was even talking about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qkd949"&gt;Then I heard back from H, a former philosophy major who now works for a blockchain company. He thought his boss might have one — why? I explained the situation sweatily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ff5vRU"&gt;“I don’t think he’d transfer it to me,” H said, and I felt like I looked silly — like I was betraying how little I knew about expensive financial assets and web 3.0 technologies that will define our society’s future. I had caveated multiple times with “I know this is super weird” and “no worries if not,” but H suddenly announced that his boss could verify his ownership online and text him a screenshot of a QR code. The boss teleworked in from Puerto Rico anyway. He said H could go in his place, and I could tag along as his plus-one. &lt;em&gt;What the fuck? Holy shit. Fuck yes. Let’s fucking go. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="C5GG8R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hype drives value. It was the reason any of us were standing in line&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="38R1bu"&gt;At 6PM, I took the B43 bus to Brooklyn Steel as I had many times before. Just as I was stepping off the bus, though, H called me. He had wisely gone to the security to ask about the protocol for admission and had been told that they would be checking not for NFT ownership but yellow wristbands that had been given out at a prior event. &lt;em&gt;What? But what about the NFT, the thing that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars?&lt;/em&gt; Nope, she was just checking for yellow wristbands. That might be a problem, but H and I met up at around 7 and joined the line that curled around the block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aN7dgv"&gt;In line, I learned my first lessons about the NFT scene. It’s not even made primarily up of people who work in tech. A guy wearing a custom blue tracksuit with his ape printed all over it said he didn’t even get the blockchain stuff and needed H to explain it to him. He was just an investor, he said. Rather than the software engineer types I was imagining, the Bored Ape crowd was full of young, eager-eyed bros, happy to strike up conversation about their own pet NFT projects. It was more like a real-life version of those Twitter spam bots that promise that a certain cryptocurrency is “going to the moon” because NFTs are fundamentally about hype. Hype drives value. It was the reason any of us were standing in line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwTCSm"&gt;It also means the actual aesthetics are shamelessly derivative. The Bored Apes themselves are a shoddy appropriation of the Japanese streetwear brand A Bathing Ape. But in line, the Yacht Club members talked up their own, non-Ape zoo-animal-themed limited avatars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yo6QfG"&gt;Everyone else, however, had yellow wristbands, and sure enough, another security guard advised us to step out of the line when we neared the front. “But we have the NFT,” we said pathetically, brandishing our QR code screenshot. She had no idea what the fuck we were talking about. I could not believe that, having gotten (by proxy) this one-in-10-thousand cartoon monkey worth half a million dollars, that we were not going to get let in because of, like, resort rules. But we accepted the judgment, went to the nearby bar Tom and Joan’s, and drank for an hour, talking about love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sIVX3R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I joined the longest line to a mens’ room I’ve ever seen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BllUa3"&gt;By around 10PM, we were ready to head home. “Do you want to just go back and try one more time?” H asked. Yeah, fuck it. We decided that maybe if we persisted, we could annoy people long enough that they’d call someone who knew the value of our QR code screenshot. As we stepped into the crowd between the food trucks and the entrance, though, security waved us in without asking us to pull up our sleeves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5JwqA"&gt;The irony was not lost on me that actually getting the non-fungible token had no bearing whatsoever on us being denied entry at first or later when we got in. But honestly, I’ll be chasing the high I felt when we illicitly crossed that threshold for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="N36wAp"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iWWlB1"&gt;Brooklyn Steel was covered in tropical camouflage; over the bar, opposite the stage, a fluorescent “BAYC” logo was glowing, and blown-up Bored Ape portraits tile walls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJh4jJ"&gt;The decorators had done a good job, but even when I was in the Yacht Club for the night, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the Bored Apes didn’t seem much more impressive than the art in a typical Newgrounds flash game. I figured I must be wrong, though. Art and commerce’s mingling isn’t some new scandal, anyway. I thought, &lt;em&gt;maybe the next great patron of the arts is here tonight.&lt;/em&gt; A hundred years from now, scholarship kids at an art school will claw each other’s eyes out to take classes in a building with his name on it; tonight, he’s doing a backflip in the photo booth, picking up his Stella Artois Cidre, and heading back to the dance floor to try to grind on his coworker to “Reptilia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Bored Ape attendee attempts a backflip at the photo booth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/izbkS3i494XS86L_VoAQrv3VTCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076198/IMG_8517.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Adlan Jackson&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Bored Ape attendee attempts a backflip at the photo booth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="63UaMc"&gt;The Strokes were there, by the way. We missed seeing Beck get introduced by Aziz Ansari but got in in time to see Chris Rock try to riff on NFTs for 90 seconds and then introduce what must have been one of the first Strokes shows since their fundraisers for Bernie Sanders. “This is kind of about art, right?” Julian Casablancas pleaded from the stage. “NFTs? I don’t know, what the hell. All I know is... a lot of dudes here tonight.” The other members of The Strokes wore stony expressions and gripped their instruments like nervous high schoolers at a talent show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6MJkAN"&gt;Casablancas was right about the gender breakdown; I joined the longest line to a mens’ room I’ve ever seen. It was a jumble because while the organizers had booked multi-million dollar comedians to introduce multi-million dollar indie rockers, they had neglected to actually hire anyone to manage the crowd inside the venue; the Yacht Club was being run by a skeleton crew. I don’t know what I was expecting, but I had to notice the failure of the party to live up to any of the futurist promises that drive the value of NFTs. It turns out you actually can’t use the blockchain to work a door or keep a bathroom clean. You can only really do that with labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="C2y0tU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Brooklyn, if you’re making more money this year than last year, make some noise!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yXGhxB"&gt;The relentless peer-to-peer advertising I noticed in the line continued inside as well. It’s one of the more memorable lessons I learned: though I was expecting software engineers getting loose, while the NFT crowd wasn’t cool per se, creating value in a public marketplace requires more social engineering than other tech phenomena. If you can make your ape, giraffe, or pizza popular, it could mean getting rich. So, more stickers were left in the bathroom, and more people are smoking indoors than I’ve seen at any punk show. (Weed, mostly.) And the crowd in this millionaires’ party was noticeably less white than I expected, reminiscent of the Supreme store line crowd of nerds, hypebeasts, and hustlers — diverse but without very many Black people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IGEzD"&gt;And if there’s something that the makers of BAYC did right, it’s encouraging all their attendees to buy merch (that’s where you got the wristband that we don’t have, a merch pop-up). The crowd was full of black-and-white Bored Ape Yacht Club hoodies and T-shirts, which have the look of mid-2010s streetwear, just north of minimal, and the Yacht Club members wore them like frat letters. The energy was very collegiate, sloppy. The partiers didn’t seem to care much about cleaning up their messes. The ground was sticky before long, and the spilled beer smell began rising from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZVXcq"&gt;Drinks were free in the Yacht Club, and thank God, because I had already broken my pledge not to spend any more than my $5.50 in bus fare tonight by insisting drinks were on me at the bar. But we had gotten in late enough that the open bar was starting to run out. I got a Stella Artois Cidre of my own, and The Strokes had gone by then, and a DJ was playing a pretty good hip-hop set by the soundboard. You haven’t lived until you’ve heard a crowd of literal millionaires go up to Bobby Shmurda’s “Hot Nigga.” The DJ ended up being Questlove, and blessedly, he knows to play the censored version in this crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lm6Nob"&gt;Lil Baby, the night’s headliner, finally took the stage at around 1AM. Most people had left by then. I was drinking my last vodka of the night and zoning out to “Life Goes On,” though, and a small group of attendees bounced near the front of the stage, and there was something inspirational about Lil Baby’s utter lack of concern with how small the audience had grown and how utterly dry the vibe in Brooklyn Steel was. He had none of Julian Casablancas’ cool kid embarrassment or Chris Rock’s self-consciousness. He was simply getting to the bag. “Brooklyn, if you’re making more money this year than last year, make some noise!” his hype man screamed to the crowd’s delight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="0gCkz2"&gt;I’m a taker and not a maker, so because unemployment ran out, I don’t think that’ll be quite the case for me. I think he’s got the right idea, though. On the walk back to the bus stop, I found myself a little shook by the diversity of the new class of oligarchs, their expensive sneakers, and their knowledge of Lil Baby lyrics. One of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned as a scholarship kid myself is that after spending enough time in the borderlands between rich and poor, you could still end up dying as poor as you were born, no matter how many times you party with the rich. However strained the atmosphere of people trying very hard to make a party cool because their ROI depends on it may have been, I thought I might finally be learning to emulate the money moves of the Casablancases and the James Murphies, rather than their subversive poses. They wised up at some point, whereas I still hadn’t learned. Culture is cheap, and the Bored Apes were right to turn it into a token. If only I’d bought in sooner. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Takedown notices are threatening online thrift shops — just as business is exploding</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Small businesses say their livelihoods are threatened even when they aren’t running afoul of copyright and trademark claims&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="UI5gcz"&gt;In January 2020, Jade Myers, a successful seller of secondhand clothes on Poshmark, came across a trove of designer swimwear and apparel at a thrift store that she knew would be a hit with her shoppers. She shelled out for dozens of pieces, prepared and photographed them, and listed them on her shop, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fposhmark.com%2Fcloset%2Fornamentalstone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2F22826114%2Ftakedown-notices-online-thrift-shops-copyright-trademark" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ornamental Stone&lt;/a&gt;. Within days, the listings turned into an intellectual property nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cf5mde"&gt;The pieces Myers found and purchased for resale were from the buzzy brand Onia x WeWoreWhat, designed by fashion influencer Danielle Bernstein. After Bernstein was alerted to the Poshmark listings, she &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/dramatic-saga-between-fashion-influencer-weworewhat-and"&gt;jumped into Myers’ Instagram DMs&lt;/a&gt; to beg her to take the products down — they were unreleased samples that had been mistakenly donated to charity by the brand. But when the two weren’t able to reach an agreement on payment after Myers pulled the listings to sell back to the brand, Bernstein took the legal route: lawyers representing the label sent a letter claiming Myers was infringing on their trademarks and copyrights by hosting the goods on her store. Now Myers’ revenue was at risk, and Bernstein was threatening to have her entire Poshmark shop shut down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4erJFS"&gt;“In my head, I had already accepted the idea that I was going to lose my business,” Myers says. “That’s the point of desperation and sadness that I felt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K5xYfNhrWUOvaQdkWa_-NKFAPkk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076530/748B46D9_AF01_4676_A87D_B70CCADDE19C.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of an email Myers received, which she posted to Instagram Stories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sew5C8"&gt;Myers’ experience, which rippled through fashion and reseller corners of social media, is just one example of a phenomenon small businesses say they’ve struggled with for years. List a secondhand product from fashion companies like Michael Kors, Dior, or YSL, and you could soon be facing down an IP notice trying to block or restrict the sale, say online sellers. These takedowns can destabilize independent merchants and jeopardize their livelihoods. And now, sellers say overzealous takedowns are getting more and more intense across different e-commerce platforms, just as consumers are beginning to embrace secondhand fashion over buying directly from manufacturers and big-box retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g45j4v"&gt;The secondhand fashion industry isn’t growing — it’s exploding. An &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/second-none-fashion-resalers-bulk-up-capitalize-booming-sales-2021-10-28/"&gt;analysis by GlobalData&lt;/a&gt; suggests the secondhand market in the US is expected to more than double by 2025 to $76.4 billion, and retailers are trying to claim territory. In June, Etsy bought Gen Z-friendly competitor Depop for $1.6 billion, and resale platforms like Vestiaire, Tradesy, and Vinted have raised hundreds of millions of dollars this year. Brands like Levi’s and Urban Outfitters have launched in-house vintage and secondhand sections in recent years, and luxury labels like &lt;a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/what-to-wear/a38087452/jean-paul-gaultier-rental-resale/"&gt;Jean Paul Gaultier&lt;/a&gt; — following viral attention on its vintage pieces — are renting and selling their archives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwNXRO"&gt;Vintage and secondhand sellers say that as the field is getting more crowded, they’re running into more speed bumps. &lt;a href="https://revivalspecs.com/"&gt;Jon Hershman&lt;/a&gt;, a seller based in San Diego, California, with expertise in vintage sunglasses, has been working to move the majority of his sales offline — shoppers can try the products on, and there are fewer returns. And critically, navigating online takedowns has become a headache. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SL59nC"&gt;Though Hershman’s products are authentic vintage, dozens of sunglasses have been removed from his store’s Instagram shopping feed, with Instagram citing third-party infringement. He says some brands tend to get flagged more, like Christian Dior and Yves Saint Laurent, but removal is sporadic — some sunglasses are allowed to stay up, while others from the same brand are taken down. Requests for Instagram to review the removals are denied, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTGE3N"&gt;Instagram says the takedowns are intended to remove counterfeit products and make the platform a trusted place to shop. “Although we do our best, and every appeal is reviewed by a person, we know we don’t always get it right and are always working to improve our approach,” Stephanie Chan, a spokesperson for Meta, which owns Instagram, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WaOoXb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s so easy to take something down,” Bowman says, “And it is so, so, so difficult to get something put back up.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="txWOL1"&gt;Online vintage and secondhand sellers describe a delicate dance they must do in order to stay in business — and that even when they follow the rules, their shops are at the mercy of the platform-specific policies and the rights holders. Montana Bowman, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FBaltoVintage&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2F22826114%2Ftakedown-notices-online-thrift-shops-copyright-trademark" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a longtime Etsy seller&lt;/a&gt; who specializes in vintage hats and clothing, got IP infringement strikes every so often as his business grew over the years. To get his products restored, Bowman has to reach out to the brand directly, convince them the product is used and authentic, and get them to notify Etsy the IP claim is withdrawn. But not every brand returns his emails — a particularly frustrating situation involved a hat from a company that makes truck parts, named Supreme. The &lt;em&gt;other &lt;/em&gt;Supreme, the famous streetwear brand, claimed infringement, despite being the wrong company, and never responded to Bowman’s inquiries, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZamvA"&gt;Then this summer, Bowman got strikes resulting in the removal of three products — a vintage hat by Mack Trucks (now owned by Volvo) and two Jack Daniel’s baseball caps. In late September, still waiting on a response from legal teams, Bowman logged into Etsy one morning to start work only to find a big red banner saying his store had been suspended. (Another seller recounted getting a final warning before possible suspension the day before his wedding.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93QTRI"&gt;Bowman was eventually able to get his shop restored, but only after hiring a lawyer to communicate with Etsy. Bowman went weeks without his store, resulting in thousands of dollars in lost income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uOawP"&gt;“It’s so easy to take something down,” he says, “And it is so, so, so difficult to get something put back up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4GidWV"&gt;Etsy declined to comment on the record for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTsBV8"&gt;Legal experts point out that what sellers are doing is allowed: you can resell items you’ve purchased, whether it’s a 30-year-old commemorative T-shirt or a sweater you found at the thrift store that still had the tags. According to the first sale doctrine, once the original owner sells a product, you don’t need their permission to resell it as long as you’re honest about the condition and its provenance, says Yvette Liebesman, a professor of law at Saint Louis University. These legal sales can get caught in a net cast by brands that have a financial incentive to search for counterfeits or unauthorized resellers through takedowns. Small businesses often have no recourse even if they know their sale is legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2a000Z"&gt;Aggressive — and at times unfounded — infringement takedowns aren’t simply an attempt by corporations to claw back lost sales, says Liebesman, who has &lt;a href="https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=350017064003084121075100101087103119097014088087016004031104066030088005066068010030032012051099111045001108067000083113075021058073017052065017069011126017016095004076031119121069116112090026124117083076073089090095084097004017119087093118104084124&amp;amp;EXT=pdf&amp;amp;INDEX=TRUE"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about IP takedowns on resale platforms like eBay. They could also be used to attempt to change the law. She points to two pieces of pending legislation that, if passed, could significantly alter the resale landscape — making it harder for small sellers to operate — under the guise of anti-counterfeit protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Le23GT"&gt;The INFORM Consumers Act, supported by &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/amazon-supports-the-u-s-house-version-of-the-inform-act"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.etsy.com%2Fnews%2F2021%2Fetsy-pledges-support-for-newly-introduced-house-inform-legislation-heres-why-it-matters%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2F22826114%2Ftakedown-notices-online-thrift-shops-copyright-trademark" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/amazons-ecommerce-bill-bind-house-931f6c00-84bc-45ee-835c-242b34016382.html"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;, would require online marketplaces to take additional steps to verify the identities of high-volume third-party sellers. Meanwhile, the SHOP SAFE Act — which has received pushback from online selling platforms — would open platforms up to lawsuits unless they take certain steps to prevent counterfeit products. But Liebesman and &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/shop-safe-another-attempt-fix-big-tech-will-mostly-harm-small-players-and"&gt;critics of the bill&lt;/a&gt; say the legislation as-is could end individuals’ and small businesses’ ability to sell products online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTcwZ3"&gt;By racking up takedown notices that are hard for small shops to fight, Liebesman says companies could be “trying to create a climate to encourage Congress to ‘do something’ about this huge problem that they are manufacturing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubAgNe"&gt;“Anytime you buy a resold good or a used good, that’s one you’re not buying from the manufacturer,” she says. “They don’t want the competition of people buying used goods or resold goods.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQYafG"&gt;Cases where small sellers begin the legal process are few and far between, according to Liebesman. One oft-cited example is the story of Karen Dudnikov and Michael Meadors, who operated on eBay under the name Tabberone selling crafts made from licensed fabric. Tired of having their listings removed for infringement, the couple &lt;a href="https://nysba.org/NYSBA/Publications/Section%20Publications/Intellectual/PastIssues/SpringSummer2007Vol16No1/SpringSummer2007Vol16No1Assets/IPNewsSprSum07.pdf"&gt;tangled&lt;/a&gt; with Major League Baseball, Disney, Mars, and other corporations, seeking declaratory judgments that allowed them to keep their storefront open while representing themselves in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TqdSUi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s like the typical David and Goliath story.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nDil1S"&gt;Reached via email, Dudnikov says that when she and her late husband began challenging the takedowns in the early 2000s, there was very little information online about what their options for recourse were. Worried they would go bankrupt, they felt they had no choice but to defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCAM9n"&gt;“I don’t think I should have had this experience,” Dudnikov says. “Companies know what the law is, but they use their corporate lawyers as bullies to control the secondary market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSwEHW"&gt;Without the money or time to engage in legal proceedings, many entrepreneurs don’t have many options but to accept takedowns, says Lynnise E. Pantin, a Columbia Law School professor who runs a clinic counseling small businesses pro bono. When faced with a copyright takedown they believe to be mistaken, sellers have the option to counter-notice, which formally begins the legal proceedings — meaning a seller is opening themselves up to a lawsuit from the company in question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8dhCG"&gt;“A lot of people just decide, ‘I’m just going to do what they tell me to do,’” she says. “It’s like the typical David and Goliath story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXDE6L"&gt;In Myers’ case, tangling over the influencer-branded fashion line, she eventually met with Bernstein in person, coming to a handshake agreement on how to move forward. The saga was a lesson for Myers, who says she now realizes the letter from lawyers was an attempt at bullying her smaller operation into complicity. (Reached for comment, Poshmark director of corporate communications Kelly Mason pointed &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to the official infringement policy. “We’re glad that the two parties came to a good faith resolution on the issue,” Mason said regarding the WeWoreWhat dispute.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQyhm2"&gt;The shift towards secondhand shopping has been a boon to resale apps and sellers, but many small businesses feel increasingly inched out. A flurry of takedown threats can spread panic in the seller community — last month, many &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shopbacktrack/video/7029120776678755631?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESPgo8yvTr%2F8Z7dpxN5QrP%2BQMt4wjfIR1GAZEJ5avSHhae0N3Y1X7Ll9zAz5QPSdPkR8HoXU7bTqgR3R4Ykr3DGgA%3D&amp;amp;checksum=3ee74e7b166546cda7fccd099e0ff09af21eae7fe77d860b902a7b644e4b67e7&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview_pb=0&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAwm0WRGyGdizTvgkz3ptZpEcVFJff_UxXCp8bZWjZrKS5rqoLxbOGkVAWsJ51O2Gf&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_item_id=7029120776678755631&amp;amp;share_link_id=60AB05FF-864C-4A67-97B7-3A749818BFBC&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;timestamp=1639061083&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=d97igc3kk3b16i&amp;amp;user_id=6757149442048803845&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;_r=1"&gt;sellers on TikTok&lt;/a&gt; realized they had all received the same email from Shopify, notifying them that the platform found branded or trademarked goods in their shop. Sellers were required to fill out a form acknowledging the products and attesting they were genuine or risk losing their stores. (Earlier this month, Shopify was hit with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812956/shopify-textbook-publishers-lawsuit-piracy-copyright"&gt;a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; in which major publishers alleged it was allowing pirated textbooks and other learning materials to flourish on its platform.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Ek3E6"&gt;And while sellers say they’re happy any corporation is trying to divert waste and put usable products back into closets instead of landfills, there’s a difference between the stay-at-home mom who removes a stain just to make $15 on a dress and the company that just began to turn towards resale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ovnJ4R"&gt;“I don’t think they ever really cared until recently,” Myers, the Poshmark seller, says. “Until they saw the money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bj5mLF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="priATT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6N6nMF"&gt;Sony is finally &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/12/13/new-dualsense-wireless-controller-colors-arrive-next-month-followed-by-new-ps5-console-covers/"&gt;announcing its own&lt;/a&gt; custom covers for the PS5. The console covers will be available in black, red, pink, blue, and purple, and will work on both the regular PS5 and PS5 Digital Edition. Sony is releasing the black and red PS5 console covers in January in most markets where the PS5 is sold, with the other colors to follow in the first half of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I7M66A"&gt;The new covers are designed to match the colors found on new pink, blue, and purple DualSense controller options. These new colors will be available in January, with the purple version being sold in the UK, US, and Germany through &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/coming-soon"&gt;Sony’s PlayStation direct&lt;/a&gt; early access program. Other retailers will stock the purple DualSense controller on February 11th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="okcxNi"&gt;Sony’s announcement of new console covers comes just weeks after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22796166/sony-ps5-faceplates-design-patent-playstation-5"&gt;patented its PS5 faceplates&lt;/a&gt;. Sony has been caught up in legal action against multiple third-party companies that have sold black faceplates. DBrand faced legal action from Sony, forcing the company to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22728936/dbrand-pulls-ps5-darkplates-from-sale-sony-threatens-legal-action"&gt;pull its faceplates&lt;/a&gt; and replace them days later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733642/dbrand-new-ps5-darkplates-sony-legal-threats"&gt;with a new design&lt;/a&gt; and a marketing campaign that mocked Sony’s team of lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton responds to surprise death in And Just Like That... with new commercial </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zQJfPyWEwJnsRDI-h-zsRt-j8Jk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70263745/akrales210108_4344_0103.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QvYd2L"&gt;Peloton has responded to a plot-line in HBO Max’s new &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; reboot, &lt;em&gt;And Just Like That...&lt;/em&gt;, turning around a commercial in less than 48 hours after the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/10/peloton-selloff-continues-as-sex-and-the-city-reboot-adds-to-image-issues.html"&gt;stock continued to plummet&lt;/a&gt; in reaction to events on the TV show over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SrczXK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Spoiler warning: the following discusses a major plot point from the first episode of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Just Like That...)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvMVsV"&gt;The plot point in question involved the sudden death of Mr. Big (Chris Noth), who suffers what appears to be a heart attack after enjoying a 45-minute Peloton workout. That workout happened to be led by a character played by a real-life Peloton instructor (Jess King). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Nwy1B"&gt;Peloton says it approved King’s appearance in the show, but knew nothing about Big’s death. “We were not made aware of the plotline,” Peloton’s SVP of global communications Jessica Kleiman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;over email. “This was a casting opportunity for one of our instructors for an acting role — not an official brand integration or product placement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pdo5fe"&gt;Now the company has responded with a commercial featuring Noth and King, in which Noth suggests the pair “take another ride.” A voiceover from Ryan Reynolds reassures viewers that “regular cycling stimulates and improves your heart, lungs, and circulation, reducing your risk of cardiovascular diseases. Cycling strengthens your heart muscles, lowers resting pulse, and reduces blood fat levels,” before concluding — “he’s alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UtOqF9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And just like that...he's alive. &lt;a href="https://t.co/bVX8uWypFZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bVX8uWypFZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Peloton (@onepeloton) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/onepeloton/status/1470132497170239496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bipWhW"&gt;Kleiman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the commercial was filmed over the weekend “in collaboration with Ryan Reynolds and his marketing company, Maximum Effort, who created the spot,” and that the whole thing “came together in less than 48 hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fS9hgy"&gt;It’s an impressively quick turnaround — so quick that you’d be forgiven for suspecting the whole back and forth is a bit of orchestrated viral marketing — but Peloton and Ryan Reynolds do have prior form here. When Peloton released its infamous “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ijof8uw4OHs"&gt;Peloton Wife&lt;/a&gt;” advert two years ago, Reynolds nabbed the same actress, Monica Ruiz, to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ayD-4nMnB44"&gt;appear in a commercial&lt;/a&gt; for his Aviation Gin, with the spot seemingly following the same storyline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFMm5H"&gt;Peloton’s difficulties go far beyond fictional plot-lines, though. The company’s stock surged during the pandemic as more people were forced to work out at home, but enthusiasm for its products have since cooled. The company also has extremely real and tragic problems involving its equipment. Its &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/peloton-treadmill-recall/"&gt;treadmill was recalled&lt;/a&gt; after it caused numerous injuries and the death of a six-year-old who was pulled into the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota is going to make you pay to start your car with your key fob</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Car Logos" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yuXGUyhZUptnuXQP4a0R71GuL2E=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70262746/1230450659.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pWECf5"&gt;Toyota is charging drivers for the convenience of using their key fobs to remotely start their cars. According to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/43329/toyota-made-its-key-fob-remote-start-into-a-subscription-service"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Drive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Toyota models 2018 or newer will need a subscription in order for the key fob to support remote start functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svDI4F"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Drive&lt;/em&gt; notes, buyers are given the option to choose from an array of &lt;a href="https://www.toyota.com/connected-services/"&gt;Connected Services&lt;/a&gt; when purchasing a new Toyota, and one of those services — called Remote Connect — just so happens to include the ability to remotely start your car with your key fob. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9wkTqc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The key fob’s remote start functionality is tied to the audio package that comes with the car&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yQPoao"&gt;Buyers are offered a free trial of Remote Connect, but the length of that trial depends on the audio package that’s included with the vehicle. Even more confusingly, only some Toyota models support the Audio Plus or Premium Audio packages that the free trial is offered with, which you can check out for yourself in this &lt;a href="https://engage.toyota.com/static/articles/11_25_2020_2021_connected_services_trial_renewal_and_applicability_chart/2021_Connected_Services_Trial_Renewal_and_Applicability_Chart.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrE2qm"&gt;In other words, the key fob’s remote start functionality is tied to the audio package that comes with the car. This was first spotted in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/qyyl94/toyota_will_disable_key_fob_remote_start_unless/"&gt;a post on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, where the original poster added a link to Toyota’s Remote Connect marketing materials (&lt;a href="https://www.toyota.com/content/connectedservices/marketing/PDF/Remote_Connect_CFA.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). The post has since been flagged as “potentially misleading,” however, Toyota confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Drive&lt;/em&gt; that users will, in fact, have to pay for remote start when the free trial ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXw1Wq"&gt;The pamphlet linked to in the post details the key fob’s remote start feature, as well as its relation to the Audio Plus and Premium Audio packages. While a car with Audio Plus gives drivers the luxury of free remote start using a key fob for three years, a car purchased with Premium Audio offers free remote start for 10 years. After that, drivers will have to pay the $8 / month or $80 / year price for the full Remote Connect service, which includes the remote start feature for the key fob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13v4j0"&gt;On Toyota’s &lt;a href="https://www.toyota.com/connected-services/remoteconnect/"&gt;Remote Connect page&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not entirely clear that the key fob’s remote start functionality is included within the plan. It says that the Remote Connect service lets drivers use their smartwatch, smart home devices, or smartphone to start their cars, but there isn’t any mention of using the key fob for remote starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydCP52"&gt;And as &lt;em&gt;The Drive &lt;/em&gt;points out, it looks like some users have been aware of this for years. In a thread dated back to 2019 on the &lt;a href="https://www.toyotanation.com/threads/remote-start-keyfob-works-after-remote-connect-subscription-was-canceled.1656626/"&gt;Toyota Nation forum&lt;/a&gt;, users discuss the key fob’s remote start functionality — some users claim that their key fob is still able to start their car remotely, however most of the users on this thread own a Toyota that’s 2018 or newer, which means they may still be covered by the free trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nW1LfL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Typically, paywalled features like these are limited to luxury car brands&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NHmXWH"&gt;Typically, paywalled features like these are limited to luxury car brands. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/16/16897326/bmw-apple-carplay-subscription-google-alexa-detroit-auto-show-2018"&gt;BMW made drivers pay an annual subscription&lt;/a&gt; for Apple Car Play — in addition to the $300 it charges to install the feature in the first place. The German car manufacturer &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2019/12/4/20995630/bmw-apple-carplay-reverse-decision-annual-fee-vehicle"&gt;later walked back on its decision&lt;/a&gt; nearly two years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWLBQD"&gt;However, BMW still does let you pay to “unlock” new features in your car, in a way that’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21311332/bmw-in-car-purchase-heated-seats-software-over-the-air-updates"&gt;described as in-car microtransactions&lt;/a&gt;. The all-electric Porsche Taycan has a similar system, dubbed &lt;a href="https://www.porsche.com/usa/connect/"&gt;Functions On-Demand&lt;/a&gt;, which lets drivers purchase new, optional features for their Porsche, like Active Lane Keeping or Dynamic Light System Plus. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/36596/cadillac-super-cruise-needs-a-25-monthly-subscription-to-work-after-three-years-no-matter-what"&gt;Cadillac charges users $25 / month&lt;/a&gt; after the end of the free trial for its hands-free driving mode, Super Cruise, which has since been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701086/cadillac-super-cruise-2022-escalade-semiconductor-shortage"&gt;temporarily discontinued in newer Escalades&lt;/a&gt; due to the chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
