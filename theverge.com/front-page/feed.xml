    <title>Razer’s Huntsman V2 Analog is the latest keyboard built to mimic a controller’s joysticks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Huntsman V2 Analog" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMSfVGHNLrq43a7f7f0rbLIBzpM=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68772647/huntsmanv2analoghero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4zGsLV"&gt;Razer’s latest mechanical keyboard, the $250 Huntsman V2 Analog, looks similar to the company’s previous models, but the biggest differences lie in the switches. This model’s optical switches support adjustable actuation (the amount of movement required to register a press), allowing for near-endless customization through Razer’s Synapse software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LdSJW"&gt;Perhaps the most appealing feature of these keys is that, instead of being limited to the usual on / off nature of key actuation, they can be programmed with analog inputs to emulate a controller’s joysticks for smoother, variable levels of movement and control. You’ll be able to program the keyboard so that pressing a key down slightly will make you walk slowly in game, while pressing it fully will have you running at a normal clip — just like an analog stick.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTwTmc"&gt;(Note that game support for using analog inputs and a mouse simultaneously will vary, but using this feature at all requires the Synapse software. And programming an analog input for a key will override its original use case, so you’ll need to revert it or flip to a different profile.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWVYKG"&gt;Building on that feature, Razer’s keyboard also allows gamers to program two distinct functions that would usually require two buttons onto one key, with one firing off at one actuation distance and the other when you fully press the key. You could equip a grenade with a soft press of a key, then throw it by pushing the key all the way down, just to give an example.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Huntsman V2 Analog" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F3ypM7jHgE1ruPKQ2qdFGSE6Ec8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278985/huntsmanv2analog1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J8W79y"&gt;In fact, Razer’s switches can be customized to your specific actuation preferences for gaming or any other use case. The Huntsman V2 Analog keys have a default 3.6mm travel, but you can adjust the distance to a much shorter 1.5mm or anywhere between those values. It’s important to note that this doesn’t change how the keys feel when you push them, but a shorter actuation will let you type a little softer without worrying that your keys won’t register a press. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nPtIH"&gt;This is how it works: instead of relying on separate physical mechanisms to delineate between actuation states, the switch’s sensor judges distance pressed by assessing the amount of infrared light hitting it. The embedded animation shows this in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Huntsman V2 Analog" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FPavGoMSphz2GbTOi6Je40BBVwc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278987/Razer_Analog_Optical_Switch_Actuation_with_Bar.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A look at how the optical switch determines the actuation level.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XtPK2H"&gt;Razer’s Huntsman V2 Analog has an aluminum frame, a set of dedicated buttons to control media, and a dial for adjusting volume, which all look and feel great. Razer includes Doubleshot PBT keycaps, which are said to wear better with age than standard keycaps, and you’ll also get a soft wrist rest that contains RGB lights and can be attached magnetically to the keyboard. As you might expect, the keyboard itself has bedazzling Chroma RGB lights all around it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4CPqS"&gt;The cable that powers the Huntsman V2 Analog is USB-C, but Razer includes an adapter so you can plug it into USB Type-A ports. And if you want to use the keyboard’s single USB 3.0 Type-A passthrough port for an accessory, it has a second USB Type-A cable hanging off its back that you can plug into your PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdCNwC"&gt;By the way, in case this is your first time hearing about this kind of analog key technology and adjustable actuation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/3/11850816/wooting-one-analog-mechanical-keyboard-computex"&gt;keyboard company Wooting&lt;/a&gt; beat Razer to the punch with similar keyboards dating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/1/11832654/wooting-analog-mechanical-keyboard-kickstarter"&gt;all the way back to 2016&lt;/a&gt;. That company’s current keyboards start at around $150, far less than Razer’s $250 Huntsman V2 Analog. Whether Razer’s model can justify its high price will depend on your thirst for Chroma RGB lights, dedicated media buttons, and optional USB-C connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgkuJl"&gt;The Huntsman V2 Analog is now available exclusively at &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=http%3A%2F%2FRazer.com&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer.com&lt;/a&gt; through February 9th, when it’ll launch at more retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer built a Thunderbolt 4 dock stuffed with ports and Chroma RGB lights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Thunderbolt 4 Dock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XCSmFVsFB6oxrj0i86eIMPmEEis=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68772644/razertb4dockhero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Thunderbolt 4 dock is littered with useful ports&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3lG6Qy"&gt;If you’ve been hunting for a Thunderbolt 4 dock for your new laptop, Razer has a new option for you to consider, simply called the Razer Thunderbolt 4 Dock. It’s loaded with ports, and of course, Chroma RGB lighting, too. Razer says it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18246182/usb-4-thunderbolt-3-specs-features-release-date"&gt;USB4&lt;/a&gt; compliant, so it’ll be compatible with the next wave of fast peripherals and devices. It’s available for preorder through Razer for $329.99, which seems competitive for what it offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cz0FXI"&gt;Taking a trip around this understated, matte black aluminum dock, its front hosts a fast UHS-II SD card slot, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a single Thunderbolt 4 port to plug straight into your computer. On the back is where you’ll find most of the ports, including a barrel jack for its 135W power source, three Thunderbolt 4 ports for connecting displays and accessories (including support for Razer’s Core X external graphics card enclosure), a Gigabit Ethernet port, and three USB Type-A 3.1 Gen 2 ports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Thunderbolt 4 Dock" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rhTna1tIDbDPyhkoe89krOghXNQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278888/razertb4dock2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dock is 7.48 inches long, 2.93 inches wide, and just over an inch tall. It weighs three quarters of a pound.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tXd9Bz"&gt;The Thunderbolt 4 Dock can deliver 90W PD charging to laptops, and if you plan to connect external monitors to it, it can support up to two 4K screens with a 60Hz refresh rate, or one 8K display at 30Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8bjqt"&gt;This dock is also compatible with Windows 10 laptops with Thunderbolt 3 ports, as well as recent MacBook Pro and Air models running macOS Big Sur and all of Apple’s M1-powered machines — all of which feature Thunderbolt 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssqsQs"&gt;Razer’s Thunderbolt 4 dock is almost a direct (but slightly more expensive) parallel to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22219031/kensingtons-sd5700t-thunderbolt-4-dock-90w-charging"&gt;the Kensington SD5700T dock that my colleague Monica Chin checked out&lt;/a&gt;. It’s $289.99 and features the same amount of Thunderbolt 4 ports, plus one extra USB Type-A port. Razer’s option is a little more slim, lightweight, and flashy with its LEDs, but only you will know if that’s worth $40 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqfS8a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new betas let you try its Watch-based solution for masked iPhone unlocks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="5G is great if you can find it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SQz6gAtygq2U54E2N1oDRkh2qbw=/555x228:2040x1218/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771975/vpavic_4243_20201017_0216.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fKHzoF"&gt;With the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260639/apple-watch-iphone-unlocked-ios-14-5-app-tracking"&gt;upcoming release of iOS 14.5 and watchOS 7.4&lt;/a&gt;, Apple will let you use your Apple Watch to authenticate and unlock your iPhone while you’re wearing a mask. But if you want to try the feature now, you can, as Apple has released public betas for both iOS 14.5 and watchOS 7.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luZbYl"&gt;Before these releases, people using iPhones with Face ID while wearing a mask could only unlock their phone by entering in their passcode manually, which can quickly become a hassle. But with the new updates installed, if your Apple Watch is unlocked (which it most likely is if it’s sitting on your wrist) and as long as it’s nearby, when you try to unlock your iPhone while wearing a mask, you’ll feel a little buzz from your Apple Watch and your iPhone should authenticate you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ronwMa"&gt;There are a few caveats to this feature, though. It only works for unlocking your iPhone — it won’t work for authenticating things like App Store or Apple Pay purchases. And you’ll still have to manually enter your passcode on your iPhone every once in a while as an extra security measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzSFvA"&gt;If you want to get the public betas to try the feature out, head over to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta program site&lt;/a&gt;. Note that you’ll need to install the iOS 14.5 beta first before you can install the watchOS 7.4 beta. And be warned that because this is beta software, you might run into unexpected bugs, crashes, and performance issues. Install with caution.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford is more than doubling its investment in electric and autonomous vehicles to $29 billion </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HGpTkCCf6RneVUTJh7Otk6R3Ke8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771759/sokane_210125_4386_1753.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SkFBfj"&gt;Ford is increasing its investment in electric and autonomous vehicles to $29 billion, the company’s top executives said in an earnings call Thursday. The automaker had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/15/16892386/ford-electric-car-11-billion-2022-detroit-auto-show-2018"&gt;previously committed to spend $11.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; on electrifying its vehicle lineup through 2022. Now, Ford says it will spend double that amount, while extending the timeline to 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCUVZg"&gt;The automaker will spend $7 billion on autonomous vehicles and $22 billion on electric ones. That $22 billion includes $7 billion that the company has already spent since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OkBldR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The automaker will spend $7 billion on autonomous vehicles and $22 billion on electric ones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F5Jgfu"&gt;Ford said a majority of vehicles it plans on producing will be battery-electric vehicles, but the company also has hybrid and plug-in hybrid models that also have traditional internal combustion engines. The company introduced an all-electric Transit van last year, and plans on unveiling an electric version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21288000/ford-electric-f-150-2022-sale-launch-jim-farley"&gt;best-selling F-150 pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0i4V3"&gt;Ford’s new CEO Jim Farley touted the company’s increased investment as a “more aggressive” plan to position the nation’s oldest automaker as a leader in the future of mobility and transportation. Farley cited Ford’s recent announcement that it would work &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260176/ford-google-android-infotainment-os-2023"&gt;with Google to integrate the tech giant’s Android software&lt;/a&gt; into “millions” of vehicles starting in 2023 as representative of the type of deals involved in Ford’s pivot to a more digital future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLXGDR"&gt;The increased investment is meant to convince those on Wall Street who have been jittery about Ford’s ability to catch up to Tesla, which has been the only automaker to successfully build an EV business over the last few years. Ford is keeping pace with other legacy automakers like GM and Volkswagen, having just begun delivering its hotly anticipated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265570/mustang-mach-e-review-electric-ford-ev-photos-video"&gt;Mustang Mach-E&lt;/a&gt; to customers late last year — though a &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/ford/2021/01/16/ford-mustang-mach-e-delivery-delay/4189265001/"&gt;quality review issue&lt;/a&gt; delayed hundreds of additional deliveries last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qNEi2O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mustang Mach-E review: Ford’s big bet is about to pay off","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22265570/mustang-mach-e-review-electric-ford-ev-photos-video"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="yr6bZS"&gt;Most of the big automakers have said in the past year that they plan on pivoting to all-electric lineups. Daimler AG, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz (Daimler itself is soon to be renamed Mercedes-Benz), said it will produce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/7/16267856/mercedes-benz-concept-eqa-frankfurt-showcase-mobility-plans"&gt;electrified versions of all of its cars by 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Volvo announced it would start to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/5/15921208/volvo-all-electric-by-2019"&gt;phase out gas-only&lt;/a&gt; car production in 2019, while the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/11/16289292/vw-electrify-entire-300-car-lineup-2030"&gt;Volkswagen Group&lt;/a&gt; is going to make everything electric in some shape or form by 2030. And China’s rising prominence in the auto market, in addition to that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/28/16379094/china-fossil-fuels-electric-vehicles"&gt;country’s restrictions&lt;/a&gt; on manufacturing fossil-fuel burning vehicles, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/8/16625938/ford-china-zotye-electric-cars-manufacturing"&gt;certainly putting pressure&lt;/a&gt; on the entire industry to go electric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9KRvN"&gt;Ford isn’t even the only car maker to greatly increase its bet on electric. Late last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575153/gm-electric-ev-investment-deadline-cadillac-chevy-hummer"&gt;GM said it would spend $27 billion&lt;/a&gt; on electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025 — up from the $20 billion it announced before the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pinterest had a giant fourth quarter thanks to a strong holiday season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BgkXZDEzf6aKb3zbLBSz3KgvACY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771540/akrales_170802_1743_0198.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JI8rg3"&gt;Like other online platforms, Pinterest reaped the benefits of an uptick in e-commerce advertising during the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8LCvWI"&gt;The image-sharing platform saw a 76 percent year-over-year jump in fourth quarter revenue, to $706 million, the &lt;a href="https://investor.pinterestinc.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2021/Pinterest-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results/default.aspx"&gt;company said Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Pinterest had 459 global million monthly active users (MAUs) in the fourth quarter, up from 442 million in &lt;a href="https://investor.pinterestinc.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2020/Pinterest-Announces-Third-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx"&gt;its third quarter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6kOE5"&gt;Pinterest said in its &lt;a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/958601754/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Pinterest-Q4-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;letter to investors&lt;/a&gt; that its revenue growth was mostly driven by a robust holiday season and product improvements in advertising. It saw a six-fold increase in the number of businesses that used its shopping ads format during the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hyHUKJ"&gt;“We welcomed over 100 million additional monthly active users to Pinterest in 2020, more than any other year in our history,” CEO and co-founder Ben Silbermann said in a statement. During a call with analysts Thursday, Silbermann said the company was encouraged by its growth among Gen Z consumers, who he said are well-served by other social media platforms, but come to Pinterest “because they want spaces where they can explore their own interests and hobbies.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tqexeZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pinterest is experimenting with sponsored story pins&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bwRDme"&gt;Pinterest saw revenue in the US — its biggest market — rise 67 percent in the fourth quarter, to $582 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqJbGH"&gt;“Our investments in ad tools and sales coverage continued to pay off, especially during a strong holiday season. Advertising demand was healthy across different advertiser sizes and verticals, with retail demand further building off last quarter’s recovery,” the letter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e9JHft"&gt;In response to an analyst question about Pinterest’s roadmap for helping creators make money on the platform, Silbermann said the company was bringing on creators known for their ability to teach something rather than pure entertainment. And Pinterest content has a much longer shelf life than other online platforms, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYOQPW"&gt;“[Pinterest] creators are in an environment where there’s a strong search dynamic, more like YouTube than other social spaces that tend to be more ephemeral,” he said. The company also is experimenting with things like sponsored story pins, Silbermann added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pe7vvk"&gt;The company’s growth comes amid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21755406/pinterest-shareholders-lawsuit-sue-toxic-work-culture-discrimination"&gt;allegations of a toxic work environment&lt;/a&gt;; a group of shareholders is suing Silbermann and other top Pinterest executives for “marginalizing women who dared to challenge Pinterest’s White, male leadership clique,” and hurting the company’s reputation, the complaint alleges. Several women sued the company last year, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/03/pinterest-race-bias-black-employees/"&gt;alleging racial discrimination,&lt;/a&gt; and its former &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/11/technology/pinterest-francoise-brougher-gender-discrimination-lawsuit.html"&gt;COO said she was underpaid&lt;/a&gt; compared to her male colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCQTFt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/PINS:NYSE"&gt;Pinterest shares were up&lt;/a&gt; more than 10 percent in after-market trading Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0r6FRk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Even you can afford Serena Williams’ gamer chair</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r0uqc3ozgb637VyVpPDOY8jU6IU=/320x0:2354x1356/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771476/Screen_Shot_2021_02_04_at_4.56.20_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qq8XB6"&gt;There’s a great deal to gawk at in Serena Williams’ house, from the perfectly shined wood floors to furniture made of Elmo dolls. But there’s one item that feels out of place in house full of luxury: a cutesy pastel gamer chair. You can spot the oddly pedestrian item in a &lt;a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/step-inside-serena-williams-striking-florida-home"&gt;recent feature from &lt;em&gt;Architectural Digest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqScUJ"&gt;There’s no rule that a legendary athlete like Williams needs a bougie, high-end chair that costs more than most people’s rent. But given the other features of her house (see: hidden room and big clear piano), it’s surprising, and a little endearing, to spot something so... average. As &lt;a href="https://jezebel.com/serena-williamss-interior-decor-is-a-nerds-delight-1846199282"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jezebel &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, Williams’ chair — dubiously named “Zeanus Pink Ergonomic Gaming Chair for Girl” because it’s pink, I guess — is shockingly affordable. Right now, it’s going for $189.99 on sites like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F358-007Z-00004%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F4%2F22267001%2Fserena-williams-gamer-chair#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WJdDT2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-TeeIEh2IE8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qhi5n6"&gt;Anyway, maybe it’s not about the price or quality at all. This chair? Only for girl. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Diablo IV and Overwatch 2 aren’t launching this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Overwatch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ADtgvvlfqbwyH-XwB8ol4gZy6Hs=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771439/OVR_Ashe_000.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YDBJRn"&gt;Blizzard has two huge sequels in the works, but it looks like neither will launch this year. During its most recent earnings call, Activision Blizzard revealed that it doesn’t expect &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt; to be part of its 2021 financials, suggesting both will launch in 2022 or later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ph5R0F"&gt;Technically, this doesn’t represent a delay since neither game had a specific release date in place. Both&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943766/blizzard-overwatch-2-sequel-announcement-blizzcon-2019"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942565/diablo-4-announced-release-date-blizzcon-2019"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were first announced at BlizzCon 2019, and the developer has been relatively quiet since then, particularly about the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; sequel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V98E9t"&gt;That said, while the games may be further off than many fans expected, we’ll still likely hear more about them soon. Blizzard will kick off a remote version of BlizzCon on February 19th, and the keynote presentation is typically filled with trailers and announcements for all of the studio’s franchises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKG64R"&gt;There will be at least some &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; this year, however, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22180377/diablo-immortal-iphone-android-technical-alpha-preview"&gt;the mobile spinoff &lt;em&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; expected to launch in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest GameStop stock dip looks like the end of the line</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="gamestop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fUcvbW3Gf66pxzabVr6_zu9iQwE=/0x32:1100x765/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771381/GameStop_Store_Front_0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CNBYIE"&gt;When GameStop’s stock price fell by over 50 percent on Tuesday, closing at $90, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262546/gamestop-amc-stock-down-short-squeeze"&gt;we weren’t sure if it was going to pick back up or keep going down&lt;/a&gt;. It seems we now have our answer, as GME is down another 41 percent, closing today at just $53.50. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sD8OHh"&gt;That's &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history/"&gt;less than the stock sold for&lt;/a&gt; the week before it took off on a wild rollercoaster ride induced by Reddit retail investors and an unprecedented social media frenzy. So it seems like we’re not so much in a dip, but on the long, slow ride back to the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YB3j2r"&gt;When I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262546/gamestop-amc-stock-down-short-squeeze"&gt;about GameStop’s stock dip on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, the stock was down 81 percent from its peak of $483. Now, it’s down 89 percent from that peak. There was always the chance of a rally (and I guess, technically, there still is), but it seems like the meme may truly be over. If it is, it’s a sad ending: anyone who bought the stock during the rush and has held on to it until now is in the red on GME.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Graph of GameStop’s stock over the past month." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s5q2UGmhwg7QCoi08iRrbG0xIg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22282255/Screen_Shot_2021_02_04_at_1.31.58_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple Stocks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’re back to where we were before the big spikes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Google union files labor board charge against contract company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gr_PWtwhgS0hsg5AjiNYAWC351Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771360/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KgZx2K"&gt;The Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) has filed an unfair labor charge against Adecco, a subcontracting firm that provides data center services to Google. The union says managers tried to stop Google contractors from discussing pay, which is illegal. Shannon Wait, a union member and contractor, was suspended after posting about working conditions on Facebook. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/alphabet-union-alleges-contract-workers-were-silenced-about-pay"&gt;The news was first reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U78oHc"&gt;The charge is the first legal action the Alphabet Workers Union has taken to protect employees. Since the union went public in early January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220778/alphabet-workers-union-demands-youtube-ban-trump"&gt;it’s called on YouTube to ban Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; and voiced concern with the treatment of AI ethics researcher Margaret Mitchell, but both of these actions took the form of open letters and had no legal force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ByNUAh"&gt;Now, AWU is alleging that Adecco and Google retaliated against Wait after she posted about working conditions at a data center in Berkeley County, South Carolina. The complaint classifies the two companies as joint employers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njCn1R"&gt;Wait’s Facebook post centered in part on management’s refusal to replace broken water bottles at the facility. She said she’d joined the union to fight for better treatment for contractors, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/alphabet-union-alleges-contract-workers-were-silenced-about-pay"&gt;according to an interview in &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We are the backbone of Google,” she added. “We are doing the hard work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZVD1w"&gt;The charge also alleges Wait was retaliated against for her union support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lj3vhP"&gt;After Wait published the post, she was questioned by a supervisor. This same individual previously asked her not to talk about pay with colleagues after she inquired about some workers not receiving a promised bonus. Shortly after, Wait was suspended. Management said she was being investigated as a possible security risk, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3zmQV"&gt;“I want other TVCs [temporary, vendor, and contract employees] to see this and know they have recourse if they see something illegal or unethical in their workplace,” said Parul Koul, executive chair of the Alphabet Workers Union, in a press release. “Alphabet’s segregated, two-tiered employment system will not stand in the way of worker solidarity. We will continue to support Shannon and all Alphabet workers against unjust working conditions and fear mongering from management.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6L6FH"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Niagara is a minimalist Android launcher I wish I’d had on my bus commute</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sHQI40ORAsdl-YM_pTV2MbVvYYk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771065/DSC00106.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Niagara Launcher puts your apps within easy striking distance of your thumb.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TOd31n"&gt;After a couple years of beta testing, Niagara Launcher is now &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;available for download from the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. It’s designed to replace the default Android app drawer and home screen grid with a layout that’s easier to access with one hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZIrlX"&gt;You pick your favorite apps to pin on the home screen, and the rest are accessible under an alphabetized list on the right side of the screen in easy striking distance of your thumb. It’s quick and very responsive; you can either tap on the part of the alphabet you’re aiming for or swipe up and down to scroll your list of apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eS7Yah"&gt;Niagara also allows you to take quick action from the home screen by swiping across any app to bring up a list of options, like setting a new timer in the clock app or starting a session with Strava. Favorited apps will also show a preview of notification content on the home screen, and a swipe will expand this to show the full text without opening the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ukD9Cp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Favorited apps will also show a preview of notification content on the home screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p2csS7"&gt;These basic features are available with the free version, but customizing your home screen further with additional widgets and displaying your battery life percentage requires an upgrade to the paid pro version, which costs $6 per year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fr5uw5"&gt;Niagara features a clever design, and it would really come in handy on a big phone. I also would have appreciated it on my standing-room-only bus commutes in the Before Time, when I often clung to a rail with one hand for dear life while checking my email with the other. It’s pretty handy on a smaller phone, too, for a more informative look at your notifications without requiring you to open an app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hONDG7"&gt;The free version does not contain ads, which is another plus. Yet while the launcher does offer the basics, it’s a little bit of a letdown that it doesn’t let you add something as simple as a weather widget without paying for the upgrade. Overall, though, Niagara offers a clean look and a unique solution for those of us with one-handed woes.&lt;/p&gt;
