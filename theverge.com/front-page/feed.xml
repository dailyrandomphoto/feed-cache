    <title>Amazon Luna runs on Windows — and yet it’s hiring Linux gaming engineers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_SC4OhN135n0AMU0C_ytBlGlPgw=/0x41:861x615/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278732/msedge_r3ufclrsdh.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C2kLyH"&gt;When Amazon’s cloud gaming service Luna launched last October, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455610/amazon-luna-game-streaming-windows-nvidia-gpu-servers"&gt;the fact it ran on Windows set it apart&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike Google Stadia, it wouldn’t necessarily need to convince developers to painstakingly port their games to an unproven platform. But it now appears that Amazon is considering a shift to Linux-based servers, too — the company is hiring three software engineers to bring Windows games to Linux (via &lt;a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=Amazon-Linux-Graphics-Jobs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phoronix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drT7AE"&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22779252/steam-deck-things-we-learned-from-valve-developer-summit"&gt;Valve’s Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt; — an upcoming gaming handheld that also runs on Linux — the idea isn’t to abandon Windows games. Both the Steam Deck and Amazon’s seemingly new Luna initiative will still run Windows games, but both of them will do it &lt;em&gt;through &lt;/em&gt;Valve’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Proton compatibility layer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GN3vNt"&gt;“[T]his role involves working with Proton - a compatibility layer to run Windows games on Linux using Wine. Luna is committed to working with the open source community around Proton. This role will commit code to open source projects such as Proton and Wine in pursuit of running games in a stable and performant manner,” each of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1840068/software-development-engineer-l5"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1840070/software-development-engineer-l5"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1840069/senior-software-engineer"&gt;descriptions&lt;/a&gt; reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5TxX4"&gt;All three jobs were posted on December 6th, and they also all mention “DXVK,” a helpful tool that translates from Microsoft’s Direct3D graphics APIs to Vulkan instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xuXLqH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Why Linux for Luna?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nLy4X6"&gt;It’s not quite clear why Amazon might want to adopt Linux; &lt;a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/amazon-looking-to-stream-windows-games-on-luna-via-linux/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neowin&lt;/em&gt; speculates&lt;/a&gt; it might be about keeping Amazon Luna’s games easily sandboxed so that new updates don’t break compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEwDRn"&gt;The Proton gaming community &lt;a href="https://www.protondb.com/"&gt;will be quick to tell you&lt;/a&gt; that Windows games can often run well on Linux these days, though some have issues — and one category in particular, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816279/valve-proton-battleye-anti-cheat-dayz-linux-steam-deck"&gt;multiplayer games with anti-cheat software&lt;/a&gt;, can be problematic. Valve is pushing to improve that in time for the Steam Deck’s launch in February, though, and now it seems Amazon may help convince developers, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlodIH"&gt;We don’t have any indications whether Amazon Luna has been a success. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525339/amazon-luna-hands-on-cloud-gaming-streaming-early-access-price-games"&gt;We weren’t very impressed in our launch hands-on&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve heard it’s gotten better since. It generally gets even less buzz than Google Stadia, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300851/amazon-marc-whitten-fire-tv-luna-cloud-gaming-unity-role"&gt;it lost its head executive in February&lt;/a&gt;. But whether Amazon will follow through with gaming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686351/amazon-games-christoph-hartmann-twitch-luna-new-world"&gt;has been an existential question, period&lt;/a&gt;, and yet the company finally has a hit in &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;, which has continually kept a place on Steam’s top 10 list of the most-played games since its September launch. Maybe things are looking up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="30laMt"&gt;There’s an unusual opportunity for cloud gaming companies right now because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791886/ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-consoles-games-delays-supply-shorage"&gt;next-gen consoles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22698588/falcodrin-gpu-hunters-nvidia-amd-graphics-card-tricks-bots-scalpers-miners-gamers"&gt;graphics cards&lt;/a&gt; are so hard to find and so expensive to buy. Amazon has suggested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22663690/amazon-new-world-luna-cloud-gaming"&gt;that &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; might come to Luna, too&lt;/a&gt;, and if it does, it’ll be interesting to see if that spurs a wave of adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCyyDJ"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iW4HQm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Swift Playgrounds 4 is live on the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YYSvEvjw7Zi-az0QEAAqfGSjwKY=/0x57:2400x1657/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278648/12152021_iPad_Swift_Launch_create_ipad_screen.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pWNBaw"&gt;Apple’s Swift Playgrounds 4 is upon us. Announced earlier this year at Apple’s WWDC, the new app allows users to develop apps for iOS and iPadOS directly on an iPad. You can preview apps in real time while you work on them and send them directly to the App Store when you’re done. The program is now live on the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id908519492"&gt;App Store for iPad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mF8rza"&gt;“Swift Playgrounds is the best and easiest way to learn how to code,” Apple claimed in &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=v868vy6e&amp;amp;1639593362"&gt;its announcement&lt;/a&gt; on Apple’s developer website. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Swift Playgrounds 4 on an iPad with a white keyboard attached over a white background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kPSH37UPfXghgDRbCfCE_IAE3SY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23099602/12152021_iPad_Swift_Launch_app_ipad_screen.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friendly, colorful interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eRp10i"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11924120/apple-swift-playground-app-teaches-kids-to-code"&gt;Previous iterations of Swift Playgrounds&lt;/a&gt; have largely been targeted at children. They’re meant to teach beginners how to code in Swift, and they do so through a series of friendly and colorful puzzles. It has not, in the past, functioned as a standalone developer tool — this is the first time that coders will be able to build full apps within the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Mfm5p"&gt;Apps for iPhone and iPad are largely built and distributed in Xcode, a famously complicated application that only runs on macOS. Developers have been calling for an iPad version of Xcode for years, and while this isn’t exactly that, it could still help to lower the barrier to entry for new iPhone and iPad developers who want to try out their ideas without investing in a Mac. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel thinks the metaverse will need a thousand-fold increase in computing capability</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xYgk_5Q7kRlbPSFJ_5r-yDG-5LA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278616/acastro_210120_1777_intel_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WOywTE"&gt;Intel made its first statement on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;metaverse&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday — its first public acknowledgement of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;that sometimes-nebulous future of computing&lt;/a&gt; which promises an always connected virtual world that exists in parallel with our physical one. But while the chip company is bullish on the possibilities of the metaverse in abstract, Intel raises a key issue with realizing any metaverse ambitions: there’s not nearly enough processing power to go around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hm2kWE"&gt;“The metaverse may be the next major platform in computing after the world wide web and mobile,” &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/opinion/powering-metaverse.html"&gt;an editorial begins from Raja Koduri&lt;/a&gt;, a senior vice president and head of Intel’s Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group. But Koduri quickly pours cold water on the idea that the metaverse is right around the corner: “our computing, storage and networking infrastructure today is simply not enough to enable this vision,” he writes. Crucially, Koduri doesn’t even think we’re close. He says that a 1,000x increase in power is needed over our current collective computing capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="luVGr3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What is the metaverse, and do I have to care?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"},{"title":"Mark Zuckerberg is betting Facebook’s future on the metaverse","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="rCYqxn"&gt;A lot of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;metaverse hype&lt;/a&gt; has been built around what you’ll do there, be it virtual reality meetings, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;digital concerts&lt;/a&gt;, and of course, blockchain and NFT-based integrations. And there’s plenty of excitement about the future of virtual and augmented reality headsets, too, whether it be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Meta’s Quest products&lt;/a&gt; (formerly known as Oculus) or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22825675/apple-ar-headset-hand-tracking-controllers-kuo-report"&gt;Apple’s long-rumored headset&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYiK5h"&gt;But the actual building blocks of the metaverse aren’t just going to be software and virtual spaces (which, of course, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/27/tim-sweeney-the-open-metaverse-requires-companies-to-have-enlightened-self-interest/"&gt;is its own fight&lt;/a&gt;, given that today’s digital worlds are extremely self-contained) or even the headsets and gadgets people wear to “get” there. It’ll be in the computers and servers that run the vast shared virtual worlds the metaverse posits as the future of technology. And it’s there that Intel has the biggest reality check: today’s computers are just simply not powerful enough to make those dreams a reality. They’re not even close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DTRxCi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Today’s computers aren’t even close to powerful enough for the metaverse&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pJb49w"&gt;On the one hand, the statement here is almost laughably obvious. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22825139/meta-horizon-worlds-access-open-metaverse"&gt;Meta’s flagship VR space&lt;/a&gt;, Horizon Worlds, maxes out at 20 participants for a space, and that’s for basic, &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;-style animated worlds. The state of the art in VR still requires thousands of dollars of PC gaming hardware, with plenty of drawbacks (like requiring a tethered headset and graphics that still don’t measure up to what 2021’s best flatscreen games can offer). And even the biggest traditional video games that &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; dealing with the added demands of VR like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547946/ea-battlefield-2042-bots-ai-soldiers-128-player-backfill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can only handle up to 100 to 128 players at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dg18v0"&gt;As Koduri notes in his editorial, we can’t even put &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; people in a truly detailed virtual environment with today’s technology. “Consider what is required to put two individuals in a social setting in an entirely virtual environment: convincing and detailed avatars with realistic clothing, hair and skin tones – all rendered in real time and based on sensor data capturing real world 3D objects, gestures, audio and much more; data transfer at super high bandwidths and extremely low latencies; and a persistent model of the environment, which may contain both real and simulated elements.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rNtyn"&gt;And that’s just for two people — scaling up to the hundreds of millions of users that a &lt;em&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt;-style metaverse concept would require much, much more computing infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KG7Abl"&gt;Of course, Intel also has a vested interest in saying that we need more and better computers and servers. After all, Intel makes CPUs (and soon, GPUs) for consumer devices and data centers alike. And if the metaverse — the hottest buzzword technology of the future — needs a literal 1,000x increase in computing capacity, well that’s just good for business. It’s no coincidence that Intel explicitly called out both its client compute and cloud processors and graphics products in its metaverse brief. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/80M4gUmTkwFFZojMV-yrD6C1rxE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792255/intelarc2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eDyK3K"&gt;The problem, though, is that even &lt;em&gt;Intel&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t think that the hardware alone is going to get us to 1,000x. As Koduri explained in an &lt;a href="https://qz.com/2101581/intel-is-ready-to-talk-about-the-metaverse/"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Quartz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “We believe that a standard kind of Moore’s Law curve is only going to get us to about eight or 10x growth over the next five years.” (Moore’s Law generally is defined as computational capacity doubling every two years, which tracks with the eight to 10x growth that Koduri predicts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tu6OlT"&gt;Instead, Koduri is optimistically forecasting that algorithms and software improvements will make up the gap. Things like machine learning-powered neural nets, or AI-enhanced computational techniques of the sort that Intel already is using for things like &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/adaptix/deep-link.html"&gt;its Deep Link technology&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22631061/intel-arc-gpu-alchemist-xe-ss-super-sampling-ai-architecture-day-preview"&gt;upcoming XeSS super sampling&lt;/a&gt; it’s planning to debut with its Arc GPUs early next year. It’s a big ask, though — Intel is counting on algorithms or AI to offer a hundredfold (or more) improvement in computing capacity, all on top of the growth offered by its existing hardware roadmap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToJyoG"&gt;Koduri notes in the same &lt;em&gt;Quartz&lt;/em&gt; interview that improved software and algorithms won’t just be necessary to close the gap in the ambitious five-year timeframe he lays out; they’ll be crucial to helping mitigate the increased energy consumption that trying to brute force the problem would create, something that he compares to the current problems with cryptocurrency mining today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lTyzaJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hardware improvements alone won’t be enough, either&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ubMZ9o"&gt;It’s easy to just wave a hand and say that software will fill in any gaps hardware leaves behind (especially for a company like Intel, which primarily makes the hardware). Plenty of major tech companies have flocked to the idea that AI and machine learning will solve their computation issues, for everything from making smartphone cameras better to offering upscaled gaming visuals, and it’s appealing to think that they might. But it still seems like a tall order to rely on them to 100x tomorrow’s computing, which is forecast to only see a 10x jump based on hardware improvements alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nje6Oa"&gt;The fact that Intel is thinking about all this now — and stating the problem — is an encouraging sign, though. It’s easy to ride the hype and start pitching fantastical ideas of selling NFTs that will follow you from place to place in different games and virtual settings. Beefing up server infrastructure and working to reduce latency is less sexy; but as Intel’s presentation shows, if the metaverse is ever going to reach its sci-fi ambitions, there’s a lot more foundational work that needs to be done in the coming years to pave the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="XdmFNd"&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s 2021 holiday gift guide for moms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zeosgij68RQdPjnroiORldVLV2M=/0x2:2048x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70144233/Mom.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Richard Parry&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Gift ideas that go beyond the flower bouquet&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="5etm1R"&gt;If you were to ask your mom what she wants for the holidays, she’ll likely tell you “nothing” — followed by something equally unhelpful like “your happiness.” That’s because moms can be loving, selfless superheroes who often prioritize the needs of their loved ones over their own. While admirable, that also means you’re not going to get much help from them when it comes to buying the perfect gift, especially if you want to beat the upcoming shipping deadlines and pick something out that will arrive on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZ0tVR"&gt;Thankfully, we’ve gathered plenty of great presents you can surprise your mom with. We've included a monthly candle subscription for those in need of some relaxation ($10), as well as a transparent pot for saplings ($30) and an annual pass that allows for unfettered access to our national parks ($80).

    <title>Ray-Ban Stories get software update adding Facebook Messenger support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E1uwGxs3znoMNMrZe0Kl2-ocR_Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278489/alopez_210907_4736_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amanda Lopez for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m6Y3N6"&gt;The Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses are getting the ability to let you send and receive Facebook Messenger messages right from your face, according to &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10114157023473271"&gt;a Wednesday post&lt;/a&gt; by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. He says that the features being rolled out are just the beginning for the product, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;made in partnership with eyewear titan Luxottica&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9eg9h"&gt;Zuckerberg says that you’ll be able to use the glasses’ built-in mics, speakers, and assistant to send messages, have messages read out to you, and make audio calls using Facebook Messenger. He also promises that more updates will be coming in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fNlGDX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sending messages using your glasses feels very Black Widow or Iron Man&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F3P6so"&gt;Adding the ability to use the Stories as a Tony Stark-esque communication device makes them significantly more useful as a piece of wearable tech. The glasses’ main selling point is that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;they put a camera on your face&lt;/a&gt;, but when they first launched they weren’t a whole lot more than that. You could use the assistant to take videos and pictures, and the glasses could act as wireless headphones, but beyond that there weren’t many smart features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAVHZt"&gt;The update should also make some improvements if you use your Stories as headphones — Zuckerberg says you’ll now be able to control volume and track playback with your voice, if you don’t feel like using the touchpad built into the frames. Of course, saying “hey Facebook, pause” is probably going to attract more attention than just tapping your glasses’ right arm, but you do you. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple closes three more retail stores as COVID-19 infections rise</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t79lnqUGVPOcFLxZr7K3KmONZxQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278293/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sG1QiA"&gt;Apple has closed three of its retail stores following increased COVID-19 exposures and cases among employees, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-15/apple-temporarily-shuts-three-retail-stores-after-covid-19-surge"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjqhNE"&gt;The stores, which are located in the Brickell City Centre in Miami; Annapolis, Maryland; and downtown Ottawa, Ontario, will be closed temporarily. Right now, Apple’s website says the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/brickellcitycentre/"&gt;Miami store&lt;/a&gt; is closed until Friday and the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/annapolis/"&gt;Annapolis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/retail/rideau/"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; stores are closed until Saturday. Apple reportedly closed a store in Southlake, Texas &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826604/apple-store-closed-southlake-texas-covid-19-outbreak-black-friday"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; due to a COVID-19 outbreak, though the company’s website currently indicates &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/southlaketownsquare/"&gt;that store is open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtBXPn"&gt;The closures are happening as COVID-19 infections are on the rise. Though the omicron variant is beginning to spread, the delta variant “continues to be the main variant circulating in the United States,” &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/omicron-variant.html"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. On Tuesday, Apple once again began requiring customers to wear masks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834419/apple-retail-store-mask-requirement-december-2021-omicron-covid"&gt;inside its US retail stores&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UdCj7"&gt;“We regularly monitor conditions and we will adjust our health measures to support the wellbeing of customers and employees,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We remain committed to a comprehensive approach for our teams that combines regular testing with daily health checks, employee and customer masking, deep cleaning and paid sick leave.” Employees at the closed stores will have to be tested prior to reopening, the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwc7rS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VR workrooms app Spatial is now an NFT art platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Spatial gallery reading “Bozo Island”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d7lq_SaOXZleyeHPsprvWQK3krI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278227/RVML7Los.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spatial&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VKLlCc"&gt;Spatial, an early player in virtual reality workroom apps, is changing its focus to virtual art galleries showcasing non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. The company &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211214005169/en/Spatial-Unveils-New-Market-Focus-To-Pioneer-A-Free-And-Open-Metaverse-With-25-Million-In-New-Funding"&gt;announced the news&lt;/a&gt; yesterday alongside a $25 million funding round. It’s a potential indication of where some “metaverse” tech might be going in the near future — namely, away from VR-heavy, work-focused experiences and toward more entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCH5Kb"&gt;Spatial’s original pitch was a virtual workspace where people could don VR headsets, talk to co-workers in virtual meetings, and collaborate by examining virtual items. But over the past year, that’s changed. The company says it’s gone from 80 percent of its users wearing VR headsets to 80 percent accessing it through the web and mobile apps, many of these users are more interested in social experiences than work ones, and it’s adjusting its priorities accordingly. It’s ended nearly all its partnerships with major companies (with the exception of Mattel and Nestlé) and shut down apps on AR headsets like the Nreal Light and Magic Leap One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zJvw12"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In the world of work, convenience is really everything”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J0fAma"&gt;Instead, Spatial is focusing on collaborations with artists who want to show off their NFT projects. The latest iteration connects with MetaMask cryptocurrency wallets and lets people see a catalog of the NFT art they own. They can then place the images into gallery spaces like virtual paintings, letting guests mill around and talk to each other with avatars or live videos that float above the avatars’ heads. Moreover, Spatial will let artists either sell NFTs directly through the platform or import 3D spaces and mint the actual spaces as NFTs, which they could then sell. (For now, it’s only supporting the Ethereum blockchain, but it could support others — potentially ones with a lower carbon footprint — in the future.) Today, for instance, it’s hosting a gallery and NFT launch designed by Renaud Futterer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40dqUY"&gt;Spatial says it is making the shift based on how it saw people use its platform, but it could also speak to broader industry trends — particularly the idea that people will work in a 3D “metaverse.” Meta, formerly Facebook, has bet big on the idea this year and launched a Spatial-like service called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22629942/facebook-workrooms-horizon-oculus-vr"&gt;Horizon Workrooms&lt;/a&gt; for the Meta Quest VR headset platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bERGgb"&gt;Jacob Loewenstein, Spatial’s head of business, thinks that world is a ways away. “There will be a day when I think people are wearing headsets to work together all day. But that day is not today,” he says. The company has had more success with NFT art, where it adds a sense of heft to something that’s otherwise just a flat image. “Art is quite typically a very experiential medium,” says Loewenstein. “And you can’t do that by just throwing something on a boring old web page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4wBcx"&gt;It may simply be harder for a small company to compete head-to-head with a product from Meta, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"&gt;isn’t a new issue&lt;/a&gt; for VR developers. But “metaverse” platforms also remain clunky enough that making people use them for a required work event can be a recipe for frustration. When I entered Spatial for a meeting, I ended up encountering a bug that forced me to drop and conduct part of the interview over Zoom, and I’ve had a similarly frustrating experience syncing up with other people on Horizon Workrooms. “In the world of work, convenience is really everything,” says Loewenstein. Spatial is betting that in the world of art, people will be more willing to take a leap into its 3D world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Minecraft crosses 1 trillion views on YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="minecraft" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZsF-_9U-r2mSe7jPdkGL2X-H13w=/0x21:1100x754/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278139/Minecraft-360.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PnQdWk"&gt;Long before the metaverse became the premier destination of tech companies and newlyweds, there was &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;. It is a platform that started as a video game about dodging explosions from hissing cactus-shaped creatures and became the blank canvas on which millions of players create their content, upload it, and generate trillions of views — literally. Today, YouTube, in collaboration with &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;developer Mojang, is celebrating an unprecedented trillionth view (trillion with a &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;) with a snapshot of the game’s unique and transformative history on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNhjYt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s chief storyteller Lydia Winters attributes the game’s trillion views to her team’s respect for the myriad ways players use &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; to tell their stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5KlwK"&gt;“We have people who are off on an adventure and people who are building and people who are playing together, and all those ways of playing are important to us,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. As &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s chief storyteller, her team’s job is to create and curate a world players want to create in. That enabling of all kinds of storytelling has been critical to the game’s nigh untouchable popularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCRd9U"&gt;“The reason why &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; has been so successful on YouTube is because YouTube videos are a way to tell stories,” she says. “So then when you have &lt;em&gt;Minecraft,&lt;/em&gt; and you can tell any story you want in a &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; world, it’s a big reason why we have so many people creating&lt;em&gt; Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S9WtFl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All those ways of playing are important to us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pmujtn"&gt;By the numbers, &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s YouTube community has over 35,000 creators from over 150 countries. The kind of content on YouTube ranges from simple role-playing “Let’s Plays” to videos that don’t feature actual gameplay from &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayyVUl"&gt;Earnest Pettie, culture and trends insights lead at YouTube, is responsible for keeping track of all the weird and wild ways players use &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; on the site. He’s fascinated by one creator in particular who uses the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; aesthetic and is popular within the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; community without actually playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FN9V0c"&gt;“Interestingly, one of the biggest trends on &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;is actually animation, and that’s animation either created with &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; or animation that is derived from the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; aesthetic,” Petite says. “There’s this creator named Jake Fellman, who creates YouTube shorts. He’s created about 100 &lt;em&gt;Minecraft-inspired&lt;/em&gt; shorts that are actually computer animation. He’s one of the most viewed &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; creators of this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0Ntz8"&gt;Fellman’s videos are 15-second bursts of hyper-realistic, “What if &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; graphics were rendered with the Unreal Engine 5” shorts that feature cute interactions with monsters or sheep and garner over 1 million views a pop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ftpx9k"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K6O5LgOZl-I?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D9aS4U"&gt;YouTube has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/trends/articles/minecraft-trillion/"&gt;a fascinating breakdown&lt;/a&gt; of the history of the game on its platform over the last 11 years, complete with stats and graphs and facts about what it took to make 1 trillion views. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KtrgJt_lnjr3XqaMDwksa-4FU1E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23099334/minecraftgraph.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="44uRvU"&gt;It’s interesting to see how genres of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; videos change over time as they fade in and out of popularity. In &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s early years, the multi-million view hits were &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/I-sH53vXP2A"&gt;music video parodies&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; household names like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCshoKvlZGZ20rVgazZp5vnQ"&gt;CaptainSparklez&lt;/a&gt;. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTkXRDQl0luXxVQrRQvWS6w"&gt;Dream&lt;/a&gt; (who recently won a Game Award for content creator of the year) dominates the charts with his &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/RJ0jdO5ZfU4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; manhunt series&lt;/a&gt; that features his friends trying to stop Dream from completing the game&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by any means necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJOsXy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; is the most popular game on YouTube ever. In 2020, it earned over 200 billion views; second place — which was curiously Roblox, another sandbox-style game — earned less than half that. Part of that seemingly untouchable popularity is because of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s nature. It’s an open space ripe for all kinds of creation and iteration on that creation in a way no other video game can boast. The other reason, according to Pettie, is the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkcIfU"&gt;“One trillion views doesn’t happen without the creative ingenuity of all the creators who have uploaded &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; videos over the years,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rejuOz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZ1bu5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s Matrix PCs can’t play The Matrix Awakens, but they look cool</title>

&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UloLjF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nvidia is also giving away five Matrix-themed backplates for the GeForce 3080 Ti&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LCtcPV"&gt;The first gaming computer, dubbed the Digital Storm Backup Operator, was made by artist Stefan Ulrich in partnership with Digital Storm. Small monitors and keyboards come mounted on the case, along with some crazy-looking wiring and fans, giving off the impression that you can actually slip into the Matrix with this machine. In terms of specs, it comes with none other than a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and a Ryzen 9 5950X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qg2x3m"&gt;The NZXT Nebuchadnezzar was made by PC customizer Dave Cathey. It’s inspired by the Nebuchadnezzar ship from the first two movies and features Sentinel arms that hug the outside of the case. Binary code is etched in on the front of the case, along with a cutout that says &lt;em&gt;“Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;.” It also comes with the NZXT Z73 Kraken AIO cooler that’s outfitted with an LCD screen — the modder programmed it to show the symbolic white rabbit. Like the previous build, it has a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti but sports an AMD 5800X processor instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiVK2z"&gt;Lastly, PC modder Staszek “Tip” Wiertelak partnered with Nvidia to create The Breacher, which doesn’t even look like a PC. It trades in a typical, boxy computer case for a mock-broadcast station. Nvidia notes that the entire case is interactive; however, you can remove the case and use the PC as “a stand-alone machine.” This rig comes with a GeForce RTX 3090, along with a Ryzen 9 3950X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cgcdHZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10925751"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3w0eh1"&gt;Of course, the only downside is that these computers can’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22828860/the-matrix-awakens-ps5-xbox-series-x-free-next-gen"&gt;play &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, considering that the demo isn’t even available for PC for whatever reason. If you don’t end up winning one of the custom computers, Nvidia says you’ll automatically be entered to win one of five custom &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt;-themed backplates that you can attach to a GeForce 3080 Ti. And no, the 3080 Ti card isn’t included.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Help your loved ones stay healthy and happy with gifts suitable for all budgets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="c6YEGG"&gt;There’s nothing quite like a global pandemic to remind you how true that old cliché is: at the end of the day, health really is wealth. During these past two years, however, emotional wellness has become just as important as physical health, making gifts that focus on our mental wellbeing just as meaningful as those that impact our physical one. Luckily, our gift guide features a range of ideas that should appeal to both, many of which were solicited from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;staff and can still arrive on time even if the holidays are nearly here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Io2XdI"&gt;Below, you’ll find an under-desk elliptical for the friend who finds making time to go to the gym challenging, as well as the latest Apple Watch, the third-gen Oura Ring, and a pair of sunglasses that let you ditch your earbuds at home. We’ve also included gift cards for popular therapy and meditation services — perfect for those of us who waited until the last minute to start shopping — along with gifts that should also work well with any budget. Take a look and see what great stuff you can get to help your family and friends stay healthy and happy.&lt;/p&gt;
