    <title>Microsoft hid its new Xbox headset in the Series X launch trailer months ago</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o9TEBO_AQA2zASXwWNqzFtgbOc0=/22x0:534x341/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829199/xboxheadset.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3KG6Ju"&gt;Microsoft’s new Xbox Wireless Headset appeared in the company’s Xbox Series X and S launch commercial all the way back in October. British actor Daniel Kaluuya picked up the headset &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21508979/microsoft-xbox-series-x-tv-commercial-ad-marketing-campaign-power-your-dreams"&gt;early on in the ad&lt;/a&gt;, but nobody noticed it was an unannounced accessory at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGNgkr"&gt;Microsoft announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285247/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-release-date-price-features"&gt;new Xbox Wireless Headset on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; which features rotating ear cup dials that let you adjust volume and game / audio chat balance. The new headset will be available for $99 on March 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_V5twfVfOfYJm1cuwNPbo8cJJPg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309428/xboxwirelessheadset.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new Xbox Wireless Headset.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dRrbVr"&gt;Aaron Greenberg, general manager of Xbox games marketing, confirmed the new Xbox Wireless Headset was part of the launch commercial during a Clubhouse audio call attended by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last night. It’s not the first time Microsoft has openly teased unannounced Xbox products. Xbox chief Phil Spencer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433228/microsoft-xbox-series-x-hidden-video-phil-spencer-july-2020"&gt;hid the Xbox Series S on his shelf last year&lt;/a&gt;, before Microsoft had even announced it was working on a second next-gen console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNESg0"&gt;Microsoft has a habit of hiding secret messages and clues in its Xbox videos. The company originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/7/15754260/microsoft-xbox-e3-project-scorpio-teaser-trailers"&gt;teased its Xbox One X console&lt;/a&gt; with videos that hinted at its 6 teraflops of GPU performance. Even the latest Xbox Series X console was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/8/18658147/microsoft-xbox-scarlet-teaser-e3-2019"&gt;teased in videos&lt;/a&gt;, under its Scarlett codename. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8Embq"&gt;If there’s one thing we’ve learned from all of this: always take a real close look at Microsoft’s Xbox videos.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games brings Apple fight to the EU with new antitrust complaint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3FfoJ2jwG5QC9WTDp8EHNXq33q8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829189/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="owZZU4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic Games has made a formal antitrust complaint about Apple to the European Commission, the &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-games-files-eu-antitrust-complaint-against-apple"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Epic alleges that Apple’s “carefully designed anti-competitive restrictions” have “completely eliminated competition in app distribution and payment processes.” It says this leads to consumers playing higher prices, and gives Apple too much control over developers on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geMeM2"&gt;The complaint is the latest legal action taken by Epic in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know/archives"&gt;ongoing dispute with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. The developer has criticized Apple’s control over software distribution with the App Store, as well as its policies around payments, which often result in Apple taking a 30 percent cut of in-app purchases. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has called this 30 percent cut a “tax,” and Epic claims Apple’s policies give its own services an unfair advantage over other iOS developers. In November, Apple said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;reduce its App Store commission rate to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; for any developer that earns less than $1 million in annual revenue, in an apparent response to pressure from developers and regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e2iCJC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic wants “timely and effective remedies” from the EU&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zuHcZa"&gt;In its announcement, Epic Games said it’s not seeking damages from Apple in the EU. Instead, it says it wants “timely and effective remedies” to address what it claims are Apple’s anti-competitive practices. “We just want to see prohibition on these platform companies using their control over the hardware to exert control over secondary markets and force them to compete on equal terms with every competitor,” Epic CEO Tim Sweeney &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e1259614-d954-400f-9265-f39a36c8c0c6"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when asked what these remedies should include. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwDVCL"&gt;Epic’s dispute with Apple erupted last summer when the developer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;attempted to circumvent&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s 30 percent cut on in-app purchases in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Apple responded by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removing the popular game from its App Store&lt;/a&gt;, only for Epic Games to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;file a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; in response. Epic has subsequently &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/freefortnite-australia-press-release"&gt;launched legal proceedings in Australia&lt;/a&gt;, and earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/epic-widens-fortnite-access-dispute-with-apple-google-in-u-k?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;complained to the UK’s antitrust tribunal&lt;/a&gt; about Apple’s actions. Epic Games and Apple are due to meet in court in May, according to the &lt;em&gt;FT. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qICjs"&gt;As well as challenging Apple, Epic also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"&gt;sued Google&lt;/a&gt; after it removed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from Android’s Google Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ruv2OL"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/euiSHuaw6Q4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qg8auo"&gt;Responding to Epic’s latest filing, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/epic-games-attacks-apple-in-complaint-to-eu-antitrust-watchdog?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Epic had intentionally violated its App Store policies, and that these “apply equally to every developer and protect customers.” It said Epic’s actions “made pawns of customers, and we look forward to making this clear to the European Commission.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8sosu"&gt;Epic’s new complaint follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;EU’s announcement last year&lt;/a&gt; that it has opened a formal antitrust investigation against Apple over its App Store and Apple Pay practices. The EU is concerned that Apple’s policies stifle and distort competition in cases where Apple’s own services compete with other developers on its App Store. Messaging app Telegram &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/88589fc5-8410-4274-859c-d27b3d83fe20"&gt;has also complained to the EU&lt;/a&gt; about Apple’s policies, demanding that it allow users to download software outside of the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX reportedly raised the best part of a billion dollars to fund future missions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SpaceX" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AbzxlnkuUcsAosditoRYyfNdxrs=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68828334/spacex1_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XEPznM"&gt;SpaceX has &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/16/elon-musks-spacex-raised-850-million-at-419point99-a-share.html"&gt;reportedly raised $850 million in a round of funding&lt;/a&gt;, in transactions that would value shares of the company at $419.99 each. According to &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;, this would mean the company is worth around $74 billion. It would also mean that the company has money to continue on with its future projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEKgcA"&gt;As one could imagine, some of SpaceX’s projects are deeply unprofitable before they start making money — for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274385/musk-spacex-starlink-deposit-price-satellite-internet"&gt;earlier this month Elon Musk said that there’s a “deep chasm of negative cash flow”&lt;/a&gt; between the company’s satellite-based internet service provider Starlink and profitability. The company’s plan to send &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21419841/spacex-starlink-internet-satellite-constellation-download-speeds-space-lasers"&gt;enough satellites to create a global, high-speed internet network&lt;/a&gt; is expensive, and since the service is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274385/musk-spacex-starlink-deposit-price-satellite-internet"&gt;still in the beta and pre-order stage&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not going to be bringing in a ton of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybYVLv"&gt;The company is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20895056/elon-musk-starship-spacex-human-health-life-support-radiation"&gt;working on a spaceship&lt;/a&gt; with a cargo capacity that rivals the Saturn V, the rocket that took us to the Moon. A project like that requires many failed test flights, which can sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262937/spacex-sn9-starship-test-flight-successful-explode-landing"&gt;crash and blow up&lt;/a&gt;. While SpaceX aims for Starship to eventually be reusable like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/30/15117096/spacex-launch-reusable-rocket-success-falcon-9-landing"&gt;some of its current rockets&lt;/a&gt;, recent crashes suggest the company will have to build a few more before it has a product that can be profitably sent into space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwuyjB"&gt;With SpaceX being a private company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/7/18129539/spacex-falcon-9-rocket-water-landing-valuation-investors"&gt;its financials can often be difficult to figure out&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s likely that investors (at least the ones who paid &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/teddyschleifer/status/1361841578378100737"&gt;almost $420&lt;/a&gt; a share) believe that the company will be successful, both with future endeavors and current ones like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22150947/spacex-second-dragon-capsule-space-station"&gt;making deliveries to the International Space Station for NASA&lt;/a&gt;. While Musk has said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/16/7569333/elon-musk-wants-to-spend-10-billion-building-the-internet-in-space"&gt;Starlink alone might cost $10 billion to create&lt;/a&gt;, having $850 million more in the bank account certainly doesn’t hurt the company’s odds.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve’s Dota 2 will become a Netflix anime series on March 25th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SOgb6jhUpacljbD3jrBMMP8gXf0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68827988/Screen_Shot_2021_02_16_at_4.19.10_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5kYUX8"&gt;Netflix is making an anime series based on Valve’s hugely-popular game &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt;. The 8-episode series, titled &lt;em&gt;Dota: Dragon’s Blood,&lt;/em&gt; launches on March 25th, and you can watch the first trailer at the top of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjtcHT"&gt;“The upcoming fantasy series tells the story of Davion, a renowned Dragon Knight devoted to wiping the scourge from the face of the world,” according to a &lt;a href="https://media.netflix.com/en/only-on-netflix/80994336"&gt;Netflix press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Following encounters with a powerful, ancient eldwurm as well as the noble Princess Mirana on a secret mission of her own, Davion becomes embroiled in events much larger than he could have ever imagined.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oxUEsj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're excited to announce a brand-new anime series exploring the Dota universe like never before. As fellow fans of Dota and its passionate global community, we look forward to sharing this new adventure with you when it premieres on Netflix March 25.&lt;a href="https://t.co/rHcL5QSi5b"&gt;https://t.co/rHcL5QSi5b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DOTA 2 (@DOTA2) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DOTA2/status/1361829031755190276?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eoSesv"&gt;Animation for the show will be done by Studio MIR, which made &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Korra &lt;/em&gt;and Netflix’s&lt;em&gt; Voltron: Legendary Defender. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbMw7N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the only huge free-to-play MOBA getting its own TV show. Riot Games is working on an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915338/league-of-legends-animated-series-fighting-game-cards-arcane-runeterra-project-l-trailers"&gt;animated series&lt;/a&gt; set in the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; universe called &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;. The show was delayed from its original 2020 release and is now scheduled to come out &lt;a href="https://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/dev/an-update-on-arcane/"&gt;sometime this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google reportedly shut down its Stadia studios a week after praising them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ryi4MrVaRwvqQP7egJLohX85B34=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68827472/akrales_191113_3779_0319.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a3HuTO"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;made the surprise announcement&lt;/a&gt; on February 1st that it would be shuttering its in-house Stadia game development studios. But the news wasn’t just a surprise to Stadia customers; it was a bolt from the blue for the Stadia development team, which, just a week prior, had been told that the studios were making “great progress,” &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/stadia-leadership-praised-development-studios-for-great-1846281384"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfllWt"&gt;“[Stadia Games and Entertainment] has made great progress building a diverse and talented team and establishing a strong lineup of Stadia exclusive games,” said Phil Harrison, a vice president at Google and general manager for Stadia, on January 27th in an email to staff obtained by &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;. The email promised more news on the Stadia studios’ strategy and goals for 2021. But instead of new development objectives, Harrison announced just days later on February 1st that the studios would be shutting down entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VWonme"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google is shutting down its in-house Stadia game development studios","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GLGje6"&gt;The biggest question — both from outside observers and Stadia team members alike — is what changed. Harrison’s blog post announcing the shutdowns cites “exponentially” rising costs of “creating best-in-class games” as a factor, for example. But given Google’s $1.4 trillion market cap, it’s hard to imagine that as the sole reason for shutting down the company’s game development studios entirely, especially when they were given so little time to prove themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVPzP7"&gt;In a Q&amp;amp;A with staff on February 4th, Harrison reportedly admitted that Google’s execs already knew the shutdown was coming when he sent the email praising the team’s progress. &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Harrison variously cited Microsoft’s acquisition of Bethesda and the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic as factors in the shutdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3tvWw"&gt;Whatever the case may be, one thing is clear: by shutting down its studios before they even managed to ship any major first-party exclusives for Stadia, Google has shown not only its staff but also the world that it isn’t as serious about its gaming initiatives as it once appeared. And ultimately, that’s a disappointing thing to see, both for Stadia’s future and for the industry at large. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tXdAkg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The writing’s on the wall for Google Stadia","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="asQZMp"&gt;Microsoft is expanding its accessibility efforts with a new program for evaluating Xbox and PC games. Today, its gaming accessibility team announced that developers can send their games to be evaluated for accessibility and tested by players with disabilities. The program was announced alongside updates to the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/accessibility/guidelines"&gt;Xbox Accessibility Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that were released in early 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGrOW2"&gt;“Developers now have the option to send Microsoft their Xbox or PC title and have it analyzed and validated against the recommendations provided in the XAGs,” says &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/02/16/xbox-accessibility-guidelines-and-testing/"&gt;an Xbox blog post&lt;/a&gt; published today. The Xbox Accessibility Guidelines include thorough explanations of inclusive design considerations for developers, and they are now updated to include clearer language, additional context, and implementation examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaJuEW"&gt;Game test reports will include feedback from players with disabilities, as well as links to information on inclusive design, relevant nonprofits, and accessibility experts. Any issues found during testing will be “noted with reproduction steps, screenshots, and other information to help the developer understand what aspect of a given experience may be challenging for certain gamers with disabilities,” says the post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtTlie"&gt;More companies have been focusing on game accessibility in recent years — including Microsoft with the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/17/17363528/xbox-adaptive-controller-disability-accessible"&gt;Xbox Adaptive Controller&lt;/a&gt; — but there are still few high-profile examples &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21274923/the-last-of-us-part-2-accessibility-features-naughty-dog-interview-ps4"&gt;besides &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A program like this could potentially lead to more games with a similarly wide variety of accessibility options. It’s also significant for players with disabilities to be able to provide insight, rather than being left unconsidered or designed for without their input. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s iOS 14.5 emoji promote inclusivity, vaccines, and the AirPods Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xm9RmEwgnIpNePWUfHMq9IuWZjo=/0x0:809x539/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68827365/Newios14.5emoji.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WaA86G"&gt;As part of iOS 14.5, Apple is adding new emoji from the Unicode Consortium’s Emoji 13.1 release, including skin tone options for some popular emoji and several new smiley faces and hearts. The company is also making some changes to other emoji that are already available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90fJIf"&gt;The new changes to skin tone and gender presentation are probably the most important to note. Popular emoji like “Couples Kissing” and “Couples with Heart” now have many more skin tone variations for all options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2xwUHU4LciSJ8wqetLXp50w4hYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307939/couples_with_skin_tones_ios_14_5_emojipedia.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Emojipedia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skin tone variations for the “Couples with Heart” emoji in iOS 14.5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IR7hYh"&gt;In addition to more skin tones, the bearded emoji has also been adjusted to allow for not just the neutral “Person:Beard” but also “Man:Beard” and “Woman:Beard.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/urqR5dzgulw6De3io73nMTqTda4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307966/beard_options_ios_14_5_emojipedia.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Emojipedia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The various beard options in iOS 14.5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HOQrNN"&gt;Apple’s update also includes its take on the new smiley faces included in the Unicode Consortium’s newest emoji set, including “Exhaling Face,” “Face with Spiral Eyes,” and “Face in Clouds.” Hearts, another emoji go-to category, also has two new members joining its ranks, “Heart on Fire” and “Mending Heart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IddUj2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10345995"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EzyeSy"&gt;All of these emoji were approved by the Unicode Consortium &lt;a href="http://blog.unicode.org/2020/09/emoji-131-now-final-to-be-widely.html"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that vendors could begin integrating them into their products and services at that time. But it’s up to the individual companies to design how emoji look on their devices and services, which is why a smiley face on your iPhone looks different than it does on Twitter. Companies also decide when the new emoji show up — Pixel users, for example, have been able to use the new emoji &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/08/december-patch-brings-unicode-13-1-emoji-to-pixel-devices/"&gt;since December&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCztZt"&gt;Apple is also making tweaks to some existing emoji, however: the rock-climbing emoji will now feature a helmet, the syringe emoji is now a more generic one rather than one filled with blood, and the headphones look like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVT3iw"&gt;The syringe change could be a legitimately helpful one for anyone writing about COVID-19. Not only is the new syringe way less intimidating when emptied of blood, but it’s also more applicable to vaccinations, which will hopefully become a lot more common soon. Check out this comparison from Emojipedia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f2QFNC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple has removed the blood from the syringe emoji in iOS 14.5, making it more versatile to represent vaccination   &lt;a href="https://t.co/tdSiIYB0gI"&gt;https://t.co/tdSiIYB0gI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/3R5gL83Cdz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3R5gL83Cdz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Emojipedia (@Emojipedia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Emojipedia/status/1361745569635573775?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LgyrLM"&gt;Changing the headphones emoji to resemble AirPods Max, on the other hand, follows a known pattern: Apple regularly inserts its own products into its emoji set as a form of free product placement. (Apple’s mobile phone emoji &lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/mobile-phone/"&gt;looks a lot like an iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, for example.) If you want to see just how different the new headphones emoji is, Emojipedia &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Emojipedia/status/1361750732643459075"&gt;made that comparison&lt;/a&gt;, too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MFFdNw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In iOS 14.5 beta 2, the   Headphone emoji now displays as AirPods Max &lt;a href="https://t.co/cGkn3ir0G9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cGkn3ir0G9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Emojipedia (@Emojipedia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Emojipedia/status/1361750732643459075?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sep5W8"&gt;Apple says all of these emoji are available in the new release of the iOS 14.5 beta, which also comes with a nice little change to the Apple Music app. According to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/ll9zje/feature_ios_145_beta_2_swipe_actions_in_music/"&gt;users on Reddit running the beta&lt;/a&gt;, you can now add and remove music from your queue with the same kind of swiping gesture used in Apple’s Mail app to archive, delete, or flag emails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UTW4wK"&gt;The full release of iOS 14.5 is also said to include several other helpful additions like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260671/ios-14-5-ps5-dualsense-xbox-series-x-controller-support"&gt;support for the new Xbox and PlayStation controllers&lt;/a&gt;, the ability &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272460/apple-ios-14-5-default-music-streaming-service-siri-spotify"&gt;to set Siri’s default music streaming&lt;/a&gt; service to Spotify, and the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260639/apple-watch-iphone-unlocked-ios-14-5-app-tracking"&gt;unlock your phone with your Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2e55r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 16th, 8:30PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added context about the new emoji and the changes to older emoji in iOS 14.5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s Nitro XV272U QHD gaming monitor is a steal at $300</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ogPiWHPrsOvfvPn5wkMqW_ZXSco=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68827256/cfaulkner_210201_4392_0014.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The monitor in question is on the left-hand side. Taken for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/22264684/remote-work-desk-home-set-up-cameron-faulkner-acer-lg-tech-reporter" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What’s on your desk?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; series&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9PUFTP"&gt;PC gaming is an expensive hobby, so I wouldn’t blame you if you’re trying to save some money here and there. To that end, if you’re looking for a QHD gaming monitor that’s affordable and loaded with features, Acer’s Nitro XV272U might have your name on it. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MQBPMJ2?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It costs $300 at Amazon right now&lt;/a&gt;, which is the cheapest you’ll find it online. This isn’t the first time it has seen this discount, but I always want to tell people about it when it resurfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7knTv"&gt;I actually purchased this monitor the last time it was on sale because it met all of my requirements at a fraction of the price I expected to pay. It’s a 27-inch IPS panel in 1440p resolution with a 144Hz refresh rate and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility. I’ve seen a lot of other monitors on the market with these specs for around $400–500, but it was a delight to find all of this for $300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gBKPob"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10346110"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lQFF4C"&gt;After using it for over a month, I can say it was easily worth the money. All monitors are different, though, and I think Acer’s color calibration isn’t stellar out of the box. But after some toggling with settings, it’s looking nice next to my 27-inch LG UltraGear gaming monitor, which I also got on sale. Bargain shopping!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple won’t have to allow App Store alternatives on iOS after North Dakota bill fails</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NbKvVmsB-rnvL4XA1KzSwsgTMA0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68827252/acastro_180130_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mWGwSx"&gt;A North Dakota bill that would have drastically altered the way app store operators like Apple and Google manage their digital marketplaces has failed to garner enough votes, failing in the state senate by an 11-36 vote on Tuesday, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karlarosehanson/status/1361780107619094530"&gt;North Dakota House of Representatives member Karla Rose Hanson&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBUfLi"&gt;The bill, SB 2333, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276511/north-dakota-senate-bill-2333-apple-google-app-store-antitrust-monopoly"&gt;stirred considerable controversy last week&lt;/a&gt; when a committee hearing drew the attention of corporate lawyers and lobbyists, experts, and Apple critics arguing both in favor and against the proposed legislation’s potentially far-reaching consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArGIFk"&gt;The bill would have barred any company in the business of software distribution making over $10 million in annual revenue from imposing rules on developers dictating they only use one app store, like the App Store or the Google Play Store, and that they have to use the app store owner’s preferred payment system. Using Apple or Google’s payment system, in turn, lets those companies take 30 percent of most sales, per their long-standing revenue sharing policies around app sales and in-app purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="i3nYDh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple said the bill would “destroy the iPhone as you know it”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QyuXVG"&gt;Requiring developers to use the App Store and Apple’s own payment system are pillars of the iPhone maker’s mobile business and largely responsible for the App Store’s continued financial success. The App Store is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;estimated to have generated more than $64 billion&lt;/a&gt; in revenue last year. (Google does allow alternative app stores onto Android, but the company requires users to click through security warnings to download and use such software.) Yet, developers have long complained of Apple’s grip on the flow of revenue on iOS, with critics claiming its ever-changing rules are inconsistently applied and that Apple grants exemptions on a case-by-case basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NtfIBU"&gt;Although the bill would only have dictated how companies like Apple operate within the state of North Dakota, the bill’s broad language may have forced Apple to make systemic changes to its business nationwide. The legislation’s success could have also inspired other states to follow suit with similar attempts to regulate app stores’ relationships with developers, although that appears to be already underway despite SB 2333’s failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpBMt6"&gt;In arguing against SB 2333, Apple’s chief privacy engineer, Erik Neuenschwander, testified that the bill “threatens to destroy iPhone as you know it,” arguing that it would “undermine the privacy, security, safety, and performance that’s built into iPhone by design,” &lt;a href="https://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/north-dakota-senate-bill-targets-monopolistic-app-stores/article_dc491c88-97e0-54cd-beb2-5a26044cb97c.html"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Bismarck Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Simply put, we work hard to keep bad apps out of the App Store; (the bill) could require us to let them in,” Neuenschwander concluded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="afeGMT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;North Dakota’s app store bill might have had far-reaching consequences for Apple and Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0spRQA"&gt;The legislation is just one of a growing number of state bills, which now includes proposed bills in Arizona and Georgia, that seek to place limits on the power of Apple and fellow app store owners. A &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/14/technology/north-dakota-tech-apps.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;report this weekend&lt;/a&gt; linked the bills to a multi-state lobbying effort from the Coalition for App Fairness, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453745/spotify-epic-tile-match-coalition-for-app-fairness-apple-app-store-policies-protest"&gt;industry group formed last fall&lt;/a&gt; consisting of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;creator Epic Games, Tinder parent company Match Group, Spotify, and dozens of other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHNq3Z"&gt;The CAF’s members have for years railed against the App Store and Apple’s mandate that it take 30 percent of all app sales and in-app purchases. The group is now dedicating its efforts to supporting legislation taking aim at Apple and its App Store policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ybrKQ"&gt;SB 2333 was proposed by Sen. Kyle Davison (R-Fargo) after the state senator was approached by Lacee Bjork Anderson, a lobbyist with the firm Odney Public Affairs based in Bismarck, North Dakota who gave a draft proposal to Davison. Anderson, it turns out, was hired by both the CAF and Epic. Epic is also suing Apple and Google after both companies removed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;last August, following Epic’s decision to include its own in-app payment system in the iOS and Android versions of the battle royale hit. (Epic was not the only CAF members that submitted testimony supporting SB 2333; Basecamp. Match Group, and Tile all submitted testimony, too, a CAF spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Al1fCl"&gt;In a tweet, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney acknowledged Epic and the Coalition for App Fairness’ participation in the ongoing lobbying efforts. “North Dakota’s effort to combat app store monopolies is awesome for consumers and developers,” Sweeney wrote. “The Coalition for App Fairness organized the outreach, lobbying, and developer participation. Can’t take credit for it, but Epic is proud to be a part of it!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vEkMG0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

    <title>Here’s what the upcoming Sonos headphones will probably look like</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fHdBRkTLomYgul7FuG2ovpmptwg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68827129/sonoslede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: German Patent and Trademark Office&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Lmm3dI"&gt;Sonos has long been rumored to be developing a premium set of noise-canceling headphones to join the company’s ecosystem of speakers and multiroom audio products. A new design patent filing at the German Patent and Trademark Office seems to provide a glimpse at a farther-along, more refined product than what we saw from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21409963/sonos-headphones-patent-wireless-noise-cancellation-bluetooth"&gt;the US Patent and Trademark Office&lt;/a&gt; in September. These latest filings were registered in December and published in late January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBwRQJ"&gt;One notable difference is that the Sonos wordmark is visible on this design; it wasn’t present on the previous filing. (That said, it’s in broken lines, which doesn’t count for much in a design patent and signifies that placement could change.) Another evolution is that the rods coming out of the headband now go straight down into the ear cups; there’s no additional part that wraps around the back of each ear cup as we saw before. Again, these are broken lines, but the solid lines also show an evolution from the design we saw before. There are obvious tweaks to the outer ear cup shape. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="VtVAo5"&gt;Little is known about the Sonos headphones beyond the fact that they’re expected to cost the same as high-end competitors from Sony and Bose. It’s believed one of the headlining features will be a seamless handoff of music from the headphones to your Sonos audio system (and vice versa). But Sonos will likely need to deliver more than just that to sway consumers away from the market leaders and newer entrants like the Apple AirPods Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mj5M3a"&gt;An adapter for earphones is also part of recent Sonos filings at the German Patent and Trademark Office. It’s not unusual for expensive headphones to offer replaceable ear cushions, so that could be what this is for. A USB-C port, various buttons, and a 3.5-millimeter cable input are also sketched out in the headphone drawings. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The German filing also shows drawings of an “adapter” for earphones. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="46nhkw"&gt;Sonos CEO Patrick Spence confirmed during the company’s earnings call last week that the next Sonos product will be announced in March. That device could end up being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22269050/sonos-fcc-filing-mini-move-portable-bluetooth-speaker"&gt;a smaller portable speaker&lt;/a&gt; to complement the bulky Sonos Move. But during the call, Spence also confirmed that Sonos continues to aim to release “at least” two new products each year. The headphones could wind up being that second new offering for 2021 — assuming they don’t make a surprise appearance next month.&lt;/p&gt;
