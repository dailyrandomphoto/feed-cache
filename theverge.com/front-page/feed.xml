    <title>Adjusted AstraZeneca data shows COVID-19 vaccine 76 percent effective</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PGPc8k"&gt;AstraZeneca released &lt;a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd1222-us-phase-iii-primary-analysis-confirms-safety-and-efficacy.html"&gt;updated data&lt;/a&gt; on its COVID-19 vaccine, saying a more recent analysis shows the vaccine is 76 percent effective against symptomatic COVID-19. It’s a slight drop from the 79 percent the company touted in an announcement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344191/covid-vaccine-astrazeneca-effective-us-study-disease-protection-fda"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;. That number was based on outdated data, US health officials said in an unusual public statement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346135/covid-vaccine-us-astrazeneca-niaid-statement-concerns"&gt;rebuking the company&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaaioM"&gt;The original efficacy was based on an interim analysis using data collected until February 17th. But adding more data collected after that date showed that the vaccine may have been 69 to 74 percent effective, according to a letter from the independent panel monitoring the clinical trial and reported &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/astrazeneca-oxford-vaccine-concerns/2021/03/23/2f931d34-8bc3-11eb-a33e-da28941cb9ac_story.html"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The panel “strongly recommended” those numbers also be reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGcSZK"&gt;The new result is a few percentage points higher, but a finding in that range would have still been a good result and much higher than the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-s-cutoff-covid-19-vaccine-effectiveness-50-percent-what-n1245506"&gt;50 percent efficacy cutoff&lt;/a&gt; the US Food and Drug Administration said it wanted from COVID-19 vaccines last fall. A federal official &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/astrazeneca-oxford-vaccine-concerns/2021/03/23/2f931d34-8bc3-11eb-a33e-da28941cb9ac_story.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that AstraZeneca’s decision to publish only the higher number earlier this week was like “telling your mother you got an A in a course, when you got an A in the first quiz but a C in the overall course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qgl9lt"&gt;Releasing scientific data in a press release instead of in a scientific paper means that outside experts can’t scrutinize the claims. The companies behind the first three COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the United States also first reported the results of their clinical trials in press releases. Their data held up, but experts were still &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/21556380/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-optimism-skepticism"&gt;critical of that strategy&lt;/a&gt;. The botched AstraZeneca data release shows why they were so cautious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VkrkwX"&gt;The updated data indicated that, likelier than not, this vaccine is a good vaccine, and it will have a major role to play in the world’s fight against COVID-19. It’s cheap compared to the Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech vaccines, it can be stored at room temperature, and it’s been earmarked as the main shot to vaccinate &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/nov/23/oxford-astrazeneca-results-covid-vaccine-developing-countries"&gt;lower-income countries&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZnkYu"&gt;But for the past year, it’s been defined &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22274371/covid-vaccine-astrazeneca-south-africa-variant"&gt;more by controversy&lt;/a&gt; than good science. The company wasn’t transparent with regulators when the trial had safety issues, for example, and its clinical trial had mistakes and opaque methodology. The US clinical trial was supposed to clear up the confusion. Instead, the botched data release added to the mess just as public health officials are trying to shore up confidence in COVID-19 vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Five-year-old Fairphone 2 getting updated to almost three-year-old Android 9</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yxzWufzeiJ-OPelFEGoc64fl6XM=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69023493/jvincent_160412_1017_8176.0.0.1484136509.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Farphone 2 was originally released five years ago.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by James Vincent / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T0b6Xx"&gt;Sustainable smartphone manufacturer Fairphone has gotten Google’s certification for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairphone.com%2Fen%2F2021%2F03%2F25%2Fandroid9-fairphone2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22349953%2Ffairphone-2-android-9-update-sustainable-long-term-support" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its Android 9 update&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/13/11414936/fairphone-2-review"&gt;Fairphone 2&lt;/a&gt;. Getting certification for a nearly three-year-old version of Android doesn’t sound that impressive until you realize that it’s running on a phone originally released five years ago when it ran Android 5. The roll-out of the software starts today, and will continue until April 18th, Fairphone says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjzkIV"&gt;It’s a length of support that’s basically unheard of among Android phone manufacturers. Although Fairphone 2 owners aren’t going to be able to enjoy the latest Android 11 features, the more important thing is that they’re running a version of Android that’s still officially supported. Google’s &lt;a href="https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2021-03-01"&gt;latest Android security bulletin&lt;/a&gt; from this month includes multiple fixes for security issues in Android 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FB9yH0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In order to get certification, we had to pass approximately 477,000 Google tests”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jfQlPs"&gt;The Fairphone 2’s Android 9 update has been in the works for a while and was released in beta &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairphone.com%2Fen%2F2020%2F06%2F18%2Ffairphone-2-gets-android-9%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22349953%2Ffairphone-2-android-9-update-sustainable-long-term-support" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;way back in June 2020&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, Fairphone outlined the challenges it had in trying to support such an old phone, including the fact that Qualcomm no longer provides support for the processor inside the device, a Snapdragon 801, which originally announced back in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jAK1pH"&gt;“To get Google certification for Android 9 for Fairphone 2 just as we hit five years of support for the smartphone is a huge achievement for Fairphone,” says CEO of Fairphone Eva Gouwens. “In order to get certification, we had to pass approximately 477,000 Google tests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="824F4E"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today we’re celebrating a milestone. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fairphone?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Fairphone&lt;/a&gt; 2 gets a major software upgrade 5 years after launch. We started Fairphone with a mission to encourage smartphone longevity by disrupting the electronics industry and this signifies that commitment.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/jdpOxZKEHQ"&gt;https://t.co/jdpOxZKEHQ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/bQGbj54CEi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bQGbj54CEi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fairphone (@Fairphone) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Fairphone/status/1375048421971746818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SwZzZM"&gt;“We want to show the industry that this kind of thing is possible, that a smartphone doesn’t have to be discarded after 2-3 years, we can prolong it’s lifespan,” the CEO added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVEX66"&gt;The only other smartphone manufacturer that offers a similar length of support for its devices is Apple, which last year released iOS 14, its latest phone OS, for its 2015 iPhone 6S. Android manufacturers, while behind Apple, are improving. Samsung now offers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;four years of security updates for its recent Galaxy devices&lt;/a&gt;, while Google offers three years of updates for its Pixel phones, and OnePlus says it &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/a-notice-about-oxygenos-11-for-our-previous-devices.1351579/"&gt;plans to release Android 11 for its 2018 OnePlus 6 and 6T&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ByEc3U"&gt;The Fairphone 2’s update to Android 9 this long after release bodes well for the company’s long-term support of its more recent Fairphone 3 and 3 Plus phones. The company says the phones should be updated to Android 11 in the second half of this year, with “one more major Android upgrade” coming thereafter. Software support and spare parts availability is set to continue until 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel couldn’t wait any longer to kick off its next phase of movies and shows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O_eZp118hCR4QCxor10pEP5DlkE=/36x0:1104x712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69023439/Screen_Shot_2020_09_15_at_11.22.13_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dnCUCC"&gt;Disney is debuting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346947/black-widow-cruella-luca-disney-plus-streaming-premiere-access-marvel-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; as a Disney Plus Premier Access title&lt;/a&gt; alongside its theatrical release this summer, sacrificing one of its biggest potential summer blockbusters to its streaming service and forgoing what would almost certainly have been hundreds of millions (or even billions) of dollars at the box office in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q038dv"&gt;In a vacuum, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/21591175/black-widow-theatrical-release-streaming-disney-plus-hbo-max"&gt;Disney could have waited to release &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; until theaters were back to normal in a post-pandemic world, and reaped the box office rewards. But in many ways, the company is a victim of its own success. The ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe means that each new &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1019714/9358?subId1=VergeDisneyNewMarvelShows032521&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; show or blockbuster film relies on previous Marvel entries, and Disney just couldn’t keep delaying its next wave of superhero adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="b8b7NT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Black Widow and Cruella are now coming to Disney Plus at the same time as theaters","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346947/black-widow-cruella-luca-disney-plus-streaming-premiere-access-marvel-theaters"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bg6bej"&gt;By the time &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; hits theaters — and now, Disney Plus — on July 9th, it’ll have been over a year since its intended release date of May 1st, 2020. Some of the ripple effects of those successive delays are easy to see: each time Disney has moved &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21437889/black-widow-delayed-release-date-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-streaming-mulan"&gt;caused a cascade of delays to its other films&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings &lt;/em&gt;(originally meant for February 12th, 2021, now out September 3rd), &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt; (originally planned to hit theaters on May 7th, 2021, and currently planned for March 25th, 2022), and &lt;em&gt;Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em&gt; (moved from November 5th, 2021 to May 6th, 2022).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BI0pmK"&gt;And if the Marvel Universe was just movies, those successive delays would be fine; everything stays in the intended order, and while Disney would be out of its billions of box office revenue for an extra quarter or two, it’d bounce back once those movies started hitting packed theaters again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mIhfxgUUnX90u4zG9IO6fHB88WY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22306978/wandavision.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="omNQbL"&gt;But the company’s recent Disney Plus ambitions further complicate things. Disney can keep delaying its movies indefinitely — as, indeed, films like &lt;em&gt;No Time To Die &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;F9&lt;/em&gt; have continued to do while waiting out the pandemic. But thanks to the tangled web of storylines crossing between those blockbuster films and the streaming shows, constantly moving back release dates for one thing — like &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; — can hold up the entire slate from moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOn3S8"&gt;The strain of scheduling is already apparent.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Take&lt;em&gt; WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, which&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;kicked off the company’s Disney Plus lineup earlier this year in its original 2021 slot. (This was mainly because COVID-19-related production delays forced &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Solider &lt;/em&gt;from its fall 2020 slot.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Yul84"&gt;Under the original, pre-delay schedule, the surreal &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;would have been the second Disney Plus show (after the more traditional &lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Solider&lt;/em&gt;), and would have been followed just a few short weeks after its debut by &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt; in March, which promises to pick up Wanda’s story where the show left off. Instead, fans will have to wait over a year to find out what happens next, ruining the carefully planned synergy between streaming subscriptions and box office receipts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ODhRZ"&gt;But unlike its films, Disney can’t afford to delay its streaming shows indefinitely. The fledgling streaming service is still extremely short on high-profile, must-watch shows — &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; being the only other non-Marvel title that fits the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XJOOEI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Disney needs Disney Plus, and Disney Plus needs Marvel shows&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XP67My"&gt;Shows like &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; are crucial to keeping subscribers paying for Disney Plus month after month, and Disney Plus’ continued growth in revenue is crucial to Disney’s future. As CEO Bob Chapek commented earlier this year, Disney’s “direct-to-consumer business is the company’s top priority, and our robust pipeline of content will continue to fuel its growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Avengers: Age of Ultron promotional stills (MARVEL/DISNEY)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p_9DRE-V6xTww9WyERzuihAOamY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3629872/Avengers255353118812fc-2040.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="odNSlE"&gt;The interconnectedness that has long been one of Marvel’s biggest strengths (best exemplified by its famous post-credit scenes and its incredibly popular crossover films) is conversely one of its biggest weaknesses here. Characters introduced in &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; are supposed to be in the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye &lt;/em&gt;series, for example, which is planned for later in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnSJGO"&gt;If Disney delays &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, it has to delay &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;, lest it spoil surprises or confuse viewers. Delay &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; too much (as has happened multiple times already) and the company has to move all its other films — like &lt;em&gt;Shang Chi;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Eternals;&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Thor&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; sequels. The tie-in effects then continue to cascade; delay &lt;em&gt;Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em&gt; too much, and you have to delay &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&lt;/em&gt;, which in turn delays that franchise’s holiday special for Disney Plus, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85iAoH"&gt;In a perfect world, Disney would want to wait for theaters to release &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;. But right now the company needs the long-term Disney Plus growth much more than a short-term windfall from one summer blockbuster. And to achieve that growth, it needs a steady drip of marquee content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V5Y4eR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Either way, Disney wins&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AcWqdq"&gt;The move isn’t a total loss for Disney, though. Moving &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; helps to keep the Disney Plus machine going and keeps the theatrical schedule on track for the fall when theaters can hopefully reopen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTwUEB"&gt;But the short-term loss could reap bigger gains for Disney down the line: if you want to watch &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; this summer, you have two options. You can go and buy expensive movie tickets in person, in which case Disney’s box office goals will be that much closer to succeeding. Or you either pony up for Disney Plus and a $30 fee on top, juicing subscriber numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dd4opU"&gt;And who knows — while you’re there, you might stick around to watch &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;, or other Marvel films. At which point you might as well just keep your subscription active for &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt; that fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aKqogr"&gt;Either way, Disney wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uB7OrZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="kFBmGr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 25th, 2021 7:31AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Target has the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-console%2F-%2FA-81114596%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=PS5Restock03252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console%2F-%2FA-81114595%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=PS5Restock03252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; available for purchase starting at $399.99. It is important to note that Target only has the console available at select locations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="J7uq4A"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony’s PlayStation 5 is available at Target","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22346479/sony-ps5-restock-target"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KMrzmx"&gt;The PlayStation 5 has been quite challenging to find ever since its launch in November. And when it is available, sales have been, for the most part, limited to online-only, with stock selling out almost instantly. Despite this, we here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; are dedicated to helping you keep track of when and where the PS5 is available in the hopes you can get another shot at buying Sony’s next-gen console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qD3Drq"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy either the PS5 (with a disc drive) or the PS5 Digital Edition, as well as any bundles that are not price surged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAoRYi"&gt;Keep in mind that due to the high demand of this console, supply will not last long, with inventory selling out typically less than an hour after being made available. Nevertheless, we’ll do our best to keep this article updated with the latest in-stock alerts and tell you when the most recent restock was available at the retailers selling the console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ca5R3n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"},{"title":"How the PS5’s DualSense controller makes games like Fortnite and NBA 2K21 better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Spcnqk"&gt;Where can I buy a PS5 right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JG5DCV"&gt;Due to the pandemic, most retailers, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734517183541536443#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-console%2F-%2FA-81114596&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, will only sell the console online until further notice. We see restocks happening multiple times in the week from various retailers; most notably, we have seen frequent restocks recently appear at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053639217049019#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5%2F11108140.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console%2F-%2FA-81114595&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Console%2F363472942&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in particular. If you are looking for a bundle, retailers like Antonline and Newegg are likely to sell PS5 bundles instead of the actual console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjSIu6"&gt;We have noticed that restocks for the console are more likely to happen later in the week as opposed to earlier in the week. Additionally, places like Newegg are combatting the demand for this console by doing a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fproduct-shuffle%3Fnm_mc%3DAFC-RAN-COM%26cm_mmc%3DAFC-RAN-COM%26utm_medium%3Daffiliates%26utm_source%3Dafc-Vox%2BMedia%26AFFID%3D3430747%26AFFNAME%3DVox%2BMedia%26ACRID%3D1%26ASUBID%3Dverge%26ASID%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.theverge.com%252F%26ranMID%3D44583%26ranEAID%3D3430747%26ranSiteID%3DnOD_rLJHOac-XXgkPukHSHvtb9QuMXSZWQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg Shuffle&lt;/a&gt;, which randomly selects winners interested in buying sought-after products. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every PS5 comes with one DualSense controller, but you can use the DualShock 4 controller, but it is only limited to when you’re playing PS4 games on the next-gen console. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o3N05Q"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the PS5?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i98dsO"&gt;The PS5 includes all the basic things you need to get started (minus the games, of course). However, you might want to consider picking up additional accessories to ensure you get the most out of your brand-new console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UsvWd"&gt;First, there’s the controller. Every new PS5 includes one &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DualSense-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC6C75Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DualSense&lt;/a&gt; controller. But there are a few benefits to owning at least one additional controller, such as if you plan to play local co-op games with a friend or family member. Or, if you are like me and want to keep playing your game but don’t want to be tethered to the charging cable, a second control lets you continue playing while the other one charges. Normally, $70, we have &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/sony-sony-ps5-dual-sense-white-sony-dual-sense-wireless" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;seen the controller go down as low as $60&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MF1y0f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PwJaY2"&gt;The PS5 HD Camera is a neat accessory for people interested in using their PS5 to live-stream video games or broadcast their gameplay with friends.  It includes dual 1080p lenses and allows you to remove the background of your camera’s feed and replace it with something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XqsPQY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562900"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YyqMlw"&gt;I strongly recommend subscribing to &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt; if you have not already done so; outside of taking advantage of some online gaming functionalities, PlayStation Plus provides a ton of additional incentives, most notably PS5 owners have access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a digital library of some of the most impactful titles to release on the PS4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SPQIiW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vVuP0t"&gt;The PS5 comes with a 825GB of available storage right now and unfortunately, there’s no way to expand the fast internal storage currently. Sony is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;reportedly expanding the options for more SSD storage&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to store some older PS4 titles on your console so you don’t use your limited SSD storage, I strongly advise &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Playstation-Portable-External-STGD4000400/dp/B076826S5R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buying an external hard drive&lt;/a&gt; to store those titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8ULn9w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562978"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia might get touchscreen controls on Android soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1jHsJhECTQBtSwME4nEpo7CAino=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69023314/akrales_191113_3779_0248.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WxE34x"&gt;Google appears to be testing touchscreen controls for Stadia on Android. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/24/stadia-3-9-touchscreen-gameplay-player-notes-android-tv/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; has analyzed&lt;/a&gt; the latest Stadia release on Android, and found multiple references to a “direct touch” feature. Once enabled, direct touch will allow Stadia users to tap, swipe, and pinch elements in games, or continue to use a Bluetooth or USB controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGfLv3"&gt;It’s not yet clear which games will support direct touch, although Stadia currently has very limited support for touchscreen controls in games like &lt;em&gt;Monopoly &lt;/em&gt;that allow users to toggle a touch mode on. This new direct touch feature has only been discovered in the Android version of Stadia, but hopefully it makes its way to the web version for iOS, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="F46RvE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A Stadia app for Android TV might also be on the way&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rv7VQp"&gt;Google hasn’t officially detailed direct touch for Stadia, so we don’t yet know how touch controls will be supported. Microsoft’s xCloud game streaming service has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528377/microsoft-xbox-touch-controls-xcloud-game-streaming-features"&gt;implemented a variety of touch controls&lt;/a&gt; across more than 20 games, allowing Xbox players to enjoy games without a controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JitD6i"&gt;Google also appears to be readying Android TV support for Stadia. &lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;notes that there are explicit references to Android TV in this latest Stadia app update. Stadia launched on Chromecast Ultra devices, but support for Android TV has been missing since Stadia’s debut more than a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s PlayStation 5 is available at Target</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yOq0pX7xIm-o6CeaGzxkgpn9lQo=/160x0:1881x1147/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69023300/vpavic_4261_20201023_0018.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ivqFA7"&gt;If you have been keeping up with PS5 news, you will know that it is nearly impossible to find this console right now because of the short supply and mostly online-only sales. If you want another shot at trying to buy Sony’s next-gen console, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-console%2F-%2FA-81114596%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=PS5Restock03252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;$400 all-digital edition&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console%2F-%2FA-81114595%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=PS5Restock03252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;$500 PS5 console&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a disc drive right now at Target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQ8ICJ"&gt;It is important to note that Target only has the console available at select locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9jxWc9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="igu8hA"&gt;If you are one of the lucky ones to secure your unit in the latest restocks, I have a few suggestions on some additional items you may want to buy. You’ll likely want to buy some games for your new console. The PS5 is home to some of the most popular titles right now, such as 2020 remake of &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fdemons-souls%2F11108202.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as some other fun games like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marvels-Spider-Man-Miles-Morales-Launch-PlayStation/dp/B08FC66ZV4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08FS5HKTR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q9bLmP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10325914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yurQ39"&gt;Some games require an online subscription to play, so &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a subscription to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt; is a good purchase. But you’re not just paying to play most games (excluding free-to-play titles) online, as PS5 users with an active PS Plus subscription also have access to a digital library of PS4 classics thanks to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sPmYRp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lVN6DU"&gt;If you are looking to buy a new TV that will take advantage of the next-gen hardware, Best Buy has a deal on a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735709730352278220#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch 4K OLED on sale for $1,500&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZgHLjV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733767"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The UK’s new £50 note celebrates Alan Turing with lots of geeky Easter eggs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pFjxO7HtpygnJvcHjILVIoDTWpo=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69023270/1200x800_New50.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bank of England&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rvdHox"&gt;The Bank of England has &lt;a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2021/march/the-new-50-note-unveiled"&gt;revealed the design&lt;/a&gt; for the UK’s new £50 note featuring computer scientist and codebreaker Alan Turing. Turing was selected to appear on the note in July 2019 in recognition of his groundbreaking work in mathematics and computer science, as well as his role in cracking the Enigma code used by Germany in World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZtMr6"&gt;The polymer note will enter circulation from June 23 this year, and incorporates a &lt;a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/polymer-50-pound-note"&gt;number of designs&lt;/a&gt; linked to Turing’s life and legacy. These include technical drawings for the bombe, a decryption device used during WWII; a string of ticker tape with Turing’s birthday rendered in binary (23 June 1912); a green and gold security foil resembling a microchip; and a table and mathematical formulae taken from one of Turing’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing%27s_proof"&gt;most famous papers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EWWKel"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Turing was prosecuted by the UK government in 1952 for ‘gross indecency’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eFpOP9"&gt;As well as honoring his scientific achievements, Turing was also selected to appear on the bank note in recognition of his persecution by the UK government for homosexuality. Turing was openly gay among friends, but in 1952 was arrested and charged with “gross indecency” for homosexual acts, which were illegal in England and Wales until 1967. Despite changes to the law, prosecution of same-sex acts &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/23/fifty-years-gay-liberation-uk-barely-four-1967-act"&gt;continued in the UK&lt;/a&gt; for decades afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjvHL3"&gt;Turing did not deny the charges and was convicted and sentenced to chemical castration. He &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130120024901/http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/yours-in-distress-alan.html"&gt;wrote in a letter&lt;/a&gt; before he was charged: “No doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I’ve not found out.” He died two years later at the age of 41 after eating an apple laced with cyanide. Historians still &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18561092"&gt;disagree&lt;/a&gt; over whether this was suicide or a case of accidental poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turing’s birthday (23 June 1912) is rendered in binary on ticker tape, a format Turing thought could be used to enter data into machines. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The table and mathematical formulae come from Turing’s seminal 1936 paper “On Computable Numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem,” which introduced the concept of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turing Machine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.  &lt;/em&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Turing’s signature is taken from the visitor’s book at Bletchley Park, and the quote from an interview given to &lt;/em&gt;The Times&lt;em&gt; on 11 June 1949: “This is only a foretaste of what is to come, and only the shadow of what is going to be.”&lt;/em&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The note’s traditional security foil has been altered to resemble the design of a microchip, while the spiral sunflower patterns pay homage to Turing’s work in morphogenetics. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rear of the note features standard elements for UK bank notes, including a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ndiUcM"&gt;Turing and tens of thousands of other men convicted of the same offenses were &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing_law#:~:text=The%20%22Alan%20Turing%20law%22%20is,legislation%20that%20outlawed%20homosexual%20acts.&amp;amp;text=Turing%20received%20a%20royal%20pardon%20(posthumously)%20in%202013."&gt;posthumously pardoned&lt;/a&gt; from 2017 following a 10-year campaign led by former MP John Leech. Leech &lt;a href="https://aboutmanchester.co.uk/turing-on-50-note-will-be-painful-reminder-of-what-we-lost/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the treatment of Turing was a “national embarrassment and an example of society at its absolute worst,” and that selecting him to appear on the £50 note would at least bring his life and works to public attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2aclU"&gt;“It is almost impossible to put into words the difference that Alan Turing made to society, but perhaps the most poignant example is that his work is estimated to have shortened the war by four years and saved 21 million lives,” said Leech in 2018. “Placing Turing on the £50 note would at least go some way to acknowledging his unprecedented contribution to society and science. But more importantly it will serve as a stark and frankly painful reminder of what we lost in Turing and what we will lose again if we ever allow that kind of hateful ideology to win.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWPoQ1"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BBCBreakfast/status/1374977788244017153"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Turing’s nephew Sir Dermot Turing said that there was still much work to be done to truly honor Turing’s legacy. “I think Alan Turing would have wanted us to think about things like under-representation of women in science subjects; under-representation of Black and ethnic minority kids in STEM subjects in school, and why they’re not being given the opportunities they should have and why that’s bad for all of us.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bang &amp; Olufsen’s new HX headphones offer 35 hours of battery life for $499 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SpmpTHMNPP7QBdCxwJVbmVZWVy8=/0x189:6000x4189/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69022993/Beoplay_HX_0012.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Beoplay HX headphones. | Image: Bang and Olufsen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D8b4Zo"&gt;Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen’s latest pair of headphones are the Beoplay HX. They’re over-ear, noise canceling, and offer up to a truly impressive 35 hours of battery life. The headphones launch in black today for $499 (£499 / €499), but there’s a white model coming at the end of April, to be followed by a white and brown version in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MckmT7"&gt;At $499, the Beoplay HX are among the more expensive wireless noise-canceling headphones available. But this isn’t unfamiliar territory for Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen: the previous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/3/14495606/beoplay-h9-review-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;Beoplay H9 headphones&lt;/a&gt; cost exactly the same — and this is the company that also sells &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21409031/bang-olufsen-beoplay-h95-noise-canceling-headphones-announced"&gt;an $800 pair of Bluetooth headphones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lhweyn"&gt;Thirty-five hours of battery life beats pretty much all competitors (and it rises up to 40 hours if you turn ANC off). The $549 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; are rated at just 20 hours with ANC on, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;our top pick&lt;/a&gt; $350 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; can go for up to 30 hours. Others, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; or Shure Aonic are rated for 16 hours and 20 hours, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ng-anZSrTJGGJ3kBH8VPFjEe4DI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394441/Beoplay_HX_0060.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang and Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A white and brown model is following in May.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0SV5Uq"&gt;Beyond battery life, the other thing your $499 gets you is build quality. The Beoplay HX’s ear cushions are made from lambskin with a memory foam interior, while the headband uses cow hide and knitted fabric in its construction. The ear cups themselves feature an aluminum disc surrounded by a recycled plastic housing, and the arm sliders are also aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WG5IHz"&gt;The rest of the Beoplay HX specs are typical. There’s a USB-C port for charging, a 3.5mm jack for wired connections, buttons on the left and right ear cup, and also touch controls on just the right side. The headphones support Bluetooth 5.1, and for codecs, you get aptX Adaptive, AAC, and SBC. Google Fast Pair and Microsoft Swift Pair are both included for easy pairing with their respective platforms. And yes, the headphones come with a 3.5mm cable in the box, unlike the AirPods Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sYBu5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Justice Department is worried about an anime monopoly after the Sony deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="attack-on-titan-season-2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kj1Ybz9KgcUWApx0vqabMpB3ZuU=/75x0:779x469/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69022099/titan.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gVwHXi"&gt;Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166585/sony-buy-anime-streaming-service-crunchyroll-at-t-funimation"&gt;plan to combine Crunchyroll and Funimation&lt;/a&gt; into a streaming service to lead its anime empire seemed as simple as tossing AT&amp;amp;T a billion dollars. But now the plan is reportedly concerning enough that the US Department of Justice is extending its antitrust review of the $1.175 billion purchase into a full-on probe, according to three sources who &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/sonys-hopes-of-countering-netflix-in-anime-market-delayed-by-antitrust-probe?utm_campaign=%5Brtsu%5D+Automated+RTS&amp;amp;utm_content=1003171&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=cio&amp;amp;utm_term=1000266"&gt;spoke to&lt;em&gt; The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zlm2Tp"&gt;The DOJ is focused on whether the deal limits the options of Japanese studios looking to license shows in the US, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s sources. “WarnerMedia and Sony have told the Justice Department that Crunchyroll and Sony’s budding anime empire are just two of many options anime creators have to distribute their shows outside Japan,” &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;writes, but even if direct competition isn’t a concern, there could be other reasons to worry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVVRKn"&gt;Controlling both Funimation and Crunchyroll means one thing in the context of anime streaming services in the US, but taken with all the other things Crunchyroll does, like manga publishing and anime conventions, and the international anime companies Sony already purchased &lt;a href="https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2019/0924/sonypicturestelevisionandaniplexannounceglobalanimestreamingmerger"&gt;in Australia and France&lt;/a&gt;, the company could have a huge amount of &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/9/21547657/sonys-funimation-acquires-crunchyroll-deal-price-watching-anime"&gt;control over the entire industry&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QUy22"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/23/21003549/anime-streaming-wars-netflix-amazon-att-sony-crunchyroll-funimation"&gt;As we wrote in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Funimation and Crunchyroll were already two of the biggest streaming anime services outside of Japan, while big players like Amazon, Netflix and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250936/hbo-max-crunchyroll-anime-netflix-amazon-funimation-fullmetal-alchemist-death-note-kill-la-kill"&gt;even the newer HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; have been beefing up their offerings with anime too. If the DOJ doesn’t block Sony’s deal and it manages to merge Crunchyroll and Funimation, Sony could very easily become the anime streaming provider to beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0Yn43"&gt;Sony, AT&amp;amp;T, and the DOJ didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgVmHC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This website that generates Beeple-esque NFTs is also an NFT and my brain is eating itself</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tuNBtUZyJChz0rCHJhSpA-3PpfI=/66x0:1259x795/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69021956/beeple6.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: BeepleGenerator&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w6gV6D"&gt;Beeple has been one of the biggest names in NFTs, likely because some of his artwork &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;has sold for truckloads of money&lt;/a&gt;. So it was really only a matter of time before someone came along with a tool that lets you create Beeple-like artwork without having to download and pose assets yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHRtZB"&gt;(NFT? WTF? If you’re lost, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwijpvrZmcrvAhUHXc0KHXs2CMsQFjAIegQIAxAD&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22310188%2Fnft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1jHPo02FamNhswM46xtCe1"&gt;here’s our NFT guide&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koBl1y"&gt;Enter BeepleGenerator.com a site that does... well, exactly what its name implies. Here’s a look at some of the... art it generated, along with some genuine Beeples for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1JE4TF"&gt;Could you sell the generated pictures as NFTs? Well... I don’t think there’s anything stopping you from listing them. But that’s thinking small — the real big brain play is to buy the site as an NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q54Lbw"&gt;Oh, yeah, did I forget to mention that the site itself is for sale as an NFT? The person who currently owns it didn’t actually make it, they bought it on NFT site Zora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4D55RJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;i purchased &lt;a href="https://t.co/b6xjXGb4LW"&gt;https://t.co/b6xjXGb4LW&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strugggggs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@strugggggs&lt;/a&gt; for 69 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FWB&amp;amp;src=ctag&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;$FWB&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ourZORA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ourZORA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i did not create it, you can bid on it here:&lt;a href="https://t.co/FfdRSwpCv1"&gt;https://t.co/FfdRSwpCv1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— chris martz   (@chrismartz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrismartz/status/1374785862064500737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NKNF8Q"&gt;The obvious question, besides “why” and “I want to move to a cabin in the woods” (not a question, by the way) is “what does Beeple think of this?” The answer will probably not be surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mGvGjT"&gt;
