    <title>CVS Pharmacy’s Spoken Rx prescription labels are now available at all locations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Up45ew"&gt;CVS Pharmacy is expanding its Spoken Rx audio prescription labels to be available in all its pharmacies, after a trial run last year. The feature, developed as part of a collaboration with the American Council of the Blind, is part of the CVS Pharmacy mobile app and can read prescription information — like dosage and directions — aloud in English or Spanish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4xNpa"&gt;To use the spoken labels, CVS Pharmacy patients register for a CVS account, download the smartphone app, and enroll in Spoken Rx. The patient’s future prescription labels will then be tagged with an RFID label. The enrollment process can be done over the phone or in person at a CVS pharmacy. When the patient holds the prescription bottle four inches from their smartphone, the app scans the prescription bottle’s RFID label and reads out the information. CVS also has options for Braille and large-print labels on prescription bottles available as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1f4P8t9KLeVqwVInUgoeS0JYTIY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055428/spoken_rx_cvs.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CVS&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The CVS Pharmacy app includes Spoken Rx, which lets users hear their prescription labels read aloud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tJuogY"&gt;Matt Blanchette, manager of retail communications for CVS Pharmacy said for those who don’t have a smartphone, CVS can provide a separate, standalone speaker device on request, at no cost to the patient. The Spoken Rx app only reads prescription labels from CVS Pharmacy, and Blanchette said there are no plans to expand the feature to include labels from other pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQ6619"&gt;Eric Bridges, executive director of the American Council of the Blind, called the feature a positive step. “Spoken Rx allows for a greater level of privacy, safety and independence for blind and visually impaired customers,” Bridges said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncNtOS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit is adding new real-time features, including a live upvote count</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6CdqdUqnnAkKEYafS_Sk3N6A8WE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70214806/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wsgsdk"&gt;Reddit is introducing some big changes on Wednesday by adding new real-time features. Perhaps the biggest update is that the number of upvotes, downvotes, and comments will go up or down as they happen. That could give you a more accurate idea of the popularity of a post as you’re reading it, but I could also see people hitting an upvote or downvote in response to seeing others do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zt9G1r"&gt;Another change is that Reddit will show the number of people reading a post when there are five or more people looking at it. Reddit won’t just show who’s reading, though; it’s also introducing a typing indicator that will pop up when two or more users are typing a comment. And when new top-level comments come in, Reddit will show a new pill-shaped notification. When you tap that notification, the comments on a post will be sorted by new so you can view what’s been added most recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDoLIO"&gt;You can get an idea of how the new features work in this GIF:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oq5hW7l85SwXFoxetlBvorLMvNY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053930/ezgif_6_f30ba41cd9a7.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U0tcRt"&gt;The new features are rolling out globally across desktop and mobile starting Wednesday, but they’ll only be available on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17190244/reddit-redesign-begins-rolling-out"&gt;newer Reddit design&lt;/a&gt;. If you use old Reddit, you won’t have access to them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams Essentials is a new standalone version for small businesses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qcquKedxBh5iHw4lPeR93odYWQc=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70214812/Create_group_from_templates__2_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bH1YzQ"&gt;Microsoft is creating its first standalone version of Microsoft Teams for small businesses. Microsoft Teams Essentials will be priced at $4 per user per month and provide access to the core meeting features of Teams without the typical Office app bundling that requires a more expensive Microsoft 365 plan. This standalone version makes Teams even more of a Zoom competitor, as Microsoft is dropping its Slack-like channels functionality in favor of a more simplified chat interface and a focus on meetings and video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXj353"&gt;“It’s the first standalone offering of Microsoft Teams designed specifically with small businesses in mind,” explains Jared Spataro, head of Microsoft 365. “It brings together features small businesses need to serve customers, including unlimited group video calls for up to 30 hours, group chat, file sharing and calendaring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6dz3Q"&gt;Microsoft Teams Essentials fills the gap for smaller businesses that has existed since Teams launched nearly five years ago. Until now, small businesses have had to choose the Microsoft 365 Business Basic plan — priced at $5 per user per month and increasing to $6 in March — or rivals like Zoom, Slack, Google Workspace, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aScVauq6HfLtRHuAS-ytQU0oY_8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055107/Create_group_from_templates__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Teams Essentials has all the regular Teams calling features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uYueGK"&gt;The differences between Microsoft Teams Essentials and Microsoft 365 Business Basic plans are primarily around Teams functionality and cloud storage. Essentials only offers 10GB of OneDrive storage, compared to the 1TB available on Business Basic. Essentials also lacks meeting recording and transcripts functionality, real-time translation, breakout rooms, and whiteboard integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UlnZcB"&gt;Microsoft Teams Essentials also drops the teams and channels functionality of Teams, so it’s more targeted at businesses that rely on apps like Teams or Zoom for video calling and meetings. Private and group chat will still work in Microsoft Teams Essentials, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="riPdVT"&gt;Microsoft is targeting smaller businesses that have relied on Zoom throughout the pandemic here. Zoom is a competitor that the software maker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186918/microsoft-teams-zoom-video-leaked-video-competition-sellers-partner-network"&gt;identified as an “emerging threat” last year&lt;/a&gt;, and offering a standalone version of Teams feels like a big step in competing with Zoom and even Google’s Workspace push.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNW2rJ"&gt;“The pandemic and acceleration of using video calling and virtual tools changed overnight,” explains Nicole Herskowitz, general manager for Microsoft Teams, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We’re seeing at this point in time a lot of small businesses saying ‘What’s my future model?’ They’re almost doing a broader rethink, and many of them kind of raced to pick up tools very quickly to just stay afloat, and now they’re looking at their long-term strategy to engaging better with customers, with employees.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qoMDkSi0UgqpdF_RJhDhQfEr38g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055108/Create_group_from_templates__4_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Teams Essentials will soon include Google Calendar integration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iTUVjF"&gt;Microsoft clearly sees an opportunity to pick up small businesses that are trying to balance a number of tools that don’t always work well together. If you’re part of a small business right now, you might use Zoom for video calls, Slack for group chat, and then Google Workspace for email and calendar. Google has been centralizing its chat and communications apps into Gmail throughout the pandemic and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532559/google-workspace-chat-officially-available-consumer-gmail-spaces"&gt;opening Google Workspace up for everyone to use&lt;/a&gt;. Slack has app integrations that try to make these separate apps more seamless to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRCHB2"&gt;Nobody has the perfect solution, and Microsoft Teams Essentials lacks the app extensibility to really bring all these separate small business solutions together. Microsoft is including Google Calendar integration into Teams Essentials soon, though, which is an important step in making Teams truly standalone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFWtVc"&gt;If you’re a small business weighing the cost of Zoom, Google Workspace, Slack, and other tools, Microsoft Teams Essentials could look appealing at just $4 per user per month, especially when a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fpricing&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F1%2F22811605%2Fmicrosoft-teams-essentials-price-features-availability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom Pro license&lt;/a&gt; is $14.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L29V6Q"&gt;Microsoft Teams Essentials is &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-teams%2Fcompare-microsoft-teams-options" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available today direct from Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; or through its regular partners and resellers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden administration issues new framework for space policy, with a focus on climate change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Af8IFEwCuCkJxz7GFdvKLb5R7TQ=/0x0:5942x3961/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70214829/51665396090_7572c74948_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice President Kamala Harris speaking at an event at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center on November 5th, 2021&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA/Taylor Mickal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nASDCZ"&gt;Today, Vice President Kamala Harris’ office released a new framework for US space policy, detailing how the Biden administration plans to approach commercial, civil, and military space activity moving forward. &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/United-States-Space-Priorities-Framework-_-December-1-2021.pdf"&gt;Called the United States Space Priorities Framework&lt;/a&gt;, the document keeps many of the same space priorities from the previous administration but adds a new emphasis on using space to help combat climate change and investing in STEM education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEXw4D"&gt;The new framework comes ahead of today’s National Space Council meeting, the first one to be held under the Biden administration. Harris, who chairs the National Space Council, will convene the policy advisory group at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington, DC, at 1:30PM ET today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BobH2t"&gt;The National Space Council is a relic of the George H. W. Bush administration, created by executive order in 1989 with the Vice President at the helm. Made up of executive cabinet members, the NASA administrator, and leaders in the space industry, the council’s goal is to advise on how to set the space agenda and come up with new solutions for addressing current space issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qegAFk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the Biden administration is carrying forward many of the priorities set by the Trump administration&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gssk1d"&gt;The original Space Council was dissolved in 1993, but it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/30/15903230/national-space-council-executive-order-mike-pence-nasa-policy"&gt;resurrected under the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; and helmed by then-Vice President Mike Pence. During Trump’s presidency, the National Space Council met a total of eight times during live-streamed events in which members shared new concerns and problems that needed to be addressed regarding space. Topics of discussion included: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/23/17035436/national-space-council-regulatory-reform-industry-mike-pence"&gt;refining launch and licensing regulations&lt;/a&gt; for space companies launching rockets and satellites; ways to maintain US leadership and competitiveness in space; strengthening cybersecurity in space; and leveraging lunar resources. These often resulted in a number of Space Policy Directives that Trump would sign throughout his tenure. NASA’s former administrator, Jim Bridenstine, would also give updates on many of NASA’s biggest spaceflight missions, such as the space agency’s Artemis program — aimed at sending the first woman and first person of color to the surface of the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32ugrJ"&gt;When it comes to space, the Biden administration is carrying forward many of the priorities set by the Trump administration. Notably, NASA’s ambitious Artemis program, which was solidified under Trump, is still a major focus under Biden. And plenty of the topics discussed under Pence’s Space Council are included in the new framework released by Harris. A few of the key points include maintaining US leadership in space by sending humans back to the Moon and exploring the Solar System with robotic spacecraft, fostering a competitive, regulatory environment for space companies, and defending against security threats in space while strengthening our space assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="na2ZrV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;a renewed focus on using space in the fight against climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8eu4C"&gt;In the biggest break from the previous administration, there looks to be a renewed focus on using space in the fight against climate change. In the new framework, the administration pledges to invest in satellites that can observe Earth from space, helping scientists better understand our changing climate. “Open dissemination of Earth observation data will support both domestic and international efforts to address the climate crisis,” the document states. To further drive home this new emphasis on climate research from space, President Biden plans to sign a new Executive Order today that will add five new members to the National Space Council, including the Secretaries of Education, Labor, Agriculture, and the Interior, but also notably the National Climate Advisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIedG2"&gt;The Trump administration, famous for downplaying the urgency of climate change, wasn’t very interested in using space for climate science initiatives, and President Trump’s budget request &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/11/18259747/nasa-trump-budget-request-fy-2020-sls-block-1b-europa"&gt;often tried to cancel various Earth science missions at NASA&lt;/a&gt;. Those efforts were mostly unsuccessful, though. Considering that the Biden administration has made tackling climate change one of its top priorities, it’s not surprising that a focus on climate research has been added to the space agenda as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6IjoG"&gt;Additionally, the Harris framework calls on investing in the next generation through various STEM initiatives. Trump’s budget requests also frequently —and unsuccessfully — tried to get rid of NASA’s Office of Stem Engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fvQlB"&gt;The framework is light on details overall, but there are a few specific objectives. For one, it calls for the creation of an open data platform within a US civil agency for hosting space traffic management data to help better understand where satellites are in space. It’s an idea that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/19/17475940/trump-space-council-traffic-control-system-junk"&gt;space industry leaders have brought up before&lt;/a&gt;. The Biden administration is also pledging to increase US efforts to combat space debris, which poses a growing threat to satellites. Notably, this pledge comes just two weeks after Russia blew up one of its own satellites in orbit, creating at least 1,700 pieces of trackable debris that posed a threat to the International Space Station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGqejM"&gt;Otherwise, it’s not particularly clear how the Biden administration plans to achieve all of its goals. But it’s possible there will be more granular discussion during the meeting, which is set to last until 3PM ET. A couple previous Space Council meetings also had some notable theatrics. Pence made a big splash during the administration’s fifth meeting when he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282598/nasa-mike-pence-vice-president-space-policy-lunar-landings-2024-gateway-sls-orion"&gt;very publicly challenged NASA to land humans on the Moon as soon as 2024&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, President Trump made a surprise appearance at one meeting and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/18/17475466/trump-space-force-announcement-national-space-council"&gt;called on the Department of Defense to establish the Space Force&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll find out soon if anything of that nature is in store this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Match Group will pay Tinder’s co-founders $441 million over valuation lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bs94yVslZUB3p8K34Nwc36ly81s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70214786/acastro_180822_1777_tinder_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cJCY9E"&gt;Match Group will pay Tinder’s co-founders and original team $441 million to &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000891103/000089110321000093/mtch-20211201.htm"&gt;settle&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/22/17765684/tinder-match-group-lawsuit-sexual-harassment"&gt;years-long lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; over allegations that Match Group purposely undervalued the startup in an effort to avoid paying out billions of dollars in equity. The settlement comes a few weeks after the trial began in the New York Supreme Court, which has included testimony from the plaintiffs, including Tinder co-founder and former CEO Sean Rad, and the defense, including IAC chairman and founder Barry Diller. (IAC owned Match Group up until last year when it &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iac-and-match-group-complete-full-separation-301086627.html"&gt;spun out&lt;/a&gt; into its company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RTSRO"&gt;The plaintiffs were originally seeking a $2 billion payout. They first filed the lawsuit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/14/17688706/tinder-match-group-law-suit-2-billion"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, a year after Match Group merged Tinder into its dating app portfolio, resulting in the plaintiffs receiving Match stock instead of Tinder stock, which they had hoped and planned to receive. Both the plaintiffs’ legal team and Match Group had no further comment on the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Km8lCW"&gt;The trial has been a messy one — four plaintiffs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/31/17805622/tinder-match-group-iac-lawsuit-plaintiffs-withdraw"&gt;dropped out&lt;/a&gt; after realizing they were under an arbitration agreement, and much of the case initially revolved around an allegation of sexual assault. Tinder’s former VP of marketing and communications, Rosette Pambakian, alleged former Tinder and Match Group CEO Greg Blatt sexually assaulted her at a company holiday party. Blatt has since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/3/20897193/tinder-lawsuit-greg-blatt-rosette-pambakian-sean-rad-match-group"&gt;sued her and Rad for defamation&lt;/a&gt;. That lawsuit is ongoing. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lg3d3V"&gt;Shortly after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;Google rolled out the Android 12 update&lt;/a&gt; in October, users started noticing that they’re unable to use any of the apps in the Amazon Appstore, as reported by &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/30/amazon-appstore-is-broken-on-android-12/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Reports of the issue cropped up on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D56Q000087E2wvSAC/amazon-appstore-not-working-after-android-12-update"&gt;Amazon forum&lt;/a&gt; over a month ago, and there’s no timeline for a possible fix (via &lt;a href="https://liliputing.com/2021/11/android-12-launched-a-month-ago-and-amazon-appstore-still-wont-run-on-it.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liliputing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HP9zpX"&gt;“We are aware and working to resolve an issue impacting&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;app performance and launches for the small number of Amazon Appstore users that have upgraded to Android 12 on their mobile devices,” Amazon spokesperson Troy Edwards told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This issue does not impact Amazon Fire Tablets or Fire TV devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdfI7B"&gt;One user, Lovingboth, describes their experience with the issue in the thread on &lt;a href="https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D56Q000087E2wvSAC/amazon-appstore-not-working-after-android-12-update"&gt;Amazon’s forum&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NAMbmR"&gt;My rain radar app from the Amazon Appstore is still happily running and giving me alerts via notifications, but I can’t actually see them because it is being prevented from running full screen by the Amazon Appstore’s failure to run properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Mvh230"&gt;Additionally, some users say no apps appear when they open the Amazon Appstore, while others cite receiving prompts to update their apps when no update is needed. An Amazon staff member also responded to complaints in the forum, noting that the “technical team is still investigating the issue,” but doesn’t offer much of an explanation of what went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SaBTLe"&gt;As pointed out by &lt;em&gt;Liliputing&lt;/em&gt;, the issue may stem from a lack of compatibility between Amazon’s built-in DRM and Android 12. One user on the Amazon forum, Eduardo S, highlights a workaround that points to DRM as the root of the issue. He notes that — for the technologically savvy — you can try downloading an app’s APK on another device that has an older version of Android. From there, you can decompile the app’s code, comment out lines referring to the DRM, repackage it with a self-signed certificate, and then install the APK on your Android 12 device. Easy, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLMOuv"&gt;While the issue may be affecting only a “small” number of users now, that number will only continue to grow. Google first launched Android 12 on just Pixel devices, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782772/samsung-one-ui-4-android-12-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-release-date-features"&gt;Galaxy S21 users&lt;/a&gt; also received the update in mid-November. Samsung is planning to bring the update to more of its phones in the future and so are other device manufacturers, further complicating things for Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sxzyS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UskVv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wbJgnf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s new always-on smartphone camera is a privacy nightmare</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lACklgffxG8nz2hmhVQIaneWy-g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70214589/akrales_190819_3594_0298.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The front-facing camera on a Samsung smartphone. Next year’s Qualcomm processor will allow these cameras to always scan for your face, even when you’re not using the phone.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CytRJa"&gt;“Your phone’s front camera is always securely looking for your face, even if you don’t touch it or raise to wake it.” That’s how Qualcomm Technologies vice president of product management Judd Heape &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3H6tfcZLHfg?t=10758"&gt;introduced the company’s new always-on camera capabilities&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22809687/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-chip-smartphone-processor-specs-details"&gt;Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor&lt;/a&gt; set to arrive in top-shelf Android phones early next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nmar7"&gt;Depending on who you are, that statement can either be exciting or terrifying. For Qualcomm, it thinks this new feature will enable new use cases, like being able to wake and unlock your phone without having to pick it up or have it instantly lock when it no longer sees your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzXm3P"&gt;But for those of us with any sense of how modern technology is used to violate our privacy, a camera on our phone that’s always recording images &lt;em&gt;even when we’re not using it&lt;/em&gt; sounds like the stuff of nightmares and has a cost to our privacy that far outweighs any potential convenience benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="TBcjBh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A camera that records your image even when you’re not using it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eyu2fQ"&gt;Qualcomm’s main pitch for this feature is for unlocking your phone any time you glance at it, even if it’s just sitting on a table or propped up on a stand. You don’t need to pick it up or tap the screen or say a voice command — it just unlocks when it sees your face. I can see this being useful if your hands are messy or otherwise occupied (in its presentation, Qualcomm used the example of using it while cooking a recipe to check the next steps). Maybe you’ve got your phone mounted in your car, and you can just glance over at it to see driving directions without having to take your hands off the steering wheel or leave the screen on the entire time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrZO2W"&gt;The company is also spinning it as making your phone &lt;em&gt;more secure&lt;/em&gt; by automatically locking the phone when it no longer sees your face or detects someone looking over your shoulder and snooping on your group chat. It can also suppress private information or notifications from popping up if you’re looking at the phone with someone else. Basically, if you’re not looking at it, your phone is locked; if it can see you, it will be unlocked. If it can see you &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; someone else, it can automatically lock the phone or hide private information or notifications from displaying on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngEJ0r"&gt;But while those features may sound neat and perhaps even convenient, I’m not convinced that having an always-on camera is worth the tradeoff in privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V6biDe"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3H6tfcZLHfg?rel=0&amp;amp;start=10758" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xrqwzE"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The always-on camera features are discussed at hour three of Qualcomm’s four-hour presentation introducing the Snapdragon Gen 1 system-on-chip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwLEwb"&gt;Qualcomm is framing the always-on camera as similar to the always-on microphones that have been in our phones for years. Those are used to listen for voice commands like “Hey Siri” or “Hey Google” (or lol, “Hi Bixby”) and then wake up the phone and provide a response, all without you having to touch or pick up the phone. But the key difference is that they are listening for specific wake words and are often limited with what they can do until you do actually pick up your phone and unlock it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xePhtk"&gt;It feels a bit different when it’s a camera that’s always scanning for your likeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vTo21a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An always-on camera is a step beyond the always-on microphones already in our phones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wRk5tL"&gt;It’s true that smart home products already have features like this. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;Google’s Nest Hub Max&lt;/a&gt; uses its camera to recognize your face when you walk up to it and greet you with personal information like your calendar. Home security cameras and video doorbells are constantly on, looking for activity or even specific faces. But those devices are in your home, not always carried with you everywhere you go, and generally don’t have your most private information stored on them, like your phone does. They also frequently have features like physical shutters to block the camera or intelligent modes to disable recording when you’re home and only resume it when you aren’t. It’s hard to imagine any phone manufacturer putting a physical shutter on the front of their slim and sleek flagship smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgoU53"&gt;Lastly, there have been many reports of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22322122/verkada-hack-150000-security-cameras-tesla-factory-cloudflare-jails-hospitals"&gt;security breaches&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21028092/amazon-ring-camera-hack-password-security-privacy-access-2fa"&gt;social engineering hacks&lt;/a&gt; to enable smart home cameras when they aren’t supposed to be on and then send that feed to remote servers, all without the knowledge of the homeowner. Modern smartphone operating systems now do a good job of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22634128/privacy-android-12-dashboard-apps-sensors"&gt;telling you when an app is accessing your camera or microphone&lt;/a&gt; while you’re using the device, but it’s not clear how they’d be able to inform you of a rogue app tapping into the always-on camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3UlWw"&gt;Heape said that “always-on camera data never leaves the secure sensing hub while it’s looking for faces,” implying that the data isn’t sent to the cloud and that apps on the phone won’t be able to access it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AjTYfM"&gt;Another Qualcomm Technologies vice president of product management Ziad Asghar told my colleague Chaim Gartenberg that users will also be able to disable the always-on camera feature or possibly even select which features they want to use and which they don’t. “The consumer has the choice to be able to pick and choose as to what is enabled and what’s not enabled,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TP4UtH0DVT_0Q539UAZ_GsuJDKM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16257180/vpavic_190510_3415_0161.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 7 Pro hid its entire camera system in a motorized pop-up module. Perhaps it’s time to bring this idea back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SFe78n"&gt;It’s also possible that the smartphone manufacturers using the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 won’t even enable this feature at a hardware level. Since Qualcomm doesn’t actually make the smartphones its chips go in (outside of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568641/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-technology"&gt;one-off novelties&lt;/a&gt; that aren’t widely purchased), companies like Samsung, OnePlus, and Xiaomi can customize which features are enabled on their phones and which aren’t. Some of those companies already bypass Qualcomm’s image processing components in favor of their own solutions — it’s not hard to see them just skipping the criticisms of privacy concerns and forgoing this feature as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="0jhcqA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An unsettling and uncomfortable precedent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UPTiXp"&gt;But even if it’s not found in every phone next year, the mere presence of the feature means that it will be used by someone at some point. It sets a precedent that is unsettling and uncomfortable; Qualcomm may be the first with this capability, but it won’t be long before other companies add it in the race to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lugMRK"&gt;Maybe we’ll just start having to put tape on our smartphone cameras like we already do with laptop webcams.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung refreshes two budget A-series phones with 5G and higher prices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy A13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fMVe7Us2BfT5wo5TScRlxJDJnaU=/120x0:4620x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70214532/GalaxyA13_5G_Green_Lockup_RGB_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A13 will be an AT&amp;amp;T exclusive starting December 3rd, 2021, before being available on T-Mobile and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://Samsung.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; in early 2022.&lt;/em&gt; | Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ArTaVC"&gt;With 2022 and CES just around the corner, Samsung is ready to introduce new updates to its popular and budget-friendly A-series, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22749880/samsung-q3-2021-earnings-record-revenue-memory-mobile"&gt;helped keep sales strong&lt;/a&gt; for the Korean company despite supply woes for the flagship Galaxy S21. This time around, both the Galaxy A13 5G and A03S are getting a bit more expensive while confirming some new hardware and 5G connectivity for the A13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r26Tc7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung Galaxy A13 5G&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pC9P83"&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21628573/samsung-a12-a02s-phones-budget-price-specs-2021"&gt;4G-only Galaxy A12&lt;/a&gt;, the new A13 will be able to access 5G networks, specifically, with the sub-6GHz bands available on T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T. The A13’s 5G readiness partly explains its new $249.99 price. That’s a whopping $70 increase from its $179.99 predecessor and slightly cheaper than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;$279.99 Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; with similar specs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PE9zXH"&gt;Its higher price makes it possible to bring some premium features to the A13, as the relatively low-resolution 6.5-inch Infinity-V HD Plus display will feel smoother with its 90Hz adaptive refresh rate. This is up from the standard 60Hz of the A12 and keeps pace with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;$239.99 OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt; that offers a 1080p display with 90Hz refresh. Thanks to its more up-to-date MediaTek Dimensity 700 processor, the A13 is better equipped to multitask and handle various mobile games than the &lt;a href="https://nanoreview.net/en/soc-compare/mediatek-helio-p35-vs-mediatek-dimensity-700"&gt;A12, which shipped last year with a chipset from 2018&lt;/a&gt;. The A13 also promises an updated triple-camera system with a 50-megapixel main camera, plus a macro and a depth sensor for bokeh effects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy A13 5G’s side fingerprint sensor" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yKa0PfMZkzh5p2eF9xR6aNNf5MQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055054/GalaxyA13_5G_Black_RSide_RGB.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A13 5G features a fingerprint sensor embedded into its power button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wxgMx2"&gt;It’s a bit disappointing that the A13 will only have 64GB of internal memory — yes, its microSD slot will support up to a 1TB card — and Samsung has not specified how much RAM this model has (the A12 had 3GB RAM). That said, you’ll be able to plug wired headphones into its 3.5mm audio jack, make contactless payments via NFC, enjoy a 5,000mAh battery, and use the side fingerprint sensor to unlock your phone (there is no face unlock option). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y3iXvD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung Galaxy A03S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fP8FvF"&gt;Samsung is not revealing nearly as many details about the upcoming Galaxy A03S, only confirming that the A03S will cost $159.99 when it ships in 2022, while the base A02S debuted at just $109.99 last year. With scant details about the A03S’s new hardware to justify this $50 price increase, the press release hints that it’ll have “a long-lasting battery, triple camera system, and fingerprint security.” You can probably expect an updated processor from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21628573/samsung-a12-a02s-phones-budget-price-specs-2021"&gt;A02S&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps 32GB of storage in the base model, but you’ll have to wait for CES or a potential Samsung Unpacked event to find out more, including what it looks like because we don’t have pictures of it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWXuoD"&gt;Both phones will ship with Android 11, but it’s unclear whether they will receive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;four years of regular security updates&lt;/a&gt; like Samsung has guaranteed for some A-series phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3zlTZ"&gt;The new A13 5G will be an AT&amp;amp;T online exclusive starting on December 3rd, 2021, with T-Mobile and Samsung.com following suit in early January 2022. If you prefer the ultra-budget A03S, you’ll need to wait until early January 2022, when it’ll be available on AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Samsung.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3KejH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s new Big Brain Academy turns brainteasers into a party game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gz8_0oKAuS8S25DaLKU8ZQTOdII=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70214182/Switch_BBABvB_Reveal_TRL_SCRN_02_bmp_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eLmz1d"&gt;2021 is shaping up to be the year of party games on the Switch. This year, Nintendo has released new entries in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22632465/warioware-get-it-together-nintendo-switch-preview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WarioWare&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22749548/mario-party-superstars-nintendo-switch-oled-kickstand"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; franchises, and now it’s completing the party trilogy with &lt;em&gt;Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain&lt;/em&gt;. It’s the continuation of a series that started with &lt;em&gt;Brain Age&lt;/em&gt; on the Nintendo DS, which, alongside the likes of &lt;em&gt;Wii Sports &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Wii Fit&lt;/em&gt;, helped solidify the company’s “blue ocean” strategy of reaching a nontraditional gaming audience. Each “Brain” game is exactly what it sounds like: a collection of digital brainteasers. The twist in the latest is that its focus is almost exclusively on multiplayer play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEB1ZI"&gt;At its most basic, &lt;em&gt;Big Brain Academy&lt;/em&gt; is a mini-game collection where each of the games is divided into five different categories: identify, memorize, analyze, compute, and visualize. The idea is that the games all test different parts of your brain. One mini-game involves popping numbered balloons in the correct order, while another has you choosing the right shapes to complete an image. There’s a pretty basic single-player mode where you can practice each of the mini-games, complete a “test” that involves each of the five categories, or compete against the ghosts of either friends or players online. Doing well earns you high scores and new looks for your avatar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiZVTI"&gt;It’s nothing like, say, a classic &lt;em&gt;Brain Age&lt;/em&gt; with a structure that encourages you to come back and keep improving. (Though the game does rate the weight of your brain after tests.) Instead, the single-player feels more like a warmup for the party mode, where up to four players can compete. This mode works well for a few reasons. To start, the games are pretty simple but with a nice progression, so they work well for a timed competition where you’re trying to solve problems as quickly as possible. It can get surprisingly intense when all the players in a room are trying to be the first to identify a slowly unraveling photo of a zebra.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kc2nMMmH08bvDb9BnFmA9xO32ns=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053914/Switch_BBABvB_Reveal_TRL_SCRN_02_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ey9zrt"&gt;The thing that sets &lt;em&gt;Brain vs. Brain&lt;/em&gt; apart from the Switch’s other party games, aside from its less zany mini-games, is just how adjustable the difficulty is. It’s really something you can play with the whole family. When you start up a multiplayer match, each player gets to choose their own difficulty level, making it possible to balance the experience for people of different ages. I spent an afternoon playing with a six- and eight-year-old, and each of us was playing on a completely different difficulty level. When we play &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, I’m usually forced to turn the speed down all the way, which is fun for the kids but boring for me. But in &lt;em&gt;Brain vs. Brain&lt;/em&gt;, you can fine-tune the experience to each player so that they can both compete against each other &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; challenge themselves. It’s a nice change of pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6datqr"&gt;I should also note that this is the rare Switch game that I actually prefer playing with a touchscreen. It’s just a lot faster in most games to tap the correct answer than move a cursor around. Unfortunately this isn’t really possible if you have a bunch of people playing, but there is a single-Switch touchscreen mode that works really well for two players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3twx9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brain vs. Brain &lt;/em&gt;isn’t revolutionary by any stretch, but it does open up the possibilities for who can play together, which is an important change from its contemporaries. It’s also not the kind of game I see myself playing solo all that often. Instead, it’s more like a board game that I’ll stick on the shelf and pull out when everyone gets together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTw54l"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; launches December 3rd on the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Big tech’s first generation of founders starts to step aside</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jeff Bezos’s India Visit Marked By Probe and Protests" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_R7fyPRCD47GK1go_CdRw566v4=/0x0:2138x1425/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70214184/1193819818.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JC8jKS"&gt;Massive tech companies like Google, Amazon, Netflix, and more have had a huge impact on the way we live our lives, and have had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770569/alphabet-google-market-cap-hits-2-trillion"&gt;incredible levels&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/"&gt;financial success&lt;/a&gt;. Another thing many of these companies have in common is that their founders are no longer necessarily in control; they’ve either stepped down, started sharing power with others, or in some cases possibly even been pushed out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hAI6N"&gt;This week alone, Twitter co-founder &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;Jack Dorsey stepped down as CEO&lt;/a&gt;, and Salesforce founder Marc Benioff &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/salesforce-promotes-bret-taylor-to-co-ceo.html"&gt;became a &lt;em&gt;co&lt;/em&gt;-CEO&lt;/a&gt;. They’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="EujqeX"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Amazon &lt;/strong&gt;— In July 2021, Jeff Bezos officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22563671/andy-jassy-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos"&gt;handed the CEO position of Amazon over&lt;/a&gt; to former Amazon Web Services head Andy Jassy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LI0HDf"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Apple &lt;/strong&gt;— Tim Cook was &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2009/01/14Apple-Media-Advisory/"&gt;temporarily left in charge of Apple&lt;/a&gt; in 2009 while Steve Jobs underwent medical treatment. Jobs returned to the company, but then put Cook in charge for another leave of absence in 2011, before permanently making him CEO later that year. Around the time of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;his 10-year anniversary as CEO of Apple&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, Tim Cook said he doesn’t intend to run the company for another decade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="03YCHp"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;ByteDance — &lt;/strong&gt;Zhang Yiming, founder of the company that owns TikTok, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445212/tiktok-bytedance-ceo-zhang-yiming-steps-down"&gt;announced he’d be stepping down as CEO&lt;/a&gt; this May. In an internal letter, he said he worried about “relying too much on the ideas I had before starting the company.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nPcfNv"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt; — In August 2015, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20994361/google-alphabet-larry-page-sergey-brin-sundar-pichai-co-founders-ceo-timeline"&gt;moved on to overseeing Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, the holding company for Google’s disparate properties. The shakeup was seen as them taking their hands off the search engine company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/10/9128083/sundar-pichai-ceo-google-larry-page-sergey-brin"&gt;leaving Sundar Pichai in charge&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20994218/google-alphabet-ceo-sundar-pichai-larry-page-sergey-brin-step-down-control-management"&gt;Pichai took over as CEO of Alphabet as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="geIrqO"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Instagram &lt;/strong&gt;— In September 2018, Instagram’s co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger announced they were stepping down, reportedly after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/4/17/18411363/why-instagram-founders-quit-hamburger-button-location-tracking"&gt;major disagreements with Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8zbaph"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft &lt;/strong&gt;— Microsoft founder Bill Gates’ departure happened in many stages, with him first stepping down as CEO in 2000, then leaving his full time position at the company he helped found in 2008, and finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179214/bill-gates-steps-down-microsoft-board-philanthropy"&gt;stepping down from his position on the board last year&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is currently being run by Satya Nadella, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537683/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-chairman-bill-gates-john-thompson"&gt;acts as both CEO and chairman of the board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="boWSkR"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Netflix&lt;/strong&gt; — In July 2020, Ted Sarandos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327550/netflix-ted-sarandos-ceo-netflix-reed-hastings-board-member-originals-tv-movies"&gt;joined Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings as co-CEO&lt;/a&gt;. The company said that Sarandos was already helping lead (he’d been &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/03/outside-the-box-2"&gt;with the company for twenty years&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/co-ceos-are-out-of-style-why-is-netflix-resurrecting-the-management-model-11594987416"&gt;was in charge of its original programming&lt;/a&gt;), and that him joining Hastings as CEO was just a formalization of his role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sw7urw"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Salesforce&lt;/strong&gt; — Bret Taylor, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;replaced Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt; as Twitter’s chairman of the board on Monday, is also becoming the co-CEO of enterprise tech giant Salesforce, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/salesforce-promotes-bret-taylor-to-co-ceo.html"&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not the first time Marc Benioff, the company’s CEO and founder, will be sharing power, but it’s another instance of a former deputy starting to gain more power within a tech giant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UUkvbR"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Twitter &lt;/strong&gt;— On Monday, November 29th, Jack Dorsey &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;announced he was leaving Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and said “I’ve decided to leave Twitter because I believe the company is ready to move on from its founders.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="NzRxzQ"&gt;There are, of course, exceptions to the trend. The most notable is Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s complete control over Meta. He &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt; that he doesn’t have plans to give up his job, and it’d be pretty much impossible for shareholders to force him out, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/opinion/tech-dual-class-stock.html"&gt;thanks to the company’s stock structure&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from Zuckerberg, a couple other CEOs come to mind: Jensen Huang is still in charge of Nvidia (until it &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/nvidia-faked-part-of-a-press-conference-with-a-cgi-ceo/"&gt;replaces him with a digital AI avatar&lt;/a&gt;), and Snapchat is still helmed by Evan Spiegel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F94x1X"&gt;Obviously, tech companies can survive and thrive without their founders — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753251/microsoft-apple-market-cap-business-valuable-company"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375223/apple-2-trillion-market-cap-first-us-company-stock-price"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; are the two most valuable public companies in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
