    <title>The Witcher’s second season is coming to Netflix on December 17th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="piIkSl"&gt;Sharpen your swords and get your coins ready to toss: Geralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill) is finally back for &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;’s second season on December 17th, revealed at the inaugural online WitcherCon event hosted by Netflix and CD Projekt Red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvYg0F"&gt;Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; shows are based directly on the novels and short stories by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski (not developer CD Projekt Red’s popular RPG games, which are original stories set after the books, although the show’s release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21043014/netflix-the-witcher-3-henry-cavill-game-steam-twitch"&gt;did help boost a new wave of interest&lt;/a&gt; in the games).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lnJxpe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Netflix’s The Witcher is a dark, funny, and faithful adaptation of the fantasy series","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FVXDJB"&gt;The second season of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; is just one part of Netflix’s expanded plans for the franchise: in addition to the main show, there’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21340050/netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-live-action-prequel-announced"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher: Blood Origin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a six-part live-action prequel miniseries that will star Sophia Brown, Laurence O’Fuarain, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565149/michelle-yeoh-netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-sword-elves"&gt;Michelle Yeoh&lt;/a&gt;. That series will focus on the original creation of the magically mutated Witchers and how the fantasy world that the story takes place in came about in the first place. Netflix is also working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21077253/witcher-netflix-anime-korean-studio-mir-henry-cavill-live-action-show"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;an anime spinoff film that’s planned for release later in 2021 from Korean animation house Studio Mir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qP2oGY"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Destiny has revealed itself. Prepare for The Witcher Season 2, premiering December 17 on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@netflix&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WitcherCon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WitcherCon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/wx5RuCn11Z"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wx5RuCn11Z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— The Witcher (@witchernetflix) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/witchernetflix/status/1413552041071362048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fLqYfB"&gt;It’s no wonder that Netflix is betting big on &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;: the show has been one of the streamer’s most popular original series and was Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075927/netflix-the-witcher-viewer-numbers-length-metrics-q4-2019-earnings"&gt;most-watched season of television&lt;/a&gt; ever when it first debuted, although that title that has since been claimed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252580/bridgerton-netflix-82-million-households-biggest-show-ever-caveats"&gt;Regency-era romance &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (That’s with the caveat that Netflix is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; generous in what it considers a watch: anyone who viewed at least two minutes of an episode of the show.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFrVAQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is teaming up with Tag Heuer on a Mario-themed watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eRGP7FK0VnjrMZqq3x4SG-L5r6Q=/0x86:1650x1186/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69562116/Screen_Shot_2021_07_09_at_9.57.30_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The case for Tag Heuer’s upcoming Mario-themed watch.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Tag Heuer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SH2HMd"&gt;Nintendo, which is often associated with being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/13/8945331/satoru-iwata-obituary-nintendo-ceo-president"&gt;a toy maker&lt;/a&gt;, is teaming up with, of all companies, luxury watchmaker Tag Heuer. The two companies revealed their collaboration on an upcoming Super Mario-themed watch in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TAGHeuer/status/1413408490421465089"&gt;psychedelic teaser posted on Twitter early Friday morning&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZk6hZ"&gt;You can sign up now on &lt;a href="https://www.tagheuer.com/us/en/announcement/coming-soon.html"&gt;Tag Heuer’s website&lt;/a&gt; to get early access to the “exclusive limited edition” watch which is coming “super soon.” Confusingly, Tag Heuer’s tweet says that you can “power-up on July 13th,” but the website has a clock that’s currently counting down to two days later: Thursday, July 15th at 10AM ET. If you’re interested in snagging one of these watches for yourself, you might want to register on the site to stay up to date on when you might actually be able to order one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uraPxy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Coming Super Soon!&lt;br&gt;Power-up on July 13th.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TAGHeuerxSuperMario?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TAGHeuerxSuperMario&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;For priority access, register now: &lt;a href="https://t.co/8rcnX4sCZV"&gt;https://t.co/8rcnX4sCZV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StayTuned?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StayTuned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SuperMario?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SuperMario&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Nintendo?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/n03JXJRPYm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/n03JXJRPYm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— TAG Heuer (@TAGHeuer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TAGHeuer/status/1413408490421465089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6yS9nP"&gt;The site doesn’t list any details on pricing, but from what I can tell, most Tag Heuer watches cost at least a grand, so it seems likely that this Super Mario watch won’t be cheap. And I have to say that the collaboration isn’t one I’d expect to see from Nintendo, which I wouldn’t consider a luxury brand. But I’m definitely curious as to what this watch might look like, and I’ll be keeping an eye on the official reveal next week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best streaming device to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4898BPrHNtUJ2D0ryKE7CVuH4mg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67310264/DSCF2108.7.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Getting something great only costs $50&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="NGkXEr"&gt;Looking for a new TV gadget to stream all of your favorite entertainment? Buying an excellent streaming device is easier in 2021 than ever before — and the prices only continue to drop and get more appealing: $50 is the sweet spot if you want a streaming stick or set-top box that can do crisp 4K resolution, Dolby Vision / HDR, and immersive Dolby Atmos surround sound. Each of the picks below has its own strengths, whether it’s a snazzier interface, better voice controls, or a more comprehensive universal search for digging through all of your services. Depending on your wants, there are several good contenders, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stands out as the best streaming device for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xj845F"&gt;Pretty much any 4K TV you buy today will come with a batch of built-in streaming apps. But they won’t always have &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. (For example, my LG OLED still somehow doesn’t have HBO Max.) So a dedicated streaming device is the best way to guarantee you’ll be able to watch that show or movie everyone’s been talking about. You can spend less money on entry-level Roku or Amazon streaming players, but you’ll be better off with one of our recommendations if you want your purchase to last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Pz52a6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503888"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="4mn8ET"&gt;BEST STREAMING DEVICES OF 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="2VmT6S"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An image of the Google Chromecast, the best streaming stick of 2021 for most people, resting on a soundbar." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kOzUEubtlPeu7op7nTCzq0zBPLw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21924603/DSCF2097_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The features and fantastic price of the Chromecast with Google TV make it the best streaming stick for most people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9cOJvp"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="liPByI"&gt;The best streaming stick for most people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3U9Abh"&gt;Google has done the best job figuring out what the home screen on a streaming stick should look like. That’s really the long and short of why the Chromecast with Google TV has taken the crown of best streaming player. With its new Google TV software, the company has taken a content-first approach that feels more focused and refined than what Amazon and Apple have managed in their own attempts to aggregate popular shows and movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lr5ZDG"&gt;On a Roku or Fire TV, my instinct is always to head right for the app where I want to watch something. But with the Chromecast, I’m equally happy browsing through Google’s rows of recommendations. The Google TV software always clearly shows where content is coming from — you can pick which streaming apps get factored into these recs — and it also provides helpful information (like Rotten Tomatoes ratings) at the surface level when you’re hunting for that night’s entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XINYdJ"&gt;When you actually hit play, you’re punted over to Netflix or Prime Video or HBO Max just like always, but there’s no avoiding that. In terms of app selection, Google’s got all of the main players covered. You can still cast content to the Chromecast from your phone or laptop, and Google Assistant voice searches consistently work well and showcase Google’s accurate voice recognition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uHgD8b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has done the best job figuring out what the software on a streaming device should look like&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IvKXPL"&gt;Everything about Google TV feels tasteful, from the fonts to the way the background color subtly shifts to match the artwork of whatever content is highlighted. And the universal Watchlist, which lets you put together a list of stuff you’re interested in from various streaming services, is super convenient — especially since you can add to it from the web or your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUEQwj"&gt;But not everything about the Chromecast with Google TV is perfect. The software can slow down from time to time, and some customers have &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/07/chromecast-google-tv-data-corrupt-android-cant-load-error/"&gt;encountered significant bugs&lt;/a&gt; that Google has tried to iron out with software updates. More annoyingly, despite the hardware supporting both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, there are still very popular apps like Disney Plus — which delivers both on other platforms — that aren’t doing so on the Chromecast. HBO Max says it does Atmos, but that hasn’t been my experience. Why? Who knows, but these inconsistencies are a mark against Google. And as for the Watchlist, some services like Netflix have already started removing their shows from it. Again, that’s something Google has no control over, but it does lessen the feature’s usefulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="e1vJvx"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An image of the Roku Streaming Stick Plus, the best streaming device for ease of use, plugged into a TV." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GeG7Xng7wS70oeIPS1EBLvuW_9g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9578455/akrales_171031_2100_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With its easy-to-use software, the Roku Streaming Stick Plus is the best streaming device for people looking for a good, simple option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="z2csvA"&gt;2. Roku Streaming Stick Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hOCseD"&gt;The best streaming device for people who want to keep it simple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7O9OD"&gt;It’s hard to really complain about a Roku. The company’s streaming devices are about as simple and straightforward as they come. All of your apps are laid out in a big grid, which can make the experience feel a bit siloed — but there’s no beating that ease of use. And Roku has tried to touch up and modernize the home screen a bit with new sections like “Featured Free” to highlight content you can stream without any subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qjIbaE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736654"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MGj91j"&gt;Despite some occasional spats with content companies, Roku now has pretty much all of the entertainment you could want, including (most recently) HBO Max and Peacock. And the wonderfully neutral universal search remains one of the best aspects of the platform, favoring your existing subscriptions and free-to-stream options over making you pay money to rent or buy. And the company’s Roku Channel has grown into a legitimate streaming app of its own, offering a mix of ad-sponsored movies, TV shows, and live news for those days when you’re burned out on combing through Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVnPjT"&gt;The $50 Streaming Stick Plus remains the best overall pick among Roku’s hardware when you weigh price and performance. It gives you HDR, Dolby Atmos, and speedy performance. The main thing you’ll miss out on is Dolby Vision. If that’s a &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;, you should look at the $100 Roku Ultra set-top box instead, which also includes an Ethernet port for optional wired connectivity and a helpful remote finder feature. Plus, the Ultra’s remote has customizable shortcut buttons and a headphone jack so you can listen privately to whatever’s on-screen if you’re trying to keep quiet at night. (Other Rokus let you do the latter with the company’s mobile app.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4IoeY"&gt;If there’s one area where Roku falls flat, it’s probably voice search. Your voice queries for specific shows or movies should work well enough, but Roku lags Amazon and Google when it comes to natural language interactions. (And forget about using your voice to control smart home gadgets or look up entertainment-related facts.) Still, the company is adding other perks to offset that weakness. Late last year, it added support for Apple’s AirPlay, letting you easily send content from an iPhone, iPad, or Mac to the TV screen. Speaking of Apple…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mqu6OJ02NVqztRrNUIgGTb3A18E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541100/DSCF3875_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple TV 4K offers the most consistent, reliable performance of any streaming device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JRXodl"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22454960/apple-tv-4k-2021-review"&gt;Apple TV 4K (second-generation)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CWJwP1"&gt;The best streaming device overall experience (for a steep price)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="M2y4K0"&gt;It’s fair to look at the Apple TV 4K as overpriced compared to its competitors, but Apple’s set-top box still has its own set of appealing qualities. The interface is fantastic. It supports Dolby Vision and Atmos across a wide variety of services, has all of the important apps checked off, and also gives you add-ons like Apple Arcade and Apple Fitness Plus (if you pay for them) that you won’t find on other streaming devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0yQqy"&gt;Apps sometimes have a higher level of polish on Apple TV and are generally better about taking advantage of everything the box can do. Another benefit of the Apple TV is privacy — to some extent. Apple itself isn’t obsessed with tracking your viewing data in the same way that a company like Roku is, but the streaming apps can still see what you’re doing. I generally think consumers aren’t particularly averse to sharing their streaming habits, but Apple’s privacy practices might matter to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AUc2Xv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10644678"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p7S0fB"&gt;Even with AirPlay now on Roku, the Apple TV still wins out for people deeply invested in Apple’s ecosystem. You can use HomePods as its speakers or connect two sets of AirPods for private listening with audio sharing. You can view the feed from HomeKit security cameras or see who is at the door if you have a HomeKit video doorbell. The Apple TV still makes it easy to tap into content on a Mac in your home, and services like Apple Music and iCloud Photo Library are right there in easy reach on the TV screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JS0nOC"&gt;And with the 2021 model of the Apple TV 4K, Apple has finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;redesigned the Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; with a much simpler, more intuitive button layout that adds power and mute controls. It’s larger and harder to lose in the couch cushions, too. The second-gen Apple TV 4K is also now more future-proofed as a smart home hub with the inclusion of Thread support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Yh1ylb"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K, a great streaming stick for $50, pictured attached to a TV’s HDMI port." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MQ6Oml67NEpEL1BJiRk4Z7fw5Iw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13360395/cwelch_181030_3054_0442.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K checks off all the boxes for HDR support and costs just $50, making it the best streaming stick for people in Amazon’s ecosystem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6ajwme"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mO4Da0"&gt;The best streaming stick if you’re in Amazon’s ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iAlxyK"&gt;Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K is yet another popular pick in that $50 range of streaming gadgets. The latest model added support for Dolby Vision, which made it the only product to offer everything HDR (Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10+, HDR10) for such little money — until the new Chromecast came along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HanEXz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351716"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oDfmk8"&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K’s software is similar to the Chromecast in that the home screen takes a content-focused approach instead of just throwing a grid of apps at you. Amazon tends to showcase its own Prime Video content more prominently than shows and movies from other services, but the newly revamped software goes a long way in improving the look and feel of the Fire TV. Alexa voice commands with the remote also work reliably, whether you’re saying “open Netflix” or asking to dim the smart lights in your living room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0rvix"&gt;Amazon offers most major streaming apps, but there are some frustrating omissions: Vudu — a good source of Dolby Vision movies — and Peacock are both still absent from the Fire TV platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i6E5A2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351738"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JiAvz9"&gt;There’s also the $120 Fire TV Cube to consider. It essentially doubles as a streaming device and small smart speaker. Rather than make you press and hold a button to speak to Alexa like with the Stick 4K, the Cube takes a hands-free approach and has beamforming mics that respond to “Alexa” prompts just like an Echo speaker would. It also features something Amazon calls Local Voice Control, which allows it to understand more spoken commands without needing help from the cloud. The Fire TV Cube has a more powerful processor than the Fire TV Stick 4K, making it the fastest of the Fire TV bunch, but the difference isn’t very noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pssjk4"&gt;When it comes to their streaming capabilities, the Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Cube are on equal footing. And you could always put the money you save by going with the Stick toward one of those new sphere-shaped Echo Dots, which will sound far better than the Cube’s tinny built-in speaker. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s Shield TV is a powerful Android TV streaming box that’s popular with home theater enthusiasts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qJ9DFz"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features"&gt;Nvidia Shield TV&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ktAsFL"&gt;Best streaming device for home theater enthusiasts and gamers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bTK5Wu"&gt;Home theater enthusiasts, gamers, and people who like to tinker with their streaming devices have loyally stuck with Nvidia’s Shield TV and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Shield-Android-Streaming-Performance/dp/B07YP9FBMM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shield TV Pro&lt;/a&gt; for a reason. They can serve as excellent players like any of our other picks, but you can also go more advanced and use them for cloud gaming or set up a Plex media library (in the case of the Pro). GeForce Now and Steam Link probably do more to sell gamers on the Shield lineup versus something like Apple Arcade on the Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="useqbH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736645"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bmo5EB"&gt;The Nvidia Shields currently run Android TV with Google Assistant built in, but it’s expected they’ll eventually get the same Google TV experience that’s on the Chromecast. Nvidia’s AI-powered upscaling can eke out some extra detail from the shows and movies you stream, and I’d rate the included remote control (with backlit buttons, even) as the most ergonomic of them all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVfT5g"&gt;But like with the Apple TV, the main hurdle here is the price. The Nvidia Shield TV costs $150, so you’re looking at spending $100 more than devices that offer most of the same functionality. You get Ethernet and a very powerful streaming device for the added premium, and you can push the Shield TV farther and make it do more than just about any of its competitors. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foxconn is dangling a shiny new EV plant in front of Wisconsin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0b4D453mdaLFg6-7BHx2hqYL1FQ=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69561840/fisker_ocean_0134.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ckmmtw"&gt;iPhone builder Foxconn is dangling a massive electric vehicle project in front of Wisconsin after burning the state with promises of a multibillion-dollar LCD factory that never happened. The Taiwanese conglomerate has also already fallen behind its own arbitrary deadline for choosing where it will build the EV factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adcA9D"&gt;The Taiwanese conglomerate said Friday that it has started talks to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) about making EVs with California startup Fisker Inc. at the mostly empty site it owns in the state. This is despite chairman Young Liu saying in March that he would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333868/foxconn-ev-wisconsin-fisker-geely-faraday-future"&gt;decide between building EVs in Mexico or Wisconsin by July 1st&lt;/a&gt;, and Foxconn and the WEDC agreeing to a far smaller tax subsidy package in April that reflected the failure of the LCD project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkUNcC"&gt;Why did Foxconn take a new deal with the WEDC in April when it knew it had EV ambitions in March, only to announce another negotiation with the state in July? Well, because that’s how things go with Foxconn in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WhE9U6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The conglomerate could still choose Mexico or elsewhere&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dzj1q9"&gt;“As part of the site selection process, Foxconn and Fisker have engaged with the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation to discuss plans for electric vehicle manufacturing,” Foxconn said in a statement. Foxconn and Fisker Inc. first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298878/foxconn-fisker-ev-electric-vehicle-wisconsin-deal-fsr-suv"&gt;announced their partnership in February&lt;/a&gt; and have since shared that they plan to build a low-cost electric sedan, currently called Project PEAR, which stands for “Personal Electric Automotive Revolution.” The two companies signed &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210513006048/en/Fisker-and-Foxconn-Sign-Framework-Agreements-for-Project-PEAR-Confirming-Manufacturing-to-Start-in-U.S.-From-Q4-2023"&gt;a framework agreement in May&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3QJsR"&gt;If Foxconn ultimately does move forward with trying to build EVs in Wisconsin, it would be another huge promise to a state and a workforce that it has already mightily burned by the company. Foxconn broke ground on the Wisconsin facility in 2018 and said it would invest $10 billion and build a 20 million-square-foot factory that would pump out LCD panels. Former President Donald Trump said it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;the “eighth wonder of the world.”&lt;/a&gt; The whole effort was supposed to create 13,000 jobs. In return, the company was going to get $4 billion in tax credits and other incentives from state and local governments. The local government in Mount Pleasant demolished entire neighborhoods to clear land for the proposed factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5FtlA"&gt;But the project has languished ever since. Foxconn struggled to meet the most basic hiring goals. It has invested just 3 percent of the $10 billion that it promised, and the biggest standing facility on the property measures just 1 million square feet. The company recently agreed to reclassify the building as a storage facility in official documents, and in April, Foxconn and the WEDC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393679/wisconsin-foxconn-contract-amendment-shrink"&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; to amend their contract to reflect the current, far more meager ambitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGWjnp"&gt;David Callender, a spokesperson for the WEDC, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an email that it is the agency’s policy “not to comment on any discussions it may or may not have with a business unless and until a contract is executed.” The agency also cited similar grounds when it denied a public records request from the &lt;em&gt;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; about the talks with Foxconn and Fisker Inc., the &lt;a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/business/2021/07/08/foxconn-partner-fisker-talks-wedc-making-electric-vehicles/7909713002/"&gt;outlet reported on Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DHnBEt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 8th Wonder of the World","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DSbccD"&gt;Foxconn has spent the last year and a half racking up deals in the EV world. It has agreements with startups that have yet to put a car into production like Fisker Inc. and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212994/byton-foxconn-electric-vehicles-china-shutdown-extended"&gt;Byton&lt;/a&gt;, a Chinese startup owned by state-run First Automotive Works. The conglomerate has also discussed making EVs with established companies like Stellantis (the company created following the recent merger of Fiat Chrysler and France’s PSA Group) and the largest private automaker in China, Geely. The Geely deal may also result in Foxconn working &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333868/foxconn-ev-wisconsin-fisker-geely-faraday-future"&gt;with Faraday Future&lt;/a&gt; (the Chinese automaker recently negotiated a stake in the California startup). Foxconn even recently announced its own electric vehicle platform that it hopes to sell to other automakers, and it’s working with Taiwanese company Gogoro on electric scooters and battery technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JpZQi3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Wisconsin amends Foxconn’s contract to reflect radically smaller project ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393679/wisconsin-foxconn-contract-amendment-shrink"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="IY5QZW"&gt;Liu, who took over the Wisconsin project after Foxconn founder Terry Gou left the company, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-wisconsin-mexico-scott-walker-taipei-313ff82519f7ac551f1a149eebf82b4e"&gt;said in March&lt;/a&gt; that he “need[s] to find a product that fits that location.” It’s a search that has stretched on for more than a year now, as Foxconn has considered &lt;a href="https://www.wpr.org/failed-partnerships-and-vacant-buildings-foxconns-wisconsin-commitment-remains-standstill"&gt;making everything from coffee robots&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21213269/foxconn-ventilators-wisconsin-plant-medtronic-pb-560-open-source-design-covid-19"&gt;ventilators&lt;/a&gt; at the facility. Still, Liu said at the time that there was no guarantee Foxconn would choose to build electric vehicles at the site. “Whether it’s Wisconsin or Mexico, it’s not political, it’s business from my perspective,” he said in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yffL6S"&gt;Wherever they wind up trying to build it, Fisker Inc. and Foxconn have said they plan to start production on the EV by the end of 2023. Fisker Inc.’s first vehicle, the Ocean SUV, is supposed to go into production in November 2022. It will be &lt;a href="https://investors.fiskerinc.com/news/news-details/2021/Fisker-and-Magna-Sign-Long-Term-Manufacturing-Agreement/default.aspx"&gt;built in Austria by automotive supplier Magna&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Oy5Jpj"&gt;For this week’s episode of &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast, &lt;/em&gt;here are the three biggest stories: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="c7BI56"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;Google faces new antitrust lawsuit over Google Play Store fees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="UvHOww"&gt;Nilay and Dieter bring back &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior reporter Adi Robertson to discuss these topics and answer questions like: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OHScpJ"&gt;Why is Samsung such a big presence in this lawsuit against Google?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="drVWoP"&gt;How much nicer does the new Nintendo Switch OLED model look and feel compared to the original model?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KlkPUI"&gt;What is Stellantis, and why did it make an event to debut its new electric vehicle mottos for all of its car brands? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="2hZOgh"&gt;There are a lot of other stories discussed in this week’s episode — like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567035/verizon-spatial-audio-adaptive-sound-motorola"&gt;Verizon’s own version of spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22566729/trump-lawsuit-facebook-twitter-google-social-media-censorship"&gt;nonsensical lawsuits against Big Tech that Donald Trump is filing&lt;/a&gt; — so listen here or in your preferred podcast player to hear the full discussion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok will start automating video removals for nudity and more in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rtd4JO3uJ3WOwyfNdJyZV9FDBlA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69561312/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0002.0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UUOiDE"&gt;TikTok is trying to speed up its moderation process by removing human reviewers where its automated systems can do the job about as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4M9lC9"&gt;In the US and Canada, the company is &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/advancing-our-approach-to-user-safety"&gt;going to start&lt;/a&gt; using automated reviewing systems to weed out videos with nudity, sex, violence, graphic content, illegal activities, and violations of its minor safety policy. If the system catches a video in those categories, it’ll be pulled right away, and the creator will be given the opportunity to appeal to a human moderator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYNZ2P"&gt;Until now, TikTok has run all videos by human moderators in the US before pulling them, a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The change is meant in part to limit the “volume of distressing videos” moderators are required to watch and give them more time to spend on trickier clips, like misinformation, that require context to properly review. Moderators for other companies, like Facebook, have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona"&gt;developed PTSD-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt; from the videos they were required to watch. The announcement is also part of an effort to provide more transparency around moderation, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/tiktok-automation-video-removals-5388a03a-4625-4435-9311-ede21fafc148.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which first reported the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tw25xd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most videos TikTok removes fall under these categories&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dPZJiX"&gt;The problem TikTok will face is that automated systems are never perfect, and some communities may be hit hardest by errors in automated takedowns. The app has a history of discriminatory moderation and was recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22519433/tiktok-intersex-ban-mistake-moderation-transparency"&gt;criticized for pulling the intersex hashtag twice&lt;/a&gt;. TikTok says it’s starting to use automation only where it’s most reliable; it’s been testing the tech in other countries, including Brazil and Pakistan, and says only 5 percent of the videos its systems removed actually should have been allowed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gu2qPA"&gt;That’s a low number, but when put in context of &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/resources/tiktok-transparency-report-2021-h-1"&gt;how many videos TikTok removes&lt;/a&gt; — 8,540,088 videos in the US during the first three months of 2021 — there could end up being tens or hundreds of thousands of videos pulled by mistake. The vast majority of the videos removed fall under the categories TikTok is implementing automated moderation. That said, not all of those videos are going to be routed around human reviewers. A spokesperson says human moderators will still be checking community reports, appeals, and other videos flagged by its automated systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GC2yt9"&gt;TikTok says it’ll be rolling out the automated review system “over the next few weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo Yoga 9i (14-inch) review: sounds like a winner</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Lenovo’s latest convertible has excellent speakers and good performance&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Zpu7S2"&gt;Lenovo is a big player in the convertible laptop sphere, and the Yoga 9i is its top dog. A sequel to the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fyoga%2Fyoga-2-in-1-series%2FLenovo-Yoga-C940-14IIL%2Fp%2F88YGC901221&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22569871%2Flenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Yoga C940&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fyoga%2Fyoga-2-in-1-series%2FYoga-9-14ITL5%2Fp%2F88YGC901455&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22569871%2Flenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,299.99-and-up&lt;/a&gt; 14-inch Yoga 9i is a capable laptop in almost every area that matters, with a comfortable keyboard, respectable battery life, and some of the better specs you can get at its price point. But there’s one area where it’s far ahead of the pack — the audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vtkjfu"&gt;Yes, you read that correctly. There’s actually a 14-inch laptop out there with very good audio. I know. I’m shocked to be typing that, too. Though it doesn’t quite surpass the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP’s Spectre x360&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309005/microsoft-surface-pro-7-plus-review"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Pro 7 Plus&lt;/a&gt; in many other areas, the Yoga 9i’s innovative speaker design keeps it very much in the premium mix as an exceptional entertainment and multimedia machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SiSv1Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10644262"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u7Kocd"&gt;About this speaker system, to start. There are two downward-firing woofers on the bottom. But the 9i’s secret is that the custom tweeters are housed in a rotating soundbar, which is built into the laptop’s hinge. The positioning means that the grills are always facing outward, regardless of whether the laptop is in clamshell, tablet, or tent mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3VgWyT"&gt;I’m not exaggerating when I say this is the best audio I’ve ever heard from a laptop of this size. Its volume more than fills a room, and it sounds great in all orientations with booming bass. The surround quality was also superb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qXp7qLpzQxMQGsH6ALJRZ3W55I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651287/akrales_20210609_4596_0067.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The excellent sound is thanks to speakers embedded in the hinge that always face you, no matter which way you use the 9i. Unfortunately, the garish logo is always visible, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ddiKk_DxNpbrUe_tpbquzgdQWg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651296/akrales_20210609_4596_0172.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you flip the Yoga 9i to tablet mode, the speaker in the hinge faces outward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B6SbQp"&gt;The 9i comes preloaded with Dolby Atmos Speaker System software, where you can swap between presets for Movie, Music, Game, and Voice as well as personalized profiles and a dynamic mode that detects your content and adjusts the audio accordingly. These do make a difference — namely, the Music mode brings the vocals out more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="y3u8jP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10644285"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lKhmHs"&gt;To complement the sound, the 9i has a very nice 1080p touch display with accurate details and colors. I’d have no problem watching movies and YouTube videos on it, and you can switch between different picture modes (Dark, Light, and Vivid) with preloaded Dolby Vision software. The screen is quite glossy, however, and kicked back a frustrating amount of glare in brighter rooms. And it’s not the brightest around, maxing out at 290 nits in testing. I also wish Lenovo would ditch the 16:9 aspect ratio, as it has for some of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22376272/lenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable-review"&gt;premium&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;models&lt;/a&gt; in the business space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nm7n1f"&gt;The final thing to call out about the chassis is its garaged stylus. Garaged styluses are sometimes a huge pain to tug in and out, but this one was smooth to remove. The garage’s location on the right side of the Yoga’s rear edge isn’t the most convenient, but it’s definitely preferable to having to store the pen yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48nA9L"&gt;The stylus has a new “elastomer” tip that’s supposed to mimic the feeling of a pen on paper. That’s a fair description of how it feels in practice, but it also means it’s not as smooth to write and draw with as other touchscreen styluses. (It’s also tiny — much smaller than most real pens.) And there are two (very small) buttons, which can be mapped to various tasks — erase, left click, copy, paste, whatever you want — in Lenovo’s Pen Settings software. You can check the pen’s battery here as well. Lenovo says it can last 40 minutes on a 15-minute charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i9jXCdPFRUa44dRE7Hx6IEMfqbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651289/akrales_20210609_4596_0074.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 9i has a new stylus that feels more like pen on paper when writing on the screen. It lives in a garage on the back side of the laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iJXTc5oFrUG30fLLvB6lg4giHjY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651288/akrales_20210609_4596_0070.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 9i’s design is not as much of a head-turner as HP’s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bIk9iG"&gt;There’s not too much to say about the rest of this chassis. The backlit keyboard is acceptable and roomy, but a bit flatter than my favorites on the market. The device is fine-looking and sturdy enough, but it doesn’t have the same sleek professionalism as the Spectre x360 14 or the Surface Pro 7 Plus (and the prominent Lenovo logo on the hinge looks a bit corny to me). It’s not the lightest laptop around, but it’s still portable at 3.02 pounds. And the port selection is about as good as you might expect for a laptop this thin, including a USB 3.2 Type-A Gen 2, two Thunderbolt 4, and an audio combo jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSAzxy"&gt;There are some optional fancy features — an ultrasonic fingerprint reader, an edge-to-edge glass palm rest, a haptic touchpad, and a leather cover — that weren’t included on the model I was sent. Configurations with those extra features start around &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fcart%2F90ce9411-7e78-4b7e-8a0f-93c96d9ce36f%3FactiveTabName%3D%26transMessageFlag%3Dtrue&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22569871%2Flenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,769.99&lt;/a&gt;, currently discounted to $1,239.99 on Lenovo’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oum5W9"&gt;The Yoga 9i starts at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fyoga%2Fyoga-2-in-1-series%2FYoga-9-14ITL5%2Fp%2F82BGCTO1WWENUS0%2Fcustomize%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22569871%2Flenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,299.99&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1745728072503349543" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,449.99 as tested&lt;/a&gt;). The base model includes a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of RAM (soldered), and 256GB of storage (PCIe SSD). This specific configuration comes with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage as well as a Core i7-1185G7 (Intel’s top chip for thin and light devices). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrnJ4D"&gt;The Yoga 9i is verified through Intel’s Evo platform, as are many of its competitors in the premium 2-in-1 space. To qualify, laptops are supposed to offer a number of Intel-selected benefits, including Thunderbolt 4, Wi-Fi 6, all-day battery life, quick boot time, fast charging, and responsive performance on battery. In my experience, check, check, and check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WRj3ZzKZYMY3aoVq5Jrq89P1Aiw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651283/akrales_20210609_4596_0036.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Yoga 9i’s keyboard and trackpad are adequate but nothing special.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ktjxoF"&gt;Performance was as satisfactory as we’d expect from the top-notch 1185G7. The system blazed through a load of 20ish Chrome tabs and booted up noticeably faster than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21174917/lenovo-yoga-c740-review-laptop-specs-features-price-2-in-1-convertible" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th Gen Yoga systems&lt;/a&gt; would. Intel’s Iris Xe graphics are more than capable of running some games, as long as you’re not expecting 60fps from anything too demanding. Battery life was also a pleasant surprise, given the power of the processor. I averaged eight hours and 25 minutes of continuous use, with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yiwUqZ"&gt;As far as video calling goes, the 9i’s webcam is a bit grainy but serviceable; it has a physical privacy shutter, though it’s very tiny and can be clumsy to move if you have large fingers. The camera doesn’t support Windows Hello (which is a bit disappointing — other top convertibles at this price point like Spectres and Surfaces do have this feature), but there is a fingerprint sensor beneath the arrow keys that you can use to log in. It had trouble identifying my finger once or twice but was quick and accurate otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZF3eb"&gt;The 9i also has two dual-array microphones. These are useful not just for video calling (where they picked up my voice just fine) but for Amazon Alexa, which comes preinstalled on the Yoga. Not only can smart home devotees give Alexa voice commands via the Yoga, but they can also activate Amazon’s Show Mode, which will change the Yoga’s home screen to look like the home screen of an Echo smart display. Hey, don’t let me stop you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVyMb6"&gt;My one disappointment here is bloatware. The Yoga 9i doesn’t come loaded with a ton of junk like some budget computers do, but it does force McAfee LiveSafe on you. McAfee alerts were popping up all over the place while I set the device up, and sometimes even appeared in windows in the middle of my screen and interrupted what I was doing. The program is a pain to uninstall, requiring you to close all of your tabs and then to restart your computer. It’s not a huge issue in the grand scheme of things, but it rubs me the wrong way to see this on a $1,500 laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VqpB6VCPsWUJ7cytwEESzah9uBM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651294/akrales_20210609_4596_0133.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Yoga 9i carries on Lenovo’s heritage of convertible laptops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Trdd8B"&gt;Overall, though, I have very few complaints. The Yoga 9i is an excellent 2-in-1 with standout audio. But is it &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;best? To answer that, we need to compare it to HP’s Spectre x360 14, the reigning monarch of the 14-inch convertible sphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ip7Vbf"&gt;At MSRP, the Spectre is &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeLenovoYoga9i070921&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2FConfigureView%3FlangId%3D-1%26storeId%3D10151%26catalogId%3D10051%26catEntryId%3D3074457345619782318%26urlLangId%3D%26quantity%3D1%26color%3Dnatural%2Bsilver" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$180 more than the Yoga&lt;/a&gt; for identical specs (though it has Intel’s Core i7-1165G7, a slight step down from the 1185G7). Its main advantage over the Yoga is its design. The Spectre is a really beautiful laptop with gold accents and beveled edges; it wouldn’t look out of place in a jewelry store. The Yoga 9i, while far from ugly, will look just about like every other laptop you’ll see in a given business meeting or lecture hall. Another significant advantage the Spectre has is the 3:2 aspect ratio, which is more roomy and comfortable for multitasking use than the Yoga’s 16:9 panel. And the Spectre is just a little bit better in many other areas. I like the keyboard just a bit more, there’s one additional port (a microSD slot, which can be quite valuable for extra storage), the webcam is better, it’s a teensy bit lighter, and it gave me around two more hours of battery life per charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2F6Id"&gt;So the Yoga 9i ultimately doesn’t take the Spectre’s crown. Still, it delivers such standout audio — a realm where so many expensive laptops are flatly terrible — that I’m glad it exists as an option for people who really value the quality of their music and movie soundtracks. And the 9i is certainly functional enough in every other area that if you’re looking for a convertible and the Spectre is out of your price range or if standout audio and a garaged stylus are priorities for you, it’s one to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="H6VjHU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10644295"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>As Marvel’s epics get bigger, Black Widow’s stakes feel too small</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CGd_ah5QSw-KFX7SNJ7FmkXc548=/1171x0:3736x1710/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69560826/nya2960_comp_v013_dd87654e.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BVyDdG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; was released at the wrong time, in multiple ways. The new Marvel prequel was one of the most high-profile films to be displaced by the constantly shifting theatrical release schedule caused by the shuttering of theaters due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; — a film set between &lt;em&gt;Captain America: Civil War&lt;/em&gt;’s superhero dust-up and &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Infinity War&lt;/em&gt;’s cosmos-spanning epic — feels like a movie that should have been released when it’s actually set, instead of as a belated prequel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jF2yee"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: spoilers ahead for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Widow,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avengers: Endgame, Loki, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and the general Marvel Cinematic Universe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-t1-5t0LoKZAGMtNstrHzEmb2s8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706938/bft2060_trl_comp_8bda88b5.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RX6uL6"&gt;It’s not that &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; is a bad movie or an unworthy member of the Marvel saga. Its brand of James Bond-esque spy-fi harks back to some of the more grounded MCU films like &lt;em&gt;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;, less focused on superpowered smack-downs in favor of more traditional action movie fare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5ZyWp"&gt;And if it had been released in 2016 after &lt;em&gt;Civil War&lt;/em&gt;, that would have been fine. But Marvel’s films have undergone vast shifts in tone since then. &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt; opened up the connected universe to straight-up magic, &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt; both offered galaxy-spanning adventures with whole planets at stake, and of course, &lt;em&gt;Infinity War &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Endgame &lt;/em&gt;see the Avengers — and Natasha Romanov — fight to save quite literally all of existence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HWxTT"&gt;After all that, &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;’s stakes feel low, especially for a character that fans have gotten to see in action in far bigger adventures for over a decade. For all the joking about how Thor could handle the Red Room without breaking a sweat, the over-the-top reality that is the regular day-to-day of the modern Marvel shows and movies hangs over &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;’s throwback style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ejhqaq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nothing about Black Widow needs it to be a prequel&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eW9Y10"&gt;Nothing in &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;’s story really necessitates it to be a prequel, either. Sure, it’s fun to see where Natasha gets her &lt;em&gt;Infinity War&lt;/em&gt; get-up from. But outside of its post-credit setup (which is set in the MCU’s post-&lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt; “present”), there’s no story element or revelation about Natasha’s character that would be different had the film been released a half-decade earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oQjpE"&gt;In fact, knowing Natasha has this found family to protect (one that the rest of the Avengers didn’t know about) could have arguably deepened her short-shrifted sacrifice in &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt;. Imagine if Natasha’s adopted sister or parents were lost in Thanos’ snap, and the sequence where she fights with Hawkeye over who gets to fling themselves off a cliff has the added weight of trying to bring them back, too. (Instead, we had Clint as the only one to potentially have to sacrifice being with his family.) &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OOX0M4"&gt;Contrast that with &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;. The show is airing on Disney Plus right as &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; comes out, and it also examines an older version of a Marvel character in a new light. But where &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; is using that perspective to re-examine what makes its titular character tick, and what separates the version of Loki then from the more heroic one fans were familiar with, &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t give Natasha the chance to change or grow. She’s already at the end of her journey, fully formed — she’s just the only one who doesn’t know it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PlVlJh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; also suffers from COVID-related delays; Disney is only releasing it now because it’s running out of time, thematically. Its interconnected web of shows and movies means that Marvel can’t advance with series like &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; (which will directly follow up &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;’s post-credits scene). But it also means that &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;’s comparatively grounded and realistic adventure is coming after &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s sorcerous saga or &lt;em&gt;Loki’&lt;/em&gt;s era-spanning epic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2NB8v"&gt;It’s not that &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t try to raise the stakes, establishing Dreykov’s army of Widows as some kind of massive, political force that secretly controls the world. But once you get cosmic magical space mysteries as the norm, it’s hard to go back to “spies, but better” as your table stakes. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SxODutR0Ljr8xw4pVSqnx15PbtE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706955/fbg7020_comp_v003_bf38a189.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ljdomt"&gt;There’s a world where Marvel was willing to commit to a film led by one of its female characters in 2016 instead of 2019 (when &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt; finally broke the MCU’s decade-long streak of male protagonists), where &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; serves as a spotlight on Natasha’s origins ahead of her ultimate sacrifice, and where the stakes are still aligned with the studio’s other properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlZXaA"&gt;Based on the trailer for Marvel’s next theatrical bow, Shang-Chi is about to punch a dragon in the face with magic space rings. And next to that, it’s hard not to feel like &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;’s brand of more grounded spy action is too little, too late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BnFeA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QT6v7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alto’s Odyssey is adding a vibrant new city for its Apple Arcade debut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Md23lF_0-J-SEU6XdwJ2VOMqN9s=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69560629/06_TheLostCity.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MOYytX"&gt;When the team behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/21/17035830/altos-odyssey-sequel-iphone-game-ios-adventure-snowboarding"&gt;the serene adventure &lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were working on the sequel, they had a lot of ideas that didn’t make it into the final release. One of those was a vibrant city that would be the game’s fourth biome, joining the existing desert, canyons, and ancient temples. For various reasons, the city was cut from the final release. But when the chance came to bring the game to Apple Arcade as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"&gt;the streaming service’s recent expansion&lt;/a&gt;, it made sense to go back to the concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8kTN8"&gt;The result is &lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City&lt;/em&gt;, which is coming to Arcade next week. “We’re thinking of &lt;em&gt;The Lost City&lt;/em&gt; as a special edition of &lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;,” says lead artist and designer Harry Nesbitt. “We’ve been able to go back to the drawing board a little bit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WrSJwG"&gt;The core of the game will remain the same as the original version. That means &lt;em&gt;The Lost City&lt;/em&gt; is an endless runner, where players ride a sandboard across a procedurally-generated desert landscape. It’s a mix of chill and challenge that has made the series so enduring. The Apple Arcade version simply adds a new area — but one that really changes the tone. “It’s very much a living, breathing city,” says Nesbitt. “It’s not a dusty ruin or empty wilderness like some of the other spaces we’ve depicted. It’s vibrant and alive, and has almost a party atmosphere to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQV06y"&gt;One of the challenges, he says, was making sure that the new area wasn’t too much of a jolt to players. The team didn’t want players jumping straight from a quiet desert to a bustling city, which is where the procedural aspect of &lt;em&gt;Alto&lt;/em&gt; came in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AL5b6UbGGx7i85CABYZUm6NPEbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22707013/alto_tlc_the_verge.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Snowman&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GLzGDA"&gt;“It’s definitely something we tried to be careful with,” he explains. “We don’t want it to be jarring in any sense. But because it’s a procedural game, we already have a natural progression for revealing new content to players. We try not to throw everything at them at once; we try to pace it out so that one thing leads to another. Just as you’re getting comfortable with one aspect of the game, a new thread opens up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CAT52j"&gt;The expanded version of the game also offered a chance to build on the storytelling, something that’s grown over the course of the series. While the &lt;em&gt;Alto&lt;/em&gt; games don’t have an explicit story with cutscenes or dialogue, there is clear worldbuilding going on. As Nesbitt explains it, the developers want players to feel like there’s more that “exists beyond the edges of the screen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJGBLL"&gt;And while the idea dates back a few years, the current version of &lt;em&gt;The Lost City&lt;/em&gt; was inspired in part by the pandemic, and the fact that so many of us have been trapped inside, largely unable to travel or experience the outdoors. “I think &lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; has always been a little bit about the idea of traveling and going outside of your comfort zone,” says Nesbitt, “and &lt;em&gt;The Lost City&lt;/em&gt; is a natural extension of that idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVTcEL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City&lt;/em&gt; launches on Apple Arcade on July 16th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo Switch OLED hands-on: a small upgrade that makes a big difference</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new Nintendo Switch OLED model" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/epssfWeIICac3HtsYCg_eiFbS_U=/0x0:5400x3600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69560633/NintendoSwitchOLEDmodel_Tabletop_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Nintendo Switch OLED model.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6lfuGx"&gt;Sitting down in Nintendo’s offices in Redwood City, California, yesterday, I already knew all of the main details on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565307/nintendo-oled-switch-screen-news-updates"&gt;new Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt;. It has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22566479/oled-nintendo-switch-vs-lite-screen-size"&gt;larger 7-inch OLED screen&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand"&gt;improved kickstand&lt;/a&gt;, increased internal storage, and very minor design tweaks. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565118/nintendo-oled-switch-cpu-ram-bluetooth-audio-headphones-dock-no-4k"&gt;not the “Switch Pro”&lt;/a&gt; that many have been hoping for. It’s just a Switch with a bigger, nicer screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DvUkq"&gt;I knew all that going in, but after playing a half-hour’s worth of &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild,&lt;/em&gt; I believe the word “just” in the previous sentence is unfair. The Switch OLED model has a bigger, nicer screen, and that’s more than enough to justify its existence — and perhaps its $350 price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Szsjr"&gt;The screen looks brighter and more vibrant to me than the original Switch. The increased contrast is definitely noticeable on Rainbow Road, where the neon lights popped out of the screen more brightly compared to the darker background. I’ve also been using a Switch Lite for the past year or so, and its screen looks positively dim and muddy by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWEOxp"&gt;One concern I had was that increasing the screen size while staying at the same 720p resolution would make pixels stick out and some things would look jagged. Pixels were more visible when I stopped the action and looked for them. I could see some subpar antialiasing on thin text on the home screen and on the blades of grass surrounding Link on the Great Plateau. But once I was actually &lt;em&gt;playing,&lt;/em&gt; all I saw is that the screen was bigger and everything looked brighter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaiFBs"&gt;To get really nerdy: I don’t have a definitive answer to whether the OLED screen uses a Pentile or RGB layout at the sub-pixel level, but it looks like RGB to me. At 7 inches diagonal, my sense is that Pentile would be obvious even to people who aren’t normally annoyed by it (like me). Photos weren’t allowed at the briefing, so I can’t show you a close-up image of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DLdR9m"&gt;But getting nerdy about the new Switch OLED model is overthinking it. The point of this midlife update isn’t to radically change or upgrade the Switch. It’s to make a version that feels just a little more premium and is a little more enjoyable in handheld mode. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new kickstand on the Switch is greatly improved over the original" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MbuAROgKV9qbzJCtuzZIUN1x7-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22707189/NintendoSwitchOLEDmodel_AdjustableStand_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new kickstand on the Switch is greatly improved over the original.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ewNTdG"&gt;I also have nothing but praise for the new kickstand, which is finally good. The original Switch’s kickstand was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/11/5/16602556/nintendo-switch-kickstand-problems-bad"&gt;so bad&lt;/a&gt; I never tried to use it. This one goes across the entire length of the device and can be adjusted to any angle down to nearly flat. It’s stable, too, offering just enough resistance to hold the console up but not enough to make changing its position a pain. I could just lightly press on the top of the Switch while in tabletop mode to adjust the angle and get rid of the glare from an overhead light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6uVp0T"&gt;The last noticeable change is the speakers, which are a bit louder and have just a little more clarity than the Switch Lite I’ve been using. I still prefer headphones (and no, there’s no surprise support for Bluetooth headphones), but these speakers are probably good enough to keep me from reaching for them every time I turn the Switch on like I do now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u1i4n9"&gt;There are a lot of other less important design tweaks. The fan vents on the bottom point downward instead of backward (to accommodate the new kickstand). The bezel around the larger screen is glossy black now instead of matte. The position of the microSD card slot is a little different.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new Nintendo Switch OLED model has an updated dock with ethernet." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/45djf0iouwMIFpUALhSfXKFp1n4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22707192/NintendoSwitchOLEDmodel_03.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Nintendo Switch OLED model has an updated dock with ethernet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nmw9qY"&gt;The dock has an ethernet port on it. I didn’t get a chance to play in docked mode, but the output hasn’t changed from the current Switch’s 1080p, and the processor is the same. If you play docked more often than not, none of the hardware upgrades on the OLED model apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJXuKT"&gt;Overall, I think Nintendo has very slightly improved the overall fit and finish of the hardware. It still feels a little toy-like, but it’s a nicer toy with a nicer finish. Whether that will extend to Joy-Con controllers that are less likely to suffer from drift remains to be seen, but I don’t think Nintendo has done anything notably different — they’re completely compatible with existing controllers, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQ0YsH"&gt;So the Nintendo Switch OLED model justifies its existence, but does it justify an &lt;em&gt;upgrade&lt;/em&gt;? For most people, the responsible answer is no. The improvements here are not going to unlock new game experiences or capabilities, they just make the current experiences a little nicer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqLk6V"&gt;I don’t think I’m going to be responsible, though. I knew going in that it was “just” a Switch with a bigger, brighter screen. I know after playing it that handheld mode feels like much less of a compromise than it does today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoCW02"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
