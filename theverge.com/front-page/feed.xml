    <title>Netflix’s Arcane is a slick and exciting intro to League of Legends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eEY9sMVp5sF8cH4Pqbx5wSSAxd8=/240x0:1545x870/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70106449/Vi_fight.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TWXeqg"&gt;For years, fans have been wondering just when the heck &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; developer Riot would make an animated series. It seemed inevitable. The studio previously created stunning animated shorts to promote everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336218/league-of-legends-yone-anime-cinematic-riot-games"&gt;new characters&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700154/league-of-legends-world-2021-anthem-music-video"&gt;esports tournaments&lt;/a&gt;. And with an increasing focus on expanding &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;’s storytelling — something that’s tough to do within the confines of a team-based strategy game — a show made a whole lot of sense. Now, it’s real, with a nine-episode series called &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;. The best part: not only is it a lot of fun, but you don’t have to know anything about &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; to get into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTbT6U"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; is set (mostly) in a city called Piltover early on, which is on the verge of a big change that could impact the entirety of the fantasy realm of Runeterra: a pair of scientists are figuring out a way to harness the dangerous power of magic to use in everything from weapons to tools to transportation. Amidst this backdrop, the show follows a handful of characters throughout the city. Things start out with a street kid named Vi leading a small gang to a big score, heading to the upper reaches of the city to steal some expensive-looking gadgets. The heist, naturally, goes bad and ends with some exploding crystals. The perspective then shifts to the likes of the aforementioned scientists and an underworld kingpin with lots of scars and a big grudge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gf5rGf"&gt;What’s great about &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;’s fantasy-meets-steampunk world is that it’s pretty easy to understand. The show doesn’t waste time with big lore dumps, nor does it expect you already know who these characters are. Vi, for instance, is one of &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;’s most popular characters, but the show serves mostly as an origin story for her and a few others. For fans, it’s a cool chance to see how some of these characters came to be — you even learn about Vi’s iconic gauntlets — but for everyone else, you’re being introduced to interesting people at a pivotal point in their lives. No prior knowledge necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="irZkb1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Svs_hl897c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hh1r2b"&gt;It helps that the story is relatively straightforward. There isn’t anything about &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; that I would call new or revolutionary. It’s a fairly typical fantasy tale that just happens to be really well done. The villains are intimidating, the would-be heroes are messy and relatable, the action is extremely satisfying to watch, and everything moves at a brisk pace. The best thing &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; has going for it is just how stylish it looks. Each frame looks like a gorgeous piece of hand-painted concept art; in motion, it’s like nothing I’ve ever seen. It’s also a world that feels lived-in and fully realized. The slums of Piltover have a toxic green look to them (police officers even wear masks when they venture in), while the upper levels are bright, airy, and luxurious. I especially loved all of the strange mechanical creations that help keep the city alive and bustling. What I’m saying is, after watching the first few episodes, I want an &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; art book ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4ZjAK"&gt;One of the more interesting things about the show is how it’s being released. It’s not an all-you-can-watch binge-fest, nor are episodes dropping weekly. Instead, &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; uses something of a hybrid format. The nine episodes are divided into chapters and are being released as three-episode bundles over the course of three weeks. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22579993/fear-street-netflix-horror-trilogy-summer-movie"&gt;It’s reminiscent of Netflix’s experimental &lt;em&gt;Fear Stree&lt;/em&gt;t trilogy of horror movies&lt;/a&gt;.) For the first chapter, at least, it works well because the three episodes have their own clear arc, while episode four picks up some time later, though that’s as far as I’ve watched so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEyNC8"&gt;Early on,&lt;em&gt; Arcane&lt;/em&gt; walks a fine line. It’s both a tribute and an introduction to a vast fantasy realm that’s been around for a decade and has millions of existing fans. Those viewers will find a story with some exciting Easter eggs and a deeper look at characters that have been around for ages. Everyone else is in for a surprisingly thrilling adventure that doesn’t skimp on style. Really, the most jarring thing for newcomers might be if they’re inspired to play &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; itself, which is decidedly lacking in the style and speed that make the show work so well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp may be working on a Communities feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sE8_Kr6c4stj8ukazGjMdrkuf1Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105878/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NnCDgO"&gt;Evidence is mounting that WhatsApp may be working on a Communities feature. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/whatsapp-new-community-feature-apk-teardown/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; first spotted&lt;/a&gt; the possibility in October, but now &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-working-on-communities/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; has come forward&lt;/a&gt; with similar findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjuvdZ"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;, the Communities feature appears to give group admins more power over groups. This includes the ability to create groups within groups, which may be similar to how channels are arranged beneath an umbrella Discord community.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="WhatsApp Communities feature" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yGOOzNKzFmslJfuWJ8wvNaYmB9I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22991747/whatsapp_communities_beta.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by WABetaInfo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zDSuEp"&gt;Admins may be able to invite new users via a Community Invite Link and then start messaging other members. It’s hard to tell how exactly these chats might look right now, but &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; notes that they appear to be end-to-end encrypted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwYVWd"&gt;It also looks like a subtle design change will help distinguish Communities from regular group chats. As &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; points out, community icons will be squares with rounded corners, a format that WhatsApp mistakenly enabled (and then quickly disabled) in October. There’s no word on when Communities will be officially rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ausP9C"&gt;By working on a Communities feature, WhatsApp may be trying to close the widening gap between it and other messaging apps like Telegram and Signal. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424769/whatsapp-privacy-policy-deadline-controversy-functionality"&gt;WhatsApp’s new privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; caused confusion among users about what it would share with parent company Facebook, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;sparking a mass exodus&lt;/a&gt; to those other apps. When &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;WhatsApp went down along with Facebook’s entire network&lt;/a&gt; of apps last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712191/telegram-70-million-new-users-facebook-outage-surge-whatsapp"&gt;Telegram gained a whopping 70 million users&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook reportedly is aware of the level of ‘problematic use’ among its users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4cl22QviTCKJZdg_pANy3B-TXbg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105825/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;More leaked documents suggest Facebook is aware of its problems | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DvIzrM"&gt;Facebook’s own internal research found 1 in 8 of its users reported compulsive social media use that interfered with their sleep, work, and relationships— what the social media platform calls “problematic use” but is more commonly known as “internet addiction,” the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-bad-for-you-360-million-users-say-yes-company-documents-facebook-files-11636124681"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="366TOG"&gt;The social media platform had a team focused on user well-being, which suggested ways to curb problematic use, some of which were put into place. But the company shut down the team in 2019, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NB488C"&gt;Pratiti Raychoudhury, a vice president of research for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;Meta, Facebook’s new parent&lt;/a&gt; company, writes in a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/wsj-report-ignores-our-approach-to-well-being-research/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; misrepresented the research (a claim the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/18/22681056/facebook-vp-disputes-report-wall-street-journal-instagram-teens-clegg"&gt;has made&lt;/a&gt; about some of the other articles the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; has produced based on Facebook’s internal documents).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TR3YR2"&gt;She says the company “has been engaged and supportive throughout our multiyear effort to better understand and empower people who use our services to manage problematic use. That’s why this work has taken place over multiple years, including now.” Raychoudhury argues that “problematic use does not equal addiction,” and that the company ships “features to help people manage their experiences on our apps and services.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6oc4d"&gt;The report is the latest in an ongoing series from the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; called the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;Facebook Files&lt;/a&gt;, based on internal documents provided by whistleblower Frances Haugen, which suggest Facebook is aware of the problems its platforms can cause. One set of reports, for instance, suggested Facebook knew that its Instagram platform was toxic for teenage users. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710371/facebook-whistleblower-congress-hearing-instagram-kids-safety-privacy-blumenthal"&gt;Haugen testified before Congress&lt;/a&gt; on October 5th, saying Facebook was “internally dysfunctional,” and that it was unlikely to change its behaviors without action from external regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7nE11f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Federal appeals court temporarily halts new Biden vaccine rule for companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of several vaccine vials over a pink and purple background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tXVMP7qOG7PCm3YyYVQStUPItZk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105574/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;New vaccine rules have been frozen by an appeals court | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QSYpdy"&gt;A federal appeals court on Saturday issued a stay against the Biden administration’s vaccine rules for US companies. The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22757969/biden-covid-vaccine-osha-cms-masking-federal-mandate"&gt;rule announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt; requires workers at businesses with 100 or more employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19, or submit to weekly testing. The rule requires affected companies to provide paid time for employees to get vaccinated, and to ensure any unvaccinated employees wear face masks while at work. The deadline for meeting the provisions is January 4th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhiljM"&gt;Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TXAG/status/1457045504710356999"&gt;petitioned for an emergency stay&lt;/a&gt; of the rule, which was to be enforced by the Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The petition was joined by attorneys general from Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Utah, and several private businesses and advocacy groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvUpzR"&gt;The three-judge panel with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals &lt;a href="https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/unpub/21/21-60845.0.pdf"&gt;said Saturday&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) that it was issuing the stay “because the petitions give cause to believe there are grave statutory and constitutional issues with the mandate.” The court didn’t provide additional detail for why it issued the stay, but the Biden administration now has until 5PM ET on Monday to respond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQIJFu"&gt;Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda said in a statement that the Labor Department was “confident” it has the legal authority to issue the rule, and was prepared to defend it in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TjBATH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Someone stole an entire shipment of EVGA RTX graphics cards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wMEddsflyzWfObLzoVgC8IHoc-k=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105438/twarren_20210601_4611_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="emXcPL"&gt;As if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22363232/global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-pandemic-consoles-cpus-graphics-cards-cars"&gt;the chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; didn’t make it hard enough to get our hands on graphics cards, criminals are making it a heck of a lot worse. According to &lt;a href="https://forums.evga.com/Notice-of-Stolen-EVGA-GeForce-RTX-30Series-Graphics-Cards-m3490851.aspx"&gt;a forum post by EVGA product manager Jacob Freeman&lt;/a&gt;, thieves made off with a whole truckload of EVGA RTX 30-Series graphics cards. The graphic cards were in transit from San Francisco to EVGA’s southern California distribution center at the time of the theft, and it remains unclear how many cards were affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CIyZgg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If a user does end up acquiring a stolen card, we will address [it] on a case by case basis”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t613zi"&gt;If you think you may have a card that was involved in this theft, you can find out by entering your card’s serial number on &lt;a href="https://www.evga.com/warranty/check.asp"&gt;EVGA’s warranty status page&lt;/a&gt;. You can also check by attempting to register your card on the &lt;a href="https://forums.evga.com/Notice-of-Stolen-EVGA-GeForce-RTX-30Series-Graphics-Cards-m3490851.aspx"&gt;My Products&lt;/a&gt; section of this site — if you can properly register your card, you can rest assured that it wasn’t snatched from the shipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zr7V1k"&gt;The post warns users that it’s illegal to “buy or receive” stolen goods, as well as “conceal, sell, withhold, or aid in concealing selling or withholding” that property. EVGA also says that it “will not register or honor any warranty or upgrade claims“ on stolen cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5rOjC"&gt;Freeman couldn’t give &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; any more details about the truck heist due to an ongoing police investigation, however, he did say in an email that “If a user has a question we urge them to contact us [at] &lt;a href="mailto:stopRTX30theft@evga.com"&gt;stopRTX30theft@evga.com&lt;/a&gt;. If a user does end up acquiring a stolen card, we will address [it] on a case by case basis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N44g9f"&gt;This isn’t the first time that a large shipment of graphics cards has been stolen, and, unfortunately, it’s probably not the last. At the end of 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22164020/thieves-ps5-rtx-3090-out-of-stock-reselling"&gt;about $340,000 worth of GeForce RTX 3090s&lt;/a&gt; were stolen from MSI’s factory in mainland China. Graphics cards have become a prime target for thieves and scalpers — the MSRP for an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 is $1,499 but if scalpers have their way, this can skyrocket to $2,000 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stranger Things 4 will have a summer 2022 release date</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wsXjbNl8B7lcdFbb4eduOtXYTwA=/360x0:1628x845/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105313/eleven_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Eleven is back for Season 4 of Netflix’s Stranger Things series | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1ZQMpp4BdU&amp;amp;ab_channel=StrangerThings" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X07yfR"&gt;Netflix &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/netflix/status/1457045171367989251"&gt;tweeted Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4 &lt;/em&gt;will premiere in the summer of 2022. While not a precise release date, it’s at least something for fans of Netflix’s flagship supernatural series, who have waited through months of delays and a seemingly endless parade of mysterious teasers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlL6gs"&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/6/22765252/stranger-things-4-teaser-trailer-2022-release-date-netflix"&gt;teaser dropped Saturday&lt;/a&gt; as well, showing Eleven in California, adjusting to her new life and school. She writes in a letter to Mike that everything is great (even though we see her classmates being mean to her), and says she can’t wait for spring break. But of course, our girl can’t have anything nice last for too long; after a fade to black, we get some eerie music under shots of a roller rink and Eleven looking afraid, along with helicopters, explosions, and Joyce recoiling from a creepy looking doll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7O337"&gt;We also got a look at the titles for all nine of the season 4 episodes for the first time. They will be called: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRP63l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hellfire Club, Vecna’s Curse, The Monster and The Superhero, Dear Billy, The Nina Project, The Dive, The Massacre At Hawkins Lab, Papa&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Piggyback&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Amqf3v"&gt;These do not sound like episodes where a lot of good times will be had by our heroine and her crew. And &lt;em&gt;Papa &lt;/em&gt;is what Eleven called Dr. Martin Brenner (Matthew Modine), whose return was signaled in an earlier season 4 &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;amp;v=ILwLN6hV-X8&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;amp;ab_channel=StrangerThings"&gt;teaser&lt;/a&gt; where we heard his voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="atF6yb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;What's in a name?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stranger Things 4 premiering Summer 2022. &lt;a href="https://t.co/leznp8XJbh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/leznp8XJbh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix (@netflix) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1457045171367989251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CMPrqy"&gt;The new announcements come as part of Netflix’s celebration of “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Stranger_Things/status/1456622489971343360"&gt;Stranger Things Day&lt;/a&gt;,” which is meant to “commemorate” the in-universe date of November 6th, 1983 — the day that Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) first disappeared into the dark Upside-Down dimension in the first season of &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things. &lt;/em&gt;(If one was feeling less charitable, one could also attribute it to a cynical and slightly desperate attempt to try and create a cash-in fan holiday for one of its most popular genre shows like May 4th’s “Star Wars Day.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wqyZHw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;November 6, 1983. The day Will Byers disappeared and the world turned upside down. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StrangerThingsDay?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StrangerThingsDay&lt;/a&gt; returns tomorrow   &lt;a href="https://t.co/sRVrGwtvi0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/sRVrGwtvi0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Stranger Things (@Stranger_Things) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Stranger_Things/status/1456622489971343360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uGA3Ip"&gt;It’s been a longer than usual wait for the fourth season after &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 3 — &lt;/em&gt;which was released in July 2019 — due to a months-long delay in production caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which shut down filming on &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4 &lt;/em&gt;after just two weeks in early 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="to4XIi"&gt;Netflix hasn’t wasted any of that time, though, with a plethora of teasers for the fourth season that it’s been steadily releasing over the past several months, including one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137590/netflix-stranger-things-4-trailer-character-teaser-missing-return"&gt;teases the return of a fan-favorite character&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422642/stranger-things-4-new-trailer-netflix-eleven"&gt;one that delves into Eleven’s dark past&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22688804/stranger-things-season-4-teaser-trailer-watch-netflix"&gt;and one that sets up a new spooky location, the Creel House&lt;/a&gt; (which presumably will feature in the upcoming fourth season). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 6 appears to fall short of expected 30W charging speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pNfsde9ODBND2xI1T3rhqcMqQww=/162x0:1935x1182/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105137/Google_Pixel_6_Pro__Alt_Angle_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HQ0Ucz"&gt;When Google released the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, it boasted about the devices’ fast-charging capabilities. Plugging a Pixel 6 series device into its &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_30w_charger"&gt;$25 30W Fast Charger&lt;/a&gt; — which isn’t even included in the box — is supposed to take full advantage of the phone’s fast charging speed, juicing it up to 50 percent in just 30 minutes. We all can agree that this is an impressive spec, but unfortunately, it may not be totally realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tz4HxR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-6-charging-test-3051231/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; put the Pixel 6’s fast charging speed to the test, and its findings suggest that &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7158570"&gt;Google’s spec sheet&lt;/a&gt; is misleading. After trying out the 30W charger with the Pixel 6, &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; found that the Pixel 6 doesn’t fully harness the power of the charger — instead, it only hits a maximum charging speed of just 22W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R5zDeA"&gt;
&lt;div class="infogram-embed" data-id="_/XhxOon5FbW8f2n44upZj" data-type="interactive" data-title="Google Pixel 6 Pro Fast Charging Test"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&amp;&amp;window[t].initialized)window[t].process&amp;&amp;window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zeJxCm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; notes that the charger took about 111 minutes to fully charge the Pixel 6 Pro’s 5,000mAh battery with its Adaptive Charging and Adaptive Battery settings switched off. Google is right; the device takes about 31 minutes for a 50 percent charge, however, filling up that final 50 percent takes much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6Q6Vy"&gt;The phone’s charging speed appears to dip all the way to 12W at 75 percent, and then 2.5W when the battery gets close to full, taking a whole hour to fill up the final 15 percent. While it’s normal for charging speeds to taper off over time to prevent damage to the battery and stave off high temperatures, dropping down to a mere 2.5W is still unusual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Gqelqf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The charger took a total of 111 minutes to fully charge the Pixel 6 Pro’s 5,000mAh battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MNYf1K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; even compared the charging speeds of the 30W Fast Charger with the 18W Power Delivery unit that Google included with older Pixels. It found that the 30W charger barely offers any improvement in terms of speed, as it takes 121 minutes to charge the Pixel 6 Pro with the 18W charger — only 10 minutes slower than the 30W Fast Charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyEKEy"&gt;This corroborates what we noticed during our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;hands-on Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro review&lt;/a&gt;. We pointed out that while both support fast charging, neither seemed to fuel up that fast. Also in line with &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;’s findings, we noted that Google throttles the charging speed after reaching 80 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcSQMf"&gt;Google doesn’t explicitly say that the Pixel 6 has a charging rate of 30W; it just says that both phones support “up to 50 percent charge in 30 minutes with Google 30W USB-C Charger with USB-PD 3.0 (PPS)” on its spec sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYAfGD"&gt;But it still doesn’t make sense that Google would promote the Fast Charger if the Pixel 6 can’t take full advantage of it. Not to mention that Google is encouraging users to buy the charger under the guise that it really does provide lightning-fast charging rates — is 10 minutes really worth an extra $25?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84waxz"&gt;Google is also set to release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22732918/google-pixel-stand-23w-wireless-charging"&gt;a second-gen $79 Google Pixel Stand fast wireless charger&lt;/a&gt; sometime in the near future. The &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_stand_2nd_gen"&gt;“superfast wireless charger” is listed as&lt;/a&gt; providing charging speeds of up to 23W “for compatible Pixel phones,” which is closer to the 22W charging rate that the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro tops out at. It remains unclear why Google would give more realistic expectations for the upcoming wireless charger, and not for the 30W Fast Charger. We reached out to Google with a request for comment on the situation and didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack in the Box suing crypto exchange FTX, says it ‘brazenly’ copied its Jack mascot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/azq-zc8UuSV_K7m9z7qUGLR79w0=/184x0:903x479/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105071/jack_mascots.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jack in the Box is suing a crypto exchange it says copied its longtime mascot. Left is Moon Man, right is Jack.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WUuzEN"&gt;Restaurant chain Jack in the Box says it is suing cryptocurrency exchange FTX because it “brazenly and illegally copied or derived its ‘Moon Man’ mascot” from its established Jack mascot, and is doing damage to the Jack in the Box brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="viRPw6"&gt;In a lawsuit filed in federal court in the Northern District of California this week, Jack in the Box claims that FTX’s Moon Man character, aka Lou Nar, “has a spherical white head also affixed to a talking human actor, with blue-dotted eyes, a nose, and a smile,” which is “strikingly similar to Jack. Both change their facial expressions and clothing throughout ads and appearances,” the suit maintains. Moon Man, however, is a “far inferior version” of Jack, the restaurant chain argues, and is  “tarnishing Jack’s reputation to consumers, and/or blurring consumers’ association of FTX’s Moon Man with Jack.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOeH5h"&gt;The company pointed to tweets about ads featuring Moon Man that were aired during a Major League Baseball game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CQVxmw"&gt;...viewers of that baseball game shared their reactions on Twitter as to who the “big head” might be, with one user posting a picture of Jack, stating that the Moon Man is the “Jack in the Box mascot.” Other members of the public have made statements such as “Oh look, it’s Walmart Jack in the Box!”, “Is it a dirty jack in the box thing?”, and “Jack in the Box’s drugged up cousin”, among others, which all demonstrate that viewers were associating the Moon Man with Jack. One Twitter user even tweeted a public post directly to FTX stating, “Hey, @FTX_Official, your mascot doesn’t look like the moon. He looks like Jack-In-The-Box with skin cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="j2wTln"&gt;Jack in the Box served FTX with a cease-and-desist letter on October 15th, according to the lawsuit, notifying the crypto exchange that it was “infringing on JITB’s intellectual property and diluting its trademarks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Zjv90"&gt;In response, FTX said it would continue to use Moon Man in advertising, the lawsuit claims, saying that “Jack in the Box has only narrow protection limited to the behatted ping pong-headed clown who exploded out of a box to sell burgers.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6t2uUHzEjwV9e0A_eLl5Lf4NK7s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22991323/jack_moon_man_2.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Moon Man (left) and Jack (right). &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JvFTda"&gt;Jack in the Box says the Jack mascot was first released in 1951, and it’s gone through a few iterations since. At first Jack was a “clown-like spherical head that sat atop drive-thru boxes to ease customers into the then-novel concept of drive-thru restaurants,” according to the suit, then in 1970 it became more clown-like, with green hair and a large rainbow collar added. The company “reimagined” the mascot in 1995, into the current version: a “humorous no-nonsense businessman”  who “appears like a typical adult human male, with the exception of his large, spherical white head, blue dot eyes, nose, and curvy smile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8blFM"&gt;The suit was first reported by legal news site &lt;a href="https://www.law360.com/securities/articles/1438006/jack-in-the-box-says-crypto-exchange-ripped-off-its-mascot?copied=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Law360&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Neither Jack in the Box nor FTX replied to requests for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hzpOQ"&gt;Jack in the Box says FTX has infringed on its copyright and diluted its trademark, and is seeking unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Riot swapped a live show for a massive music video at Worlds 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8KMRUcaWN5Nif_mRpQI_ohGKsOs=/0x2:8033x5357/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70104983/CYW_WorldsOC_Set_015.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w9008O"&gt;Every year, one of the highlights of the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;World Championship is the opening ceremonies. It’s been a regular chance for developer Riot to create a real-world spectacle ahead of the big game. In the past that’s meant everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959206/league-of-legends-worlds-2019-opening-ceremony-holograms-holonet"&gt;holographic musical performances&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/31/21541871/league-of-legends-world-championship-worlds-2020-opening-ceremony-ar-kda"&gt;an appearance from an augmented reality K-pop group&lt;/a&gt;. In 2021, though, things went in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kV6afJ"&gt;Without an audience in attendance due to COVID-19 restrictions, Riot instead went with a pre-produced series of music videos that featured gigantic real-world sets spliced with moments from the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Arcane &lt;/em&gt;animated series. It may not have been a live performance, but it was still impressive. “This is really what feature films do, what Marvel does,” says Matt Kauth, head of production at London Alley Entertainment, which worked with Riot on the piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CyxJhq"&gt;What premiered before Worlds’ championship match was essentially a 13-minute-long short film that combined animation, music videos, and physical sets. It featured a handful of performances from the likes of Imagine Dragons and Bea Miller, interspersed with animated vignettes from &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;, which debuts on Netflix this evening. The idea of mixing live-action and CG isn’t exactly new, but part of what makes the Worlds event work so well is the sprawling real-world sets designed to look like Zaun and Piltover, two iconic cities from &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; (which are featured prominently in the Netflix show).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/54IkKp1SE5jQb4vgTiCY1mQ1kEg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989614/CYW_WorldsOC_BTS_031.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Riot&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZFlsQ"&gt;“These are the biggest sets that we’ve ever done, and it’s probably not even close,” says Kauth, whose studio has worked on music videos for the likes of Lil Nas X and The Weeknd. “We shot this whole piece over three days in Los Angeles and three days in Birmingham, UK. It is also the busiest it has ever been in the production landscape right now. Both because we’re coming out of the other side of covid, but also because all of the streaming that’s happening. It’s never been busier, and crews are very hard to come by. The LA shoot, we were literally taking construction members rolling off of TV shows. And adding new crew members every single day in order to meet this time frame.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9zgMP"&gt;Music videos were always part of the plan. But initially Riot had hoped to incorporate a live element as well. That changed when the company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22649691/league-of-legends-world-championships-2021-europe"&gt;forced to move the event from Shenzhen, China to Reykjavík, Iceland&lt;/a&gt; due to covid concerns. “We actually always intended for there to be this integration of music videos and more cinematic performances,” says Nick Troop, executive producer of the event for Riot. “Even when Worlds was still situated in Shenzhen, we were going to shoot these videos this way. This was the general plan. And part of the magic of the stadium show was going to be to build this interplay between the live show and the stuff that was pre-recorded, and use that to elevate what was happening in-stadium.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0K8pHF"&gt;The focus on physical sets is a contrast to past Worlds, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21529317/league-of-legends-world-championship-high-tech-stage-riot-mandalorian"&gt;new technologies like mixed reality were on full display&lt;/a&gt;. Part of the reason for the choice was practical. With a short timeline to finish the production, the physical sets would put less strain on the various VFX teams that worked on it. If the videos had been shot with a green screen, for instance, it would’ve taken much longer to finish because artists would’ve had to design the backdrops virtually from scratch. “Our goal was to make sure that we were capturing as much in-camera as possible, so that when we handed the baton off to the VFX departments, they had enough to work with,” explains Kauth. (Even still, five different studios and 230 people worked on wrapping the post-production effects.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/03XLnCzxuB-LRHthD2kgr4B-J3w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989619/CYW_WorldsOC_BTS_094.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Riot&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WJCOLz"&gt;But the IRL sets were also chosen because Riot thought it would help differentiate the opening ceremonies from the many other virtual performances that have been happening of late, particularly during the pandemic. Plus, it just looked cool. “You can feel when it’s real,” says Troop. “You live in a rendered world for the most part when you interact with &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. Here is one of a handful of opportunities to bring it to life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tigilh"&gt;It’s typical for large-scale movie productions, like those from Marvel, to utilize both large sets and multiple effects studio partners. But Kauth says it’s rare for shorter form projects like this. Not only did it help make the opening ceremonies look impressive, he says, but having so many people working on it also helped make it a more sustainable production where teams were able to largely avoid crunch. “It’s a film and TV approach to hit the deadline and not burn a single company into the ground,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tr6KvA"&gt;As impressive as the 2021 ceremony was, there is definitely something missing without an in-person audience. It’s hard for the team to know if viewers are into it without the roar of a crowd inside of a stadium. In lieu of that this year, they’ll be looking elsewhere for that initial rush of feedback. “I’ll be curious for sure,” says Troop. “I’ll be keeping an eye on Twitter and Twitch chat.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alienware X17 review: pretty pixels for a pretty penny</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It delivers the 4K future I’ve been waiting for, but it came at a weird time&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p-large-text" id="43sxgT"&gt;Alienware did it. Its latest 17.3-inch X17 gaming laptop can actually deliver an enjoyable 4K gaming experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YjZa3F"&gt;The last time I checked in on how laptops were faring with 4K gaming in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20976363/razer-blade-pro-17-4k-120hz-display-gaming-laptop-review-specs-features-price"&gt;things weren’t looking so hot&lt;/a&gt;. Nvidia’s last-gen RTX 20-series mobile chips couldn’t work hard enough to smoothly run demanding games at 4K without several compromises to visual fidelity. Fortunately, things have changed for the better this year with the RTX 3080 — specifically, for the X17’s high-powered 16GB VRAM variant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFnDQt"&gt;The X17’s 3080 has a maximum graphics power level of 165W and a boost clock speed of 1,545MHz. That’s really powerful for a mobile GPU and close to the highest amount of power that Nvidia allows for its mobile graphics chips. It’s certainly the most graphically capable laptop that I’ve tested yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nI5Bzi"&gt;I’ll get to the performance numbers in a sec, but it’s important to note near the top that this is one of Alienware’s best gaming laptops yet, and not only because it &lt;em&gt;whips &lt;/em&gt;at gaming. Its X-series design is new for 2021, resulting in a slimmer and sleeker look that balances form and function better than most other models that have similar power levels without foregoing ports (more on that later). For gaming and other intensive tasks, its cooling system is efficient, keeping this 17.3-inch 4K beast both cool and surprisingly quiet. And even when you’re doing other stuff, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22333684/alienware-m15-m17-gaming-laptops-cherry-mx-ultra-low-mechanical-keyboard-switches-price"&gt;clicky Cherry ultra-low-profile mechanical switches&lt;/a&gt; are fun to type on. It’s a heavy laptop that you probably won’t want to lug around to many places, but functionally, the X17 is almost as good for work as it is for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6axkpc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10847819"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Cd0q4E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10847747"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qxMGMl"&gt;Despite these glowing remarks, if you were to ask me if you should buy this specific gaming laptop, I would advise against it unless you’re dead-set on getting a powerful 17.3-inch gaming laptop. It’s a tough sell &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?sid=VergeX17Review110521&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Falienware-x17-r1-laptop%3F%7Eck%3Dmn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at its $3,680 asking price&lt;/a&gt;, as configured. (I will note that this similar &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fmsigs7611078.html&amp;amp;subid1=VergeX17Review110521"&gt;MSI GS76 Stealth&lt;/a&gt; configuration costs hundreds more than the X17, but has twice the amount of RAM. &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-17%2FRZ09-0406CE63-R3U1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeX17Review110521"&gt;Razer’s latest Blade 17&lt;/a&gt; costs $3,699 and has a 4K/120Hz touchscreen and a more capable processor, but has less storage, as configured, and its GPU isn’t as powerful.) Also, since I received this unit for review, Alienware has paused on accepting new orders because it needs to catch up with its supply chain backlog. A spokesperson said Alienware intends to offer it for sale again at some point in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnJ32t"&gt;To test X17’s gaming performance, I ran some titles that have proven to be demanding at their highest graphical settings, starting with &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt;. At native 4K without Nvidia’s deep-learning supersampling (DLSS) tech that tends to give games a noticeable boost in frame rate (by lowering the render resolution and using AI to clean up the image), it ran at 46 frames per second. With DLSS set to auto and no other settings adjusted, the frame rate in 4K went up to 60 frames per second. Personally, I always lean on DLSS as much as any game will allow me to for those few extra free frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="260muE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;’s benchmark registered an average of 55 frames per second without ray tracing. When I turned on ray tracing, DLSS dropped it slightly to 49 frames per second. On the other hand, DLSS running without the taxing ray tracing bumped it up to 64 frames per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4R9vvtq0Up_uat7LNlKskSxmmKI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859879/akrales_210915_4757_0036.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The design ID is similar to the M-series, but the X17 looks more elegant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sj-ESTJkjONRN4gLRIyJ28UpWqU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989060/cfaulkner_211103_4757_0208.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playing games like Deathloop on its max graphical settings in 4K is a joy on the X17.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hKDTmD"&gt;The X17 delivered similarly promising results with &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;. Both averaged around 55 to 70 frames per second with every possible setting switched to their highest option. With each game’s respective ray tracing settings on, performance was closer to around 50 frames per second, which is still phenomenal at this resolution. The best performing of the bunch at 4K was &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt; without ray tracing, which sometimes sailed over 100 frames per second in smaller corridors, dropping to a steady 75 frames per second during frantic fights in larger environments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3Ou3O"&gt;These are all very playable frame rates, whether you decide to go the ray tracing route or take advantage of DLSS in games that support it. Also, since the X17 can run these demanding AAA games at 4K/60 without much of a struggle, many other games that aren’t as demanding should be able to take full advantage of its 120Hz refresh rate display in native 4K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNUOG4"&gt;I won’t lie: I wasn’t expecting this kind of reliable performance with this system, let alone with any other kind of thin-ish gaming laptop. I’ve seen similar specs in action before in other models, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;I was less than impressed&lt;/a&gt;. While Alienware isn’t the first to use a 4K 120Hz display in a gaming laptop, or the aforementioned RTX 3080, it earns credit for cramming it all in a slim chassis that’s much more powerful, yet somehow quieter and cooler than some of the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-N1nZGJQYbKfLTSL2IQuUofvSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859889/akrales_210916_4757_0183.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The optional Cherry MX ultra-low profile mechanical switches are a worthy addition, since you’re already spending a ton of this laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A6UZSj"&gt;Digging more into what the X17 can do with its powerful components, its performance in Adobe Premiere Pro is as impressive as you might expect. During our test where we see how long it takes to churn out a 5-minute, 33-second 4K video, the X17 took three minutes, 22 seconds to get through the export process. For a more intensive benchmark, the PugetBench for Premiere Pro &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=60260"&gt;scored competitively&lt;/a&gt; with similarly specced gaming desktops, which is both to be expected (and that price) and impressive. Funnily enough, Apple’s M1 Pro and M1 Max-equipped MacBook Pros each handily beat Alienware’s score, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;as we noted in our review&lt;/a&gt;. Those outliers aside, you’ll be hard-pressed to find this kind of performance in many other gaming laptops out right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkFwAZ"&gt;It goes without saying, then, that the X17 didn’t see my usual workload as much of an obstacle. I typically run about 20 tabs in Microsoft Edge, along with Spotify, Slack, and Affinity Photo, and the X17 didn’t miss a beat. I realized once that I accidentally had around 40 tabs open in minimized Edge windows, but not even that caused a noticeable hitch or slowdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbVdW6"&gt;The Windows Hello IR webcam here is good for logging in hands-free, but if you anticipate doing lots of video calls, the image quality is mediocre. The video feed looks passable if you’re in good light, but it proved unable to compensate for being rear-lit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eam59n_1mC3WS6B0sXQgkqQWf5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859888/akrales_210916_4757_0159.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows Hello IR webcam is good at logging you in, but its 720p 1MP sensor doesn’t yield great results for video chats.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAN8Yl"&gt;Battery life doesn’t seem to have been a high priority for Alienware since the X17 is primarily aimed at fast desktop-class 4K gaming performance while plugged in. But it’s not the worst we’ve seen, averaging almost four hours of mixed use with the workload that I mentioned above. It’d be tough for me to find a justification for lugging this heavy laptop away from its charger, though. It weighs about seven pounds, and its 330W charger is almost the size and weight of a literal brick. The good news about the power supply is that it recharges the X17 quickly, taking just over an hour to go from about 10 percent to full capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOYSEO"&gt;This X-series chassis is new for 2021, as I mentioned before, and it’s generally a positive evolution of the bulkier M-series design. It has the company’s signature Alienware alien logo as its power button, and its rear, where you’ll now find nearly all of the ports instead of just some of them, looks like the exhaust of a futuristic spaceship. That’s where most of the hot air from the X17’s quad-fan cooling system and the plentiful copper heatsinks is dispelled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k4ewzx1cKtAnNKnO-MJoQb-7XW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859883/akrales_210916_4757_0107.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stylish, honeycomb-patterned rear exhaust design derived from the M-series still looks pretty cool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UHVxZb"&gt;In slimming down, Alienware didn’t make any major omissions in terms of ports. There are two USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports with PD charging (5V/3A), one of which is Thunderbolt 4. You also have two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, a 2.5-gigabit Ethernet port, an HDMI 2.1 port, a micro SD slot, and a mini DisplayPort 1.4. On the right side, there’s a lone headphone jack, and on the left, there’s a plug for the power cable. Just in case you were curious, the X-series gaming laptops, along with the M15 R5 and R6 models, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/6/1/22464110/dell-alienware-graphics-amp-egpu-discontinued"&gt;don’t have Alienware’s graphics amplifier port&lt;/a&gt;, though it should support Thunderbolt GPU enclosures — not that this X17 needs any help in the graphics department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtchZs"&gt;The two-toned body design is a small but appreciated tweak, as are a few areas around the laptop where Alienware softened its look. It rounded off the laptop’s corners that were previously angular and, frankly, leaning a little too hard into the “alien” aesthetic. Though if you didn’t like the look before, your feelings may not be changed here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4dIC-4K_ITX2CrAE-uzIuinM9jc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859882/akrales_210916_4757_0086.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some may dislike that you’ll have to reach to the back of the X17 to reach its ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y2X11-GCd2-Tn58dOZK55dsb2Gc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859884/akrales_210916_4757_0118.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alienware gets credit for cramming a lot of power into the thin section of its chassis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tkn6lR"&gt;You can usually count on gaming laptops to bring the power, a nice display, and maybe ports, too, but you can’t always depend on getting a good keyboard to go with it. This version of the X17 includes the ultra-low-profile Cherry mechanical key switches that were first introduced on the M-series, and they feel fantastic to type on. They’re quiet for mechanical keys, but they have a much more satisfying “thock” feel than membrane laptop keyboards. I’m impressed by how many powerful components Alienware was able to cram into the thinnest section of its chassis, which is just under 16mm thick (its rear section shoots up to 22mm), with room to spare for a mechanical keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQHqdc"&gt;The key layout is intuitive, though some may be upset that the numpad is missing. I did encounter the occasional issue with the keyboard’s responsiveness. Sometimes, my first key press wouldn’t register, so I’d need to try again. It didn’t feel like an n-key rollover issue — just some strange latency with accepting the first input here and there. There were other times when the keyboard would suddenly stop accepting any input whatsoever, requiring a restart. It felt like the kind of thing that can be addressed with a patch, but it’s not an encouraging sign that I’m experiencing it several months after this laptop became available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bq_X68SxV4zmLJkACs2XsgVr_dQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859880/akrales_210915_4757_0038.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I would rather have a bigger trackpad than one that lights up, but it’d be better to have both.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cc9u7TsaoJ1oooTTla8h_mxhNpQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859890/akrales_210916_4757_0184.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The X17 lacks the angular edges found on the M-series, giving it a more toned-down look.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="VUWOaJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10847705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9JBTai"&gt;One weird inclusion with the RTX 3080 is the light-up trackpad that illuminates when you touch it, though the light goes out after a few seconds of inactivity. It’s just for show, but nevertheless, it’s a basic trackpad with support for Windows Precision drivers and gesture customization in Windows. I’d like to see Alienware follow in Razer and MSI’s footsteps and implement bigger trackpads instead of superfluous features like trackpad backlighting. This current one is a little too small, almost seeming to signal that you should use a dedicated mouse instead, which is usually my advice with most gaming laptops anyway. Speaking of accessories, grab a gaming headset, as the built-in speakers aren’t anything special. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpIFAI"&gt;Earlier this year, I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;heralded the arrival of QHD screens&lt;/a&gt; as “the best thing to happen to gaming laptops” because I felt a future where 4K gaming on a laptop was commonplace still seemed far off. I was excited because lowering the resolution from 4K to 1440p would mean that games would still look very good, yet more reasonably priced components would be able to run them, thus driving down the total cost of laptops. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;We now have a growing amount of powerful, fully featured QHD options&lt;/a&gt; that are cheaper than 4K laptops and well worth the cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPKbrm"&gt;That leaves the Alienware X17 in a tough spot. On one hand, there’s nothing like gaming on a big 17.3-inch screen. The slightly smaller 16-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7"&gt;16:10 aspect ratio QHD screens&lt;/a&gt; that we’re thankfully seeing more of come close but don’t quite feel as immersive. In that way, there’s certainly a lot of fun to be had with the excessive screen real estate and power offered by the X17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSH56E"&gt;Furthermore, it easily proves its ability to play 4K games with finesse and that Alienware’s a little more serious about improving its chassis design. All of that progress is important, and if you’ve been waiting for a big, well-designed gaming laptop that delivers on the promise of 4K gaming on the go, this is it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Z7sNUw"&gt;But for most people, it’s ultimately just too expensive. Plus, for the massive amount of power and cooling required to power 4K games, I just don’t think it offers &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;much better of an experience to warrant the cost versus more affordable, yet no less competently designed, laptops with sharp QHD displays. Pocket the rest of your money for games, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;headset&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;mouse&lt;/a&gt;, or a gaming monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
