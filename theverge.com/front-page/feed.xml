    <title>Netflix on the Wii U and 3DS will shut down on June 30th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nintendo Wii U GamePad (555px)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GKGlru1_IBtpqOHJSJb8MEPsnZY=/2x0:554x368/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68628525/DSC_2612-555px.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0D2EL1"&gt;Nintendo is winding down support for the Netflix app on the Wii U and 3DS. The app will be shut down for existing users on June 30th, and if you’ve never downloaded it, it isn’t available anymore. You can redownload the app if you’ve downloaded it in the past, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgGTD1"&gt;“Starting Dec 31st, 2020, the Netflix app will no longer be available for new users to download from Nintendo eShop on the Wii U console or Nintendo 3DS family of systems,” Nintendo said in a statement on the listings for the &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/netflix-wii-u/"&gt;Wii U&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/netflix-3ds/"&gt;3DS&lt;/a&gt; Netflix app. “During that time, it will be possible for existing users to re-download these applications. Service for existing users will continue until June 30th, 2021. Thank you to everyone who enjoyed Netflix on these platforms over the years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfGfzo"&gt;Nintendo discontinued the 3DS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21441096/nintendo-3ds-production-discontinued-total-sales"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt; and quickly moved on from the Wii U in favor of the Nintendo Switch, so it’s not all that surprising that the company is shutting down the Netflix app on the older platforms. But Netflix still isn’t on the Switch, despite former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé saying days after the Switch’s launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/8/14852624/nintendo-switch-netflix-hulu-amazon-support"&gt;in March 2017&lt;/a&gt; that the company was talking with companies like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon about bringing their services to the console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eI69ww"&gt;Hulu launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/11/16633818/nintendo-switch-hulu-app-perfectly-good-streaming-gadget"&gt;in November 2017&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s still no Netflix app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump administration finalizes rule that could define gig workers as contractors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AdYcyX1SsRN16FZ3CGKudTSIosM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68628412/akrales_180614_1777_0235.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MM2xjF"&gt;The US Department of Labor has finalized a decision that could make it easier for “gig economy” companies to classify their workers as independent contractors, rather than employees that can claim legal benefits. The Trump administration released its &lt;a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20210106"&gt;final version&lt;/a&gt; of the rule today, and it’s set to take effect on March 8th, although this could change after President-elect Joe Biden takes office in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFJatD"&gt;The DOL proposed a &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/dol-debuts-rule-to-ease-employers-use-of-independent-contractors"&gt;new framework&lt;/a&gt; last year for classifying employees and contractors. It &lt;a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa/2021-independent-contractor"&gt;focuses on&lt;/a&gt; two “core factors” for distinguishing the two: the “nature and degree of control over the work” and the “opportunity for profit or loss” based on initiative and investment. It also lists additional “guideposts” that include “the amount of skill required” for the job, the “degree of permanence” of the working relationship, and whether the work is part of an “integrated unit of production.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7YxND"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/business/economy/labor-gig-workers.html"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; noted&lt;/a&gt; last year, the rule is interpreting existing regulations rather than establishing new ones, and it only covers federal laws enforced by the DOL. States can still establish their own definitions — like California’s Prop 22, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174600/uber-lyft-new-benefits-california-drivers-prop-22-gig-economy"&gt;which specifies&lt;/a&gt; that Lyft and Uber drivers aren’t employees. However, it could still broadly influence how companies define their workers. The nonprofit labor rights group National Employment Law Project called it a “narrowing” of the standards rather than a meaningful clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVHc2X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon marked free podcasts as costing $8.95 with a discount for Audible subscribers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f9SGYrKoOM8u0Hkzp8BuQGUHaF8=/0x0:1569x1046/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68628327/vergecast.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TjK9RZ"&gt;Charlie Harding, the host of the podcast &lt;em&gt;Switched On Pop&lt;/em&gt;, noticed something strange when &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/charlieharding/status/1346584298330099712?s=21"&gt;he searched his podcast name on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; yesterday: a price tag. An $8.95 price, to be exact, marked as a “limited deal” with the suggestion to buy an Audible subscription to get a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHYZoP"&gt;Harding’s show, which details the making and meaning of popular music, is already freely available in all podcast apps through an RSS feed. It also recently became available for free inside Audible, which is owned by Amazon, when podcasts were added to its app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536963/amazon-free-podcast-update-catalog"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. But for some reason, Amazon had started advertising the show as paid content. Even more strangely, the Audible promotion was really for a price &lt;em&gt;hike&lt;/em&gt;, marking the show as originally costing $0 and being marked up to $8.95.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9z5WWz"&gt;The same happened with other podcasts available in Audible, too. All the ones we checked, including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s own &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, which is freely distributed through RSS, were listed as costing $8.95 and promoted an Audible membership deal. These results only showed up on Amazon’s website, not in the mobile app, and only if you were logged into an Amazon account when you searched. If you clicked on the podcast, you’d then be able to select where you wanted to listen, either Amazon Music or Audible, and you could listen for free without a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IoLoVw"&gt;The pricing disappeared Wednesday morning after &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out for comment. Amazon has not yet responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0MjXK"&gt;It’s unclear why Amazon marked the shows as costing $8.95 given that none of Audible’s subscription tiers are that price. Its lowest tier, which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/24/21398875/audible-plus-premium-subscription-membership-plan-credit"&gt;launched in August&lt;/a&gt;, costs $7.95 for access to these free shows, as well as exclusive Audible programming and audiobooks. The price goes up to $14.95 for a subscription that includes audiobook credits. This seems more than likely to be a bug given that the shows’ prices were raised instead of lowered as part of this “limited deal,” but still, it’s not a great look for Amazon, which just recently started focusing on podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oCc8FP"&gt;The addition of podcasts is part of Audible’s latest push to sell subscriptions. The freely available shows add value to a costly subscription and bulk up its catalog, which might entice people to pay every month for access. It’s worth remembering, though, that most podcasts are available for free through RSS, not when you pay Audible.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo says it’s ditching the term ‘self-driving’ in dig at Tesla</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P3bidMzhIue2_bIFxcH6p0xgwYA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68628280/waymo_chrysler_pacifica_detroit_auto_show_2017_0547.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GzZDhH"&gt;Waymo is saying so long to “self-driving.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SpEG20"&gt;The Google sister company says it is through using the term “self-driving cars” to describe its fleet of autonomous vehicles. And it is subtly pointing fingers at Elon Musk’s Tesla as the reason why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqJJxk"&gt;Waymo says it is committing to “using more deliberate language” in its marketing, educational, and promotional materials going forward. This means the company will no longer refer to its vehicles as “self-driving,” Waymo says. For example, the company is changing the name of its three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16447628/waymo-self-driving-car-ad-campaign-arizona"&gt;public education campaign&lt;/a&gt; from “Let’s Talk Self-Driving” to “Let’s Talk Autonomous Driving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EuA8uY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It may seem like a small change, but it’s an important one, because precision in language matters and could save lives.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pIvYbG"&gt;“It may seem like a small change, but it’s an important one, because precision in language matters and could save lives,” the company wrote in a blog post published on January 5th. “We’re hopeful that consistency will help differentiate the fully autonomous technology Waymo is developing from driver-assist technologies (sometimes erroneously referred to as ‘self-driving’ technologies) that require oversight from licensed human drivers for safe operation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJqYaj"&gt;The references to driver-assist technologies appears to be a shot at Tesla, which last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528508/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-first-reaction-video"&gt;activated a software update&lt;/a&gt; in some of its cars called “Full Self Driving.” The software, which enables drivers to use many of Autopilot’s advanced driver-assist features on local, non-highway streets, is still technically in beta. But an unknown number of white-listed drivers have received it and have been actively testing it on public roads — often filming and uploading those tests on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kMioer"&gt;Tesla has said Full Self-Driving should only be used by attentive drivers with both hands on the wheel. But the feature is designed to assist a driver, and it’s not foolproof: there have been several high-profile incidents in which some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/30/12072408/tesla-autopilot-car-crash-death-autonomous-model-s"&gt;drivers have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16923800/tesla-firetruck-crash-autopilot-investigation"&gt;engaged Autopilot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/30/17182824/tesla-model-x-crash-autopilot-statement"&gt; crashed&lt;/a&gt;, and died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjOyhI"&gt;Waymo never mentions Tesla by name in the blog post. But the Alphabet company is clearly motivated by Musk’s controversial decision to use the term “Full Self Driving” in deciding to more rigorously police its own language. A key paragraph in the post reads (emphasis ours):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="h3513l"&gt;This is more than just a branding or linguistic exercise. Unfortunately, we see that some automakers use the term “self-driving” in an inaccurate way, giving consumers and the general public a false impression of the capabilities of driver assist (not fully autonomous) technology. &lt;strong&gt;That false impression can lead someone to unknowingly take risks (like taking their hands off the steering wheel) that could jeopardize not only their own safety but the safety of people around them.&lt;/strong&gt; Coalescing around standard terminology will not just prevent misunderstanding and confusion, it will also save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WiMlKr"&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/11/17960456/self-driving-cars-av-safety-common-language-rand"&gt;increasingly urgent calls&lt;/a&gt; to standardize the language used to describe autonomous driving. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/avs-need-common-language-to-tell-us-what-theyre-doing-3bd1ea4f-bf9f-4d35-8ef9-5c286fe6198a.html"&gt;Ford recently came out in favor&lt;/a&gt; of standardized visual cues that autonomous vehicles could use to communicate intent to pedestrians, bicyclists, and other drivers. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="http://www.thedrive.com/opinion/20495/how-the-language-of-self-driving-is-killing-us"&gt;critics continue to assail&lt;/a&gt; the five levels of automation as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers, the global standard for self-driving, for being overly broad and possibly dangerous. Most experts agree: we need a better, more unified way to talk about self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXe4sD"&gt;Tesla, in particular, is seen by most experts as abusing the lack of a common language around autonomous vehicles to overhype its products. Musk recently called Waymo’s approach to autonomous driving “impressive, but a highly specialized solution.” But there is a widening gap between what Tesla claims its vehicles can do and how they actually behave. Musk claimed Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” driver assist feature was capable of “zero intervention drives,” but within hours of the release, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKlpCG367AE&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;ab_channel=BrandonM"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kimpaquette/status/1321077451951349760"&gt;surfaced&lt;/a&gt; of Tesla customers swerving to avoid parked cars and other near misses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8a93y"&gt;Years ago, Waymo considered developing an advanced driver-assist system like Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” version of Autopilot but ultimately decided against it, having become “alarmed” by the negative effects on the driver. Drivers would zone out or fall asleep at the wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3R7Bf"&gt;The experiment in driver assistance helped solidify Waymo’s mission: fully autonomous or bust. To that end, Waymo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507814/waymo-driverless-cars-allow-more-customers-phoenix"&gt;recently began offering rides in its fully driverless vehicles to the general public&lt;/a&gt; in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izlow1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How much you love The Office may determine what Peacock plan you get, apparently</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XD3AeeKz1tesHtAWdQ1nLPajXZU=/0x4:620x417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68628272/office_computer.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: NBC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YPhEj0"&gt;Chances are if you’re looking into signing up for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324215/peacock-nbc-universal-comcast-app-how-to-watch-download-price-subscription-stream-shows"&gt;Peacock&lt;/a&gt; (“Ugh, another streaming service!”), it’s because you’re trying to watch &lt;em&gt;The Office &lt;/em&gt;— and NBC knows it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfqWte"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Office &lt;/em&gt;isn’t just a big deal to college students who are just getting into Jim and Pam’s “will they, won’t they” relationship; it’s a massive play for subscribers from NBCUniversal. And now, the streamer’s marketing attempts reflect that importance. Instead of simply saying “this plan will give you access to these types of titles,” Peacock’s pricing is broken down by just how much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174856/the-office-netflix-peacock-streaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;you personally love The Office&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uCAiJp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Peacock is literally pricing their service based on how much of the Office you can watch what is going on &lt;a href="https://t.co/mTHX0GYXSh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mTHX0GYXSh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— cowabummer (@ItsRetroNemo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ItsRetroNemo/status/1346565557848580096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QLraaN"&gt;Just want the first two seasons? The free plan will be more than enough. Looking for every episode of &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, along with never-before-seen clips? You’ll want Peacock Premium. Want everything in that tier but without all of those pesky ads (more on that in a second)? Peacock Premium Plus is what you’re looking for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Za4x7x"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is also an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="046MPZ"&gt;Beyond the confusion associated with each tier, trying to sell people a service based on how much&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;they love &lt;em&gt;The Office &lt;/em&gt;seems... well, not great. Especially when people start signing up for Peacock and are left frustrated. For example: Peacock Premium Plus isn’t exactly ad-free. Even though NBCUniversal notes that in a disclaimer on the signup page, the Peacock subreddit is &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/peacock/comments/j3kms1/paying_for_adfree_to_still_see_ads/"&gt;full of annoyed customers&lt;/a&gt; who believed the entire experience would be ad-free, only to discover that “a small amount of programming will still contain ads.” As tech reporter and columnist &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/waltmossberg/status/1345096947821146116"&gt;Walt Mossberg tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, the move from Netflix to Peacock has “diminished the experience of viewing the show.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZK0sR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; was previously available on Netflix, where it remained one of the most watched shows on any streaming service for several years. Unlike Peacock, Netflix is also extremely easy to use. People pay on average about $14 a month, and they get access to everything without ads on almost any device they want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7Dg4x"&gt;Peacock isn’t the only streamer whose “ad-free” platform contains ads. Hulu’s ad-free plan will run ads on “a select number of shows from our streaming library” due to streaming rights, &lt;a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/no-ads-exceptions?language=en_US"&gt;according to the company’s website&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, there are two shows that contain ads: &lt;em&gt;Grey’s Anatomy &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D&lt;/em&gt;. Comparatively, it seems like there are more ads that play on shows and films on Peacock’s “ad-free” tier. NBC likely has a similar contractual obligation to show ads on some shows, but there’s no warning icon or sign to indicate what programming will have an ad until one pops up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0lx4jm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s bad to make paid customers feel like they’re not getting what you promised them”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jTqc35"&gt;We’re in a transitional moment for the industry. There’s never been more to stream, but it’s also more fragmented than ever (at least in the United States), as every conglomerate tries to find its place in a booming marketplace. Everything used to be on Netflix or Hulu. Now, everything is somewhere, but it’s left to customers to figure out where exactly their favorite show or movie is and if it’s really worth adding another $10 subscription to their monthly expenses. In other words: is &lt;em&gt;The Office &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Friends &lt;/em&gt;really worth buying a Peacock or HBO Max subscription? That’s something individual customers have to decide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHuZQ0"&gt;It’s important to note that the entirety of &lt;em&gt;The Office &lt;/em&gt;is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Ftv-season%2Fthe-office-the-complete-series%2Fid1438674900&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F6%2F22216867%2Fpeacock-office-subscription-streaming-ad-free-premium-plus-netflix#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $70 on iTunes right now&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re only signing up for Peacock to watch &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, there are better ways. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 7 is still running on at least 100 million PCs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xfDSHMyZkGjlwDmiug-DL5JlReY=/7x0:1014x671/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68628125/win7.0.1436517999.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PO3Zpo"&gt;Windows 7 appears to still be running on at least 100 million machines, despite Microsoft ending support for the operating system a year ago. &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-7-a-year-after-the-end-of-support-deadline-millions-choose-not-to-upgrade/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ZDNet &lt;/em&gt;has been analyzing&lt;/a&gt; the proportion of PCs still running Windows 7 across various analytics reports. While each data source pegs Windows 7 at different percentages of market share, most agree that the OS still makes up for around 20 percent of PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BupxI"&gt;Microsoft has said for years that there are 1.5 billion users of Windows across multiple versions worldwide. It’s difficult to get an exact number of Windows 7 users owing to the different methods used by analytics companies, but it’s at least 100 million. If you drop Microsoft’s estimate of 1.5 billion users of Windows to just a billion (there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21116762/microsoft-windows-10-active-devices-billion-7-support"&gt;1 billion active Windows 10 users&lt;/a&gt;), then Windows 7 is still on a massive amount of PCs. In reality, it could still be in use by more than 200 million devices worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dell’s XPS 13 is a popular Windows 10 machine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7SBhsM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065122/microsoft-windows-7-end-of-support-lifecycle-millions-pcs"&gt;Support for Windows 7 ended in January 2020&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 11 years after the OS first launched with its “I’m a PC, and Windows 7 was my idea” marketing campaign. It quickly became a massively popular version of Windows, especially with businesses. It was clear from looking at the market share of the operating system last year that it would take a year or two to get Windows 7 firmly below 10 percent market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyN99B"&gt;It may take even longer for Windows 7 to finally disappear, especially after a year when many have turned to PCs for remote working and home schooling. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241681/microsoft-q3-2020-earnings-surface-windows-xbox-revenue-profit"&gt;Microsoft reported an increase in PC demand&lt;/a&gt; and usage due to the pandemic. It’s likely that part of that PC usage also came from households dusting off old PCs and laptops they haven’t used frequently, and some of these devices could still be running Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtoWZb"&gt;It’s clear that the pandemic has also influenced the PC market over the past year. We’re still waiting on PC estimates from Gartner and IDC, but some analysts believe we could have seen nearly 300 million PCs shipped in 2020 alone. That would be a significant change for the PC market, after PCs saw a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065100/pc-market-shipments-idc-gartner-growth-2019-laptops-desktops-windows-7-10"&gt;first year of growth&lt;/a&gt; since 2011 during 2019. That growth was boosted by the end of Windows 7 support, and most analysts didn’t expect the market to grow even further throughout 2020. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s 2021 TVs have dramatically better picture, thanks to Mini LED</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nz0WhE4_Ys_hbiaNEFWd36OhSg0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68627892/DSCF2812.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jxCwZ4"&gt;Samsung is today announcing its upper tier of 2021 8K and 4K HDR TVs. And like TCL and LG before it, the company is moving to a more precise backlighting system that uses Mini LED technology for improved contrast and greater picture quality than its previous full-array local dimming systems — and Samsung’s premium QLED LCD TVs were already impressive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hiEt62"&gt;The latest Mini LED advancements are being branded as “Neo QLED” and will be found in several different tiers in the 2021 lineup. There are two 8K models: the QN900A (a successor to last year’s top-tier 8K QLED with barely there bezels) and the QN800A. From there, three series of 4K TVs will get Mini LED: the QN95A, QN90A, and QN85A.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fyCkoLdTHtw2657anl_c1PKBq3w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217061/DSCF2781.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mini LED lets Samsung pack more LEDs into its premium TVs for brightness that’s “more finely controlled.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QOLZUb"&gt;(Note: All photos in this story were captured at a private briefing in New York City arranged by Samsung. Strict social distancing and sanitization precautions were in place, and masks were worn by everyone on site.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3DTif6"&gt;Samsung says the LEDs in these TVs are up to 40 times smaller than those in sets with traditional full-array backlighting, where you get a few dozen “zones” that light up and dim in accordance with what’s happening on-screen. Packing more LEDs into a smaller space results in more precise backlighting that should greatly reduce blooming, which is the halo effect you can sometimes see around bright objects on a dark background on LCD TVs when the light bleeds into a different dimming zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGIQxN"&gt;While LG tossed out some numbers for its upcoming LCD TVs with Mini LED — “up to almost 30,000 tiny LEDs” and “up to 2,500 dimming zones” — Samsung isn’t being as forward about the exact number of LEDs and dimming zones it has achieved. Similar to past years, these TVs retain quantum dot expanded color range; that’s what the Q in QLED stands for, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tq-7QVKOY7dmwRW9Xa_IUK_-nVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217046/DSCF2777.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s latest TVs have a new “Game Bar” for accessing the most important settings for next-gen consoles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AZUniW"&gt;Samsung’s 2021 QLED TVs are also aiming to make life simpler for gamers who recently purchased an Xbox Series X / S or PlayStation 5. There’s a new “game bar” with quick access to settings like refresh rate, aspect ratio, and so on. All of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/24/22193437/vergecast-podcast-interview-hdmi"&gt;HDMI 2.1&lt;/a&gt; functionality you’d hope for — 4K at 120Hz, variable refresh rate, auto low latency mode, and eARC — are supported, though you’ll give up some features at the bottom of the lineup. And Samsung is bringing the ultrawide 21:9 and 32:9 ratios of its gaming monitors to the TV screen so you can get a more comprehensive view of all that’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Adtwln2y0b6zeExk3-cXdGaVtz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22216068/cwelch210104_4356_0008.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="li64K1"&gt;As for sound quality, Samsung is building more speaker drivers into the 2021 TVs for what it calls Object Tracking Sound. The TVs analyze scenes and try to make it seem like sound is coming directly from the source on screen — and moving with it. A new “SpaceFit Sound” feature that uses a built-in mic on these TVs to analyze a room’s acoustics and automatically apply the best audio settings. (Yes, that mic can also be used for Google Assistant or Alexa — and it can be disabled if you don’t want it on.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seGWe1"&gt;Samsung is also putting a bigger emphasis on its Samsung Health software on the big screen. These latest TVs can be paired with a video camera for a new “Smart Trainer” feature that tracks you through an interactive fitness class. Here’s what Samsung says on that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OwfhIM"&gt;The Smart Trainer displays an AI trainer on the left screen, and an image of yourself on the right screen, allowing you to check your posture, count your reps, and receive real-time feedback on how you’re doing—just as if you were at an in-person workout class. The AI trainer even remembers how you like to exercise, from workout type to intensity. Finally, you’ll get feedback on your calories burned and other metrics, so you can keep track of your fitness journey. And with a new auto-sync feature that links select Samsung Smart TVs, Galaxy phones, and Galaxy watches, you can pick a workout on your phone and cast it to your TV, while your watch automatically tracks your progress — without touching a button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gVbl7U"&gt;It’s plain to see the tit for tat that Samsung is trying to play against Apple Fitness Plus, Peloton, and other services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/adPn7j1Y7lpnk9xrbVScNpnnhXc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22216071/cwelch210104_4356_0011.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ydq0ns4g3vkO8ToC3epX-kF4h3E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22216066/cwelch210104_4356_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LAva74"&gt;Pricing for all of the new TVs will be announced closer to when they start shipping in a few months, but it should be pretty comparable to the 2019 series TVs on Samsung’s store right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="46DZgK"&gt;An even more frame-like The Frame&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HpbVJwYH85AfpyVZnqqqG1ThUuk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22216067/cwelch210104_4356_0007.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IPj9Uh"&gt;The only one of Samsung’s “lifestyle” TVs being updated for CES is The Frame. Samsung has reduced the thickness; it’s now 24.9mm thick, which the company says “mirrors the depth of a traditional picture frame.” The 43-inch model can now be rotated into a portrait orientation, and Samsung says customers who subscribe to its Art Store — The Frame can be configured to display artwork when idle — will now get better AI-powered recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gS2m7j"&gt;Samsung also says “there are more bezel choices than ever, from slim, neutral, and minimalist to big, ornate, and bold.” The Frame’s bezels can be swapped in a way that, in some cases, according to the company, “you can literally frame The Frame.” As for the TV itself, you get the same QLED 4K HDR picture as before.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9tfzDh4Nji9LQgHHAvMLmai8rNU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22216063/cwelch210104_4356_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PfpFzC"&gt;More sizes of MicroLED&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="w2hhu1"&gt;Last month, Samsung announced that it will be making &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166062/samsung-110-inch-microled-4k-tv-announced-features"&gt;a massive 110-inch TV that uses the next-gen MicroLED technology&lt;/a&gt; that has previously been available in the company’s modular (and only-for-the-filthy-rich) display known as The Wall. Now, the company says that 99-inch and 88-inch models will join the 110-incher, bringing MicroLED to a “traditional TV form factor” for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6t5hq"&gt;Instead of requiring professional installation, you’ll just take these out of the box and mount them like any other TV. Aside from the OLED-like benefits of MicroLED — self-emissive LEDs for each pixel and no backlight required — Samsung says its Multi View feature lets you watch four sources of content simultaneously on any of these sets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Yfupw"&gt;Thing is, all of these TVs will still be silly expensive for a long time to come. So the Neo QLED TVs are what the vast majority of consumers will be eyeing in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung made a solar-charging Eco Remote for its latest TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8dqLB09nyrp13SaFvkxeW2wHIOM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68627884/cwelch210104_4356_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E1pVSd"&gt;With its 2021 lineup of 4K and 8K QLED TVs, Samsung is introducing a new Eco Remote Control that the company claims will “reduce tons of plastic waste per year” and further its efforts to reduce its environmental impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMXJaO"&gt;From the front, the Eco Remote Control looks like any of Samsung’s TV clickers from recent years. But flip it around and you’ll see a long panel of solar cells that can charge the internal battery. The remote is made from 31 grams of plastic, and Samsung says 28 percent of that comes “from recycled polyethylene terephthalate.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5aecqkYhDT05KQjQatZ_Xtkdsd4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22216070/cwelch210104_4356_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eazw99"&gt;Samsung estimates you’ll be able to use the Eco Remote Control for two years before its battery gives out and needs a full recharge. Overall, the internal rechargeable battery is designed to last for around seven years, or the average life cycle of a single TV. That’ll certainly save you from buying fistfuls of AAA batteries over the years, and the reduction in plastic waste is notable, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hWmlMh"&gt;There’s a USB-C port on the bottom if you need to charge the remote faster for whatever reason. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a22mqOEL3_LD9y0AkMTE7KEa7cU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217403/Embargo_Jan_6_11am_ET_Neo_QLED_Eco_Remote.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lQwr4l"&gt;Samsung is also continuing its eco packaging efforts in 2021. “By eliminating oil-based ink and expanding eco-friendly packaging to all Lifestyle and QLED TV models, Samsung offers a sustainable solution that can upcycle up to 200,000 tons of boxes a year and turn them into pieces of home decor.” After your TV is unpacked, you can scan a QR code on its box for instructions on how to craft it into something you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; want to keep around. Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.dezeen.com/outofthebox/"&gt;partnered with &lt;em&gt;Dezeen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a competition that encouraged people to come up with clever ways of repurposing the cardboard boxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qtZLqY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The article originally stated that the remote had a lifespan of two years, due to Samsung’s marketing materials saying that it “can be used for up to two years.” The company has clarified that in fact, the internal battery can last for up to seven years to align with the average life cycle of a TV. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s capable Halo fitness tracker is 25 percent off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AXNs0i7n1pAFf1oTzOR0DwPkGbY=/0x0:3750x2500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68627583/Halo_App_and_Halo_Band.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Olo46s"&gt;If you’re feeling swept up in New Year’s resolutions for getting fit and want a device that’s going to hold you accountable to meet your goals, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PMT4T11?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s Halo tracker is $25 off its usual $100 price&lt;/a&gt;. All sizes and colors are the same price. The Halo was actually about $10 cheaper when it first launched, but this is the next-best deal. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;In case you don’t know much about this product&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a tracker that can monitor more granular metrics than most fitness devices, like the tone of your voice and a general approximation of how much overall body fat you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ka0uwT"&gt;To get all of the features Halo offers, you’ll need a subscription. You’ll get six months for free with purchase. After that, it’s $3.99 per month if you want to continue. If not, then the Halo will just track sleep, heart rate, and step tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MTim3f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10269519"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Aukey 10W wireless charger" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f7AlSCulBXx2x9Y-SUCGSAaG_90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217270/aukeywirelesscharger.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8RuHeR"&gt;Aukey is offering a limited time deal on one of its wireless charging stands that has multiple coils, simultaneously supporting a phone (oriented vertically or horizontally) and, say, a set of wireless earbuds like AirPods or Galaxy Buds Live resting around the back of it. By clipping the on-page coupon that knocks 5 percent off the cost and applying the 35 percent of extra savings (click the “1 Applicable Promotion” drop-down to redeem), &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NCDVG59?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this charger drops down in price to just over $16 before tax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGeC47"&gt;A few things worth noting are that this wireless charger doesn’t include a power brick, so you’ll have to supply your own. Also, it tops out at 10W of charging speed for most Android phones, while iPhones (aside from the iPhone 12 mini since its coil doesn’t align properly, says Aukey) that support Qi charging will charge at 7.5W, and Pixel phones and AirPods max out at 5W. Basically, get this to keep your devices topped up throughout the day, not to quickly recharge things before leaving the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSXyeC"&gt;This deal lasts until January 12th at 2:59AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Georgia’s runoff may have saved net neutrality</title>

  &lt;p&gt;Throttling could be much harder under a Democratic Senate&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PwMfbP"&gt;Tuesday night was a good night for Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="pQLwxK"&gt;Votes are still being tallied and no one has conceded, but it seems &lt;a href="https://results.decisiondeskhq.com/"&gt;all but certain&lt;/a&gt; that Democratic candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff have won election to the US Senate, putting the chamber under 50-50 Democratic control. It’s a huge shift in what’s possible for Democrats and policymakers are already discussing policies that seemed impossible on Monday, like $2,000 direct stimulus payments or a new voting rights act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjiSkw"&gt;But while the wins will have impacts across the Democratic platform, they may have particularly strong effects on net neutrality. Before Georgia, net neutrality advocates were &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2020/12/03/what-to-expect-from-a-biden-fcc-on-section-230-net-neutrality-and-5g/"&gt;facing a gridlock in Congress&lt;/a&gt; and the frightening possibility that the incoming president wouldn’t be able to appoint his own FCC commissioners. But as the Senate falls back under Democratic control, the possibilities for net neutrality have expanded dramatically. Now, Democrats can push for more progressive FCC nominees that will reinstate the net neutrality rules from 2015, or even push for legislation that would write net neutrality into law. Flipping these two Senate seats could make the difference between keeping net neutrality in a permanent legal limbo and making it the law of the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HF173b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The FCC shouldn’t wait for Congress”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oAVkr6"&gt;Already, net neutrality advocates are barely containing their excitement. Reached for comment, Fight for the Future’s Evan Greer laid out a laundry list of progressive goals that can now be pursued, from overturning FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s order to implementing more aggressive privacy and connectivity policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjTTwk"&gt;“If Democrats take the Senate they should move quickly to confirm an FCC chair who will make it their first order of business to restore the Title II open Internet protections,” Greer said in a statement. “But they should also do more than that. The FCC can and should take steps to protect people’s privacy, and to ensure that everyone can afford Internet access during a time when many are working from home and sending their kids to school online.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWHwQY"&gt;In a similar vein, Public Knowledge CEO Chris Lewis focused on getting a fair hearing for bills like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18304522/net-neutrality-save-the-internet-act-house-of-representatives-approval"&gt;the Save the Internet Act&lt;/a&gt;, which have largely been blocked by the Republican Senate. “The Senate has made noise about enshrining rules into law for the past two years without any action — not even a public hearing,” said Lewis. “The FCC shouldn’t wait for Congress to grow the political will to act to restore strong net neutrality rules. There is broad support for this in the country across partisan divides.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imx5II"&gt;The net neutrality fight has mostly been in a stalemate since 2017, when Pai &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/11/17439456/net-neutrality-dead-ajit-pai-fcc-internet"&gt;passed the Restoring Internet Freedom Order&lt;/a&gt;, repealing the 2015 Open Internet Order on a straight party-line vote. There were significant legal challenges to Pai’s order — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20898779/fcc-net-neutrality-court-of-appeals-decision-ruling"&gt;most notably from Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; — but the basic facts of the order remained in place. Under Pai’s rule, the FCC doesn’t have much authority to regulate practices like throttling, zero-rating, and data caps. As long as that order is in place, fighting carrier misbehavior will fall to the FTC and the states, both of which are stretched too thin to put up much of a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="owWeDv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;new legislation could write Title II rules permanently into law&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="46mhqQ"&gt;In a normal congress, a Democratic president would spell trouble for Pai’s order. When he takes office, Biden will have control over FCC appointments, which typically means Democrats would control the commission’s majority (determining the chairperson and three of the five seats on the commission). Restoring the Open Internet Order would be as simple as appointing progressive commissioners and holding a vote. But Republicans were &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-fcc-pick-fight-senate-c53a6099-7684-4994-9b5b-a83a8d22b180.html"&gt;preparing to block FCC appointments&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for concessions, effectively giving them veto power over the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJrNjU"&gt;The result was a tough choice for the Biden administration: either nominate moderate Democrats who wouldn’t repeal the Pai order or resign themselves to a gridlocked FCC without the vote to do anything at all. It was a grim choice for net neutrality advocates; either option would leave the Pai order in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVdwTl"&gt;But this morning, the state of play looks very different. With Warnock and Ossoff in the Senate, the chamber will be split 50-50, with VP-elect Kamala Harris passing the deciding vote. That will give Democrats control of crucial oversight committees and make it far easier to shepherd Democratic nominees through confirmation hearings. In short, Biden can nominate who he wants, and Senate Democrats can make sure they’re legally appointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="OBWpBi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;How much will Biden care about net neutrality?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RWcQW2"&gt;Progressive ambitions don’t stop at the FCC. A new FCC order would put net neutrality rules in place, but it could still be overturned by the next Republican president, and flipping back and forth with each administration isn’t anyone’s ideal telecom policy. The real win would be new legislation that would write Title II rules permanently into law, something that couldn’t be overturned by the next Republican FCC. House Democrats have passed bills to do just that, although they crashed as soon they hit the Republican Senate. It’s hard to say whether moderate Democrats like Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) or Joe Manchin (D-WV) would go along with such a move, and a compromise bill might end up with something much milder than full Title II protection. But for the first time, that kind of lasting legislative victory is possible, and it will be a major focus for advocates over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2iSaUI"&gt;There are still some important caveats to this victory. Democratic control of the Senate isn’t a done deal: neither Republican candidate has conceded, and it’s not settled what kind of power-sharing arrangement will emerge from the 50-50 Senate. There is still room for all kinds of obstruction, and Senate Democrats shouldn’t count chickens before they’re hatched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="2ZEKdw"&gt;Most importantly, we don’t know how much the Biden administration will care about net neutrality. It was a non-issue in the campaign, crowded out by the chaos of Trump, and the president-elect hasn’t made any clear statements about where he stands on it. As soon as the election was over, right-wing analysts were &lt;a href="https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/3-reasons-why-biden-will-kill-off-net-neutrality/"&gt;predicting that Biden would abandon the fight entirely&lt;/a&gt;, finding it not worth the political costs. Progressives will keep fighting, some from inside the White House, but it is too early to know if they’ll win. Georgia has given Biden the chance to save net neutrality; now the question is whether he will take it.&lt;/p&gt;
