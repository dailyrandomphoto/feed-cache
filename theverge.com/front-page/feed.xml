  &lt;p&gt;Great gifts that will cultivate curiosity, creativity, and so much more &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="j0Yebj"&gt;Kids can be tricky giftees. They want toys, of course, but the sheer abundance of available options can be overwhelming, especially if you don’t know where to start. And while you could make life easier by asking your kids what they want, they’ll likely bombard you with a laundry list of items, some of which might not be realistic. Besides, there are other factors to consider, including your budget and whether the gift is age-appropriate, safe, and good for your child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rG96i"&gt;That can take hours to research, so we’ve done the hard work for you. Below, we’ve compiled a list of gifts suitable for kids of all ages, ranging from tried-and-true classics like the Lite-Brite ($12) to newer additions, such as the latest Kindle Paperwhite Kids ($160) and Wing’s second-gen electric bike ($1,298). There are also a number of STEM toys and educational gifts for younger children, as well as a few designed to spur their creativity on paper and get them moving outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwExzX"&gt;Take a look, and see what kind of fun stuff you can gift the kids in your life this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap’s deal with Sony Music means it now partners with all three major music labels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nQ8lhXmfur572J_YopQC6kD0mvQ=/0x5:2844x1901/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70149151/snapchat_sony_deal.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9NKDZE"&gt;Snapchat is adding audio from Sony Music Entertainment to its Sounds library, according to a report by &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/snap-licensing-sony-music-1235112123/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This means that Snap has now inked deals with all three major music labels: Sony Music Entertainment, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548673/snapchat-universal-music-group-snap-partnership-spotlight"&gt;Universal Music Group&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/snapchat-add-songs-music-deal-wmg-tiktok-1234723547/"&gt;Warner Music Group&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from the Big Three, the platform also partners with Warner Chappell, BMG, Kobalt, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="63lWCD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The platform has seen 521 million videos created with Sounds since the feature’s launch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0VgF4a"&gt;Snapchat will also start rolling out Sound Lenses, as noted in a press release on the &lt;a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/sounds-sony"&gt;Snap newsroom&lt;/a&gt;, featuring pre-selected songs and visual effects that make the subject look like they’re singing. It plans on adding Cameo Sound Lenses as well, which lets two users appear together in an animated music video. Snap says you can identify music-embedded Lenses by looking for the music note on their Lens icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnAwNF"&gt;Snap’s deal with three of the biggest music publishers puts the platform on par with TikTok, which already signed pacts with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272595/tiktok-universal-music-group-deal-merlin-sony-music"&gt;Universal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21546323/tiktok-sony-music-licensing-deal-labels-app"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/record-labels-reap-billion-dollar-bonanza-from-tunes-on-social-media"&gt;Warner&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier this month, Snap &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757095/snapchat-nbcuniversal-audio-office-snl-shrek-tiktok"&gt;signed a deal with NBCUniversal&lt;/a&gt;, adding audio from popular shows and movies, like &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Shrek&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bridesmaids&lt;/em&gt;, and more to its Sounds library. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21516348/snapchat-snap-sounds-music-ios-update"&gt;Snapchat launched sounds last October&lt;/a&gt;, throwing its TikTok-like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;short-form video feature, Spotlight&lt;/a&gt;, into the mix shortly thereafter. According to a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/snapsounds-universalmusicgroup/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; sent out by Snap in June, the platform has seen 521 million videos created with Sounds, resulting in 31 billion views since Snap first introduced the feature.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Let’s chat about RCS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iFTZFuwe0dIZFlvcOl-0Xn2lpXY=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70149133/acastro_211115_4880_0002.0.gif" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oUdhTU"&gt;Every Tuesday on &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we’re pulling apart a different new tech standard that is designed to replace tech standards before it. Last week, we explored &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772024/vergecast-podcast-usb-c-future"&gt;the fractious history and fraught future of USB-C&lt;/a&gt;. This week, we’re talking about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/12/18137937/rcs-rich-communication-service-messaging-explainer-what-is-google-chat"&gt;Rich Communication Services, or RCS&lt;/a&gt;. Will it replace SMS? Google is trying to make it happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CoDK7x"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP4498295924&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pmmytB"&gt;To really understand why Google is going all-in on RCS, you have to understand that there’s &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/7/"&gt;a rich and complicated history of messaging apps at Google&lt;/a&gt; and also RCS’s own history that’s entirely separate from Google. On the &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; RCS special, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; executive editor Dieter Bohn walks you through the messy past and uncertain future of the texting standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pr5g2w"&gt;Dieter also talks with Sanaz Ahari, senior director of communications products at Google, and Ron Amadeo, reviews editor at &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to help explain how RCS works, why it’s dependent on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931202/us-carriers-rcs-cross-carrier-messaging-initiative-ccmi-att-tmobile-sprint-verizon"&gt;the big three US carriers&lt;/a&gt;, what features can be added to the service in the future, and of course, whether &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715696/svp-android-invitation-apple-rcs-texting-iphone"&gt;Apple will ever support it on the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZe9mT"&gt;Listen here or in your preferred podcast player for the full episode of our RCS special. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4mDKGC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Vergecast&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;","description":"The podcast you need to make sense of the week in tech news","label":"Subscribe","url":"http://Subscribe"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Bose’s new QuietComfort 45 are seeing their first price drop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yr13l0Yh25We617ksj2MwBbT6cg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70149112/cwelch_202109_4775_5625.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The headphones are selling for a discounted $279 today.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hFDi1t"&gt;Some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; you can buy right now are Bose’s QuietComfort 45, and they’re selling at the lowest price we’ve seen yet. Just two months following their release, you can buy them for $279 from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098FKXT8L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYqeoj9E2O" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://adorama.rfvk.net/2ryLqz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; as a part of their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;early Black Friday sales&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a solid $50 price drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haBgJ3"&gt;If comfort is key, these are some of the most cozy headphones to wear. Like previous QuietComfort models, these can fold up and be stowed in the included zip-up case. They offer up to 24 hours of battery life per charge — you can even enjoy three hours of usage with just 15 minutes of charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nBWaEK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10857708"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="x959qD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"},{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"},{"title":"Win a mystery bag from The Verge jam-packed with free stuff","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22771977/mystery-bag-sweepstakes-gear-tech-entry-rules-black-friday-2021-holidays"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kdspCa"&gt;With the rare combo of being dynamic wall art and a 4K QLED TV in one, Samsung’s unique Frame TV is back down to its lowest price once again. Oddly, Amazon increased the price for this model last week, but now readers can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=58&amp;amp;imprToken=ccbe924a-908d-b765-2dc&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22523255%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,498&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=59&amp;amp;imprToken=ccbe924a-908d-b765-2dc&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22523255%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $998&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. When not in use, the TV displays customizable photos or art. But when you need to use it as a TV, it has handy features like Amazon’s Alexa built in and a 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5gVG7"&gt;You can also still buy these TVs for roughly the same prices at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeAej60sy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike Amazon, Best Buy is including a 30-day subscription to FuboTV Pro, if that dictates where you make your purchase. It's worth noting that while Amazon no longer offers a free six-month HBO Max subscription as it did earlier this month, there’s a possibility we could see a similar perk come back as Black Friday nears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SFrYMb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10847966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="gbIbTj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10819823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QDfG83"&gt;Apple’s most affordable desktop computer, the 2020 Mac Mini, is currently the cheapest it’s ever been. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling the 256GB version for $600 instead of its typical $700 at checkout. &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/.product.100694159.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; is also offering it for the same price until November 29th, though you need to be a member to get it there for that price. Note that Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5P7TLW/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB version for $750&lt;/a&gt; at checkout instead of $899. You can place an order at that price, but it’s on backorder currently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ua3p2o"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that Apple’s M1-equipped Mac Mini outperforms most other Intel-based Macs, thanks to the M1 chip and its efficiently cooled chassis. It also comes with Wi-Fi 6 support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="el3DDZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10795407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JRECoU"&gt;Prefer a Chromebook over a desktop computer? We’ve got you. The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is often on sale, but today’s discounts on both the 2020 and 2021 models are some of the best we’ve seen yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BAFikk"&gt;Right now, Best Buy is selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfM3aomFXkf?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22490339%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2021 model&lt;/a&gt; for $529 instead of $699. It comes with 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an Evo-certified 11th Gen Intel Core i5 processor. Meanwhile, you can save more money without compromising on battery life or build quality by getting the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfMWtFCPMfN?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22490339%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 version&lt;/a&gt; of that very same Chromebook. Typically $529, Best Buy is selling that one for $389. Though, it comes with just 4GB RAM, a slower 64GB eMMC SSD, and Intel’s 10th Gen Core i3 processor model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkS9HE"&gt;My colleague Monica Chin highly recommends both Acer Chromebook Spin 713 model, praising how the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 version&lt;/a&gt; outperformed many others at the time of its release in terms of features, build quality, and performance. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2021 model&lt;/a&gt;, they wrote, improves on its predecessor with Thunderbolt 4 support and Intel’s 11th Gen processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GSFkTp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505954"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="HReJCZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730313"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6JSQWF"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; reviewer Chris Welch, Amazon’s new Fire TV Stick 4K Max — while a mouthful of a name — is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715206/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s “best straightforward 4K streamer.”&lt;/a&gt; And good news, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MQZXN1X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire TV Stick 4K Max&lt;/a&gt; is on sale for the first time. Instead of paying its usual $55 cost, you can buy the stick for $35.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5rn0n"&gt;Amazon’s latest flagship streaming stick supports Wi-Fi 6 and offers noticeably improved performance compared to the Fire TV Stick 4K. Apps launch faster and navigation feels more fluid, while there’s also support for Dolby Vision, HDR, HDR10 Plus, and Dolby Atmos. Meanwhile, the updated remote in the box comes with handy shortcuts to live TV programming and apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wiFh00"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10866896"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eveFAD"&gt;If you prefer wireless earbuds to over-ear headphones, but you still crave active noise cancellation, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/164914311936?mkcid=1&amp;amp;mkrid=711-53200-19255-0&amp;amp;siteid=0&amp;amp;campid=5338794975&amp;amp;customid=VergeDeals110921&amp;amp;toolid=10001&amp;amp;mkevt=1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/11/9/22770263/apple-airpods-google-pixelbook-hisense-tv-macbook-air-deal-sale&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22534304__t_w__r_theverge.com/authors__d_" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay’&lt;/a&gt;s deal on a refurbished pair of Jabra Elite 85t buds is tough to pass up. You can get them for $95 through Jabra’s digital storefront. Up until now, eBay was selling the pair for a discounted $100, meaning you can now save about $135 off the new cost. Jabra says that although these may have minor blemishes, they’ve been inspected and cleaned and include all original accessories. The pair also comes with a two-year warranty. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lSDZjd"&gt;Apple’s AirTag Loop, which securely attaches the AirTag Bluetooth tracker to backpacks and other items, is selling for an Amazon all-time low. Typically $29, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932LZM6K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling the deep navy version for $21.96 instead.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Beyond Bebop: a guide to the works of Shinichiro Watanabe</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iWQMfS0LDWoFOtuALTgoMHiod4s=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70149072/C_T_ep01_0308__Prores.mov_001150.956_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carole &amp;amp; Tuesday.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IlRF90"&gt;Thanks to its heavy Western pop culture influences and long life in reruns on Adult Swim, &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; has long been one of Americans’ most successful gateway drugs to anime. With the original anime now streaming on Netflix in advance of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776962/cowboy-bebop-review-netflix"&gt;its live-action adaptation premiering November 19th&lt;/a&gt;, even more new viewers can discover “the work which becomes a new genre itself.” However, while &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; is as close to a household name as adult-oriented anime get in the States, director Shinichiro Watanabe’s other works have never found the same level of mainstream success, despite featuring much of the same stunning animation, beautiful music, and sharp post-modernist sensibility that made &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phFF3Q"&gt;If you’ve enjoyed &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, here’s a guide to help you explore the rest of Watanabe’s rich catalog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZE7uC1"&gt;If you want to see where Watanabe started: &lt;em&gt;Macross Plus&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dHV9IW"&gt;Watanabe made his directorial debut co-directing the 1994 OVA (original video animation) series &lt;em&gt;Macross Plus&lt;/em&gt; alongside Shoji Kawamori. &lt;em&gt;Macross&lt;/em&gt; is the mecha anime franchise that got partially localized as part of &lt;em&gt;Robotech&lt;/em&gt;, but you don’t need to have seen any other &lt;em&gt;Macross&lt;/em&gt; series to enjoy &lt;em&gt;Plus&lt;/em&gt;’ &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;/em&gt;-style fighter pilot rivalries and battles against an evil AI pop star, written long before Hatsune Miku became a thing. Screenwriter Keiko Nobumoto, composer Yoko Kanno, and animation studio Sunrise would all go on to collaborate on &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJZC3q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macross Plus&lt;/em&gt; isn’t currently available for streaming and DVDs are out of print, but the 1995 &lt;em&gt;Macross Plus Movie Edition&lt;/em&gt;, which edits the series’s four episodes into a single film, will screen in theaters courtesy of Fathom Events on December 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H32Bg0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hficV9yr2mA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SyBuQC"&gt;If you loved how &lt;em&gt;Bebop &lt;/em&gt;blended genres: &lt;em&gt;Samurai Champloo&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pbXo50"&gt;Probably Watanabe’s second most popular anime thanks to its Adult Swim broadcast at the height of the 2000s anime boom, the 2004 series &lt;em&gt;Samurai Champloo&lt;/em&gt; remixes historical dramas with hip-hop much the same way &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; combined space Westerns with jazz. Utilizing a similar episodic structure and cast of traveling misfits, &lt;em&gt;Champloo&lt;/em&gt; is a slightly lighter viewing experience than &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt;; it’s a more straightforward heroes’ journey that holds back on lasting tragedy. But &lt;em&gt;Champloo&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just style over substance: amid all the cool fights and anachronistic humor are interesting ideas about Japan’s relationship with the West and how society treats marginalized groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCRpA9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samurai Champloo&lt;/em&gt; is streaming on Hulu and Funimation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NyYoOs"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7plEDcWy0Oc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="St7IWb"&gt;If you want more awesome jazz: &lt;em&gt;Kids on the Slope&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="A5RZAq"&gt;Eight years passed between &lt;em&gt;Champloo&lt;/em&gt; and Watanabe’s next TV series, 2012’s &lt;em&gt;Kids on the Slope&lt;/em&gt;. Based on the manga by Yuki Kodama, &lt;em&gt;Kids on the Slope&lt;/em&gt; was a major change of pace for Watanabe, abandoning action and genre conceits in favor of a realistic drama about teenagers in the 1960s playing jazz music together. The lower key storyline explains why &lt;em&gt;Kids on the Slope&lt;/em&gt; largely got overlooked, but this is a genuine gem of a show that makes amazing use of its director’s musical passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLjBDp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kids on the Slope&lt;/em&gt; is streaming on Crunchyroll and Hidive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hYw28d"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XoZ2udQkr3c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="itMSu4"&gt;If you wished &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt;’s comedy episodes went even further: &lt;em&gt;Space Dandy&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MbChmH"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Space Dandy&lt;/em&gt; premiered on Adult Swim in 2014 (a rare occasion in which a Japanese anime premiered in America before Japan), fans were hoping this new Watanabe-directed sci-fi series would be the next &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt;. What they got was less &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; and more Douglas Adams crossed with an animation film festival. Watanabe was the chief director of &lt;em&gt;Dandy&lt;/em&gt;, but the series is best understood as an anthology in which different directors each got to do their own unique stories about three bumbling, horny alien hunters. Characters could die in one episode and be fine in the next, all connected via a multiverse metanarrative as ambitious as anything attempted by Marvel or &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Dandy&lt;/em&gt; isn’t &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, but if you liked the latter’s sense of humor, there’s a lot to love about &lt;em&gt;Dandy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11QPuk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Dandy &lt;/em&gt;is streaming on Hulu, Funimation, and Tubi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TxlBoB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g1ARRcK4LVs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="t8rvED"&gt;If you’re interested in an ambitious political statement: &lt;em&gt;Terror in Resonance&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gQh0mT"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Space Dandy&lt;/em&gt; was where Watanabe directed his experimental and comedic instincts in 2014, &lt;em&gt;Terror in Resonance&lt;/em&gt; was where he was aiming his more serious sensibilities and attempts at social commentary. A story about young savants trying to take down the Japanese government through acts of terrorism, &lt;em&gt;Terror in Resonance&lt;/em&gt; is either Watanabe’s most muted success or his most ambitious failure. He and his writers clearly had a lot to say with this anime, and the animation and music are fantastic, but there’s maybe a few too many ridiculous twists to take the story seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAkt2R"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terror in Resonance&lt;/em&gt; is streaming on Hulu and Funimation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5nWCGR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yriU4eXzXP8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Hs1KS1"&gt;If you want to return to the &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt;-verse… and need all the feels: &lt;em&gt;Carole &amp;amp; Tuesday&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="OsnXc2"&gt;2019’s &lt;em&gt;Carole &amp;amp; Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; takes place in the Martian metropolis of Alba City, the same setting as &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop: The Movie&lt;/em&gt;. Though the timeline details aren’t exactly clear (&lt;em&gt;Carole &amp;amp; Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; theoretically takes place only a few years after &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; but has very different technology), Watanabe has said the two shows share a universe (&lt;em&gt;Dandy&lt;/em&gt; happens to exist as a cartoon within this universe). That might be enough to make &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; lovers interested, but &lt;em&gt;Carole &amp;amp; Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; is a unique experience all its own that might very well be Watanabe’s most emotional serialized narrative. The story of an orphaned refugee and the neglected daughter of a xenophobic politician teaming up to pursue pop stardom is by turns wholesome, hilarious, heavy, and heartwarming. The soundtrack features a wide range of styles and includes such artists as Flying Lotus, Thundercat, and Denzel Curry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxgnhF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carole &amp;amp; Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; is streaming on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TlWvwh"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylqBPksn36A?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d2uvdc"&gt;Extra credit: shorts, storyboards, and music&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2uuUy8"&gt;Watanabe’s resume of short films leans heavily on his Western popularity, working with Hollywood franchises and major music artists. For &lt;em&gt;The Animatrix&lt;/em&gt; (streaming on HBO Max), he directed the rotoscoped Matrix awakening “Kid’s Story” and the neo-noir “A Detective Story.” His 2017 short film &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner Black Out 2022&lt;/em&gt; (on YouTube) fills in the gaps between the original &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt; (Watanabe is credited as a creative producer on the new &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner: Black Lotus&lt;/em&gt; series on Adult Swim and Crunchyroll). Watanabe also directed the music video for “More” by Flying Lotus featuring Anderson .Paak. The most obscure of Watanabe’s shorts, “Baby Blue” from the 2008 &lt;em&gt;Genius Party&lt;/em&gt; anthology film (on Hoopla, Tubi, and Kanopy), is a charming high school romance story that in many ways plays as a test run for &lt;em&gt;Kids on the Slope&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxLaBR"&gt;Beyond directing, Watanabe has done other jobs here and there throughout the anime industry. He’s storyboarded episodes of &lt;em&gt;The Vision of Escaflowne&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ergo Proxy&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Birdy the Mighty Decode&lt;/em&gt;, but his most common role tends to be helping on the musical side of things. He was the musical producer on Masaaki Yuasa’s film &lt;em&gt;Mind Game&lt;/em&gt; and on Sayo Yamamoto’s first two TV anime, &lt;em&gt;Michiko &amp;amp; Hatchin&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lupin the Third: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine, &lt;/em&gt;and directed the ending theme animation for &lt;em&gt;Death Parade&lt;/em&gt;. This year, he advised on the soundtrack for &lt;em&gt;Sonny Boy&lt;/em&gt;, a surreal take on &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/em&gt; from fellow &lt;em&gt;Space Dandy&lt;/em&gt; director Shingo Natsume.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter stops auto-refreshing timelines so tweets won’t disappear while you’re still reading them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qd51QueZt64PWvcGwY3h4ZaNWrk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148903/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter has updated its web platform to prevent users’ feeds from auto-refreshing | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o7C69z"&gt;Twitter has updated its platform to prevent auto-refreshing of users’ feeds that caused some tweets to “disappear” while they were reading them. The platform first announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688697/twitter-fix-disappearing-tweets-issue"&gt;working on the update in September&lt;/a&gt;, saying “we know it’s a frustrating experience” when tweets disappeared from view mid-read, and the fix is now rolling out to Twitter’s web platform. Users will be able to load new tweets by clicking on a tweet counter bar that will appear at the top of their timelines above existing tweets in their feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fyBAeA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;An update to the disappearing Tweet experience is rolling out for web! Now you can choose when you want new Tweets to load into your timeline –– click the Tweet counter bar at the top.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1460304788621508618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uIbkWd"&gt;The web version of Twitter will now behave the way its native iOS and Android apps already do; neither one auto-refreshes users’ timelines, instead loading the tweets for when the user manually refreshes their feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i96RTN"&gt;Twitter has been adding new features regularly over the past several months; in addition to its audio chat room &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570150/twitter-spaces-clubhouse-voice-rooms-testing"&gt;Spaces, which it launched&lt;/a&gt; almost exactly a year ago, the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22766286/twitter-blue-subscription-service-scroll-nuzzel-undo-tweets-ad-free-articles-us"&gt;rolled out its Twitter Blue premium service&lt;/a&gt; to users in the US earlier this month. For a monthly fee of $2.99, Twitter Blue’s features include the ability to “undo” tweets, ad-free articles from some publishers, and a Nuzzel-like roundup of top articles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7owwu"&gt;The latest update, like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;decision to shut down Fleets&lt;/a&gt; less than a year after introducing the expiring tweets feature, suggests Twitter does take users’ feedback into consideration when making changes and updates. Now if we could just persuade them to add editable tweets... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uI4Icx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter shouldn’t be hiding basic app improvements behind its Blue paywall  ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/14/22778827/twitter-blue-undo-button-paywall-features-paid-free"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aGPyMp"&gt;Happy Tuesday, peeps. We’re so close to Thanksgiving, I can taste the cornbread casserole. Yes, that is my dish, and yes, I’m from the Midwest. No further questions, please! We have a relatively light one today, which seems to be because many companies are taking it easy through the rest of the year. The social audio companies, however, are continuing to land the deals and make the news. No rest for the startups. Although I have lots of things to say about Spotify’s audiobook company acquisition from Thursday, I’m saving it for hopefully later this week. (If you work in the literary world and have some thoughts on the audiobook market, feel free to reach out!) Otherwise, let’s get to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqFVN6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The New York Times&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; says COVID misinformation is rampant in audio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTrcGx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/business/media/coronavirus-misinformation-radio-podcasts.html"&gt;has chimed in on&lt;/a&gt; how podcast and radio hosts are handling the pandemic — they’re spreading misinformation, heeding their own advice, and dying because of it. Dark. The piece names and shames a who’s who of radio and podcasting companies, including iHeart Media, Spotify, and Apple, which have allowed some of these shows to distribute their programming on their respective platforms. (Shockingly, Cumulus doesn’t come up in the piece despite being the place where a star podcaster and radio host &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733806/hot-pod-apple-event-airpods-dolby-atmos-cumulus-dan-bongino"&gt;is protesting&lt;/a&gt; a corporate vaccine mandate.) The piece specifically focuses on where these podcasts are distributed, not who’s making or monetizing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JrbDTv"&gt;To give you a sense of what we’re working with in this story, among the quotes is one from a pastor and podcaster who says the virus is “an egg that hatches into a synthetic parasite and grows inside your body.” (His show is available through iHeart’s app, reports the paper.) Someone watched too much &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; and didn’t realize it was fiction, I guess. This was the same person who also apparently said a “Jew coup” was behind the efforts to impeach former President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjlZyl"&gt;I feel like I’ve read this same story a bunch already, but the thing I’m watching and wondering about, that the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ piece mentions, is how tech companies’ moderation policies are likely stricter than many audio-specific companies’. It links iHeart’s &lt;a href="https://www.iheart.com/content/iheartmedia-podcast-content-policy/"&gt;content policy&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/"&gt;Spotify’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/support/891-content-and-subscription-guidelines"&gt;Apple’s&lt;/a&gt;, but one that doesn’t come up — and I’m curious to know if it even exists — is Cumulus’. iHeart also declined to tell the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; whether it had any sort of policy around COVID misinformation. I care about this partially because I think as more listening time goes to the tech platforms, including Facebook, there could be a world in which a podcast can’t be published on the big tech platforms, and podcast companies have to distribute their shows through other means. (Also, moderating these podcasts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22273071/podcast-moderation-apple-spotify-podbean-steve-bannon"&gt;will be difficult, if not impossible&lt;/a&gt;, which I went long on here in February and is likely the more pressing concern.) I sense impending drama, and I’m ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxU95b"&gt;Now, let’s move into tech world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYk311"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify keeps trying to make Greenroom happen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4hs2Ts"&gt;Spotify &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-11-15/kicking-off-a-new-slate-of-spotify-greenroom-shows-host-lauren-simmons-gives-her-two-cents-on-her-upcoming-show-money-moves/"&gt;yesterday announced&lt;/a&gt; it has a new slate of live social audio shows launching along with the news that people no longer have to log in to listen, which, great. They can do so from their browser or phone, meaning promotion of the programming will be much easier. The less friction the better. Among the shows is one about being a Taylor Swift fan and going deep on her music and another from Spotify Original podcast host Lauren Simmons where she’ll answer Gen Z’s questions. IDK! Spotify &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; promise to make its audio content and product all about the fans, and this seems to fulfill that promise pretty specifically. Will it be enough to compete with Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces, though?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MvZYv"&gt;Which...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EM7I7Q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clubhouse hosts Oprah, only 23K people tuned in&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJgyoJ"&gt;Last night, Clubhouse’s head of global marketing Maya Watson got on the app and with her came Oprah Winfrey and her bestie Gayle King. The group, along with other Clubhouse folks, discussed Winfrey’s Adele interview and how it came together. This is a major get for any platform; an exclusive Winfrey chat immediately following the premiere of a highly anticipated two-hour interview? I mean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z79WzG"&gt;Here’s the thing, though, &lt;a href="https://ios.clubhouse.com/room/M6jlXX8J"&gt;the recording of the show&lt;/a&gt; indicates only 22.7K people tuned in at all, including people who might have even just dropped in briefly before leaving. At CBS, where the special premiered, 10 million people &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/15/media/adele-special-concert-ratings/index.html"&gt;tuned in&lt;/a&gt;. We could interpret this in a couple ways. One could be that if the app can’t draw in a major audience for the queen of television then why even try? The other is Winfrey and the Clubhouse team suffered from a lack of marketing. If CBS had simultaneously promoted the special and the Clubhouse after-event, maybe it would have stood a better shot at success. But alas, here we are. I will say, as an aside, this is the first Clubhouse replay I’ve watched, and the experience is well built. You can skip around, view who’s talking, and essentially, relive the event as if you were in the app when it happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EpWI6"&gt;Okay a couple more small things and then we’ll wrap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t44dJn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K14ZXi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snapchat keeps signing music deals for its TikTok copy, Spotlight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZhgrG"&gt;I’ve been wanting to check in with Snapchat’s TikTok clone Spotlight and finally have an opportunity for an update. Now, you might wonder, why here in this audio-centric newsletter? To which I’d argue these short videos are, yes, visual experiences, but ones that are highly reliant on audio, particularly audio with the chance to go viral. So with that context, Snapchat yesterday announced it &lt;a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/sounds-sony/"&gt;signed a deal&lt;/a&gt; with Sony Music Entertainment to bring its artists’ tracks to the platform. It’s now on par with TikTok, having signed deals with all three major labels — Sony, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTlrB7"&gt;More interesting to me, though, is the deal Snap &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757095/snapchat-nbcuniversal-audio-office-snl-shrek-tiktok"&gt;signed earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; with NBCUniversal to bring audio from &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bridesmaids&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Parks and Recreation&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live &lt;/em&gt;to the app. This feels like the beginning of something big — dialogue and scripting having the chance to go viral, which is much more in the podcasting vein. Also it comes with the idea that companies could make actual deals for access to that audio? Maybe there’s something here for comedy podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84WhpI"&gt;One last thing before we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiMI49"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitch launches an incubator program for musicians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIKxQW"&gt;The worlds, they converge. Twitch, primarily known for its gaming livestreams, is eyeing the music space. It already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710438/heavyweight-podcast-gimlet-exclusive-spotify-hot-pod"&gt;signed a deal with Warner Music Group&lt;/a&gt; to bring its musicians to the app for exclusive channels, but now it’s &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/artists/the-collective/#faq"&gt;launching an incubator program&lt;/a&gt; for artists called The Collective. Chosen participants will receive hands-on guidance from the Twitch team, as well as “prioritized discovery, promotion, and activations” from partners, like Amazon Music and &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;. The idea seems to be to make Twitch a place you spend more time in, even if you’re not streaming a video game, and the payoff for the musicians is reaching a young demographic and learning from the Twitch team itself. All the tech companies want to own not just your visual attention span, but your ears, too, and Twitch &lt;a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2015/03/31/a-new-persistent-player-for-mobile-ed23b61efa9d/#:~:text=Audio%20Only%20mode.,and%20select%20Audio%20Only%20mode."&gt;offers&lt;/a&gt; an audio-only mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whjtvv"&gt;Alright, we’re out of here. I’m back Thursday for you paying subscribers, and if you’re interested in signing up, you can do so &lt;a href="https://hotpodnews.com/subscribe/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We deliver scoops, exclusives, and more analysis. If you care about audio, you should be reading it, just sayin’. Talk to you later! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Don’t take Nvidia’s word for it — try Nvidia’s awesome new image comparison tool, instead  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F1CwwFw8ml2qG-TS3OtnHz0jVPY=/16x0:2640x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148689/twarren_rtx3080_3_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jiw9Co"&gt;Nvidia wants you to know that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545441/amd-dlss-fidelityfx-super-resolution-fsr-supersampling-tests-benchmarks"&gt;AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR)&lt;/a&gt; is a mere pretender, nothing like the Nvidia Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technique its GPUs can use to boost the framerate and/or image quality of your games. To prove it, Nvidia is trying an interesting new tactic by releasing a remarkably powerful image comparison tool called Nvidia ICAT, for free, so that anyone can see for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qX0zL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Ftechnologies%2Ficat%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F16%2F22784404%2Fnvidia-icat-dlss-spatial-temporal-upscaling-graphics" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ICAT&lt;/a&gt;, short for “Image Comparison And Analysis,” is a very simple program that lets you view a stack of gameplay screenshots and even recorded videos side-by-side, automatically lining up the frames, and allowing you to fluidly pan across each scene, zoom in and out, on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of those images or videos &lt;em&gt;simultaneously. &lt;/em&gt;It’s got a drag-and-drop interface that makes pixel peeping child’s play, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769156/iphone-13-pro-vs-pixel-6-pro-camera-comparison-photos"&gt;and as known pixel peepers&lt;/a&gt;, you’d better believe &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;is going to be using it for more than just gaming graphics! &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f1hPNNhVqLmp-sxcwyaNZXRgvgQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018127/nvidia_icat_verge_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s new ICAT tool in action. There’s also an image slider mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HRopCk"&gt;But Nvidia’s hope, again, is to show how poor AMD’s FSR is compared to DLSS — or even Nvidia’s own, separate spatial upscaling technique. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JrCJY"&gt;In case you need a brief primer: &lt;strong&gt;Spatial upscaling&lt;/strong&gt; techniques, like AMD FSR, run each of your game’s video frames one at a time through a fixed algorithm — and they don’t require a special GPU to run. Nvidia’s DLSS, on the other hand, is a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;temporal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; upscaling&lt;/strong&gt; technique that compares multiple frames and takes account of how things are moving in a video game scene, and processes all that using a neural network that runs exclusively on the Tensor cores you can only find in an Nvidia RTX GPU. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVirmcTpJkFMIYutOrKlUg3Qu88=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018071/temporal_spacial_nvidia.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia illustrates how temporal and spatial upscaling differ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GvZrVb"&gt;But before you say “that’s great Nvidia, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776567/evga-line-queue-to-get-nvidia-rtx-3000-graphics-card-works"&gt;I can’t actually buy your new GPUs!&lt;/a&gt;” you should probably know that Nvidia has its own spatial upscaler as well, dubbed Nvidia Image Scaling. It’s apparently been buried in the Nvidia Control Panel for some time now, and today Nvidia is open-sourcing it on GitHub with its own SDK and support for every brand of GPU. Developers can natively integrate it into their games if they want, just like AMD’s FSR. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nZw8lIqddEAhoeFtINvcq_qgXmw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018097/image_scaling_sdk.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pd1FHxDnVtUXO7nUOegRUWt9s64=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018104/nvidia_sharpness_slider.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AfLzPU"&gt;And, the company’s baking Nvidia Image Scaling into its GeForce Experience app so you can turn it on for any game, and adjust an in-game sharpness slider (so you can see the difference) using Nvidia’s overlay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRTWTo"&gt;Is it as good as Nvidia’s DLSS? Not even close, and Nvidia’s the first to admit it. In a briefing with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, product manager Henry Lin hammered us with example after example of how DLSS (particularly the new DLSS 2.3, which suffers from less ghosting around moving objects) not only beats the pants off of Nvidia’s own spatial upscaler, but sometimes performs better than a native image. Particularly when you’re looking at thin objects with lots of edges that tend to flicker:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The communications dish is crisper and less aliased with DLSS." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fhG49x9kBDmAByVG-_IuzN83lVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018114/spatial_upscaler_vs_dlss_briefing.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pictured communications dish is one place DLSS has an advantage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="viO3HL"&gt;Personally, I’ve sworn by native resolution all the way — but Nvidia’s ICAT made me curious enough to put it to the test. So I fired up &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt;, two games that offer both AMD FSR and Nvidia DLSS, on a 4K screen at their highest quality modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOSXr4"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt;, I felt vindicated. Every part of the image looked fuller, crisper, and higher resolution at native 4K, up to and including the roof-mounted antenna:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XZjKcx7jFn2mDeJa2h_rwBLPjr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018153/nvidia_icat_verge_b4b.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll want to tap to zoom and/or download, this is a 4K image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PGW6Ia"&gt;There were even parts of the scene where AMD FSR clearly beat Nvidia DLSS, like all of these wooden textures:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xAFXygM2rGuL-riD-Kh-i2KtRgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018154/nvidia_icat_verge_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe Nvidia’s neural network needs more experience with wood.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="13IMFh"&gt;But when I tried out &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, it was the opposite story: almost everywhere I looked, DLSS was resolving and preserving details I couldn’t even see at native resolution, and with far, far less flicker from distant aliased objects. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0B2lrXQZPuNPwENllnlkDZczbVw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018227/nvidia_icat_verge_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Deathloop, the VW bus in the background looks decidedly less cartoony with DLSS, and you can see far more detail in distant textures. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lTZ85YWBntbB8eV6lqN3Y-c8DZo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018242/flicker_deathloop_native.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Native 4K, blown up to show detail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVRvlbyGzb195HW6AgVMdOZcb7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018241/flicker_deathloop_dlss.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DLSS Quality, at the same size. Less flicker, more detail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uic9RB"&gt;That said, I still saw moments in &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; where DLSS does weird things, too. Scroll up to the top of this post for one example: you can see how DLSS totally changed the sparkly finish of the Strelak Verso pistols and muddies the texture of the dirt ground in the exact same scene as my other screenshots and GIFs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxkYOe"&gt;I’m not a believer in DLSS quite yet, but I’m intrigued. Nvidia’s promise is that, with enough learning, games can actually look better &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; run faster than native with DLSS turned on. For now, it’s something developers have to enable on a per-game basis, and not all games have the same version to offer, but that could change down the road. Nvidia’s Lin tells me that &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;already features over-the-air DLSS updates — when you open the game, it can check with the Nvidia driver to see if there’s a new version and hot swap it at launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MO81r0"&gt;“Wherever you see DLSS not match native, that’s what we’ll be working on,” says Lin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUeS26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9UH7OW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6bbRX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>1Password 8 arrives on Windows with a new design and big performance improvements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e3p3vr11wdY-XcLAIrtfVtoZ6t8=/80x0:2480x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148701/Dark___1Password_8_for_Windows_hero_image__unlocked.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;1Password 8 now includes a dark mode for Windows.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: AgileBits&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HqIpIM"&gt;1Password is getting its first major design update in more than three years today, with the launch of 1Password 8 for Windows. It includes a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/Verge1PasswordImprovements111621/https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-for-windows-dark-mode-edition/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new design&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/Verge1PasswordImprovements111621/https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-for-windows-dark-mode-edition/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dark mode&lt;/a&gt; that better matches some of the recent UI improvements across Windows 10 and Windows 11. 1Password is also now built on Rust, to improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="weY4d4"&gt;The entire desktop app now looks a lot more like the web or 1Password browser extension interface, with updated item icons, detailed views for items and vaults, and a redesigned sidebar. There’s also a new quick find feature and improvements to search results to make it easier to find the login entry you need.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KPPzoVtAIrzOSAhSFU-k3C5tyYE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018397/NextLevelEditing.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: AgileBits&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The editing experience in 1Password 8 is a lot easier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rfyvPD"&gt;It’s also a lot easier to edit entries now, with a new password generator and the ability to add files directly into items. 1Password 8 also includes a security questions feature, if there are still websites out there that need this type of login.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjVBXb"&gt;Underneath the new design, 1Password is now built on Rust which should improve performance and security. “You won’t see this change but you’ll feel it,” &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/Verge1PasswordImprovements111621/https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-for-windows-is-now-in-early-access/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said 1Password founder Dave Teare&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. “The app is incredibly responsive across the board, from unlocking to adding accounts to searching your items.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLqA9B"&gt;If you use this dedicated 1Password Windows app with the browser extension, both will share a login state and you can even use Windows Hello for easier unlocking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MvfUO"&gt;The new 1Password 8 update is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/Verge1PasswordImprovements111621/https://1password.com/downloads/windows/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available now for Windows users&lt;/a&gt;, and is still in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619846/1password-8-macos-early-access-password-manager-app"&gt;early access mode&lt;/a&gt; for macOS users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11’s Black Screen of Death is changing back to blue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VGJnZKj5gvMjIhjWV4OoGJAyFbg=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148382/windows11bsod.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="31lKyR"&gt;Microsoft is changing its Black Screen of Death in Windows 11 back to the original blue color. The software giant originally changed its infamous Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559852/microsoft-windows-11-black-blue-screen-of-death-bsod-change"&gt;to black in Windows 11 earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, to match the new black logon and shutdown screens. It was the first major change to the BSOD since Microsoft added a sad face to the screen in Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxuxIL"&gt;That change is now being reverted in a Windows 11 update that’s due to be released any day now. “We changed the screen color to blue when a device stops working or a stop error occurs as in previous versions of Windows,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/11/12/releasing-windows-11-build-22000-346-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/"&gt;admits Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; in recent patch notes, spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/blue-screen-death-will-return-windows-11"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for the Windows 11 update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdIZQr"&gt;Microsoft first introduced the BSOD in Windows 3.0, offering a way for IT professionals and support personnel to diagnose hardware and memory faults. A BSOD is Windows’ own kernel error, and it typically includes a dump of data that IT admins can analyze to determine what is causing the crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvEXR3"&gt;It’s not clear why the BSOD is going back to blue in Windows 11, but it could be related to IT support calls. The Blue Screen of Death has long been part of Windows, and is an easy way for end users to spot a problem and call IT support. Imagine a scenario where IT admins are trying to troubleshoot issues remotely in a pandemic, and it’s easy to see where a black screen, that’s often associated with monitor issues, could be more confusing than the Blue Screen of Death everyone is used to.&lt;/p&gt;
