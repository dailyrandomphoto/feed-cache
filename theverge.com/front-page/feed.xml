    <title>Faze Clan is going public in $1 billion SPAC deal</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SXTpRn"&gt;Faze Clan is on track to become a publicly traded company. The competitive esports group is merging with B. Riley Principal 150 Merger Corp. in a deal that values the combined companies at $1 billion (via &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/faze-clan-stock-esports-spac-deal-1-billion-dollars-brpm-2021-10"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Markets Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). As a part of the deal, Faze Clan estimates it can get up to $291 million to help fund its growth, according to &lt;a href="https://fazeclan.com/public/"&gt;a post on Faze Clan’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MN2EmI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For you, the fans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our biggest announcement to date: FaZe Clan is going to become a publicly traded company. &lt;a href="https://t.co/HaHJtFIglW"&gt;https://t.co/HaHJtFIglW&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/YNYLpvVIRo"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YNYLpvVIRo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FaZe Clan (@FaZeClan) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FaZeClan/status/1452575754676580352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="PzXzRN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10368711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qQh20L"&gt;Faze Clan is known for its teams that compete in &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;, and more. With an audience of about 350 million people on social media, the group &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21239034/faze-clan-studios-film-tv-projects"&gt;opened up Faze Studios&lt;/a&gt; last year with one of the producers behind the Netflix original &lt;em&gt;13 Reasons Why&lt;/em&gt;. To further bolster its reputation, celebrities like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21400919/ben-simmons-faze-clan"&gt;NBA star Ben Simmons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20835760/offset-migos-faze-clan-esports-gaming-interview"&gt;hip hop artist Offset&lt;/a&gt;, and popular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451434/nickmercs-faze-clan-twitch-deal-renewal"&gt;Twitch streamer NickMercs&lt;/a&gt; have all joined the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ptYqN"&gt;Faze Clan will hit the NASDAQ with the ticker symbol FAZE in 2022, but some are skeptical of its arrival on the stock market. Jacob Wolf, a reporter for &lt;em&gt;Dot Esports&lt;/em&gt;, criticized the $1 billion valuation of Faze Clan, noting that Swift Media Entertainment, the parent company of Team Solo Mid, is worth less than half as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pxkhAD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;What this means is I expect FaZe to go on an acquisition spree the next year or so. They have to. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine acquisitions like 100 Thieves' of Higround (albeit that one is also somewhat hype based), or Swift's of Blitz App. The real challenge will be acquiring IP that isn't gated. &lt;a href="https://t.co/sNmCQHEiZR"&gt;https://t.co/sNmCQHEiZR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jacob Wolf (@JacobWolf) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JacobWolf/status/1452647685777989632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D44Vdx"&gt;In its post, Faze Clan says that it plans to step outside of content creation to gain a more diverse source of revenue. As Wolf notes, this may mean that Faze Clan will have to acquire hardware companies, software, or add some other type of tech brand to its portfolio. Esports organization 100 Thieves did just that earlier this month with its acquisition of Higround, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22723255/100-thieves-higround-acquisition-hardware-keyboards"&gt;a gaming peripheral company&lt;/a&gt;, which complements &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21211236/100-thieves-apparel-collection-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch"&gt;the group’s knack for apparel design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s value briefly passed $1 trillion after Hertz ordered 100,000 of its vehicles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Electric Car Maker Tesla Reports Record Quarterly Earnings" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cy6FSu1ENwRKL0_MYxbqRI0CzxM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70041271/1347936771.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QcJ6yp"&gt;Rental car company Hertz has ordered 100,000 Teslas as part of an ambitious plan to electrify its fleet. A first tranche of Tesla’s Model 3 sedans will be available to rent from Hertz in major US and European markets from early November, said the company in a &lt;a href="https://ir.hertz.com/2021-10-25-Hertz-Invests-in-Largest-Electric-Vehicle-Rental-Fleet-and-Partners-with-Seven-Time-Super-Bowl-Champion-Tom-Brady-to-Headline-New-Campaign"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. The announcement comes just months after Hertz &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/business/hertz-bankrupcty.html"&gt;escaped bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77ESnD"&gt;After the purchase was announced, Tesla’s stock price reached as high as $998.74, increasing its market cap to over $1 trillion before the price dropped again. As &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/tesla-shares-up-on-news-hertz-will-purchase-100000-electric-vehicles.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; notes, that put it in the rare company of other trillion-dollar market cap companies like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpQ0hC"&gt;News of the purchase was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/hertz-orders-100-000-teslas-tsla-stock-soars?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_content=business&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which says the deal is the single largest order ever for electric vehicles, and worth $4.2 billion in revenue to Tesla. The automaker’s stock was &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-stock-surges-toward-a-record-after-hertz-reportedly-ordered-100000-tesla-evs-2021-10-25"&gt;up 4.3 percent on the news&lt;/a&gt; in pre-market trading. It was also reported this morning that Tesla’s Model 3 became the first electric vehicle to top &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744481/tesla-model-3-tops-sales-charts-europe-electric-vehicles"&gt;monthly sales charts&lt;/a&gt; in Europe this September. Earlier this month, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22704830/tesla-sold-241300-cars-third-quarter"&gt;reported record sales&lt;/a&gt; in its third quarter, despite chip shortages denting the automotive market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="prErM2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s been a very good month for Tesla&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9fGrhC"&gt;Anyone renting a Tesla from Hertz will be able to use the automaker’s network of 3,000 superchargers across the US and Europe. Hertz says it’s planing on supplementing these chargers with “thousands” of its own, dispersed “throughout its location network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YbtfM"&gt;Hertz went into bankruptcy in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/business/hertz-bankruptcy-coronavirus-car-rental.html?searchResultPosition=1"&gt;May last year&lt;/a&gt; after the car rental market was hit hard by the pandemic. The company, which is more than a hundred years old, was eventually re-financed to the tune of $5.9 billion by investors led by Knighthead Capital Management and Certares Management. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg, &lt;/em&gt;Hertz now plans to electrify nearly all of its roughly 500,000 cars and vans, with the Tesla order comprising a significant first chunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erfKHV"&gt;In a press statement, Hertz’s interim CEO Mark Fields said: “Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we’ve only just begun to see rising global demand and interest. The new Hertz is going to lead the way as a mobility company, starting with the largest EV rental fleet in North America and a commitment to grow our EV fleet and provide the best rental and recharging experience for leisure and business customers around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpi4nh"&gt;To publicize the move, Hertz has launched a new ad campaign featuring Tom Brady. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9IcNMg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;GOAT’s recognize GOAT’s.

    <title>Tesla keeps ignoring the government’s requests to fix Autopilot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Vehicles And Charging Stations Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JENss41hIvxy7VEguw2cg_bfTrw=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70042964/1235987758.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TjhVh2"&gt;The National Transportation Safety Board is not happy with Tesla’s failure to respond to its safety recommendations made four years ago concerning the company’s controversial driver assist feature, Autopilot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFUkHm"&gt;In 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16294684/tesla-autopilot-fatal-crash-ntsb"&gt;NTSB recommended&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla and five other automakers install driver monitoring systems in their vehicles to ensure that drivers stay vigilant even when active safety systems are engaged. The board also implored automakers to limit the use of driver assist features on highways. The recommendations were made in response to an investigation into a crash in which a Tesla owner was killed when his car slammed into a truck that was crossing a highway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYWEuq"&gt;The five other automakers officially responded to the recommendations within the 90-day window that the safety board prescribes, and the NTSB officially flagged those responses as acceptable. But while Tesla did increase the frequency of alerts when drivers take their hands off the steering wheel while using Autopilot, Tesla never officially responded to the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="40tHk0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The board is “deeply concerned” with Tesla’s inaction&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IedQsr"&gt;The board is “deeply concerned” with Tesla’s inaction in responding to the recommendations, NTSB said in a letter released Monday. In fact, Tesla’s failure to respond has led to additional crashes and further safety lapses, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said in the letter to Tesla CEO Elon Musk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPliqb"&gt;“You have stated that ‘safety is always the primary design requirement for a Tesla,’” Homendy writes to Musk, before going on to lament the recent release of the company’s Full Self-Driving beta software update the enables some Tesla owners to use a more advanced version of Autopilot on city and residential streets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="et9VLn"&gt;“If you are serious about putting safety front and center in Tesla vehicle design, I invite you to complete action on the safety recommendations we issued four years ago,” she concludes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGzR74"&gt;The NTSB can conduct investigations and make recommendations but has no enforcement authority. NTSB isn’t a regulatory agency and, as such, lacks the ability to force Tesla’s hand. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has the ability to issue recalls, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744629/tesla-autopilot-secret-response-nhtsa-investigation"&gt;currently investigating possible defects in Autopilot&lt;/a&gt; that may have caused nearly a dozen crashes involving stationary emergency vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4zZYd"&gt;This isn’t the first time that NTSB has called Tesla out for its failure to respond to its recommendations. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152984/tesla-autopilot-safety-recommendations-ignored-ntsb-crash-hearing"&gt;former NTSB chair Robert Sumwalt made similar criticisms&lt;/a&gt; about Tesla’s inaction during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150546/tesla-autopilot-fatal-crash-invesigation-huang-ntsb-hearing-live-stream"&gt;a hearing about a fatal 2018 crash that involved Autopilot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dw0zS3"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22682272/ntsb-official-tesla-safety-elon-musk-full-self-driving"&gt;Homendy said in an interview&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla should address “basic safety issues” before the carmaker expands Full Self-Driving beta to more customers. She called Tesla’s decision to call its software update Full Self-Driving “misleading and irresponsible,” adding that Tesla “has clearly misled numerous people to misuse and abuse technology.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile delays shutdown of Sprint 3G network</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m1b-3gOt-1pUqjPvo4j7dC_X3UE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70035219/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile has delayed its plans to shut down Sprint’s CDMA network | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kyB0TN"&gt;T-Mobile said it will delay its planned shutdown of Sprint’s 3G network by three months to ensure its “partners” have time to help customers with the transition. It had originally planned to phase out the network in January; that date has now been pushed to March 31st, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Kh5mD"&gt;“Recently it’s become increasingly clear that some of those partners haven’t followed through on their responsibility to help their customers through this shift,” the company said in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fbusiness%2Fupdate-on-our-cdma-network-transition-plans&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F23%2F22741762%2Ftmobile-delays-shutdown-sprint-3g-network-dish-boost" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “So, we’re stepping up on their behalf.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRagtl"&gt;T-Mobile’s statement doesn’t mention it by name, but likely is referring to Dish Network. The two sides have tangled over T-Mobile’s announcement it was shutting down Sprint’s legacy network, because of the impact it would have on Dish’s Boost Mobile customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSrfgT"&gt;As one of the conditions of the T-Mobile/Sprint Merger, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;Dish acquired Boost Mobile&lt;/a&gt; in July, 2020 with the goal of Dish taking Sprint’s place as a fourth wireless carrier in the US. After T-Mobile announced it planned to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;shut down Sprint’s CDMA network&lt;/a&gt;, Dish chairman Charlie Ergen compared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"&gt;T-Mobile to the Grinch&lt;/a&gt;, and later said his company was making every effort to migrate its customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsLa4p"&gt;But T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Ffor-t-mobile-5g-connectivity-means-that-no-one-is-left-behind&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F23%2F22741762%2Ftmobile-delays-shutdown-sprint-3g-network-dish-boost" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that Dish was “dragging their feet in getting their customers upgraded to the superior 4G/5G world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGLj9w"&gt;Dish fired back on Monday; Jeff Blum, the company’s executive VP of external and legislative affairs said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that T-Mobile’s announcement “is a recognition that its premature shutdown of the CDMA network will harm consumers who rely on this network for critical connectivity, including 911.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uAEr4d"&gt;Blum said that the additional time was “not nearly sufficient” to ensure that “over one million Boost customers— many of whom are low-income — projected to still need access to this network beyond March 31, 2022.” Supply chain cellphone shortages and COVID-related interruptions have slowed the upgrades, he added&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZrdWJ"&gt;“Given T-Mobile’s new admission that continuing the operation of its CDMA network will have ‘no material financial impact’ to its business and 5G buildout, we urge the company to live up to its promises to regulators,” Blum said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99YHwf"&gt;The Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618472/doj-letter-dish-t-mobile-3g-cdma-network-shutdown"&gt;Justice told Dish Network and T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; in a July &lt;a href="https://dish.gcs-web.com/static-files/d0097e8d-56b9-486a-bc0a-1190e7141481"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; that it had “grave concerns” about the shutdown of Sprint’s legacy network, and urged both sides to take “all appropriate steps” to reduce the impact on customers who still rely on the network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6gjLQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: October 25th 1:46PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds statement from Dish Network EVP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new Galaxy Books include 11th Gen Intel chips and 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Book open, angled to the left, on a white background.

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Samsung Galaxy Book.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5ooHLD"&gt;Samsung has announced three new additions to its Galaxy Book line: the Galaxy Book, the Galaxy Book Odyssey, and the Galaxy Book Pro 360 5G. While none of the models have features that will knock your socks off, they seem like a natural progression of Samsung’s recent efforts to bring the Galaxy Book line out of the enthusiast space and into the mainstream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5lyrX"&gt;The most accessible offering looks to be the regular 15.6-inch Galaxy Book. This is the only one of the three that’s available now; the other two products hit shelves November 11th. I’m currently seeing a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRAal6y3RF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$749.99 model&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy that includes a Core i5-1165G7, 8GB of memory, and 256GB of storage, as well as a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRAaQhLEQb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Core i7-1165G7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-galaxy-book-15-6-led-touch-screen-intel-core-i7-1165g7-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-mystic-silver%2F6480610.p%3FskuId%3D6480610&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRAaQhLEQb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-galaxy-book-15-6-led-touch-screen-intel-core-i7-1165g7-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-mystic-silver%2F6480610.p%3FskuId%3D6480610&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRAaQhLEQb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;16GB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-galaxy-book-15-6-led-touch-screen-intel-core-i7-1165g7-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-mystic-silver%2F6480610.p%3FskuId%3D6480610&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRAaQhLEQb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;/ 512GB configuration&lt;/a&gt; for $999.99. Those seem like reasonable prices to pay for these specs, assuming that the build, keyboard, screen, and other various features are adequate. Given the high quality we tend to see from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419899/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-15-inch-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Book line&lt;/a&gt; (particularly when it comes to displays), I’m optimistic there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rX2Ec9"&gt;In addition to its price point, the Galaxy Book’s primary calling card seems to be that it’s fairly portable at just 0.61 inches thick (though Samsung hasn’t provided the weight yet). It also has an attractive port selection that includes a nano-SIM and a microSD slot, as well as two USB-C, a USB-A, and an audio jack. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Book Odyssey on a white background facing forward. The screen displays a blue and black pattern." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DQnWE39b1LO06_p953XC0XFQy_w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954270/Galaxy_Book_Odyssey___Front.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Galaxy Book Odyssey. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hX8vea"&gt;Up a few tiers in price is the $1,399 15.6-inch Galaxy Book Odyssey. This is more of a workstation device, configurable with Intel’s H-Series processors as well as Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3050 Ti. At $1,399, it’s certainly a good price for a workstation, though the 3050 Ti is a fairly midrange GPU, and we haven’t been blown away by the results it’s delivered in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22716121/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;more expensive systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6PdT4r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Galaxy Book Odyssey starts at $1,399&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ieQLIF"&gt;Also starting at $1,399 is the 13.3-inch Galaxy Book Pro 360 5G. It’s worth noting that the non-5G version of this device &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRAbbTzAQn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starts at $1,009.99&lt;/a&gt;, so while we haven’t seen the specs of the base 5G model yet, it seems likely you’ll be paying a significant premium for the extra connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwXicW"&gt;That said, the 15-inch Galaxy Book Pro impressed when we reviewed it earlier this year. It has a standout screen (which is par for the course in Samsung devices) and excellent battery life. It also ships with Samsung’s S Pen for drawing and note taking, though there’s not a garage to store it in. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oid8P3NbIK6AMBDa2TmQEXkOKas=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954275/Galaxy_Book_Pro_360_5G___Tab___S_pen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rco3bN"&gt;These all seem refreshingly affordable for their specs, but the Galaxy Book is what I’m most excited about. Its $749 tag is competitive pricing for a line with a history of excellent build quality and gorgeous panels. The ultimate verdict, of course, will depend on how well it ends up performing (and Samsung hasn’t provided the battery size yet). But given how long the Galaxy Book line has been confined to the Samsung-enthusiast space, it’s nice to see it expanding further into the midrange market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkUbRC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cs4WoN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>macOS Monterey is now available to download</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nQb4FgVLtVz8puPS_k0zaFONLHE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70042777/akrales_20210515_4583_0105.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new M1-equipped iMac.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ecyI9B"&gt;The latest version of macOS, Monterey, is now available to download &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/macos-monterey-is-now-available/"&gt;according to Apple&lt;/a&gt;. The software has been available in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;public beta for several months&lt;/a&gt;, but today’s release means Apple thinks the software is ready for everyday use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SrFaF"&gt;As is tradition, Apple announced its latest version of macOS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;at WWDC in June&lt;/a&gt;. New features include the ability to set Macs as an AirPlay target to play content from iPhones and iPads, as well as Shortcuts, Apple’s iOS automation software. There have also been improvements made to FaceTime, as well as a new Quick Note feature. For a full rundown of what’s on the way, check out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;preview from July&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey/features/"&gt;Apple’s own feature list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YQCoeJ"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple_WWDC21_Drag_And_Drop_Demo|102462" data-volume-uuid="d15336f46" data-volume-id="102462" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-925" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s drag-and-drop demo from WWDC 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LVJgp8"&gt;Unfortunately, some of Monterey’s biggest new additions, Universal Control and SharePlay, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733044/macos-universal-control-later-this-fall-monterey-feature-delay"&gt;don’t seem to be available at launch&lt;/a&gt;. Apple notes that both features will be available “&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey/features/#:~:text=available%20later%20this%20fall."&gt;later this fall.&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82u2wM"&gt;Universal Control allows files to be dragged and dropped between several different machines, as Apple’s Craig Federighi demonstrated at WWDC.  It also will let you control multiple Apple devices including Macs, MacBooks, and iPads, with the same mouse and keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpzQJH"&gt;SharePlay will enable shared experiences of music, TV shows, movies, and more while connected over FaceTime. Once it’s available, Apple says you can use the feature with Apple Music, Apple TV+ and unnamed “popular third-party services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXqmr1"&gt;It’s better news when it comes to Safari’s redesign, which by default now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733357/apple-old-safari-tab-design-macos-monterey"&gt;uses a more traditional interface&lt;/a&gt; rather than the &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/10/the_tragedy_of_safari_15_quote_unquote_tabs"&gt;controversial new tab design&lt;/a&gt; introduced at WWDC. Early users complained that, among other things, the changes made it far too difficult to work out which tab was currently active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKBIgF"&gt;The full list of Macs that can run Monterey can be found below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wVQfix"&gt;iMac (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201634"&gt;late 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="macCRY"&gt;iMac Pro (2017 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pe2aXs"&gt;Mac Pro (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT202888"&gt;late 2013 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EwY30f"&gt;Mac Mini (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201894"&gt;late 2014 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="noB5Y1"&gt;MacBook Pro (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201300"&gt;early 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OB4NQq"&gt;MacBook Air (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201862"&gt;early 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="L42eNi"&gt;MacBook (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201608"&gt;early 2016 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Cx8cXp"&gt;For those keeping track, there are a couple of models that got Big Sur last year that have been left out of the Monterey party. These include the 2015 MacBook, the 2013 MacBook Air, the late 2013 MacBook Pro, and the 2014 iMac. Here’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201581"&gt;Apple’s guide&lt;/a&gt; for identifying your specific model, and here’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21287898/apple-macos-updates-automatic-manage-software-catalina-apple-macbook"&gt;ours for updating your machine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7U4sHG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541"&gt;To install Monterey&lt;/a&gt;, go to System Preferences &amp;gt; Software Update (or search “Software Update” in Spotlight). If Monterey shows up as an available install, you can then click the upgrade button to begin the install process. If it doesn’t show up, you may need to check back in later, as it continues to roll out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWiS9p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 25th, 1:25PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information on SharePlay and instructions for how to install Monterey. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This sure looks like Facebook’s rumored Oculus Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bWxD16_eVqdKrdSOQ0Dwdzd_dxU=/25x0:775x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70042808/Oculus_Pro_leaked.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Oculus.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bn0BcR"&gt;Facebook has been teasing work on a pro version of its Oculus Quest headset for quite some time, and now a series of what appear to be setup videos for the unreleased product have leaked from its own servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flF57n"&gt;The videos were first &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/qezcec/this_looks_promising/"&gt;spotted on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend and downloaded from &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2FOculus.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus.com&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and embedded below. They&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;show an unreleased, dark-colored headset being used to customize virtual avatars with what looks like full body tracking, new controllers with a charging dock, and more footage of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22629942/facebook-workrooms-horizon-oculus-vr"&gt;Horizon Workrooms app&lt;/a&gt; for work collaboration in VR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgcOZ8"&gt;Executives from Facebook have teased the possibility of a pro version of the Oculus Quest for a while, and on October 28th, the company is hosting its annual Connect conference where it usually debuts new VR products. Facebook has also been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735612/facebook-change-company-name-metaverse"&gt;planning to rebrand its parent company name&lt;/a&gt; to focus more on building its vision of the metaverse, which could use the richer avatars depicted in these videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CiLE52"&gt;If Facebook does debut this headset at Connect this week, it would be a reverse from when Andrew Bosworth, VP at Facebook’s Reality Labs, said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391456/oculus-quest-3-pro-timeline-facebook-vr"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that there wasn’t going to be a Quest Pro this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suwKu6"&gt;“We do have a lot of things in development where we want to introduce new functionality to the headset along the kinds that people theorize that we would want to introduce, and that’s a little ways off still,” he said in a Twitter Space conversation with Oculus consulting CTO John Carmack in April. “It’s still not gonna happen this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvdthS"&gt;So there’s a chance that this headset isn’t shown at Connect or that it’s called something else when it does debut, though a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/basti564"&gt;YouTuber who goes by Basti564&lt;/a&gt; told me he found direct references in recent Oculus software to an “Oculus Pro.” He added &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/basti564/status/1452412099947270144?s=21"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that, based on where these videos were discovered in the headset’s unreleased firmware, they will play on initial setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdyQud"&gt;A spokesperson for Oculus declined to comment on the leaked videos below when I asked about them on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple releases iOS 15.1 with SharePlay and more iPhone 13 Pro camera options</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uEJLYKONo8IiYe34FuX2ZXR85NI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70042748/cgartenberg_210629_4653_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C7o5Si"&gt;Apple is releasing iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1 today, and the big new feature is SharePlay’s return. SharePlay is a feature that was originally supposed to ship in iOS 15; it lets people call friends or family and watch movies, TV, or listen to music together. SharePlay syncs content so everyone can watch it at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARvL9R"&gt;iOS 15.1 also includes some improvements to the camera options for iPhone 13 Pro models. A new Auto Macro toggle for the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ is available, allowing you to switch off the automatic macro mode if you find it annoying. ProRes video capture is also available in iOS 15.1, so you can capture even better quality video on an iPhone 13 Pro at 30fps / 1080p on 128GB models or 4K on 256GB models and above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAmXnN"&gt;Apple is also enabling iOS 15.1 users to add their COVID vaccine card to the Wallet app, similar to how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22558245/google-pay-covid-vaccination-card-android-digital-pass"&gt;Google’s Android version of this feature works&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a HomePod user, iOS 15.1 adds Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos with Spatial Audio support to the ‌HomePod‌ and the HomePod Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5D6xY"&gt;iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1 are both available now from Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Software Update on compatible devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The original iPod ‘prototype’ was an Apple design to prevent leaks</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xvaKCn"&gt;It’s hard to believe that the prototype for the original iPod is something that you can’t even fit into your pocket. Panic, a software development group for macOS and iOS, &lt;a href="https://panic.com/blog/a-prototype-original-ipod/"&gt;dredged up the prototype for the original iPod&lt;/a&gt; — something that Apple probably never wanted to see again — in honor of the iPod’s 20th anniversary (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/23/panic-shares-first-look-at-extremely-rare-early-ipod-prototype/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gIoxH1"&gt;As funny as it would be if Apple was actually trying to make the iPod look like a failed attempt at a pocket-sized DVD player, that’s (sadly) not the case. A tweet from Tony Fadell, the inventor of the iPod, confirms that the prototype was designed to prevent the real iPod design from getting leaked ahead of its launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9M7rpp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is a P68/Dulcimer iPod prototype we (very quickly) made before the true form factor design was ready. Didn’t want it look like an iPod for confidentiality - the buttons placement, the size - it was mostly air inside - and the wheel worked (poorly) &lt;a href="https://t.co/qeNMHMmVsc"&gt;https://t.co/qeNMHMmVsc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tony Fadell (@tfadell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tfadell/status/1451969239359926276?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HQFoZA"&gt;The yellow, brick-like device is dated September 3rd, 2001, almost two months before the iPod’s actual release date on October 23rd. The prototype is several times larger than the iPod we all know and love and has a scroll wheel in its top-left corner, along with a tiny screen in the top-right. Other clunky navigation buttons line the side of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IhlY6x"&gt;Apple’s mission to conceal its design is also the reason behind the massive amount of space on the inside of the device. The layout of its internals is closer to the size of the official iPod, but Apple just decided to give it a clunky get-up to hide its design secrets, both on the inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IGRNMX"&gt;We’ve seen other Apple prototypes in the past, but nothing looks as silly as this. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/25/14737526/second-generation-ipod-prototype-ebay"&gt;second-generation iPod popped up on eBay&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, and the seller wanted nearly $100,000. Even &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/28/the-story-behind-a-rare-1st-generation-ipod-touch-prototype-that-still-runs-os-x-gallery/"&gt;the iPod Touch prototype&lt;/a&gt; looks close to the finished product. More recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738419/apple-videopad-auction-steve-jobs-bonhams-prototype"&gt;a prototype for the never-released VideoPad 2&lt;/a&gt; popped up and is set to be auctioned off in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4CMd3"&gt;The original iPod prototype, however, is definitely one of a kind. It’s a testament to Apple’s dedication to keeping its design classified, which was especially important for the launch of its very first iPod.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mastercard will allow banks on its payments network to provide cryptocurrency services</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3lwwbb"&gt;Mastercard has signed a deal with cryptocurrency firm Bakkt to make crypto options available to merchants and banks across its payments network, the company &lt;a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/2021/october/mastercard-and-bakkt-partner-to-offer-innovative-crypto-and-loyalty-solutions/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Monday. The news was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/mastercard-says-any-bank-or-merchant-on-its-vast-network-can-soon-offer-crypto-services.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXH5Di"&gt;Banks on Mastercard’s global payments network will be able to provide cryptocurrency rewards on credit and debit cards, for example, and reward points on purchases like airlines or hotels can be paid out in cryptocurrency. Consumers will be able to convert their crypto holdings to pay for purchases and hold digital assets through custodial wallets on Bakkt’s platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGYA6I"&gt;Mastercard &lt;a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2021/why-mastercard-is-bringing-crypto-onto-our-network/"&gt;said earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; it would start allowing its cardholders to conduct some transactions on specific cryptocurrencies on its network, and it said in July it was working with crypto and digital asset startups as part of its effort to make cryptocurrencies more widely used by consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hw7V0i"&gt;The deal with Bakkt, which began publicly trading on the New York Stock Exchange on October 18th, could significantly expand access to and adoption of cryptocurrencies; the company says there are presently more than 2.8 billion active Mastercards and more than 22,000 banks and financial institutions on its network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9llKg"&gt;“Together with Bakkt and grounded by our principled approach to innovation, we’ll not only empower our partners to offer a dynamic mix of digital assets options, but also deliver differentiated and relevant consumer experiences,” Sherri Haymond, executive vice president of digital partnerships at Mastercard, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
