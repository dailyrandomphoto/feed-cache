    <title>Tom Brady’s best throw of the night destroys Microsoft tablet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TyTgnOcUxWut3Ckn3bV8IYgUYts=/47x0:553x337/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70296124/brady_vs_microsoft_surface.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom Brady rage quitting Microsoft Surface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S3Er4z"&gt;After throwing a fourth-quarter interception to seal a 9-0 loss against the Saints on Sunday night, Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady managed to connect with a Microsoft Surface tablet, absolutely destroying it. The defeat was &lt;a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tom-brady-gets-shut-out-for-first-time-in-15-years-vs-saints-keeping-a-drew-brees-nfl-record-safe/"&gt;Brady’s first shutout in 15 years&lt;/a&gt;, according to CBS Sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehReaz"&gt;Brady joins an illustrious group of Surface abusers that include &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/8/9693380/the-packers-are-terrible-aaron-rodgers-surface"&gt;Aaron Rogers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SN_Ohio/status/691374430728130560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;Johnny Manziel&lt;/a&gt;, and former boss Bill “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/18/13320664/bill-belichick-patriots-microsoft-surface-tablet-nfl"&gt;I just can’t take it anymore”&lt;/a&gt; Belichick, to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0kiYq"&gt;Surface tablets have suffered regular abuse since &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/9/7359503/microsoft-surface-nfl-demo-hands-on"&gt;their introduction in the 2014 NFL season&lt;/a&gt; after Microsoft became the official provider of tablet-based video reviews for teams during games, replacing the black-and-white photographs that had been in use for decades. The tablets were frequently called “iPads” in early post-game interviews despite Microsoft paying millions to the NFL for the exclusive advertising and equipment rights. And early &lt;a href="http://www.technobuffalo.com/2016/01/25/microsoft-surface-tablets-blamed-after-nfl-breakdown/"&gt;technical and usability issues&lt;/a&gt; often caused the Surface tablets to become high-speed projectiles in the hands of athletes prone to favoring human growth hormone injections over vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked images show upcoming Garmin Fenix 7 and Venu 2 Plus smartwatches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x2EpxkztTWaPFM_Nm47vceI6sJQ=/0x12:1000x679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70295203/garmin_watches_lineup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Leaked images of the Fenix 7, Venu 2 Plus, Instinct 2, and the Epix Gen2 (pictured from left to right). | Photo by Winfuture&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ABg3IK"&gt;A trove of leaked images shows what Garmin’s upcoming 2022 smartwatch lineup may look like. A report by German technology site &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,127058.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winfuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows the supposed images of the Garmin Fenix 7 series, Venu 2 Plus, Epix Gen2, and Instinct 2 series smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKZCtR"&gt;The post shows that the Fenix 7 series may consist of three models: the standard Fenix 7, 7S, and 7X, all of which are rumored to be made of both reinforced plastic and stainless steel. It may also have a built-in solar panel that charges the device while you’re wearing it, along with some familiar tracking features that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/8/29/20838081/garmin-fenix-6-solar-price-date"&gt;the Fenix 6 originally came with&lt;/a&gt; (and possibly more). It appears that the base model will only come in black, while the Fenix 7S may have an all-white variation, as well as an option that has a rose gold frame with an off-white band. &lt;em&gt;Winfuture&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t provide any additional details on the rumored 7X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Bd4Hta"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Epix Gen2 trades a square watch face for one that’s round and comes with new health tracking features&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hlx7zk"&gt;Also included in the post is the Epix Gen2. Garmin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7486787/garmin-fenix-3-epix-vivoactive-smartwatch-connect-iq-ces-2015"&gt;originally debuted the Epix smartwatch in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, and unlike its predecessor, the leaked images show that the Epix Gen2 trades a square watch face for one that’s round. The Epix Gen2 may also have a built-in GPS, along with features new to the Epix line of watches, including a blood oxygen sensor, heart rate monitor, and sleep tracking capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qMK14"&gt;Images of the Instinct 2 and 2S show that the watches may have retained the same rugged look that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/11/17965748/garmin-instinct-rugged-smartwatch-outdoors-pricing-feautures"&gt;the original Instinct had&lt;/a&gt; when it was first released in 2018. &lt;em&gt;Winfuture&lt;/em&gt; claims the watches use an e-ink display that allows the device to conserve battery life, and also comes with features that track your heart rate, steps, and sleep. The white variation of the base Instinct smartwatch appears to have an integrated solar panel. However, it remains unclear what the differences are between the 2 and 2S, but it’s possible that the 2S is the smaller of the two. The same can be said for the Fenix 7 and 7S, considering that the previously-released Fenix 6S and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/30/15113006/garmin-fenix-5-5s-5x-review-fitness-tracking-multisport-watch"&gt;Fenix 5S models&lt;/a&gt; have smaller displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6O8u0G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Venu 2 Plus seems to have an additional third button that the standard model doesn’t have&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MwO6bk"&gt;Lastly, &lt;em&gt;Winfuture&lt;/em&gt; shows us more of what appears to be the Venu 2 Plus. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1471655765769433089"&gt;Leaked images of this smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; have already been floating around the internet, and the images here only corroborate what the initial leak shows. The device is rumored to have both black and white variations, as well as come with an OLED display. It also seems to have an additional third button that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22524882/garmin-venu-2-fitness-watch-review"&gt;standard Venu 2&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t have, but it’s unclear what it may be for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yswDEZ"&gt;We may not have to wait much longer for Garmin to officially announce the lineup. With CES 2022 just weeks away, Garmin may make the big reveal at the event. For now, you can see all of the leaked images on &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,127058.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winfuture&lt;/em&gt;’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney and YouTube TV cut a deal to bring back ESPN, FX, and other channels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NFL: NOV 16 Vikings at Bears" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xBmjEl778QXZnPOSNn6OOK7vQ3w=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70294739/1229688203.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b1kaPt"&gt;Disney and YouTube TV have reached a deal today to put more than a dozen Disney-owned channels back on Google’s internet TV streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDgJod"&gt;The news follows a previous announcement late Friday that the two had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/18/22836949/disney-youtube-tv-channels-deal"&gt;failed to reach an agreement&lt;/a&gt; before their contract expired, and users were informed they would no longer have access to the channels, which included ESPN, Disney, FX, and other Disney-owned properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYw0eS"&gt;“We are pleased to announce that after a brief disruption, we have reached a new distribution agreement with Google’s YouTube TV for continued carriage of our portfolio of networks,” Disney said in a statement. “We appreciate Google’s collaboration to reach fair terms that are consistent with the market, and we’re thrilled that our robust lineup of live sports and news plus kids, family and general entertainment programming is in the process of being restored to YouTube TV subscribers across the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmTw1a"&gt;With the loss of channels, YouTube TV said it would lower its price by $15 to $49.99 per month. In a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-disney-programming-update/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about the reinstated service, YouTube TV said it would return to its original $64.99-per-month service cost, but that it will “honor a one-time credit for all impacted members.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1vDaH"&gt;“For active members who have not yet received that $15 discount on their monthly bill, you will automatically receive a one-time credit on your next bill with no action needed,” YouTube TV said. “For members who were impacted and have initiated the cancellation process, we would love to welcome you back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ng2o9T"&gt;YouTube TV said that it has started to restore access to the Disney-owned properties on its service, including local ABC stations, which will return “over the course of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC settles with Verizon, AT&amp;T, and others over failed 911 calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zhte_qzeEtWYvLvv25Tl4r2cKPI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70294725/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6UFV1c"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/four-companies-settle-fcc-investigations-compliance-911-rules"&gt;has reached settlements&lt;/a&gt; with AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, Intrado, and CenturyLink (which now goes by Lumen Technologies) over investigations into failed 911 calls that occurred during network outages in 2020. The companies will pay a total of $6 million combined and also agreed to ensure compliance with the FCC’s 911 availability rules going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUOACx"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T will pay $460,000 to settle two different investigations regarding network outages that took place on September 28th, 2020. Both Lumen Technologies and Intrado agreed to resolve investigations into outages that occurred on that same day, with Lumen Technologies paying $3.8 million and Intrado paying $1.7 million. Verizon settled with the FCC over an investigation of an outage that took place on May 7th, 2020, paying $274,000 as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JjexEM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s vital that phone companies prevent these outages wherever possible and provide prompt and sufficient notification to 911 call centers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5TA3d"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, Lumen Technologies, and Intrado weren’t just probed for failed 911 calls. The FCC also reports that it opened an investigation as to whether these companies alerted the affected 911 call centers of the outages in a timely manner. It also investigated AT&amp;amp;T for potentially failing to “deliver number and location information” during the outage, which is in violation of FCC rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKjhfJ"&gt;“Sunny day outages can be especially troubling because they occur when the public and 911 call centers least expect it,” said FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel. “It’s vital that phone companies prevent these outages wherever possible and provide prompt and sufficient notification to 911 call centers when they do occur.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LX28cX"&gt;Just last month, &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-reaches-195m-settlement-t-mobile-911-outage-investigation"&gt;T-Mobile agreed to pay $19.5 million&lt;/a&gt; to settle an investigation into whether T-Mobile violated the FCC’s 911 calling rules during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21292024/t-mobile-verizon-att-calls-failing-down-phone-networks-us-carriers"&gt;the massive nationwide outage&lt;/a&gt; that occurred in June. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok Kitchens will bring viral culinary creations to fans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QLF8kEIrV3imKfWjxaKT9QUj5SQ=/0x480:2991x2474/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70294485/tiktok_kitchens_food_samples.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Virtual Dining Concepts/TikTok&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RT8mTk"&gt;TikTok is partnering with Virtual Dining Concepts (VDC) to launch TikTok Kitchens, a delivery-only service that will cook up some of the trendiest recipes on the app, first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-17/tiktok-viral-food-recipes-like-feta-pasta-available-in-virtual-restaurant-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. TikTok and VDC will reportedly open around 300 locations across the US to start, but plan on expanding to around 1,000 by the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ky3LwD"&gt;TikTok Kitchens will operate out of existing restaurants, including chains owned by VDC co-founder Robert Earl, such as Buca di Beppo and Bertucci’s. It’s essentially a ghost kitchen service, but unlike some companies in this niche, VDC’s kitchens don’t appear to operate out of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807607/go-read-ghost-kitchens-uber-eats-doordash"&gt;satellite, trailer-converted kitchens in parking lots&lt;/a&gt;. As the &lt;a href="https://www.virtualdiningconcepts.com/concepts/tiktok-kitchen/"&gt;VDC’s description of the service&lt;/a&gt; notes, TikTok Kitchens will make use of a restaurant's existing kitchen and employees but will provide the training, food packaging, and TikTok-sourced recipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JyfNXp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The menu will initially feature the viral baked feta pasta, corn ribs, pasta chips, and the smash burger&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2x7qCE"&gt;To keep things fresh, the menu will rotate quarterly, given how fast viral content comes and goes on the platform. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says that the menu will initially feature the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2021/02/11/baked-feta-pasta-recipe-tiktok/"&gt;viral baked feta pasta&lt;/a&gt; — which was apparently the &lt;a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2021/US/"&gt;most-searched recipe on Google&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 — air-fried strips of corn known as &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/2021/8/5/22611324/what-is-the-tik-tok-corn-ribs-trend-momofuku-ssam"&gt;corn ribs&lt;/a&gt;, the crispy, cheese-covered &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2021/07/16/pasta-chips-tiktok/"&gt;pasta chips&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the smash burger. The creators who inspired the recipes on the menu will receive part of the proceeds, as noted by the &lt;a href="https://www.qsrmagazine.com/news/virtual-dining-concepts-launches-tiktok-kitchen-brand"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opLpcU"&gt;“Creators will be receiving credit for dishes within the menu and will be featured prominently throughout [the] promotion,” said TikTok spokesperson Elena Saavedra in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “To be clear, this is a campaign to bring TikTok foods to fans, not a venture into the restaurant business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yufBTX"&gt;VDC has already seen success with &lt;a href="https://mrbeastburger.com/"&gt;MrBeast Burger&lt;/a&gt;, a virtual kitchen that the ultra-popular YouTuber, MrBeast, first launched towards the end of 2020. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;notes that MrBeast sold one million burgers in just three months, and that there are now 1,500 kitchens throughout the US, Canada, and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Zk7cO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some Halo Infinite players have to use Xbox dev kits at first major tournament</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7yEq_HyGpsBCsjFTBTB9eWBI47I=/236x91:2645x1697/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70294069/halo_infinite_tournament_raleigh.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot from Halo Esports via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGmmB1c_RyE" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bmh97L"&gt;Microsoft is apparently having just as much trouble procuring Xbox consoles as everyone else, as some of the players at the first major &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; tournament in Raleigh, North Carolina are forced to play on Xbox Series X development kits (via &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/continued-xbox-shortages-force-microsoft-to-use-dev-kit-1848240181"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Game dev kits consist of hardware that developers use to create games and typically aren’t available to the public, let alone used at official gaming tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LChZ3C"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Heads up open bracket players - you'll be playing this weekend on Series X development consoles. They're functionally identical and will be operating in "Retail" mode so it's the exact same experience, they just look a little different.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why? Global supply chain shortage is real.&lt;/p&gt;— Tashi (@Tashi343i) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tashi343i/status/1471183177620373511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2uTzui"&gt;Tahir Hasandjekic, the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; esports and viewership lead at 343 Industries sent out a tweet before the start of the tournament, warning some players that they’ll have to play on Xbox Series X dev kits instead of the real thing. He notes that the dev kits are “functionally identical and will be operating in ‘Retail’ mode.” Players will still get the “exact same experience” as others playing on the standard console, but the hardware will obviously look a lot different. As for the reason behind the use of dev kits, Hasandjekic bluntly explains that the “global supply chain shortage is real.”&lt;/p&gt;

In September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/12/13/22833362/apple-eddy-cue-xbox-help-twitter-stock-alerts"&gt;Xbox boss Phil Spencer said&lt;/a&gt; that supply chain constraints could last well into next year. It’s gotten so bad that not only is Microsoft struggling to get enough of its own consoles, but even Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services, can’t seem to get his hands on a new Xbox either. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/12/13/22833362/apple-eddy-cue-xbox-help-twitter-stock-alerts"&gt;Cue resorted to following @XboxStockAlerts&lt;/a&gt;, a Twitter account that posts about Xbox console restocks, proving that even having the highest of connections can’t guarantee you access to the console.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AI Dungeon’s creators are launching an experimental AI-powered game platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Medieval Problems, one of Voyage’s games" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/siYbCD-DU0y-4errQcAIHOR9Tag=/0x84:2346x1648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70293888/Latitude___Midieval_Problems.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Latitude&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1sNzY3"&gt;Latitude, the startup behind text game &lt;em&gt;AI Dungeon&lt;/em&gt;, is expanding into a new artificial intelligence-powered game platform called Voyage. The company announced the closed beta on Friday, &lt;a href="https://voyage.latitude.io/"&gt;opening a waitlist&lt;/a&gt; for current &lt;em&gt;AI Dungeon&lt;/em&gt; users. It’s the next step for a company that began with a university hackathon project, but that ultimately hopes to help other people create their own games using trained AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKLdYY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI Dungeon, &lt;/em&gt;which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/12/6/20998993/ai-dungeon-2-choose-your-own-adventure-game-text-nick-walton-gpt-machine-learning"&gt;launched as &lt;em&gt;AI Dungeon 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, is powered by OpenAI’s GPT-2 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential"&gt;GPT-3 text generation algorithms&lt;/a&gt;. To start, you generate some introductory text or write your own adventure setup. Then you can enter any command you want and a &lt;em&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&lt;/em&gt;-style virtual game master will improvise some text describing the outcome. It’s very weird and a lot of fun, but it’s light on traditional game mechanics — more like an interactive fiction engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zuOeDA"&gt;Voyage features more structured games. There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12585648/reigns-smartphone-rpg-iphone-android-tinder"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reigns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-inspired experiment called &lt;em&gt;Medieval Problems&lt;/em&gt;, where you’re the ruler of a kingdom and enter freeform text commands for your advisors, then see the outcome reflected in success ratings. It’s still a lot like &lt;em&gt;AI Dungeon&lt;/em&gt;, but with a clearer framing for what you’re supposed to do and a system for evaluating success — although after playing with the game, that system seems pretty forgiving and more than a bit random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An image from the party game Pixel This" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fv0kAnhvv6rsPMrpZlEqspDCreI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23112781/pixel_this.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;An image from the party game Pixel This&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A2GOlJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixel This&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, is a party game where one person enters a phrase, the AI generates a pixelated picture of it, and that image slowly increases in resolution until another player guesses it. It’s a bit like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820106/ai-art-app-dream-synthetic-media-wombo"&gt;the art app &lt;em&gt;Dream&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; paired with a &lt;em&gt;Pictionary&lt;/em&gt;-style mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5E1cb"&gt;Latitude CEO Nick Walton describes Voyage as a natural evolution for Latitude. For the company, “AI games are kind of restarting at the beginning” — with text adventures reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Colossal Cave Adventure. &lt;/em&gt;“Now we’re moving into 2D images where you’ve got some level of visuals in.” &lt;em&gt;AI Dungeon, &lt;/em&gt;which is included in Voyage, recently &lt;a href="https://latitude.io/blog/ai-dungeon-2d"&gt;added AI-produced pictures&lt;/a&gt; created with the &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2021/12/01/the-incredible-pixray-will-draw-whatever-you-tell-it-to/?sh=38d7b23e237d"&gt;Pixray image generator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFTti5"&gt;The eventual goal is to add game creation tools, not just games, to Voyage. “Our long-term vision is enabling creators to make things that are dynamic and alive in a way that existing experiences aren’t, and also be able to create things that would have taken studios of a hundred people in the past,” says Walton. There’s no precise roadmap, but Latitude plans to spend the first half of next year working on the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k8Xp9L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Latitude hopes to add game creation tools, not just more games&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n11NyM"&gt;Creative tools could help Voyage find a long-term business plan. &lt;em&gt;AI Dungeon&lt;/em&gt; is currently free for a set of features powered by GPT-2 and subscription-based for access to the higher-quality GPT-3 algorithm. Following the Voyage beta, Latitude plans to introduce a subscription for it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UdCZKG"&gt;But Voyage’s new games don’t yet have the versatility or replayability of &lt;em&gt;AI Dungeon — &lt;/em&gt;they’re still clearly the products of a company trying to crack games based on machine learning. “This approach is one of the things that I think is going to be really beneficial in terms of being able to iterate and find out what experiences people enjoy,” Walton says. “With traditional games, you can kind of take existing models and create a game that you’re pretty sure people will enjoy. But this space is so different, and it’s hard to necessarily know.” The question is how much people will want to pay to be part of that process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2VRiz"&gt;As Latitude’s mission expands, it will likely need to exercise caution with OpenAI’s application programming interface (API). The organization approves GPT-3 projects on an individual basis, and projects must adhere to content guidelines intended to prevent misuse. Latitude has struggled with these restrictions in the past, since &lt;em&gt;AI Dungeon&lt;/em&gt; gives users a lot of freedom to shape their own stories — resulting in &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-fueled-dungeon-game-got-much-darker/"&gt;some users creating&lt;/a&gt; disturbing sexual scenarios that alarmed OpenAI. (It’s also dealt with &lt;a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2021/09/ai-dungeon-latitude-data-breach/"&gt;security issues&lt;/a&gt; around user commands.) The startup spent months working on filter systems that accidentally blocked more innocuous fictional content before striking a deal where &lt;a href="https://latitude.io/blog/a-new-story-experience"&gt;some user commands would be sent&lt;/a&gt; to a non-OpenAI algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="5MC0jN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you try and make something super serious with AI ... it’s going to have a hard time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L8yoCb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixel This&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Medieval Problems&lt;/em&gt; are more closed systems with fewer obvious moderation risks, but introducing creative tools risks chipping away at OpenAI’s control of GPT-3, which may pose its own set of issues. Walton says that over time, Latitude hopes to shift more of its games onto other algorithms. “We will have some more structure and systems so that it’s not just directly consuming the [OpenAI] API in the same way. And at the same time, I think most of our models will probably be ones that we host ourselves,” he says. That includes models based on emerging open source projects — which have had trouble competing with OpenAI’s work but have advanced since their early days. “I don’t think that gap will be around that long,” says Walton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rm5pY9"&gt;Lots of games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22807568/procedural-storytelling-video-games-dwarf-fortress-wildermyth-blaseball"&gt;use procedural generation&lt;/a&gt; that remixes developer-created building blocks to create huge quantities of content, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/6/18222203/video-game-ai-future-procedural-generation-deep-learning"&gt;most video game “AI”&lt;/a&gt; is a comparatively simple set of instructions. A company like Latitude&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;by contrast, uses algorithms that are trained to produce text or images fitting a pattern from a data set. (Think of them as super-advanced autocomplete systems.) Right now that can make the resulting experiences highly unpredictable, and their absurdity is often part of their charm — outside gaming, other companies like NovelAI have also harnessed text generation for creative work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="of54DA"&gt;But Latitude is still figuring out how to make systems where players can expect fair and consistent outcomes. Text generation algorithms don’t have any built-in sense of whether an action succeeds or fails, for instance, and systems for making those judgments may not agree with normal human intuition. Image generation algorithms are great for producing weird art, but in a game like &lt;em&gt;Pixel This&lt;/em&gt;, players can’t necessarily predict how recognizable a given picture will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwVmPy"&gt;For now, Latitude’s solution is to lean into the chaos. “If you try and make something super serious with AI where people are going to expect to have a high level of coherence, it’s going to have a hard time, at least until the technology gets better,” Walton says. “But if you kind of embrace that aspect of it and kind of let it be crazier and wacky, then I think you make a fun experience and people get delighted by those surprises.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s new RTX 2050 laptop GPU could potentially power more affordable laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FJiGfWM-MXDmWEC0hUJnstj3Iqc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70292246/acastro_180529_1777_nvidia_0001.0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZfgfsM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fgeforce-rtx-laptop-new-options%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F18%2F22844091%2Fnvidia-rtx-2050-laptop-gpu-chip-shortage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nvidia’s upcoming RTX 2050&lt;/a&gt; laptop GPUs don’t sound “new” at all, considering that the company already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423474/nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-60fps-gaming-laptops-features-specs-performance-price"&gt;released the RTX 3050 and 3050 Ti GPUs&lt;/a&gt; for laptops earlier this year (via &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-introduces-geforce-rtx-2050-mx570-and-m550-laptop-gpus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VideoCardz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). But it’s clear that Nvidia isn’t ready to retire its 20 series GPUs just yet — Nvidia says that the RTX 2050 will be available in laptops starting in the spring of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zRqVjY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The RTX 2050 is based on Ampere GA107 architecture, not Turing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uOLWhB"&gt;The RTX 2050 isn’t just a piece of old hardware brought back from the dead. Unlike other 20 series chips, the RTX 2050 is based on Ampere GA107 architecture, not Turing. Ampere is the same architecture that the RTX 3050 (and all other 30 series cards) is powered by, and packaging it within a 20-series card could potentially offer some of the same ray-tracing improvements at a cheaper price. The RTX 2050 comes with the same 2,048 CUDA cores and 4GB of GDDR6 memory that the RTX 3050 has. However, it offers a 64-bit memory bus when compared to the RTX 3050’s 128-bit, potentially leading to a bit of a downgrade in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Gjvex"&gt;While it’s possible that Nvidia is releasing a GPU that doesn’t belong to the latest and greatest 30 series due to the ongoing chip shortage, the move may also come as a way to provide a middle ground between the RTX 3050 and the RTX 1650. Nvidia might want a mid-range GPU that offers a boost in performance over the RTX 1650, but is still more affordable when compared to devices that carry the RTX 3050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LlgRB9"&gt;In addition to the RTX 2050, Nvidia also announced the entry-level MX550 and MX570 laptop chips, but the company hasn’t provided many details about their specs. Nvidia vaguely mentions “more CUDA Cores” and “faster memory speeds” with no solid numbers to back it up just yet. All this comes about two weeks after Nvidia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812618/nvidia-new-rtx-2060-12gb-vram-graphics-card-gpu-release-date-price"&gt;released a new version of the RTX 2060&lt;/a&gt; —which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/7/18171616/nvidia-rtx-2060-gpu-349-ray-tracing-budget-entry-level-ces-2019"&gt;originally launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; — that offers an upgrade of 12GB of video RAM when compared to the 6GB of VRAM that the standard model comes with.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Appstore update is supposed to fix issues with Android 12</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h6DQ6Li6F-1mU3tdaL-OVAwHcHE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70291801/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wYqMbA"&gt;Amazon has finally rolled out an update for its Appstore, and it’s supposed to fix the issues that have been plaguing Android 12 users for over a month (via &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fixes-android-12-appstore-231954404.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). After users downloaded Android 12, they noticed that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811710/amazon-android-12-appstore-drm-issues"&gt;Amazon Appstore wasn’t functioning correctly&lt;/a&gt;, an issue likely caused by the lack of compatibility between Amazon’s built-in DRM and the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PL45mh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The fix doesn’t seem to solve the problem for everyone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YAvaTO"&gt;In an update on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D56Q000087E2wvSAC/amazon-appstore-not-working-after-android-12-update"&gt;Amazon support forum&lt;/a&gt; where the issue first came to light, an Amazon staff member notes that the technical team has issued an update to address the issue between the Appstore and Android 12. He says that you can download the update from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/get-appstore/android"&gt;Amazon’s website&lt;/a&gt;, and that you should sign out and sign in of the Appstore after installing the update. You’ll then have to update any apps that you’ve downloaded by opening the Amazon Appstore, heading to “My Apps,” and then hitting “Updates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VSWOy0"&gt;However, this fix doesn’t seem to solve the problem for everyone. Some users on the forum say that they are still experiencing issues following the update. While a couple of different users complain that all of their apps still aren’t appearing on the store, another user reports that they’re getting compatibility errors when trying to open a single app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="diLw3e"&gt;“We are contacting customers with steps to update their Appstore experience,” said Amazon spokesperson Troy Edwards in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We are sorry for any disruption this has caused.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uA4bKW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 18th 6:45PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to add a statement from an Amazon spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM starts delivering electric Hummer pickup trucks to customers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pwovvWKUymwYJ2RUb53obNlZlJE=/168x88:1112x717/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70291570/gm_hummer_ev_pickup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jeffrey Sauger for General Motor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rbmOLe"&gt;GM has officially started sending its Hummer EV Edition 1 pickup trucks out of the factory and into the driveways of customers, according to a &lt;a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/dec/1217-electric.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s website. Built on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;Ultium platform&lt;/a&gt;, the Hummer EV Edition 1 model comes with a hefty $110,295 price tag, along with up to 1,000 horsepower, 11,500 lb-ft of torque, and an estimated 329-mile range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBqIcF"&gt;Features unique to the vehicle include “CrabWalk,” a mode that enables the truck to drive diagonally at low speeds by pivoting the rear and front wheels at the same angle. Another feature increases the height of the truck’s suspension by six inches, potentially allowing the truck to clear large rocks or water when off-roading — in the fine print, &lt;a href="https://media.gmc.com/media/us/en/gmc/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/dec/1217-hummer.html"&gt;GM says&lt;/a&gt; that this feature won’t come with 2022 Edition 1 models, but it will be available via a free software update and will come standard in any models produced in 2023 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fjAB4vj24s9FA0UD1mKTuwAXrls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23111405/hummer_ev_rear_gm.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jeffrey Sauger for General Motors&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ff8kLd"&gt;The Hummer EV Edition 1 also has a performance setting that lets you harness the electric propulsion system’s full power, which GM claims can send the vehicle from zero to 60 in about three seconds. It comes with Super Cruise as well, giving you a hands-free driving experience and enabling automatic lane changing on compatible roads. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701086/cadillac-super-cruise-2022-escalade-semiconductor-shortage"&gt;Super Cruise was temporarily discontinued&lt;/a&gt; on the 2022 Cadillac Escalade due to the chip shortage, but it doesn’t appear that the Edition 1 is affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZmLeU"&gt;The Hummer EV Edition 1 model has since been sold out, but there are other trims still available for preorder. The Hummer EV 3X is set to become available in the fall of next year, and will cost $99,995. It will come with an estimated range of over 300 miles and three motors producing 830HP and up to 11,500 lb-ft of torque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8atEq"&gt;Meanwhile, the 625HP Hummer EV 2X will cost $89,995, comes with two motors, and will be available in the spring of 2023. It will last an estimated 300 miles on a single charge, and will produce 7,400 lb-ft of torque. Finally, the cheapest of the bunch — the Hummer EV 2 — also has two motors and produces the same 625HP and 7,400 lb-ft of torque. GM plans to release it for $79,995 in the spring of 2024, with a range of over 250 miles on a full charge.
