    <title>FCC approves $6 billion Verizon-Tracfone acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ib4gJG"&gt;On Monday, the Federal Communications Commission voted to approve Verizon Wireless’ purchase of Tracfone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21435980/verizon-tracfone-acquisition-prepaid-phones-budget"&gt;in a deal worth more than $6 billion&lt;/a&gt;, positioning Verizon to become one of the largest prepaid service providers in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQJqTB"&gt;Tracfone is the largest reseller of wireless devices in the US and maintains over 20 million subscribers with more than 90,000 retail locations. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621905/verizon-tracfone-merger-lifeline-fcc-public-interest"&gt;Verizon’s Tracfone acquisition&lt;/a&gt; combines the largest mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) with the largest wireless provider in the country. When Verizon first proposed the deal last September, the company said that the acquisition would bolster Tracfone’s networks while making low-income wireless services more competitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wN31HY"&gt;“After rigorous review, the Commission found that the transaction, as modified by Verizon’s enforceable commitments, will make Verizon and Tracfone stronger providers of prepaid and Lifeline services,” the FCC said in a Monday press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MItMBV"&gt;It’s unclear which commissioners voted to approve the deal. Currently, there are only two Democrats and two Republicans serving at the agency, meaning at least one Democrat would have been required to approve the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GoxN4U"&gt;As part of its decision to approve the deal, the FCC said that it would be requiring Verizon to make several consumer protection agreements with the agency. First, Verizon promised to continue its participation in the Lifeline subsidy program for at least seven years. The company must also provide “cost-effective” 5G devices and services to Lifeline customers. Verizon must also submit semi-annual reports describing how its compliance meets these restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zJIEE"&gt;Last Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/news-and-updates/all-news/cpuc-requires-consumer-protection-measures-for-verizon-acquisition-of-tracfone"&gt;the California Public Utility Commission&lt;/a&gt; approved the deal, mandating similar restrictions to those imposed by the FCC. However, the California regulators required Verizon’s Tracfone to participate in the Lifeline program for at least 20 years. Customers will also receive free 5G-compatible devices and should not see wireless plan price increases over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em4Fas"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Ysdobu3Dq5hfr7-QRZnyVxadrk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079139/Early_Black_Friday_Deals.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, many retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score a great deal before it sells out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nypGAV"&gt;Latest deal highlights:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YeaHyy"&gt;If you’re a PlayStation gamer, Amazon is offering a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Membership-Digital/dp/B09JTZSB3R/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year membership to PlayStation Plus for just $40&lt;/a&gt; ($20 off). This service grants you access to online multiplayer, exclusive discounts, and complimentary titles each month to add to your PSN account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0CAnqM"&gt;The Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 2 is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NFP7KYJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available in either blue or gray&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon for $80, one of the better prices we’ve seen on the waterproof Bluetooth speaker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7PLK8F"&gt;Amazon’s 11th-gen Kindle Paperwhite Kids is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P52R2PL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $115&lt;/a&gt;, its best price to date. The kid-centric Paperwhite is the same as the 8GB base model, but comes with a cover, a two-year warranty, and a year-long subscription to Amazon Kids Plus, which provides your child access to a trove of kid-friendly books and other content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bEsScB"&gt;A bundle containing the Roomba i3 Plus with a self-emptying base and the Braava Jet m6 mop is on sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3scripyja?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22553352%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fgood-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $585 (regularly $850). You can also pick up the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3sepiNNMQ?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22553352%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fgood-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Roomba i3 Plus with Clean Base&lt;/a&gt; on its own for $399, regularly $599.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="lwMndD"&gt;Right now, Amazon is discounting all sizes of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, the LG C1. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model is on sale for $1,097&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,297, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is selling for $1,297&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $1,797&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, all sport several features gamers will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, and support for HDMI 2.1. Best Buy is offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWewqARCyb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same discounts&lt;/a&gt;, except with 30 days of FuboTV Pro and three months of Apple TV Plus, as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV, a camera accessory that brings wide-angle video chats to your TV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="MqKN84"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="E5gVG7"&gt;Amazon is also discounting various sizes of Samsung’s The Frame, a unique kind of TV that functions both as wall art and an HDR-compatible QLED. Right now, for example, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,498&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $998&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. The TV offers a decor-friendly design while also displaying customizable images when somebody’s in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into a smart 4K TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and a 120Hz refresh rate. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeAej60sy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is matching this deal&lt;/a&gt; as well, and including 30 days of FuboTV Pro as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="jNcvZm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="mExVb6"&gt;This 70-inch LG TV may only feature midrange specs, but Best Buy has brought it down to its lowest price ever. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTimnyrsb7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG NanoCell 75 series TV is down to just $750&lt;/a&gt; for a limited time, a staggering $450 off the list price. The 4K panel is powered by LG’s WebOS smart platform, which offers a solid array of streaming services and includes HDR10 for vivid picture quality. The 75 Series also comes equipped with three HDMI ports and ARC compatibility, as well as Apple’s AirPlay 2, which allows you to cast content from your Apple device to your TV. It may not be as impressive as an OLED TV, but $750 for a 70-inch panel is still a solid value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="YkAdjB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10835005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="wcr0Gl"&gt;Naturally, Amazon is offering some great discounts on its own products, taking between $140 and $150 off the Omni Series (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6F8YBH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;) and 4-Series 4K Fire TVs (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08SVZ775L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QB66R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lDDnQ9"&gt;The best Black Friday deals on streaming devices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="qcHKiS"&gt;The latest Roku Streaming Stick 4K, which just launched in September, is selling at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Froku-streaming-stick-4k-2021-streaming-device-4k-hdr-dolby-vision-with-voice-remote-and-tv-controls%2F-%2FA-52709600%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayTechDeals111921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vrWZYkTQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; at a record low. Normally $50, the retailer is offering the streaming device for just $29. The 2021 model is faster, comes with improved Wi-Fi performance, and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. Roku’s players also now support AirPlay 2, which means you can use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to easily cast content to the device. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="PuNKYt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="xfNVil"&gt;This accessible Roku alternative from Google features support for Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, and the current sale at the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/chromecast_google_tv?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1JKx5U7SD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has brought the Chromecast with Google TV down to $40, saving you $10 off the regular price. The streaming device features access to all of your favorite streaming services and has a built-in voice assistant to help you find your favorite shows. You can even cast media from your phone through the Chromecast app. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="bsLjhK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10872711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ADYgqg"&gt;The best Black Friday deals on laptops and tablets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="c5Ol71"&gt;The Lenovo Yoga 9i remains one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687992/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-pro-8-hp-spectre-macbook-air-creator-laptops-compare-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our favorite alternatives to the Microsoft Surface line of ultrabooks&lt;/a&gt; and, right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThlWBLJhS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is offering the slick 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; for $1,350. While this model received a similar discount a couple of months ago, it still remains a solid value. The foldable laptop boasts some impressive specs, too, with an 11th Gen Core i7 CPU, 512GB of storage, and Iris Xe integrated graphics. This hardware, paired with a 4K touchscreen display and a garaged stylus, makes the 9i a great choice for creators.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="nisc5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10689258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1BiPh2"&gt;HP’s 15.6-inch laptop with Windows Home in S Mode is on sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3sBxrPIx7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $330&lt;/a&gt; instead of $500. This particular model features 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i3 processor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9kKV5j"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Chromebook-Celeron-Processor-Gigabit/dp/B07XL4JHXR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 11.6-inch Galaxy Chromebook 4&lt;/a&gt; is now on sale for $180 instead of $250 at Amazon. This particular model includes 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eNqjUh"&gt;The Dell XPS 15 ultrabook is currently enjoying a solid discount. &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-14349898?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Fxps-15-9510-laptop%2Fsmx15w11p1c6700p%3Fpreview%3Doff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has reduced the price of this particular configuration to $2,199&lt;/a&gt;, taking $396 off the usual price tag. This is the best deal we’ve seen on this laptop so far, with some retailers charging as much as $2,600 for the same configuration. This model boasts some impressive specs with an 11th Gen Core i9 CPU and an RTX 3050 Ti graphics card, not to mention 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Our reviewer, Monica Chin, liked the 16:10 display and snappy keyboard, even though the XPS 15 tended to get a little hot under load. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="G5or8D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10842148"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="vAdouM"&gt;The latest model of the Dell XPS 13 takes what made last year’s model so great and makes it better. During its Black Friday sale, &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-12578053?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops-and-notebooks%2Fxps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fsmx13w11p2c3100p" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has marked down this configuration to $1,369&lt;/a&gt;, taking about $260 off the regular MSRP. While not quite the same configuration, aforementioned reviewer Monica Chin described the Dell XPS 13 as the company’s “best-in-class 13-inch ultraportable laptop.” This particular configuration comes equipped with an Intel Core i7-1195G7, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. While the integrated Iris Xe GPU doesn’t have enough juice for gaming, this lightweight laptop is remarkably versatile and remains a powerful choice in the 13-inch laptop class. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21310825" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="TALLIn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10845789"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="7OxW8A"&gt;If you need a powerful iPad with plenty of storage and a gorgeous display, B&amp;amp;H is selling the Wi-Fi version of the latest &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1636230-REG%2Fapple_mhnh3ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_wifi.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; with 256GB of storage for its lowest price to date. Normally $1,199, the retailer is selling it for $1,099 for a limited time. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25603205.13772/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNDQyMDg0L2lwYWQtcHJvLTIwMjEtcmV2aWV3LWZlYXR1cmVzLXNjcmVlbi1taW5pLWxlZC1tMS1wcm9jZXNzb3I/60ca3952dba83e591470a57aB376c5282" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In Dieter Bohn’s review&lt;/a&gt;, he deemed this model to be the nicest iPad available, even with its strange camera placement. The 2021 iPad Pro is also a speed demon thanks to Apple’s M1 chip and comes with welcome features such as a Mini LED display, Thunderbolt connectivity, Wi-Fi 6 support, and Face ID, which allows you to unlock the device with just a glance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="3zmNuJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848332"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AygW13"&gt;The best Black Friday deals on noise-canceling headphones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="fDTpC7"&gt;Typically $400, Amazon is currently selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best-sounding noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for non-Apple users — the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VW98ZKG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; — in black for $247 or in white for $223. That’s one of the lowest prices Amazon has ever sold them for. As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the comfortable headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound while providing 17 hours of playback per charge. They even come outfitted with a USB-C port and a compact, foldable design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

While this phone doesn’t come packaged with a complimentary pair of earbuds like some other models, you do get a free 11-inch Chromebook. While free is generally a good thing, just note that the model on offer here isn’t exactly premium, as it comes with just 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Electronics-Unlocked-Smartphone-Long-Lasting/dp/B08BX7N9SK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon also has the Note 20 Ultra for $1,100&lt;/a&gt; though without any freebies. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

This is the only model currently on sale that doesn’t net you any extra goodies, but it’s a solid value regardless. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Featuring one of the best cameras available in a midrange smartphone, the 5G-compatible 5A also comes equipped with 128GB of onboard storage, IP67 water resistance, and improved battery life. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li id="E2PYly"&gt;The best discount we’ve seen on the Nest Learning Thermostat is now live at the Google Store, allowing you to &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/nest_learning_thermostat_3rd_gen?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $70 on a single unit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/nest_learning_thermostat_3rd_gen_bundle?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 on a two-pack&lt;/a&gt;, lowering the prices to $180 and $350, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="fos0TC"&gt;Eero Pro 6 is offering up to 40 percent off its excellent mesh Wi-Fi routers that have Thread radios built-in (and which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22741839/eero-ceo-confirms-matter-support-thread" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eero has said will get upgraded to the new smart home standard Matter&lt;/a&gt;, when it arrives next year).

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MlgV5J"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; for Xbox — which is compatible with Xbox One, Series S, or Series X — is on sale &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mass-Effect-Legendary-Xbox-Digital/dp/B08ZFDL2RK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $28 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, the best price we’ve seen on the optimized, three-game collection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wgOaew"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild &lt;/em&gt;is &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild%2F141686.html%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to $27 at GameStop&lt;/a&gt; right now, an all-time low for the phenomenal Nintendo Switch exclusive. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="49W4Z1"&gt;A three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is $25 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1204229/2092?subId1=Verge%252CBestEarlyBlackFridayDeals112221&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-xbox-one-digital%2F-%2FA-76626995" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgift-cards%2Fdigital-subscriptions%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-game-pass-3-month-ultimate-membership%2F11095751.html%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, granting you access to online multiplayer, exclusive discounts, and a robust library of Xbox games at a fraction of what the subscription normally retails for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TImMO9"&gt;Probably the best deal in gaming — one that spans video games and tabletop games — is Target’s &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestEarlyBlackFridayDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fbuy-2-get-1-free-mix-match%2F-%2FN-93tfb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mix and Match sale&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to buy two items from an approved list and get a third for free. The list of items the sale covers is robust, and includes everything from board games, to craft supplies, to some of the latest video games. If you can think of a faster way to fill your stockings this holiday, we’d like to hear it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="4ie8in"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860156"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li id="YI7fLA"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, an excellent exclusive for the PS5 and PC, is &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fdeathloop---playstation-5%2F11112058.html%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to just $25 at GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, its best price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pbANF8"&gt;If you’re looking for a solid gaming mouse, the latest iteration of the Razer Viper is on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Viper-Ultralight-Ambidextrous-Gaming/dp/B08QVM2JMQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$40 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3sF0uNz2W" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$38 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The latest model retains the same lightweight and ambidextrous chassis that made the original so good, but ups the ante with a 20K DPI sensor and a polling rate of 8000Hz. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="LClDhH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10859951"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wolverine-Gaming-Controller-Wireless-Headset-Bundle/dp/B08NGCT6B1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer’s Wolverine V2 wired gaming controller&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially an affordable version of the Xbox Elite controller, is on sale at Amazon as part of a bundle with a Kaira Pro gaming headset. Normally $250, you can pick up both peripherals for $170 for a limited time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bE0eBv"&gt;The best Black Friday deals on cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="OnH62Q"&gt;The older GoPro Hero8 Black often retails for $300 on its own, but &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoPro-HERO8-Black-Dual-Battery-Charger-Bonus-Battery%2F199369934&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is offering a bundle that includes the popular 4K action cam for just $249&lt;/a&gt;. Other retailers offer &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3ssYV7eRw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the camera alone for $250&lt;/a&gt;, so this bundle is the better value. It includes a dual battery charger and a total of three batteries, so you’ll never run out of juice. This rugged digital camera is perfectly suited for capturing fast-moving action wherever and whenever it happens. The HyperSmooth technology provides an amazing level of image stabilization, while the LiveBurst feature automatically records anything that happens two seconds before and two seconds after your shot. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20891984/gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera-image-stabilization-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="6WQkzQ"&gt;The latest GoPro, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1658382-REG%2Fgopro_chdhx_101_hero10_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro Hero10 Black&lt;/a&gt;, is currently selling at its lowest price ever. Normally $500, B&amp;amp;H is now selling the popular action cam for $450. The Hero10 Black boasts all the amazing features found on its predecessor — which we once called the “biggest, baddest action camera out there” — and more, like a new processor that allows it to shoot in higher frame rates and upload videos to the cloud while charging. It’s also compatible with Hero9 accessories, meaning those looking to upgrade won’t necessarily need to purchase new add-ons. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The bundle includes the 20MP, 4K-capable camera as well as a wireless shooting grip and a 64GB memory card.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="dfpgis"&gt;A great companion to any streamer or podcaster, the Blue Yeti microphone is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $100&lt;/a&gt;, matching one of its best prices to date.

The mic comes packaged with its own stand but is also compatible with a wide variety of booms and mic arms if that's more your style. The current discount applies to the black, blue, grey, and silver models, meaning you’ve got a variety of styles to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="DOJQiS"&gt;If you’re looking to add some storage space to your PC, Amazon is currently discounting Western Digital’s 2TB and 4TB My Passport models in a variety of colors. Typically $380, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Drive-WDBAGF0020BGY-WESN/dp/B08F1VVBL9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2TB SSD&lt;/a&gt; for $230, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Compatible-systems/dp/B08RX3TWJZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;4TB model&lt;/a&gt; for $550. Western Digital claims up to sequential read / write speeds of 1,050MB/s and 1,000MB/s, respectively, and the deal also includes a USB Type-A adapter in the box.&lt;/p&gt;

These include some of the heavy-hitters of the podcast world, like the broadcast-quality SM7B and its newer offspring: the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B08G7RG9ML?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MV7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B09BZZCGC8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MV7X&lt;/a&gt;. All three mics are discounted, with, for example, the Shure SM7B going for $359 instead of $399 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-SM7B-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B0002E4Z8M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p id="LIGPO3"&gt;Amazon and EA will be &lt;a href="https://primegaming.blog/tis-the-season-for-even-more-new-free-games-and-in-game-content-for-prime-gaming-members-9fd509131336"&gt;giving away free PC games&lt;/a&gt; and content through Amazon’s Prime Gaming program for the next few months, so it may be time to &lt;a href="http://gaming.amazon.com/"&gt;check in on the gaming service&lt;/a&gt; if you’ve forgotten that it comes included with Prime. This month, Prime subscribers will be able to get a free Origin code for the surprisingly decent remaster of 2010’s &lt;em&gt;Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit,&lt;/em&gt; and Amazon says that four more of EA’s “most popular titles” will be coming in 2022 (though given the starting game, it may be worth keeping your expectations in check).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aCQrd"&gt;If it’s still November when you’re reading this, you &lt;a href="https://primegaming.blog/spend-the-holiday-season-gaming-with-family-and-friends-with-new-free-games-and-content-from-prime-b180be31c66e"&gt;can also snag&lt;/a&gt; EA’s &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age Inquisition&lt;/em&gt; for free from Prime Gaming. Amazon’s partnership with EA also includes skins for games like &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;, as well as some additional content for EA Sports games that’ll be “rolling out over the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="jnGOwK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;EA games aren’t the only ones on offer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ldhwr5"&gt;As usual, you’ll also be able to get a number of other free games with Prime Gaming as well. The games available in December probably won’t blow your mind but should be good romps for any holiday vacations you have coming up; there’s &lt;em&gt;Frostpunk&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Journey to the Savage Planet&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Football Manager 2021&lt;/em&gt;, and TellTale’s take on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F9ahZQ7oP0"&gt;beloved &lt;em&gt;Monkey Island&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tales of Monkey Island&lt;/em&gt;. Also included are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Yrj10r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morkredd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RsbI49"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spellcaster University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RIQ7I2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTubers Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="A8e2cn"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse (&lt;/em&gt;what a name)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lDVaOs"&gt;Amazon hasn’t said what EA games will be coming next, but it’s probably worth keeping an eye on. As maligned as the publisher can be (oftentimes for good reasons), it does have some solid titles, and it’d be hard to complain about getting them for free. Personally, I’m crossing my fingers that the collection of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjZQZgeSMx8"&gt;remastered &lt;em&gt;Command &amp;amp; Conquer&lt;/em&gt; games&lt;/a&gt; will be one of the upcoming free titles so I can get a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w-FQoNrwHM"&gt;sweet, sweet hit of nostalgia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart is now delivering diapers and food by drone (if you live close to this Arkansas store)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/luRuvEdVAFC1WHfSaEWluenmmfk=/0x2:3000x2002/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70179775/DroneUp_Hub_Flight_Engineers.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WWXWAd"&gt;Just last week, Walmart made headlines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22786919/walmart-zipline-drone-delivery-commercial-service-arkansas"&gt;by launching its first commercial US drone delivery service&lt;/a&gt; within a 50-mile radius of Pea Ridge, Arkansas — dropping parachute-laden packages from an autonomous Zipline plane to a “hand-selected group of recipients.” Now, it’s already expanding those drone deliveries in another, small way: customers who live in Farmington, Arkansas, &lt;a href="https://droneupdelivery.com/"&gt;can now order small items&lt;/a&gt; like cans of tuna, baby supplies, and paper plates starting today. That’s &lt;a href="https://www.droneup.com/2021/11/22/walmart-droneup-announce-first-multi-site-drone-delivery-operation/"&gt;thanks to a partnership with DroneUp&lt;/a&gt;, which will also provide drone delivery stations in Rogers, AR and Bentonville, AR “in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emZW8R"&gt;While it’s kind of exciting for drone delivery watchers, you should know that it’s also very much baby steps. DroneUp’s traditional quadcopters only deliver within a one-mile radius of a Walmart store — and all three of these stores are within the same region that Zipline already announced it would serve. They do, however, lower their packages down on cables rather than dropping them from the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KtkujpGs1sEJfgiIgw2_IdWaU6U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23035478/farmington_ar_drone_radius_walmart_droneup.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image via Google Maps and &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.mapdevelopers.com/draw-circle-tool.php" target="_blank"&gt;MapDevelopers.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Here’s what a 1-mile radius around &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Walmart+Neighborhood+Market/@36.0372031,-94.2595164,1636m/data=!3m2!1e3!5s0x87c970403386bb8d:0xb886ea455159ec68!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x665cc8ece83138d8!2sWalmart+Neighborhood+Market!8m2!3d36.0369101!4d-94.2564392!3m4!1s0x0:0x665cc8ece83138d8!8m2!3d36.0369101!4d-94.2564392" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;the Farmington Walmart store&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; looks like.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ng8lF9bdJiqcNZym33RAmg4iaLU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23035477/arkansas_missouri_walmart_center.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A zoomed out look at Walmart’s drone delivery footprint. Smaller circles are DroneUp 1-mile radii.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RtsEcK"&gt;Walmart did seem to have quite the selection of essentials to offer when we typed in a local address. We spotted a 26-count pack of diapers, a box of buttermilk pancake mix, paper plates, crayons, trash bags, vitamins, scotch tape, and page after page of basic food items and baby items (including baby food). Every item has a weight, and the website will only let you check out with 4 pounds of goods or less for a $10 delivery fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpLGrA"&gt;The heaviest thing we saw was a 3.87-pound box of Similac baby formula, and the priciest was a $29.88 bottle of extra virgin olive oil. 1.5 pounds worth of canned tuna, a 2.4-pound bottle of Pedialyte and a 3.58-pound box of mixed fruit cups are also within reach if you live in the (tiny) region that Walmart and DroneUp now serve. DroneUp says customers can get orders as quickly as 30 minutes (but isn’t promising a typical delivery time) and says each hub can launch multiple flights per hour. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UsSbrYaa50OXkEoa4iY-7LFd0RU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23035483/droneup_shopping_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vBpAw1"&gt;(Weirdly, you can’t sort Walmart’s items by weight to make selections easier, and the shopping cart doesn’t seem to be smart enough to restrict you by volume: I added 27 lightweight cups of ramen to my cart without triggering a flag at all, and I’m pretty sure they won’t all fit in that drone.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ti67Hu"&gt;Walmart and DroneUp &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/09/22/walmart-now-piloting-drone-delivery-of-covid-19-at-home-self-collection-kits"&gt;previously trialed COVID-19 test drone deliveries&lt;/a&gt; in a one-mile radius of stores in North Las Vegas and Cheektowaga, New York, and Walmart made &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/06/17/walmart-invests-in-droneup-the-nationwide-on-demand-drone-delivery-provider"&gt;an undisclosed investment in DroneUp&lt;/a&gt; this summer. DroneUp still isn’t saying what Walmart invested or how much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvVTXF"&gt;Here’s a video from DroneUp about what the deliveries might look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BZZroz"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Walmart expands drone deliveries with DroneUp|104963" data-volume-uuid="1a031a246" data-volume-id="104963" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-970" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Dodge will phase out gas-powered Charger and Challenger in 2024 to make way for EVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dodge Charger Logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/syz4-pCiT2Z18CvMUp8dzzATUTw=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70179761/1291299299.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P7DEpG"&gt;Dodge will cease production of its gas-powered Charger sedan and Challenger coupe in 2024 in order to make way for the automaker’s first electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2uBWkV"&gt;Dodge Brand CEO Tim Kuniskis shed some new light on the timeline in an interview this week &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/dodge-challenger-charger-dead-2024-ev-coming-soon"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;Motor Trend&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company will roll out its first electric muscle concept car in 2022, followed by a plug-in hybrid vehicle and a mysterious third vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SS2Roh"&gt;Dodge had previously announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568272/dodge-electric-muscle-car-2024-stellantis-ev-day"&gt;intention to produce its first EV in 2024&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568625/stellantis-jeep-dodge-ev-day-shark-drone-autonomous"&gt;July event covering electric vehicle strategy&lt;/a&gt; by the automaker’s parent company, Stellantis. During the event, Kuniskis proclaimed that Dodge would not “sell electric cars — it will sell eMuscle,” which is apparently Dodge branding for its future EVs. The first eMuscle cars will go into production in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OteG50"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dodge had previously announced its intention to produce its first EV in 2024 &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0pWsap"&gt;At the time, Kuniskis didn’t reveal the fate of the company’s internal combustion engine vehicles. Now we know that they will be phased out as the company shifts resources over to EV production. “These cars that you know today will go out of production by the time we get to 2024,” Kuniskis told &lt;em&gt;Motor Trend&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgplL5"&gt;Dodge’s future EVs will sport the Fratzog logo that was initially used by the company in the 1960s and 70s. It features a split deltoid made of three arrowhead shapes that form a three-pointed star. The new version is designed to be three-dimensional and includes LED lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFJkFM"&gt;In addition to electric versions of Charger and Challenger vehicles, Dodge also plans on producing electric trucks, including a battery-powered Ram 1500 that would compete with Ford’s upcoming F-150 Lightning. Dodge’s sister companies, like Jeep, Chrysler, and brands from the PSA Groupe, are also producing EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="up8DNf"&gt;It remains unclear how muscle car fans will react to the news that their beloved Hemi engines aren’t long for this world. EVs are no slouches when it comes to acceleration, with many electric sports cars boasting of quicker 0–60 times than most gas equivalents. Where they do differentiate, though, is the sound — or rather the absence of sound — as they accelerate. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals on Microsoft products</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft is currently offering savings across the Surface lineup.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kPOyoQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fb%2Fblack-friday%3Ficid%3Dgm_nav_L0_BF22" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft has kicked off its Black Friday sales&lt;/a&gt; offering some solid discounts on its line of Surface laptops and related accessories, with some models being discounted by as much as $600. Many of these models are also available as a bundle deal that allows you to get discounts on services like Microsoft 365 and accessories like the Surface Headphones 2 and the Surface Pen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Sqe8M"&gt;While some of these extras only receive a discount if you purchase them as part of a bundle, we’ve included a few of the accessories you can buy individually that are currently marked down. And if you’re looking for more sweet deals this week, make sure to check out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday hub&lt;/a&gt; in addition to our roundup of the best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vDMQ5I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals on Amazon devices ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22789253/black-friday-2021-amazon-echo-speaker-device-cyber-monday"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals on Apple devices","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22787892/apple-black-friday-2021-deals-macbook-ipad-airpods-cyber-monday"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals on Google devices","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22788031/google-black-friday-2021-deals-cyber-monday"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7BKCfB"&gt;The top-tier model of the Microsoft Surface Laptop Go is currently on sale for $700, knocking $200 off the standard price tag. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21512680/microsoft-surface-laptop-go-review-price-specs-features"&gt;In our initial review&lt;/a&gt;, Monica Chin found the original $900 price tag a little steep. However, this deal makes the original iteration of this laptop a little more palatable. This compact laptop comes equipped with an Intel Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of built-in storage. While this is by far the best price we’ve seen for this laptop, we wouldn’t recommend paying more for this particular configuration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tm1Wim"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nbgCQj"&gt;The slightly improved sequel to the original Laptop Go, the Surface Go 2, is also getting a solid discount, with most configurations receiving a $150 discount on their regular price. The highest-end model features an Intel Core M3, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage and is down to $580, making it the lowest price we’ve seen for this laptop. According to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21259805/microsoft-surface-go-2-review-windows-tablet-speed-intel-processor-price"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, the Surface Go 2 improved on the original but just barely. Just like the previous model, the price made the specs on this laptop a bit of a tough sell. However, with this deal, it’s a little easier to recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TY6YOD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730365"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pO2Ikd"&gt;This model of the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Pro-7%2F8n17j0m5zzqs%3Fcrosssellid%3D%26selectedColor%3D86888a" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Laptop Pro 7 has been discounted by $400&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the total price down to just $800. This configuration normally goes for over $1,000, making this one of the better prices we’ve ever seen for this particular model. This configuration features an Intel Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage space. Microsoft is also offering an excellent deal on a more powerful model that includes a Core i7 CPU and double the RAM and storage space for $1,300, taking $600 off the regular MSRP. This is also an excellent deal, but if you just need more storage, it would be more cost-effective to invest in a MicroSD card. Neither of these models comes packaged with a Typer Cover or Surface Pen, but Microsoft is also offering discounts on these accessories, whether you’re purchasing them alone or part of a bundle.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923662/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-tablet-specs-features-price-usb-c-windows-10"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OfCUMX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9624587"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d0IIgF"&gt;A rock-solid entry in the Surface lineup of laptops, the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fbuild%2FSurface-Pro-7-and-Surface-Pro-Type-Cover-Bundle%2F8s6t3hp3ct18%3Fcid%3D%26preview%3D%26previewModes%3D%26icid%3Dstore_SurfaceDeals_R1_CP1_Pro7Plus_72335_BF22_111821-AEM" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Pro 7 Plus is currently available at a solid discount&lt;/a&gt;, but only if you purchase one as part of a bundle. The two models being offered both include 8GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD but use different processors. The lower-end version uses an Intel Core i3 CPU and costs $650, while the Core i5 version runs $750. Regardless of which version you go with, this $250 discount is the best price you can currently get for this laptop, especially when you throw the Surface Pro Type Cover into the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8IulI1"&gt;The Cover is the only required part of this bundle, which is normally available for $130 but is down to $50 as part of this bundle. You can also save on other accessories, like the Surface Pen and services like Microsoft 365, but these are entirely optional. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309005/microsoft-surface-pro-7-plus-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xSG7wP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880529"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z38Z15"&gt;While Microsoft hasn’t discounted the Surface Pro 8, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fbuild%2FSurface-Pro-8-Essentials-Bundle%2F8qh8v48n82m0%3Fcid%3D%26preview%3D%26previewModes%3D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it is currently offering its accessories at a discount&lt;/a&gt; if you purchase everything as part of a bundle. Some of the highlights include $56 off a Surface Pro Signature Keyboard with the Slim Pen 2 and a pair of Surface Headphones 2 for $200, a cool $50 off their regular MSRP. However, unlike the 7 Plus bundle being offered, you’re obligated to add both a Microsoft 365 subscription and a Microsoft protection plan to your purchase. These mandatory add-ons will tack on at least $190 to your purchase. If you’re in the market for these extra goodies, this is a great way to save on the accessories, but otherwise, we’d recommend going with the 7 Plus bundle being offered instead.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="VFs9UP"&gt;The best price we’ve seen yet for the Surface Laptop 4, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Laptop-4%2F946627fb12t1%3Fcrosssellid%3D%26selectedColor%3D9A9CA3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;all models of this 15-inch laptop are currently discounted by $150&lt;/a&gt;. The specific model used by Monica Chin in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22392778/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt; is down to just $1,550. She noted what a massive improvement this model was over the Surface Laptop 3 and particularly how the addition of an AMD CPU positively impacted the overall performance. This model uses a Ryzen 7 CPU paired with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, but there are options available with up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pkl0rw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10832863"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g3HZ0M"&gt;This curvy ergonomic mouse is currently available at a solid discount, bringing the regular price of $100 down to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fmicrosoft-precision-mouse%2F8r2x2zwv803p%3Fcid%3Dmsft_web_collection%26activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$77 in black&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-precision-mouse%2F8qc5p0d8ddjt%3Ficid%3DMicrosoftPrecisionMousePDP_BuyBox_SurfacePrecisionMousePDP_9Mar2021_en-sg%26activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$80 in white&lt;/a&gt;. This rechargeable mouse can last up to three months on a single charge and is all business. The mouse can pair with your device via Bluetooth or using the included 2.4Ghz wireless dongle. There are six programmable buttons, and much like Logitech’s Master series of ergonomic mice, the Precision Mouse features a scroll wheel that can either move in steps or be released to freewheel through large pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GdBoAb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880274"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e8jWCo"&gt;This bundle, now available at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Ergonomic-Wireless-Desktop-Keyboard/dp/B00CYX54C0/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUybZYyYRs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, takes $50 off the regular price of this amazing ergonomic package. For just $80, you get the futuristic-looking split layout Sculpt keyboard, an ergonomic mouse, and a stand-alone Numpad. If you purchase at Best Buy, you’ll even get a free three-month subscription to Microsoft 365 to sweeten the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart’s PS5 and Xbox Series X restock is now live for Plus subscribers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mKdeJ0t8u60hUjSNqb0Apa86cyo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177981/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dEMy8h"&gt;Walmart kicked off its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; deals with a bang, granting Walmart Plus subscribers early access to a big console restock. Paid members can now have a go at snagging a PlayStation 5 (both the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420%3Fathbdg%3DL2000&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeRestock11222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 disc-based version&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383%3Fathbdg%3DL2000&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeRestock11222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99 digital version&lt;/a&gt; are available) or the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X-Video-Game-Console-Black%2F443574645%3Fathbdg%3DL2000&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeRestock11222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 Xbox Series X console&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XO4jB0"&gt;To get this early access to boost your chances of getting a console (though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"&gt;it’s no guarantee&lt;/a&gt;), you’ll &lt;strong&gt;need &lt;/strong&gt;to be a paying member to Walmart Plus, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeRestock11222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $12.99 per month&lt;/a&gt;. To reiterate, members sampling the free trial will &lt;strong&gt;not &lt;/strong&gt;get early access to this restock or Walmart’s myriad Black Friday deals that launch an hour earlier at 3PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsbI8F"&gt;Here are the links, with more details about this restock beneath them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RmbPiW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="iySGYk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="wSPUIp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0HaYm3"&gt;Hey, if you miss out on a chance to get the Series X, it might save your case during the holidays that the smaller, less-powerful Series S is more readily available and costs less at $299.99. It lacks a disc drive and has half the storage of the Series X (512GB), but it has many of the same features as the high-end console. It targets 1440p resolution for some content, and it can boost certain games up to 120 frames per second, but it could be a great fit for someone who still uses a 1080p TV or monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KCGmrH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D0S9oG"&gt;If you say nay to Walmart Plus, the restock will open up to everyone else three hours later at 7PM ET / 4PM PT, though it’s tough to determine how much stock Walmart will have left. Personally, I can’t see the retailer leaving non-subscribers totally high and dry. And with the restock being printed in its Black Friday ad, I expect Walmart to have a surplus of inventory. That said, what’s available will still sell out very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rnSVO"&gt;As for what to expect when the time comes, a Walmart spokesperson shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it will “roll out consoles and other hot items in separate windows to help unlock a smooth online shopping experience.” Hopefully, that means the site will be stable during the restock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="matiwg"&gt;In case you don’t know the drill at this point, make sure you’re logged in to your Walmart Plus account, with the correct payment method and shipping address entered in ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2Wbaw3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="f58M3f"&gt;Add these to your cart before the restock&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zbYawB"&gt;What’s a console without extra games, controllers, or accessories? One that isn’t nearly as fun to use as it should be. Load these items into your Walmart cart ahead of time, so you can get it all at once when the consoles drop. Though, in some cases, you can find better deals at other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s6X9RR"&gt;For PS5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="QgIEC5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="HoSimS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10759091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ncUxi6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10876171"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3WHzie"&gt;For Xbox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="3jLbi8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420028"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>GM backs electric boat startup in $150 million deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V2Dhh4jhiLsmuEFN0XoClMEgex4=/409x0:2092x1122/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70179572/Pure_Watercraft_Electric_Outboard_Motor.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Pure Watercraft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VkjA72"&gt;General Motors has taken a 25 percent stake in Pure Watercraft, a Seattle-based startup that makes electric outboard motors and batteries for boats, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/22/gm-takes-a-stake-in-electric-boating-start-up-pure-watercraft.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;amp;par=sharebar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbG4Qg"&gt;The deal is worth $150 million, though that’s split between cash and payment-in-kind contributions from GM. The two companies didn’t tell &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; what that split will look like, but GM “will become a supplier of components to Pure Watercraft, a co-developer of new products, and will provide engineering, design and manufacturing expertise to help [Pure Watercraft] establish new factories,” according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FGWTL"&gt;GM struck a similar deal — though half the size — with Lordstown Motors in 2020 as part of that electric pickup truck startup’s merger with a special purpose acquisition company. (A good chunk of the value attributed to the deal was the factory GM sold to Lordstown Motors, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775168/foxconn-lordstown-motors-electric-vehicle-factory-trump-ohio"&gt;now being bought by Foxconn&lt;/a&gt; as part of the Taiwanese electronics giant’s push into EVs.) The automaker also once had a deal in place to receive $2 billion of stock in hydrogen-electric trucking startup Nikola in exchange for access to parts, components, and some manufacturing. But that deal fell apart after &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/barra-gm-conducted-appropriate-diligence-on-2-billion-nikola-deal.html"&gt;Nikola was accused of fraud in September 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XpGHa"&gt;GM has made far less rocky bets outside of the EV space. It bought &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/11/11195808/gm-cruise-automation-self-driving-acquisition"&gt;self-driving startup Cruise in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and backed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325241/gm-electric-vehicle-battery-range-cost-solid-energy"&gt;an MIT spinoff focused on batteries in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; points out, CEO Mary Barra telegraphed that the company was looking into watercraft in &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/were-transforming-more-than-auto-industry-mary-barra/"&gt;an October blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="gqa1r7"&gt;We are delivering hardware platforms that will help put everybody in an electric vehicle – even beyond our own vehicles. Our Ultium battery platform and HYDROTEC fuel cell platform give us the potential to make planes, trains, automobiles and even boats into zero emission products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mqVysG"&gt;Pure Watercraft is one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22598790/arc-one-electric-boat-photos-interview"&gt;a number of startups trying to electrify boating&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s one that’s been chipping away at the idea for 10 years. It sells outboard motors and water-tight battery packs, and also collaborates with a number of boat makers to sell ready-to-go electric boats in different shapes and sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hitman 3 VR is coming to PC in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IJeXGrl_4_jdgiP7v8G6L0vyk-c=/524x0:2321x1198/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70179422/hitman_3_vr.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6Y3Bqjz_AY" target="_blank"&gt;IO Interactive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DQ3yv4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hitman 3 VR&lt;/em&gt; will become available on PC next year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-3-year-2/"&gt;an announcement by game developer IO Interactive&lt;/a&gt;, which outlines the roadmap of content that players can expect in &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt;’s second year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AI3uF4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're excited to announce that HITMAN 3 - Year 2 starts on 20 January 2022.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prepare for new maps, new storylines, new modes and new ways to play. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ALtABxoaqx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ALtABxoaqx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— HITMAN 3 (@Hitman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hitman/status/1462858421808635906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U3KSBG"&gt;One of the most significant updates is VR support for PC, as the VR version of the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218554/hitman-3-trailer-virtual-reality-vr-psvr-ps4-ps5-trailer"&gt;was exclusive to PlayStation VR&lt;/a&gt; when it first came out. The &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/r6Y3Bqjz_AY"&gt;accompanying “Year 2” video&lt;/a&gt; briefly shows &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3 VR&lt;/em&gt; played with both an Oculus Rift S and Valve Index. The experience already looks more immersive than the PSVR version, which only supports the DualShock 4 gamepad and its limited motion controls — this means you can’t even use the more intuitive Move controllers with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RiIa0Z"&gt;Aside from &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3 VR&lt;/em&gt; arriving on PC, IO Interactive also announced that the game has officially hit 50 million players, making it the most popular &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt; game in the series. In addition, IO Interactive is adding a series of new maps, storylines, and modes next year, along with the permanent addition of Elusive Target Arcade mode and support for ray-tracing on PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tlzmv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hitman 3 VR&lt;/em&gt; is coming to PC in January 2022, but details still remain sparse. IO Interactive notes that it will provide more information about the game’s supported platforms and technical specifications before the start of Year 2 on January 20th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oura Ring Generation 3 review: a relationship for the long term</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Oura’s adding ambitious new features, but you’ll have to wait to use them&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="D7uaac"&gt;Last year, it seemed like the Oura Ring was everywhere. Researchers were studying whether the smart ring (and other wearables) could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21191225/coronavirus-smart-ring-oura-ucsf-san-francisco-general-hospital-tempredict"&gt;one day detect illness&lt;/a&gt;, and right on cue, the NBA announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21345583/nba-smart-oura-ring-health-plan-wearable-covid-prediction-nfl"&gt;it bought 2,000 Oura Rings&lt;/a&gt; to monitor athletes. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/prince-harry-s-ring-sparks-interest-new-sleep-tracker-n921696"&gt;Prince Harry&lt;/a&gt; has been a fan for years, and celebrities like &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/jennifer-aniston-jimmy-kimmel-oura-ring-toss-salad-morning-show-video/"&gt;Jennifer Aniston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/gwyneth-paltrow-and-kim-kardashian-are-in-a-tense-competition-over-who-gets-more-sleep/"&gt;Kim Kardashian West&lt;/a&gt; have also been spotted wearing the sleep tracker. That’s already a lot of buzz for a niche gadget, but the third-generation Oura Ring also adds ambitious new features like period prediction and blood oxygen. The question is whether it’s worth committing to a $299 smart ring that now requires a monthly subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iePten"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10872844"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9CNHwy"&gt;For a ring with such fashionable devotees, it’s quite plain. My gold review unit isn’t too far off from what Frodo schlepped to Mordor. It also comes in silver and black, as well as a matte black version called “stealth.” So while you won’t turn heads, it’s perfect at blending seamlessly into your life. It doesn’t catch on your clothes, it’ll never buzz when you get notifications, and it’s way more comfortable than wearing a smartwatch 24/7. Most days, even I forgot it was a smart ring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcdzhN"&gt;This kind of disappearing act is no easy feat. The new Oura Ring packs in four more temperature sensors for a total of seven, a new green LED heart rate sensor, and an SpO2 sensor for monitoring blood oxygen levels. That’s on top of the battery and accelerometers. (If you look at the inside of the ring, you can catch a glimpse of how tiny these sensors are.) So while the ring is a little wider than I’d prefer — especially for petite fingers or smaller hands — it’s a fair trade-off considering where the tech is at today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kd4V5o"&gt;While it’s impressive Oura crammed this much into such a small form factor, it’s not without its quirks. Unlike a normal ring, you have to check if the sensors are positioned correctly if you want the most accurate metrics. Since you’re wearing it all day and night, you also have to be diligent about keeping the sensors clean. Fit is also important since it isn’t adjustable. You rarely need to measure your wrist to buy a smartwatch, but for the ring, you have to wait two to seven days for a free sizing kit. Oura then recommends you test a dummy ring for at least a day before placing an order. But like a smartwatch, the ring needs to be charged. It takes about two hours to get up to 100% battery, and you’ll get about a week on a single charge with normal use.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the Oura Ring Gen 3 (middle) and Gen 2 (left) are much thicker than normal rings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MXIzml"&gt;The Oura Ring bills itself as a sleep and recovery tracker. It literally doesn’t do anything else (yet). The app centers around three scores: readiness, sleep, and activity. Each is calculated based on the heart rate, temperature, and activity data collected by the ring. A high score is good, while a low score means you might need to take it easy or reevaluate your habits. That’s the gist, and you could happily ignore all the other data it throws your way. But if you want more insight, prepare to do a lot of reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAc0af"&gt;Take your sleep score. Oura determines that by looking at factors such as total sleep, REM sleep, and deep sleep — fairly typical sleep metrics that other wearable devices provide, too. Then there are also more novel metrics like “timing,” which refers to the midpoint of your total sleep falling between midnight and 3AM. Likewise, your readiness score uses something called “recovery index,” or the time it takes for your resting heart rate to stabilize during sleep. Thankfully, each of these metrics comes with little explainers as to why they matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JeHR8"&gt;These three scores are at the core of the Oura experience. However, the third gen’s new sensors add even more data to the mix. Previously, the ring only measured your heart rate when sleeping. But with the new green LED, you can now track your daytime heart rate. That introduces new terms, like restorative time, and graphs of heart rate trends. Restorative time refers to periods of relaxation where the ring detects your heart rate is low and, strangely enough, your hands are warm. (Oura’s chief of product, Chris Becherer, says this is because skin temperature increases when you’re more relaxed.) There’s also a guide so you can interpret what patterns you’re seeing. For instance, a low, flat daytime heart rate pattern is called an “Open Ocean” and shows you’ve had a chill day. Meanwhile, a hammock-shaped heart rate curve indicates your body recovered well during the night. It’s a lot to take in, but Oura gets kudos for including both bite-sized and in-depth explanations to give you more context. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshots of the Restorative Time metric explanations" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SNwJj7FkRrBRNF7au0_X1cv5Xq0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024684/IMG_2083_copy.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Restorative time is a new metric that’s part of daytime heart rate monitoring. The Explore tab is also new.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LBAXSm"&gt;But is it accurate? Daytime heart rate monitoring was in line with other trackers. In random spot checks, it was within five beats per minute of what I was getting on my Apple Watch Series 7. There were times where they weren’t in sync, but that usually evened out after a few seconds. Basically, the Series 7 will get you a faster real-time heart rate, but Oura’s daily data is presented in a more digestible format. I’m also tickled that the Oura Ring saw my nightly Pokémon sessions as restorative time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7dG61"&gt;As for sleep tracking, some wearables I’ve tested have struggled to tell when I’m awake at 4AM because the cat is yowling at the moon. For my fellow insomniacs, some trackers count those sleepless hours spent staring at the ceiling as sleep. I didn’t have that problem here. It was able to tell when I left the bed for midnight snacks and correctly identified when I was awake but trying to fall back asleep. I can’t tell you how accurate the sleep stages data is, however, as I don’t have access to clinical equipment. But my sleep data did correspond to what I got on the Sleep Cycle app on my phone and consistently outperformed the Withings ScanWatch I was testing alongside the Oura. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can choose whether you want your metrics to be easy-to-digest or if you want to go deep.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k1Lyj0"&gt;When I reviewed &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/oura-ring-review-a-great-sleep-tracker-but-its-not-ma-1844799780"&gt;the second-gen Oura Ring&lt;/a&gt;, the readiness score was hit-or-miss. Some days, it told me to take it easy when I felt fine. Others, I was a walking trainwreck and was told to challenge myself. This time around, however, it seems to have gotten better at recognizing bodily stress. I was sick for a week, and my readiness scores, which were in the high 70s–80s, plummeted to the 50s–60s. I also appreciated the ability to turn on a “rest mode,” which shuts off your activity score and prioritizes your readiness and sleep. More fitness trackers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22774263/wearables-smartwatches-apple-watch-fitness-trackers-fitbit-streaks-recovery"&gt;should follow Oura’s lead&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kr4y7c"&gt;Along that line, Oura’s activity score emphasizes weekly activity over arbitrary daily goals. It’s OK if you’ve been chained to your desk all day — you won’t get shamed for it. Instead, your score will only start to dip if you don’t meet your goals three or more days in a week. It also accounts for your training load and will adjust your daily calorie burn target depending on your readiness score. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KdZ9e0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SpO2, the new sleep algorithms, and workout heart rate won’t be available until later this year or early 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SkF4No"&gt;Another neat feature is quantified meditation sessions. I normally pass on woo-woo guided mindfulness features, but Oura caters to data nerds. After each session, you can view how it impacted your heart rate, heart rate variation (HRV), and skin temperature. Just this week, the company also added a new Explore tab to the app, which organizes audio and video content and provides more educational reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpoNyJ"&gt;As for all the marquee features like SpO2 and period predictions — I’d love to tell you about my experience, but I can’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2jrbW"&gt;I did, however, get a demo of the workout heart rate tracking feature. Based on what I saw, workout heart rate tracking is minimalistic and will initially support just running, walking, and cycling. The record screen doesn’t show any metrics — which is good for distraction-free exercise — but will show a summary of your stats, route, splits, and heart rate once the activity is finished. Until then, you can import workouts from Apple Health and Google Fit (or any app like Strava that integrates with those APIs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of a period prediction notification in the Oura app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E9AnVufXHw9HhKHPMDbhYL9ukEU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024725/IMG_2078.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Period predictions are in beta, but you get advance notifications based on your temperature. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HaRHMn"&gt;Period predictions are live and in beta, but I’ve only had this device for three weeks, and Oura recommends at least two months of continuous data. In the meantime, the app will use a combination of skin temperature data, user feedback, and the calendar method for initial predictions. TL;DR — I won’t be able to see how accurate Oura’s period predictions are for several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWQiHF"&gt;The feature also won’t be available at launch if you use contraceptives, as Becherer says the Oura team is still conducting additional testing. Current Oura users might be able to skip that two-month wait if they’ve got enough data banked, but only if and when they upgrade. This feature won’t come to Oura Ring Gen 2 owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hd6mic"&gt;This sums up why the Oura Ring can be frustrating. Oura’s looking far off into the future of wearables, and it’s counting on its customers to feel like the wait is worth it. You can see that in how Oura participates in several studies to see if it can be used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535204/apple-watch-fitbit-oura-wearables-illness-prediction"&gt;to detect illness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.19.21262306v1.full.pdf"&gt;predict pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;. In conversations with Oura CEO Harpreet Rai and Becherer, both emphasized this is a baby step toward more ambitious women’s health features and research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TZJvV"&gt;It also means much of what makes the ring cool may be invisible to the average person. Becherer confirmed that the new sleep algorithms are a back-end update, and you won’t see any UI change in the app. Your data will simply be more accurate. He also told me that there’s “nothing we can share on SpO2 Sensing right now” but that the feature would launch in 2022. For each of Oura’s available features, you’ll get the best results only if you wear it every day for months. That’s a big commitment, and if you’re going to buy in, it has to be something you’re okay with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Oura Ring Gen 3 on its charging stand." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/elKXrkdm15ZurdB5BjGMfPhYk18=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23035228/vsong_211117_4890_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ring comes with a little USB-C charging stand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jg5jMy"&gt;It doesn’t help that Oura is switching to a subscription model. The company says it’s doing so precisely because it has such ambitious plans in this space. Unfortunately, the research that Oura (as well as Apple and Fitbit) partake in is expensive, and increasingly, one-time hardware sales &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-never-ending-death-of-smart-home-gadgets-1842456125"&gt;aren’t keeping&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/in-2030-you-wont-own-any-gadgets-1847176540"&gt;the lights on&lt;/a&gt; for smaller companies. It’s also where wearables are headed. Fitbit has Fitbit Premium, Apple introduced Fitness Plus, and Whoop — another recovery tracker — requires a $30 monthly subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NceTw"&gt;Compared to those, Oura membership is on the affordable side. You get six months free, and after that, it’s $5.99 a month. Current Oura ring owners also get a free lifetime membership if they upgrade — and if they don’t, they won’t get charged extra. Also, Oura says on its &lt;a href="https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409086524819-Oura-Membership-FAQs"&gt;FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; that if you cancel or choose not to subscribe, you’ll still be able to see your readiness, sleep, and activity scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="Ld1mUE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Oura’s looking far off into the future of wearables, and it’s counting on its customers to feel like the wait is worth it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5g38aA"&gt;If you’re a diehard Oura user, you should upgrade and take advantage of that free lifetime membership &lt;a href="https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409086524819-Oura-Membership-FAQs"&gt;before it expires on November 29th&lt;/a&gt;. For everyone else, it boils down to whether you’re ready to commit. Whoop is cheaper in the short term, but it tips in Oura’s favor if you’re in it for the long haul. A cheaper Fitbit will also get you excellent sleep tracking and recovery metrics, on top of other smart features like notifications and contactless payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="XxiNyn"&gt;So is the Oura Ring worth it? If recovery is important to you, but you prefer analog watches or you don’t find wrist-based trackers comfortable, then I’d say yes. Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.wareable.com/wearable-tech/motiv-ring-sells-out-7958"&gt;failed Motiv Ring&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/motivs-ring-with-built-in-2fa-would-be-nicer-if-it-work-1831242426"&gt;trying to do too much&lt;/a&gt;. It’s trying to be an excellent health tracker, and on that front, few others do it better.&lt;/p&gt;
