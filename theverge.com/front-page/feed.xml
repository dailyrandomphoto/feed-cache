    <title>Apple’s new iPad Pros and TV remote don’t have U1 locators to help find them in your couch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fmctdqcCJ27r-jb8zh79NUa694Q=/0x0:1478x985/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159216/2UiJGkD.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rsm2tv"&gt;Apple has been quietly sticking special locator beacon chips into some of its new iPhones that’ll &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299182/apple-carkey-ios-14-13-digital-key-unlock-car-iphone-wwdc-2020"&gt;let you unlock your car&lt;/a&gt; and find lost items through walls — the latter thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;the $29 AirTags&lt;/a&gt; announced today — but sadly, you won’t find that chip in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;the new M1-based iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/18277449/apple-tv-remote-new-design-4k-features-price-release-date"&gt;the long-awaited new Siri remote&lt;/a&gt; for the Apple TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QztKa9"&gt;Apple confirmed to us that the U1 locator chip, which uses pulses of ultra-wideband (UWB) radio to broadcast its precise location, won’t appear in the Siri remote. We’re waiting on final bulletproof confirmation about the iPad Pros, but it also doesn’t appear in their product page, spec sheet, or press release. Last year’s iPad Pros didn’t include a U1 chip, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nUhMXp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ckqvG0Rj35I?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Za91aO"&gt;Is Apple expecting us to stick AirTags to our iPads and TV remotes to escape the jaws of the ever-ravenous couch? Unlikely, but the company has been pretty choosey about which devices get the chip so far. You can find it in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20859550/apple-iphone-11-pro-airdrop-u1-locator-chip-tag-tile-bluetooth-tracking"&gt;the iPhone 11 and newer&lt;/a&gt; (but not the iPhone SE) and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/15/21438497/apple-watch-series-6-u1-locator-ultra-wideband-location"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; (but not the Apple Watch SE), but we’re pretty sure it hasn’t made its way to any iPads or MacBooks that have been announced since the chip’s introduction in September 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFRFzN"&gt;Theoretically, Apple could build an ecosystem where any Apple device can easily find any other Apple device (not to mention UWB devices from Samsung, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230960/samsung-digital-car-key-audi-bmw-ford-genesis-uwb-bluetooth"&gt;which is also deeply invested in the tech&lt;/a&gt; and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373410/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-uwb-ar-bluetooth-price-release-date"&gt;its own AirTag-like device&lt;/a&gt; as well). But for now, you’ll primarily just be using your phone to find AirTags, not other gadgets, except perhaps your future car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pODdAU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLgfVN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emyNjp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHfFuv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple quietly reveals that iOS 14.5 will arrive next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TUSQo9wvznWlWZ9pyHG1BruKEuE=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69158860/findmy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS 14.5 will enable use of AirTag trackers to help locate tagged items using Apple’s Find My feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wYXsIE"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-introduces-airtag%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394200%2Fapple-ios-14-5-watch-os-7-4-mac-os-11-3-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; for Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;new Tile-like AirTag tracker&lt;/a&gt;, the company has revealed that iOS 14.5 will officially arrive “starting next week” — as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoannaStern"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s Joanna Stern&lt;/a&gt;. AirTags go on sale April 30th and will only work with devices running iOS 14.5 or higher. Likewise, watchOS 7.4 and macOS 11.3 will also launch next week, as they support new Apple Podcast feature updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwDeAc"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22267230/apple-ios-14-5-watchos-7-4-public-beta-unlock-iphone-apple-watch-mask"&gt;first launched the 14.5 beta&lt;/a&gt; to the public earlier this year in February alongside watchOS 7.4 beta (no word on whether that’s arriving soon, too). Along with AirTag support, it will implement Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253366/apple-app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-requirement-beta-launch"&gt;App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt; requirement, which mandates that developers ask for permission to track users for ad targeting. The feature was announced last year and met with sharp resistance from Facebook in particular, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;argues that the move&lt;/a&gt; will harm small businesses that benefit from ad tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohaQHf"&gt;iOS 14.5 also introduces some welcome inclusivity features, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360502/apple-siri-female-voice-default-new-voices-ios-14-5"&gt;ability to change Siri’s voice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285963/apple-emoji-ios-14-5-smiley-faces-hearts-more-skin-tones"&gt;new skin tone options&lt;/a&gt; for some emoji. Another feature we’ve appreciated in our testing thus far is Siri’s ability to learn which audio-listening apps you prefer for certain activities. This stops short of letting you select a new default app, like picking Spotify for all of your streaming music requests, but it’s a helpful evolution in any case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWsSBM"&gt;Of course, this feature may or may not make it to the final release, but we &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;know now when we can expect to find out which features made the final cut. Apple doesn’t say specifically which day we can expect 14.5, but when it does, iPhone users will be able to download the update in their phone’s settings as always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ycu2tJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A first look at Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming on iOS and the web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KtQzQbETtYs7zwp7GZhFlnHcsOk=/9x0:2631x1748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69158828/xcloudiphone.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Game Streaming running on an iPhone.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1OuUcS"&gt;Microsoft has started inviting Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to test its Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) service on iPhones and iPads today. The service works through web browsers, allowing it to also run on PCs and Macs on Edge, Chrome, or Safari. We’ve managed to get an early look at this beta and see how Xbox Cloud Gaming works on an iPhone or iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQRIZq"&gt;The web interface for xCloud (yes, we’re going to keep calling it xCloud) is very simple to use. It scales across devices like the iPhone, iPad, or even a large monitor attached to a PC to provide quick access to games. Microsoft has even included a search interface, which is something that’s strangely missing on rival service Google Stadia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jIiBSM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;here’s a first look at how xCloud, or Xbox Cloud Gaming, works on an iPhone. Full details here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/4QlTfCCjSQ"&gt;https://t.co/4QlTfCCjSQ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Td6TOKZh9d"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Td6TOKZh9d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1384594572622319616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tfadur"&gt;You don’t need to install any apps or extensions; it works natively in Chrome, Safari, or Edge. All you need is a compatible USB or Bluetooth controller. Some games even work with Xbox Touch Controls, so a controller isn’t required if you’re happy to tap on the screen and play. I managed to quickly start games using an Xbox Elite 2 controller paired to an iPhone 11 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ewqJY"&gt;Once you launch a game, you’ll have to wait a fair amount of time for it to actually load. Much like xCloud on Android, the backend servers for Microsoft’s Xbox game streaming are actually Xbox One S consoles. This older Xbox hardware isn’t powered by a modern CPU or SSD, so game loads are affected as a result. Microsoft is planning to upgrade xCloud servers to Xbox Series X hardware at some point this year, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zGUsoHhwMiYbZ1T0EQUfuKrkRX4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457711/20210420_190102000_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Game Streaming on an iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E29pDW"&gt;I’ve only been playing xCloud via the web for a few hours, so it’s difficult to judge the experience, but I’ve certainly run into a lot of connection issues both wireless and wired with my desktop PC. Microsoft says it’s working on a routing issue with this beta, but it’s worth pointing out this is a test service, and it’s only just launched, so hiccups like this are to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gURABC"&gt;Once the connection settles down, it’s very similar to xCloud on Android. If you run this through a web browser on a PC or iPad, you’ll even get a 1080p stream. It feels like I’m playing on an Xbox in the cloud, and there’s a dashboard that lets me access friends, party chats, achievements, and invites to games. This is all powered by Xbox Game Pass, so there are more than 100 games available — and even some original Xbox and Xbox 360 titles that can be streamed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b6TQaAuBYmCrYOhEtLTW0hOVA0k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457712/20210420_190115000_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can search and easily launch Xbox games in a browser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pwkKce2up0hlNX-QGfr1gZ9icBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457713/20210420_190300000_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Touch Controls can be used for certain games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="59BiXk"&gt;Microsoft hasn’t said when the company plans to roll this out more broadly yet, but given the early connection issues, there’s clearly still some work to be done until the web version is available for everyone. Still, it’s impressive how well this scales across multiple devices and opens up the ability to stream Xbox games to virtually any device that has a Chromium or Safari browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jklbgr"&gt;I also tried this xCloud browser version on the new Edge app for Xbox consoles, but it’s not fully supported yet. Both the service and the browser are in early beta right now, so full support might come at a later date. Either way, I imagine that xCloud will arrive on Xbox consoles through the ability to quickly stream a game while you’re waiting for it to download in the background. That’s really where xCloud makes sense on a console that can already play Xbox games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwRUeA"&gt;This browser-based version of xCloud does open up the service to many more possibilities, too. Xbox chief Phil Spencer has previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21529925/xbox-tv-streaming-stick-xcloud-cloud-gaming-phil-spencer-interview"&gt;hinted at TV streaming sticks for xCloud&lt;/a&gt;, and Microsoft has already committed to bringing the service to Facebook Gaming at some point. It’s easy to imagine Xbox Game Streaming apps for smart TVs, coupled with the ability to access the service from web browsers to ensure almost any device can access an Xbox Game Pass subscription. That’s clearly Microsoft’s goal here, and this beta feels like just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Polaroid’s new analog instant camera is its smallest yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xCffhYTj-cZxQfNl-ZRNywSQ7ac=/36x0:848x541/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69158605/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_8.34.42_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Polaroid&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GN5SoB"&gt;The Polaroid Go, &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/introducing-polaroid-go-the-worlds-smallest-analog-instant-camera-to-join-the-polaroid-family-301272190.html"&gt;Polaroid’s new $99.99 instant camera&lt;/a&gt; seems tiny. In design and functionality, it’s almost like a condensed version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/photography/2020/3/26/21193062/polaroid-now-instant-film-camera-rebranding-price-impossible-project"&gt;the Polaroid Now&lt;/a&gt; launched last year. But it has a few add-ons like a selfie mirror and a longer-lasting battery for the trendier, on-the-go, social media-savvy crowd who are the champions of instant film cameras these days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PP1iZo"&gt;The Go is 2.4 inches tall, 3.3 inches wide, and 4.1 inches long. Smaller than a breadbox, or the Now, which is over an inch larger in nearly every direction. Along with the mirror and Polaroid’s claims of an improved 750mAh battery, it also has standard features like a self timer (good for group shots), flash, and the ability to do easy double exposures with just a button click. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2dA9TcjpZ4UNdwH_q-Fb3C2QTNQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457172/image_go_polaroid_film_006017_front_photo_800x.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Polaroid&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Polaroid Go’s film is more square than it is rectangular.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xN7QhU"&gt;Because of its smaller size, the Go does use a new instant film format, which may be potentially inconvenient if you’ve already stocked up on the larger sizes Polaroid’s other cameras use. The Color Go film — which you can receive two packages of if you preorder the camera — measures 2.623 x 2.122 inches and has an ASA of 640, which means the Go should fair better in brighter settings or with the flash on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66Fzyy"&gt;Polaroid claims the Polaroid Go is the smallest instant camera it’s made yet, but the real test is if any compromises in quality had to be made to get that smaller size. When &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/photography/2020/3/26/21193062/polaroid-now-instant-film-camera-rebranding-price-impossible-project"&gt;we reviewed the Polaroid Now&lt;/a&gt; last year, we had issues with autofocus and the film taking a long time to develop. The Go might not have solved those problems, but the size and the cute design might be worthwhile trade-offs for someone who views their instant camera as an accessory as much as they do a tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kP6tp8"&gt;The Polaroid Go is available for preorder today for $119.99 with bundled film. The camera itself costs $99.99 and will go on sale on April 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2qBGB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ExKrMk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook pivots to audio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The word facebook in white against a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W9RIu_LTdGsjyuj7le2RjZVwsbs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69158562/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iO50I9"&gt;On Monday, I had a chance to talk with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg about &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/bringing-social-audio-experiences-to-facebook/"&gt;the company’s plans to build new audio products over the next few months&lt;/a&gt;. The occasion for our interview was the opening of Sidechannel, a Discord server I launched over the weekend with some fellow independent journalists. We didn’t know what to expect when we opened the doors, but more than 2,500 people filed in over the first day, and many of them joined us for a lively conversation about Facebook’s rapidly evolving attitudes toward creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qcTmO3"&gt;If you missed the conversation, you can find &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fcasey-newton-996089329%2Ftracks&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394215%2Ffacebook-soundbites-audio-mark-zuckerberg-interview" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the audio here on Soundcloud&lt;/a&gt;. (Skip to 1:10 to get past my welcome message to Sidechannel members.) There’s also &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/sSNgAP4Y6jQuvbWuRl-9DiBIXBc"&gt;a very rough automated transcript up on Otter&lt;/a&gt;, if you like your conversations moderately corrupted by errors in machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jK2at"&gt;There are at least three big audio bets that Facebook will lay down in the next three to six months, Zuckerberg said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="EejDJg"&gt;“Soundbites” are a new format for creative, short-form audio that will appear across the company’s suite of products. Think TikTok, but for audio; Soundbites will let you change your sound via filters and other effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TiZhNw"&gt;Facebook will become a home for long-form audio as well, recommending you shows and episodes based on your interests and allowing you to consume them inside the app. An expanded partnership with Spotify will bring the company’s audio player to Facebook’s app as well, allowing users to listen to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391551/facebook-audio-podcasts-clubhouse-competitor-spotify-live-rooms?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;both music and podcasts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gOO1BE"&gt;Facebook will add Clubhouse-style live audio rooms, which it expects to be popular with groups. Participants will be able to tip creators with Facebook’s digital currency, Stars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Qf1o5K"&gt;That’s an unusually detailed roadmap of future products for Facebook — &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt; reported on &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/4/18/22390742/facebook-podcasts-clubhouse-audio-launch-spotify-zuckerberg-apple?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; of it yesterday — and it’s probably best assessed when these features actually ship. In the meantime, though, here are five big things that stood out to me from my conversation with Zuckerberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="03kOHD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook is betting on small business over big business&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="X6aGw8"&gt;The idea of a “pivot to audio” refers to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_to_video#:~:text=%22Pivot%20to%20video%22%20is%20a,Instagram%2C%20Twitter%2C%20YouTube%2C%20and"&gt;the pivot to video&lt;/a&gt;, a mid-2010s phenomenon whereby Facebook paid big publishers to create short-form videos for the News Feed. Within a couple years, Facebook began reducing the distribution of publisher videos in the feed, though, leading to hundreds of layoffs in the media industry. (The company also disclosed that it had accidentally inflated viewership metrics during this period.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0YwVJW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A big part of the creative economy is that it’s enabling individuals”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K3lGum"&gt;At the same time, video succeeded all over Facebook — it just tended to be user-generated video, which created a context for lucrative video ads to be placed alongside them. Facebook’s pivot to video worked great for Facebook; it was the publishers who suffered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nq6aC9"&gt;And the company’s audio investments &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; follow a similar path. The flashing red light I’d look for: news that Facebook is making upfront payments to CNN, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, or other usual suspects to create short- or long-form audio for the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2QXpP"&gt;But to hear Zuckerberg tell it Monday, the audio play is much more about helping the little guy. Here’s what he said when I asked whether Facebook audio was more likely to benefit individual creators than big publishers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aZjEqh"&gt;“A big part of the creative economy is that it’s enabling individuals, and shifting power from some traditional institutions to individuals to exercise their own creativity. And I think that that’s a positive trend in the world. It’s really empowering for a lot of people, and allows a lot of new stuff to get created. I think based on that, your prediction that this is likely to work better maybe for individual creators or small groups — I could see that playing out for sure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9UqLVi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to moderate live audio is still an open question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImT81p"&gt;Facebook is getting better at moderating text and video content, particularly in the United States. But &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/series/the-facebook-loophole"&gt;as a recent series in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; has illustrated&lt;/a&gt;, policy enforcement tends to grow weaker the further removed the content is from Menlo Park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aspb6f"&gt;I asked Zuckerberg how he planned to roll out audio products with good, equitable moderation in place. He told me that the company would be able to take many lessons from what it has learned about monitoring text and video posts for bad behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IFkoYo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That set of debates, I think, will be going on forever”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yGIh2H"&gt;But he also acknowledged that there is still a debate over the degree to which audio — particularly live audio — ought to be moderated. If I walk by your picnic table in the park and hear you sharing misinformation with your friends, I’m not going to call the police. If the same conversation took place on Facebook audio rooms, should moderators shut it down? Hide it from recommendations? Or leave it alone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATCUTD"&gt;The jury is still out, Zuckerberg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KXp7ee"&gt;“There’s also this question of what you should enforce against. That’s going to be an open debate. If we go back five years, I think a lot more people were more on the free expression side of things. Today, a lot of people still are, but there’s also this rising wave of more people who are basically calling for more stuff to be blocked or limited in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4iVLZX"&gt;“That set of debates, I think, will be going on forever, in terms of where to find the right line. … I don’t take it for granted that just because you have the ability to do different kinds of enforcement, that you should always do every single thing. I think that a lot of the time, you want to be on the side of free expression and allowing people to have more conversations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1fbxhK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook thinks creators should have more ownership over their audiences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cKqEwk"&gt;When I wrote about Facebook’s interest in newsletters last month, I noted that an open question was &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/what-facebook-sees-in-newsletters"&gt;whether writers would be able to keep their email lists if they decided to leave the platform&lt;/a&gt;. On Monday, Zuckerberg confirmed that they will be able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aeZiOE"&gt;“I think one of the powerful things that Substack has done is making it so that … if someone signs up with them, [and] decides to pick up and go to another place, your subscriber list is yours. And I think that that is a really powerful part of the creator economy, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYBY1x"&gt;He continued: “When we talk about giving favorable terms [to creators], it’s actually not just the economics. I think it’s also the portability, so that the creators know that if they start building up a business here, that they’re not just gonna be locked in, and will be able to take it to different places.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NmYBiY"&gt;This is a pretty big deal! You can’t export your Facebook page subscribers or your Instagram followers. Nor can you easily transfer your subscribers on TikTok or YouTube. If Facebook leans into the notion that creators ought to own the relationship with their subscribers, it could represent the start of a healthy shift in mindset among platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="R24OOj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Substack’s margin is Facebook’s opportunity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="izfWp3"&gt;One reason some people are bearish on Substack is that the company takes 10 percent of writers’ revenue, which is higher than what it would cost writers to build their own sites on WordPress or elsewhere. (See &lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/platformer/Ethics-Policy-e8ee22c0ce7b4228b5da482a83b2ab76"&gt;my ethics disclosure about Substack&lt;/a&gt;.) For many and even most writers on the platform, that 10 percent might not hurt too much, even when combined with payment processing fees, which are usually around 3 percent. But once you’re making over $100,000 on the platform, the fees could start to sting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3cvqjz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’ve learned over the last several years not to be too Pollyanna-ish about this.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M8LBWh"&gt;Zuckerberg wouldn’t tell me what, if anything, Facebook plans to charge newsletter writers for using the platform. But it sounds like it’s going to be a lot less than 10 percent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FRI9Pv"&gt;“The biggest part of our business is not going to be taking a small cut of things from creator tools. So that does give us the opportunity to build tools at potentially more favorable terms, and have more of the economics go to creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezWuQO"&gt;“If you think about what our interests are in the space, we want this kind of creativity to thrive. We want that content to be out and to be created. We think that that helps foster social connections, helps build community, helps give people things to talk about and share. And that’s that’s ultimately the bread and butter of what we do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PAG3uf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a shift in power from institutions to individuals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E8P0cv"&gt;Zuckerberg argues that some of the negative attitudes about Facebook are explained by the same forces propelling the success of creators. It’s a story that to date has been told most forcefully by people on the losing side of that equation, he told me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="MgPFnP"&gt;“I think if you look at the grand arc here, what’s really happening is individuals are getting more power and more opportunity. To create the lives and the jobs that they want, to connect with the people they want to connect with, the ideas that they want, to share the ideas that they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHIB3W"&gt;“And I just think that that will lead to a better world. It will be different from the world that we had before — I think it will be more diverse. I think more different ideas and models will be able to exist. And I think it inevitably means that some of the people who had control over that world in the past will lose [control].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNLr77"&gt;“I can see why those folks will lament the direction that it’s going in. But my concern is that we’re too frequently telling the negative sides of it, from the perspective of the institutions that may not be on the winning side of these changes. I think the people who are on the winning side of these changes are individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPH12N"&gt;“I’ve learned over the last several years not to be too Pollyanna-ish about this. There are real issues that need to be dealt with. But my own sense is that the narrative is a little too biased, or maybe a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; too biased towards telling the negative side of the issues, rather than all the value and opportunity that is being created. And that’s what I care about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GKNAp1"&gt;Lots to think about here, for me and for all of us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="AcGdEm"&gt;
&lt;p id="q9qLVV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can buy Apple’s new $60 Siri remote a la carte for your old Apple TV, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ZPHPzKC2sV17O3sBiRfsOEIBdE=/121x0:1414x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69158556/WcGeQVXeT3.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V0Yd0E"&gt;Apple has finally excised its much-maligned Apple TV remote with a new iteration that ditches the confusing touchpad for some good old-fashioned buttons. But you won’t need to shell out for Apple’s updated Apple TV 4K to get one. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJFM3LL%2FA%2Fsiri-remote%3Ffnode%3De0808b838ac7ea88235c6447b1de687c55374fe65132236210b1cfe210a480f89a3f5e474d0a29621a712e1b6c12a7335755ab03d7c030e82feb310eb3b42cb7ae1bd481f1be764276fa9fab07b2e4d3d3d19928bd2232c89d048c164e0482e8&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394196%2Fapple-tv-4k-new-siri-remote-sold-separately-price-buttons" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple is selling the new remote separately for $59&lt;/a&gt;, and customers will be able to use it with any tvOS-based Apple TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LlfgyD"&gt;That means even if you own the first-generation Apple TV 4K or the original fourth-generation Apple TV from 2015 that debuted the Siri remote, you’ll be able to upgrade to the new and improved clicker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oztJrq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple unveils a redesigned remote for its new Apple TV 4K","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/18277449/apple-tv-remote-new-design-4k-features-price-release-date"},{"title":"Apple announces new Apple TV 4K","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22386298/apple-tv-4k-a12-bionic-price-features-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="l6EfLM"&gt;This is great news for anyone who still has an older model since the original Siri remote is terrible, and Apple’s newly refreshed Apple TV 4K models are still on the extremely high end of the spectrum for a new set-top box — especially if you already have the first-generation Apple TV 4K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHeG3Q"&gt;The new Siri remote is also replacing the old (bad) model in all new Apple TVs sold going forward, which includes both the 32GB and 64GB versions of the new Apple TV 4K and the inexplicably still-on-sale Apple TV HD (which, at $149 for the six-year-old set-top box, is an extremely hard sell compared to the $179 just-refreshed Apple TV 4K).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8osVa"&gt;Preorders for the new Siri remote will open on April 30th and will start to ship sometime in the second half of May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9pvtv"&gt;By the way, Apple confirms the new Siri Remote does not have a U1 locator chip inside, so it’s still on you to find it when it gets buried in your couch cushions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Spring Loaded event: the 8 biggest announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dN7cX0"&gt;Apple just wrapped up its “Spring Loaded” event, announcing new iPads, iMacs, and more. It was jam-packed with news from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tri6hY"&gt;If you want to read about what was announced as it happened, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384269/apple-event-live-blog-news-announcements-ipad-pro-spring-loaded"&gt;check out our live blog&lt;/a&gt; with commentary from Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, and Chaim Gartenberg.

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22149716"&gt;Apple’s new iPad Pros have the company’s M1 chip&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LQgYgx"&gt;Apple unveiled its newest iPad Pro tablets, and they’re equipped with the same Apple-designed M1 chip in the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini (and the new iMac, also announced today). The 12.9-inch model has an upgraded display that uses 10,000 Mini LEDs, and Apple calls it the Liquid Retina XDR display. Both iPad Pros also have a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera that can automatically track you during video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3W8ao"&gt;You can order the tablets on April 30th, and they will be available in the second half of May. The 11-inch model starts at $799, and the 12.9-inch model starts at $1,099.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="g17dqO"&gt;Apple debuted a completely redesigned iMac that also has the M1 chip. It’s really thin, has a 24-inch screen, a 1080p FaceTime camera, and comes in seven different colors. They’ll also come with a new wireless keyboard that includes Touch ID for authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PdqL3"&gt;You can buy the new iMac in four colors starting at $1,299 and in seven colors and better specs starting at $1,499. You can order it starting on April 30th, and it will be available in the second half of May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Y6n88W"&gt;At long last, Apple took the wraps off its long-rumored AirTag item trackers, which you can track in the Find My app. You can customize your AirTag with emoji, too. You’ll be able to preorder them on Friday for $29, and they’ll be available on April 30th. You can also get a four-pack for $99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord reportedly dismisses Microsoft deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/30AGbmJ-8c0JPwWghZYhuJ7d9QE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69158084/acastro_210129_1777_discord_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e4fXxu"&gt;Discord is ending talks to sell itself to Microsoft or other companies, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/discord-ends-deal-talks-with-microsoft-11618938806?mod=breakingnews"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The popular online chat app was reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345792/microsoft-discord-acquisition-report-10-billion"&gt;in talks to sell to Microsoft in March&lt;/a&gt; for a price that valued Discord at over $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sNlG8O"&gt;Discord was reportedly in talks with at least three other companies besides Microsoft. Other past potential suitors included both Amazon and Epic Games, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-20/chat-app-discord-is-said-to-end-takeover-talks-with-microsoft?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But even with the big-name options, Discord has reportedly decided to stay independent and consider a potential public listing to build on its success. Discord has around 140 million monthly users and earned about $130 million in revenue in 2020 but still isn’t profitable, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-social-network-without-ads-discord-defies-convention-11615199401"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwnLVj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352028/microsoft-discord-acquisition-analysis-report"&gt;Microsoft’s interest in Discord&lt;/a&gt; had a lot to do with the latter’s role as a home for online communities. The app is a destination for creators cultivating their own forums as well as homegrown groups centered on video and tabletop roleplaying games. Outside of its Xbox and Surface devices, Microsoft doesn’t have a big consumer-facing way to be a part of most people’s day-to-day lives. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298766/microsoft-teams-personal-launch-preview-accounts"&gt;opened up Teams for personal use&lt;/a&gt;, but Discord has built-in familiarity and doesn’t read as enterprise software. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; writes that both Discord and Microsoft are still open to renewed talks — but for now, Discord is going its own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOQQu6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 20th, 4:41PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added additional context from &lt;/em&gt;Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwRaQc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Overwatch director Jeff Kaplan has left Blizzard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jeff Kaplan Portrait Shoot, London" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K8_RcVgbMFAq8NF106UMpm2OnnM=/0x0:4827x3218/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69158016/871693790.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hodLXZ"&gt;Jeff Kaplan, the most public face of Blizzard’s team shooter &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, has left the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7neurj"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/overwatch/23665015/new-leadership-for-overwatch"&gt;a letter posted today&lt;/a&gt;, Kaplan said “it was truly the honor of a lifetime to have the opportunity to create worlds and heroes for such a passionate audience. I want to express my deep appreciation to everyone at Blizzard who supported our games, our game teams, and our players. But I want to say a special thanks to the wonderful game developers that shared in the journey of creation with me.” It’s not clear where Kaplan is headed, but his tenure at Blizzard lasted 19 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qb750N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was truly the honor of a lifetime.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XnfXic"&gt;It’s also unclear what this might mean for &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;. The game is in a strange place at the moment, with a sequel in the work that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22267131/diablo-4-overwatch-2-release-date-2022-activision-blizzard-earnings"&gt;isn’t expected to launch until after this year&lt;/a&gt;. Aaron Keller, described as a founding member of the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; team and an 18-year Blizzard veteran, will be taking over Kaplan’s role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGvWSG"&gt;In a statement, he wrote: “Jeff’s been a great leader, mentor, and friend, and he knows how much we’re going to miss him. I’ve been lucky to work alongside him and the rest of the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; team for many years in building something that continues to inspire people all around the world, and I’m honored to carry the torch forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nW8iZY"&gt;He added that “development is continuing at a good pace” on &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; and that “we’ll be sharing more frequent updates about &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; progress and new features in the live game with you all very soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple launches new iPad Pro with M1 processor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RThDKKvsa37AWzXULQcYRLpf3Bw=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157640/lcimg_06ebca85_7eac_4c32_9e8f_4b98fad99ec8.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rquOpZ"&gt;Right on schedule, Apple has launched the next generation of its iPad Pro. As was the case with the recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s improvements to the iPad Pro are largely on the inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELYssq"&gt;The device has a new eight-core M1 processor, the same chip that powers the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini. Apple claims this will deliver “a big jump in performance” over the previous generation. The graphics performance is over 1,500 times faster, per the company. The chip brings a number of new features, including a “next-generation 16-core Apple Neural engine” and an advanced image signal processor. Apple also says you can expect up to 10 hours of battery life from Wi-Fi models and nine hours from Wi-Fi + Cellular models. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3BdPe4hhuUM-Pj_1LqM5XMsHCmg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457435/lcimg_5b9a9e8b_c6d0_48da_8f7c_ad8d1086a21e.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yzNQb8"&gt;The iPad Pro now supports Thunderbolt 3 and USB4, as well as millimeter-wave 5G connectivity. Apple says the tablet will offer “the broadest 5G coverage worldwide,” reaching speeds up to 4Gbps, and will support eSIM. The company didn’t mention its U1 locator chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnRj5d"&gt;There’s an improved camera as well. Apple says the ISP and LIDAR scanner will capture “incredible details” in low-light conditions. There’s a TrueDepth camera system on the front of the device, which allows users to unlock it with facial recognition. The system includes a new 12MP ultrawide camera with a 120-degree field of view. The camera will automatically pan to follow you around during video calls with a new feature called Center Stage. Some smart displays, such as the Facebook Portal, offer similar features. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pcy6M1ba7uE9QKhvYmwwnbhDRy0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457520/lcimg_80056320_9cae_41a0_ae7b_242b83419310.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XACejP"&gt;The iPad Pro will support the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard Folio, as well as the Magic Keyboard, which is available in a new white color. On the gaming front, it also supports PS5 and Xbox controllers with haptics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="miSm1Q"&gt;Apple says the device uses a 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosure. The magnets in the enclosure and the speakers include 100 percent “recycled rare earth elements.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQW9Ys"&gt;The iPad comes in two sizes: an 11-inch option and a 12.9-inch option, with starting weights of 1.03 pounds and 1.5 pounds respectively. You can configure both with up to 16GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. They ship with a one-meter USB-C charging cable and a 20W USB-C power adapter. The 11-inch model has a 28.65 watt-hour battery, and the larger device has a 40.88 watt-hour battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQsAai"&gt;The 12.9-inch iPad models also include a new Mini LED screen, the Liquid Retina XDR, which Apple says delivers “XDR-level brightness.” The 2732 x 2048 display includes 10,000 Mini LEDs and will reach up to 1,000 nits of brightness and a 1 million-to-one contrast ratio, Apple claims. This component has run Apple into some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379337/new-ipad-pro-mini-led-production-issues-date-report"&gt;supply chain issues&lt;/a&gt; recently — one manufacturer has reportedly paused production. (The 11-incher comes with a regular Liquid Retina display with 2388 x 1688 resolution, which maxes out at 600 nits of brightness.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EzPaq_lDc873Jt4LnGCdsIGCfEw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457518/lcimg_34fb76c1_9a66_47dd_b873_8be9a156eda3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ksncYk"&gt;The 11-inch model starts at $799 (Wi-Fi) and $999 (Wi-Fi + Cellular), and the 12.9-inch one begins at $1,099 (Wi-Fi) and $1,299 (Wi-Fi + Cellular). Education pricing is also available: college students can get the 11-inch model for $749 and the 12.9-inch model for $999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9r32RI"&gt;Both models will be available in the second half of May, with preorders going live on April 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
