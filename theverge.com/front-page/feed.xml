    <title>Volunteers built a one-stop website to find open NYC vaccine appointments</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zbGON3"&gt;The first two months of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign have been chaotic: local health departments and hospitals are struggling put the limited shots they have available in arms, and people eligible for those shots are often frustrated by buggy sign-up websites. Older adults, in particular, are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;having trouble&lt;/a&gt; with online tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNzjBE"&gt;In New York City, one of the main pain points is that everything is fractured. Multiple different groups — including the city, the state, and various hospital groups — are distributing the vaccine across dozens of sites. That leaves New Yorkers juggling multiple registration websites as they search for open slots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9O5Ku"&gt;After experiencing the frustration of jumping from site to site to site firsthand, software developer Dan Benamy reached out to some friends and colleagues to start building a platform to pull every open vaccine appointment into one, &lt;a href="https://nycvaccinelist.com/"&gt;easy-to-use site.&lt;/a&gt; Right now, it pulls in vaccine appointments from around 40 locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9OSWqZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The hottest website in NYC now is &lt;a href="https://t.co/WdGl4JTZhQ"&gt;https://t.co/WdGl4JTZhQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Built by a genius team of volunteers, it scans most vaccination apptmt systems to tell you where there are openings. Updates every few mins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Of course it's outrageous that it's vols doing this not fed/state/city gov't)&lt;/p&gt;— Mark D. Levine (@MarkLevineNYC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarkLevineNYC/status/1354454113006845952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FqvRbJ"&gt;“We just saw a place that we could help,” Benamy says. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;spoke with Benamy and Michael Kuznetsov, another volunteer, about the website and the goal of making vaccine appointment sign-ups a little bit easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZom3O"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCnePg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did this project get started? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47bm9o"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benamy: &lt;/em&gt;When they opened up vaccination slots to older folks, my grandparents qualified. I went online to try and figure it all out. New York City has this nice site that lists all the places where you can get vaccines, but you have to check each location individually to see if there’s any availability. I thought that there was an opportunity to aggregate some of this information. I reached out to a couple of folks I knew initially, and we started building this very quickly. Other folks started coming in on the effort — developers, designers, other people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrZDvD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once you had the idea and started connecting with other folks, how long did it take to get things up and running? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u12i8v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benamy: &lt;/em&gt;There’s been a lot a lot of late nights, but I think it was two or three days after we started there was something we were showing friends and family. Then, several days later, it  was still very minimal but we felt like it added enough value to be worth sharing. We’ve been iterating on it every day, adding in more data, improving the data, and making it easier to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2LG1zU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have any plans to partner with the city, or any other officials on the project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFAwIq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benamy:&lt;/em&gt; If there’s something that we could do that would that would be helpful to the city, or if there’s somebody who has a data feed about vaccine availability that they’d be interested in us adding to the site, we’d love to do that. Whatever opportunity we have to help, we’re happy to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4rVkG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you heard from people who have used the site to set up their vaccination appointments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJk0S6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benamy:&lt;/em&gt;  We have a little feedback form on the site, and we’ve definitely had a stream of folks saying how helpful it was that there was something like this to use for vaccine appointments. And we know that the page has been viewed tens of thousands of times in the past few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFqEQi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kuznetsov: O&lt;/em&gt;ne nice story there is that one of the volunteers that joined our effort this week, actually joined because he used the website to help find his grandfather a vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m9juHR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We got vaccine appointments for all three family members and it was entirely thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ny_covid?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ny_covid&lt;/a&gt;! I highly recommend monitoring &lt;a href="https://t.co/DJWE1jpEDs"&gt;https://t.co/DJWE1jpEDs&lt;/a&gt; - it WILL pay off. &lt;a href="https://t.co/VGgG2BXzQi"&gt;https://t.co/VGgG2BXzQi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Janna Zagari (she/her) (@jannazagari) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jannazagari/status/1355254208795127816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u2Qu4J"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of problems with the vaccine rollout has been that many websites and online sign-up forms aren’t easily accessible for people who aren’t tech savvy. Is that something the team thinks about when building your site? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJYcls"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benamy: &lt;/em&gt;There’s a real focus on simplicity on the site. You don’t need to navigate around, you can just go to &lt;a href="http://nycvaccinelist.com"&gt;nycvaccinelist.com&lt;/a&gt;, and if there’s any availability it just shows it immediately on your screen. We want to try and make it accessible to folks that may be more or less sophisticated. We’d be open to including other languages also — anything that can connect people with vaccines. I’ll just be incremental improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqOVu9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your next steps for the site?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDVYUW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benamy: &lt;/em&gt;The top priority right now is getting more information into the site. The more places that we can aggregate vaccine availability from, the easier it will be for people to find vaccines, and that’s really all that matters. We’re continuing to build more tools to pull in information from other sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cr80qc"&gt;We already have information on appointments in the greater metro area, and Long Island, and another next step is to keep filling in more appointments in the surrounding area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Ve8eC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was it like to come in and fill a need like this? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHnv8W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benamy: &lt;/em&gt;The tools are out there to let people do amazing things, and we thought that if there was at least a chance we could help, we’d give it a shot.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CdvuBU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kuznetsov:&lt;/em&gt; If there’s even one life saved because somebody got a shot who wouldn’t have gotten it — that’s lit a fire under our seats as we go and do this every day. I’ve heard a couple of people say that if six months go by and this thing doesn’t matter anymore because the systems built by other people are great, and everyone’s been vaccinated — that’s a win for us.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>G.I. Joe’s Fortnite collaboration includes a Snake Eyes skin and action figure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0QCGm20RRmzzAQ_fIzrQgLsLOpo=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68745932/Fortnite_Snake_Eyes_Social.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nd7ij7"&gt;With all of its recent licensed characters, which includes everyone from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;Sarah Connor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22028767/the-mandalorian-fortnite-perfect-character-season-5"&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/a&gt;, the virtual battlefield of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is starting to resemble a playground full of action figures. When you think about it like that, a collaboration with G.I. Joe makes a lot of sense. With that in mind, Epic and Hasbro announced that iconic character Snake Eyes will be available as part of the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; universe starting today — both in-game and as a physical toy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juz7aM"&gt;The new version of the character is called Snake Eyes: Zero Point edition, an allusion to a key part of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; lore (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;one which took on more significance this season&lt;/a&gt;). The in-game version will be available starting on January 30th for 1,800 V-bucks, while a 6-inch-tall action figure is also available to preorder for $39.99 &lt;a href="https://hasbropulse.com/products/fortnite-g-i-joe-collab-snake-eyes-zero-point-edition"&gt;via Hasbro Pulse&lt;/a&gt;. Hasbro says that the figure will feature accessories inspired by “the rich history of the Snake Eyes character” as well as a few that will be familiar to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; fans, like the classic Boogie Bomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="guW1Yi"&gt;There have already been plenty of toys and figures based on &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s original characters, of course, but this collaboration hints at something different, as licensing deals become a bigger part of the battle royale. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21068938/fortnite-ninja-skin-icon-series-metaverse-tyler-blevins-ultimate-virtual-world-star-wars"&gt;Next stop, metaverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google union in turmoil following global alliance announcement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UHT9-9W5-oVvJdnlwiejyaEdyAE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68745616/acastro_180820_1777_google_china_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7C80tD"&gt;The Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) is in turmoil following the announcement of an international alliance on Monday. The alliance, Alpha Global, was billed as a worker-led initiative, but union members in the US say they didn’t know about it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22243138/google-union-alphabet-workers-europe-announce-global-alliance"&gt;until &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; published an exclusive&lt;/a&gt;. That piece included a press release quote from AWU executive council member Parul Koul, which she says she didn’t write. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uq5hyd"&gt;The news was an unwelcome surprise to union members who expect the Alphabet Workers Union to run democratically. Now, multiple sources tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that some AWU organizers are considering pushing the group to disaffiliate from the Communications Workers of America (CWA), a national union representing workers in telecommunications and media. AWU has also set up a committee to investigate CWA’s role in the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlqqSg"&gt;In a statement, AWU executive council member Auni Ahsan said: “We want to honor the concerns that have been raised, but our primary focus as a union isn’t affiliation or disaffiliation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HM0bwu"&gt;The upheaval points to the difficulties facing AWU. As a so-called minority union, it isn’t recognized by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and can’t require Alphabet or its subsidiaries like Google to negotiate a contract for its members. Its power comes in part from uniting Alphabet workers and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224926/google-union-700-members"&gt;swelling its membership base&lt;/a&gt; to mount public pressure campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvQ7xo"&gt;Since the union went public on January 4th, it’s grown from 230 members to more than 800. But &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/computerfemme/status/1346144349218889728"&gt;some members have raised concerns&lt;/a&gt; that the Communications Workers of America pushed the union to go public prematurely. They also say the CWA has a history of publishing big announcements without first consulting Google workers. Amr Gaber, a Google engineer who helped organize the 2018 walkout, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the union has been more concerned with claiming turf than listening to the needs of organizers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLiEOT"&gt;The Alphabet union’s rapid expansion has also underlined the need for clear rules and processes, including when the group puts out statements and who controls major announcements. So far, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220778/alphabet-workers-union-demands-youtube-ban-trump"&gt;AWU has called on YouTube to permanently ban Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/press/releases/retaliation-against-margaret-mitchell/"&gt;expressed concern about the treatment of Margaret Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;, co-lead of the ethical AI team. Both statements involved significant input from union members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUCu4q"&gt;That didn’t happen with the global alliance announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMAt3q"&gt;Uni Global Union, a Switzerland-based federation of labor unions, organized the coalition, and worked with at least one CWA representative on the rollout strategy. The idea was to bring together unions representing Google workers across the globe and allow members to share information more easily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rX3ZL1"&gt;Uni sent out a press release stating that “Alphabet workers” were “announcing a new global union alliance to build a more ethical and accountable company.” The press release included a quote from Koul talking about the importance of global solidarity, and CWA representative Wes McEnany told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the alliance was worker-led in a phone call about the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mf4zmJ"&gt;After the article came out, however, multiple AWU members told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they were blindsided by the news. A Google worker in Europe also said they hadn’t known about the announcement, but noted they typically don’t find out about union news before it becomes public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ov8GCb"&gt;When asked why so many AWU members had been left out of the planning, a spokesperson for CWA said there had been a mixup in the messaging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUPNIr"&gt;On January 25th, AWU called an emergency meeting. According to meeting notes reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Koul said Uni’s announcement “happened [without] any of us being notified or given a heads up that this alliance was being formed or that this statement was going out.” She stressed that she’d never said the quote attributed to her in the press release, and noted she’d been “burned” by the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgPI2a"&gt;(Koul did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHd5vb"&gt;CWA organizer Tom Smith said he hadn’t known about the situation until that morning, claiming CWA president Christopher Shelton sent an email “literally saying ‘WTF?!’” He added that Uni had been asked to take the press release down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJT7u8"&gt;Uni told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that McEnany was “very involved” in the alliance, and during the meeting, McEnany acknowledged he was partly to blame — he’d told Uni to attribute the quote to Koul. He said the timeline of the announcement had been fuzzy. (McEnany spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; three days prior to the article’s publication.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLnIMe"&gt;Later in the meeting, Koul announced McEnany would be resigning from his role working with AWU, though he is not leaving CWA altogether.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHRcJw"&gt;On January 29th, CWA sent out a newsletter, which, again, falsely attributed the quote to Koul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkkNBk"&gt;McEnany’s resignation did not quell concerns from Google organizers like Kathryn Spiers, who says she sees the botched alliance announcement as part of a larger pattern. In 2019, Google fired Spiers and four other workers who were engaged in workplace organizing. When CWA offered to pay the workers’ legal fees, the group agreed, with the understanding that CWA would not publish information about the case without first getting their approval, according to multiple sources. Despite that understanding, workers say CWA put out a press release referencing Spiers, before she’d been fired and her name had become public, and without getting her approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYhhDZ"&gt;During the emergency meeting on Monday, Spiers spoke about her experience with CWA and said she wanted to acknowledge that the alliance announcement was not an isolated incident. Now, she’s participating in a campaign to disaffiliate from the larger organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIJ3x7"&gt;The campaign could threaten to destabilize AWU, a nascent union still in its first month of public life. But it might also be a sign that the organization is working as intended. Workers are coming together to push for change, even if it means breaking up with a powerful ally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ib2uXE"&gt;If that happens, it will be a serious setback for the Communications Workers of America. In 2020, the organization launched CODE-CWA, a campaign dedicated to unionizing workers in the tech industry. Losing Google could make it more difficult for CWA to organize staff at other big tech companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyFTxz"&gt;For some workers who’ve been organizing with Google for years, however, disaffiliation might be the only option. If the campaign fails, they say they are likely to leave the organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKkpRR"&gt;“Google couldn’t have paid for this kind of union busting,” Spiers says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWeRm8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIwVtC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coachella has been canceled for the third time due to the coronavirus pandemic </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2019 Coachella Valley Music And Arts Festival - Weekend 2 - Day 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RFweUJiJeNcZnuZYiVzdhhDBDjY=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68745580/1144330957.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RzbrmP"&gt;Health officials have ordered the Coachella music festival scheduled for April to be canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. It’s the third time the pandemic has forced the annual outdoor festival that draws hundreds of thousands of fans to the California desert to be postponed or canceled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tbaFdk"&gt;“The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and the Stagecoach Country Music Festival currently scheduled for April 2021 are hereby canceled,” Riverside County Health Officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser said in an &lt;a href="https://www.rivcoph.org/Portals/0/Documents/CoronaVirus/Jan2021/HealthProviders/Scan0040.pdf"&gt;order issued Friday&lt;/a&gt;. Kaiser’s order also canceled the Stagecoach Country Music Festival, also scheduled for April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4Y6CVJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Due to the pandemic, Public Health Officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser today (Jan. 29) signed a public health order canceling Coachella Valley Music and Arts, Stagecoach Country Music festivals planned for April 2021. We look forward to when the events may return. &lt;a href="https://t.co/YAIn8uTea9"&gt;https://t.co/YAIn8uTea9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dr. Cameron Kaiser (@RivCoDoc) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RivCoDoc/status/1355287119678337024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7LX9ul"&gt;“This order is intended to reduce the likelihood of exposure to COVID-19,” the order states. “If COVID-19 were detected at these festivals, the scope and number of attendees and the nature of the venue would make it infeasible, if not impossible, to track those who may be placed at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KniYRj"&gt;Coachella’s 2020 festival was originally scheduled for April 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21174083/coachella-postponed-coronavirus-october-music-festival-stagecoach"&gt;then later postponed&lt;/a&gt; to October 2020, before finally being scrapped altogether until April 2021. There’s no word from organizers or health officials about when Coachella will be rescheduled, but&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/festivals/9518452/coachella-canceled-april-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; is reporting&lt;/a&gt; it may be pushed to October. And if vaccine distribution continues to lag and coronavirus cases keep multiplying, it’s likely we’ll start to see other large spring and summer events postponed or canceled  as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vFFMq"&gt;Coachella organizers didn’t immediately reply to a request for more information Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YiDMP9"&gt;It’s no secret that the US is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213307/covid-vaccine-florida-eventbrite"&gt;struggling to distribute&lt;/a&gt; coronavirus vaccines; some states haven’t received enough doses, and finding an appointment on sign-up websites has been a chaotic experience. A &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/30/1017086/cdc-44-million-vaccine-data-vams-problems/"&gt;new report in &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; looks at why, almost a year into the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention seemed totally unprepared for actually getting shots into people’s arms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGaaep"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;, the agency knew it needed a robust, one-stop shop that could be used by patients, clinics, employers, and government officials. But instead, the CDC spent $44 million on something called the Vaccine Administration Management System —-VAMS— built by consulting firm Deloitte (via no-bid contracts) which was so inadequate that it has driven some states to try to patch together their own vaccine distribution systems instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="lFtr3j"&gt;Clinic workers in Connecticut, Virginia, and other states say the system is notorious for randomly canceled appointments, unreliable registration, and problems that lock staff out of the dashboard they’re supposed to use to log records. The CDC acknowledges there are multiple flaws it’s working to fix, although it attributes some of the problems to user error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="U71P4G"&gt;And it’s not just a matter of elderly people not being tech-savvy enough to navigate the site (although that is a huge issue); many doctors’ offices who tried to use VAMS have mostly given up. Courtney Rowe of Connecticut Children’s Medical Center told Technology Review that she had become de facto tech support for many patients trying to set up appointments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="srgSQq"&gt;“It won’t work on Internet Explorer; it only works in Chrome. The ‘Next’ button is all the way down and to the right, so if you’re on a cell phone, you literally can’t see it,” says Rowe. “In the first round, people using VAMS mostly had advanced degrees. If you’re 75 and someone asks you to log into VAMS, there is zero&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;way&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;it’ll happen without help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3zRVMV"&gt;Take a deep breath before diving into this infuriating report about how broken government systems are contributing to the mess around vaccine distribution.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After a wild week of stocks, you can’t stream most of the biggest Wall Street films</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="wolf of wall street" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5DzEn663R0o6_rCz7dJ-zEHlioQ=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68745094/wolfofwallstreet7_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JXkCY7"&gt;It has been a wild week for the stock market, with amateur traders from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets subreddit&lt;/a&gt; battling traditional investors. The past several days have been full of massive swings in stocks like GameStop and AMC and app-fueled drama that’s sparked a larger debate over the nature of Wall Street as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VgOhhO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How r/WallStreetBets gamed the stock of GameStop ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6CwwXn"&gt;But if you were hoping to kick back this weekend, relax, and enjoy a classic business movie about shark-like investors and over-confident Wall Street executives, you’re probably out of luck. Nearly every major finance film isn’t available to stream right now in the US (at least, not at the time of publication of this article), thanks to the capricious nature of the streaming marketplace, the increasingly fragmented libraries of studios, and the byzantine licensing deals that regulate what you can stream and where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5CJaPQ"&gt;This week’s short stock drama have you hankering for &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt;? You won’t find it on Netflix, Hulu, or HBO Max. Right now, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; stream it with ads on Crackle, of all services. Paramount (which distributed the film) might be saving it for Paramount Plus, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238502/paramount-plus-launch-date-cbs-all-access-streaming-event-shows-movies"&gt;set to launch in March&lt;/a&gt;, but that won’t do you any good this weekend. Instead, your only option is to buy or rent it — which, it seems, many people are doing, given that the film has shot to &lt;a href="http://www.popvortex.com/movies/charts/top-movies.php"&gt;the No. 3 spot on iTunes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhNX3e"&gt;Maybe the ups and downs of the stock market reminded you more of Martin Scorsese’s &lt;em&gt;The Wolf of Wall Street&lt;/em&gt;, chronicling the rise and fall of investor Jordan Belfort. But the Paramount film is nowhere to be found on any streaming platform. So unless you’re willing to pony up some actual cash to buy or rent the film (which, like &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt;, is shooting up rental charts), you won’t be enjoying Leonardo DiCaprio’s profanity-fueled chest-thumping either. The same applies to 2000’s &lt;em&gt;Boiler Room&lt;/em&gt;, which is also absent from any streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Big Short" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F-iCebobzUbgBYILkhCIm1OYvhg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4340571/bgs-01810r2.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bfOibo"&gt;20th Century Fox’s &lt;em&gt;Wall Street&lt;/em&gt; is — predictably — not on Disney Plus to stream, but it’s also not available on Hulu or any other service. If you are looking for a financial film to watch this weekend, though, the sequel, &lt;em&gt;Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps&lt;/em&gt;, is on Amazon Prime. There’s also &lt;em&gt;Margin Call&lt;/em&gt;, which is streaming on Peacock (for now). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2E726"&gt;But the dearth of classic Wall Street films isn’t a unique issue. It’s one that streaming services have been grappling with in recent years, as big players like Netflix and Hulu have been less encompassing and streaming services have focused more on building up libraries of original content. There was a similar issue during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when millions of viewers looking to watch Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 film &lt;em&gt;Contagion&lt;/em&gt; were frustrated that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/7/21164769/contagion-streaming-netflix-hulu-cinemax-itunes-download-torrent-coronavirus"&gt;the film wasn’t available to stream anywhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="It9BWN"&gt;The fact that iconic Wall Street films will similarly miss the big moment around ambitious investors and skeevy short selling is indicative of a bigger problem with streaming in 2021, one that will likely continue to get worse as more and more studios continue to reclaim their content for their own services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Huo1yW"&gt;Then again, it’s almost fitting that the only way to watch &lt;em&gt;The Wolf of Wall Street&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Big Short &lt;/em&gt;this weekend is to pay a little extra cash back into the big financial machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaw78J"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp is using Status messages—its version of Stories— to try to reassure users about privacy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w9i6u0dKqiQO_O6JEQO2njq358o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68744939/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WbyrdH"&gt;Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp has started posting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/3/15537000/whatsapp-stories-status-users-175-million"&gt;Status&lt;/a&gt; messages to users about its “commitment to your privacy.” The in-app messages were appearing for members of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff in the US and UK on Saturday, and some users reported the Status messages — WhatsApp’s version of Snapchat Stories or Twitter Fleets—have been appearing in India for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrCXp0"&gt;“There’s been a lot of misinformation and confusion around our recent update and we want to help everyone understand the facts behind how WhatsApp protects people’s privacy and security,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Going forward, we’re going to provide updates to people in the Status tab so people hear from WhatsApp directly. Our first update reaffirms that WhatsApp cannot see your personal messages, and neither can Facebook, because they are protected by end-to-end encryption.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x89RYa"&gt;The messages read “One thing that isn’t new is our commitment to your privacy,” and a reminder that “WhatsApp can’t read or listen to your personal conversations as they’re end-to-end encrypted.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hwbtMdbIyUuxGhzSh-wsDKLJxKc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22270076/whatsapp1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;WhatsApp adds Status updates about its privacy policy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JdAAHjKaS4s7HGYPBt4iQTGQdtk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22270078/whatsapp2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YPtva1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wqkVK"&gt;The messages are part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;larger effort from WhatsApp &lt;/a&gt;to dispel misperceptions about an upcoming update to its privacy policy. The update is meant to explain how businesses that use WhatsApp for customer service may store logs of their chats on Facebook’s servers. WhatsApp &lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/shopping-payments-and-customer-service-on-whatsapp"&gt;previewed the changes&lt;/a&gt; to business chats in November. Given Facebook’s history of privacy blunders, however, users misinterpreted the changes to the privacy policy to mean WhatsApp would require sharing sensitive profile information with Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ct7OXU"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/answering-your-questions-about-whatsapps-privacy-policy"&gt;posted an FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; about the changes, and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;pushed back the date&lt;/a&gt; the update will take effect from February to May. It issued a statement earlier this month addressing the confusion to reiterate what the new privacy policy would cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="eKgK7g"&gt;The update does not change WhatsApp’s data sharing practices with Facebook and does not impact how people communicate privately with friends or family wherever they are in the world. WhatsApp remains deeply committed to protecting people’s privacy. We are communicating directly with users through WhatsApp about these changes so they have time to review the new policy over the course of the next month&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4KMWhH"&gt;Amid the ensuing confusion, rival &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218989/signal-new-signups-whatsapp-facebook-privacy-controversy-elon-musk"&gt;messaging apps Signal&lt;/a&gt; and Telegram have both recently seen a surge in new users. Telegram said last week it’s added the ability for users to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253918/telegram-ios-chat-history-import-whatsapp-line-kakaotalk"&gt;import their chat history from WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22244458/signal-new-features-animated-stickers-about-ios-android"&gt;Signal has added&lt;/a&gt; new mainstream chat features like animated stickers and wallpapers to its app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chromebooks just had their best year ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Chromebook 14" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVob3n7NLqhdsrzDUOeGtfxMWLI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68744613/acerwm2_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7gi0GK"&gt;According to analysts, Chromebooks had an incredible 2020, with the last quarter being the strongest ever for Google’s laptops (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/29/chromebook-covid-19-demand-market-growth/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to research firms Gartner and Canalys, over 30 million of the devices shipped last year, with somewhere between 11 and 11.7 million shipping in Q4 alone. Canalys says &lt;a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/tablets-chromebooks-q4-2020"&gt;that’s a staggering 287 percent&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; than were shipped in Q4 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bh5wt8"&gt;The firms disagree on how much growth this is when compared to 2019, but both estimate that it’s a lot: Gartner estimates that Chromebooks are up 80 percent, while Canalys says it’s 109 percent. For comparison, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;PC sales were up by 11 percent this year&lt;/a&gt;, which is the biggest growth the category had seen in a decade. This isn’t to give the impression that Chromebooks outsold PCs — Gartner estimates there were &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-01-11-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-grew-10-point-7-percent-in-the-fourth-quarter-of-2020-and-4-point-8-percent-for-the-year"&gt;275 million traditional computers sold this year&lt;/a&gt;, but it does show that one category is experiencing an explosion in growth, while another is recovering after a dip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXgfSL"&gt;Education has a lot to do with it, according to Canalys. Chromebooks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21362450/minecraft-education-edition-chromebook-version-now-available"&gt;are big sellers in the education market&lt;/a&gt;, and schools had to find a way to provide at-home students with computers for remote learning during COVID. Even the Vice President of Microsoft Education agrees that Chromebooks are great for schools — &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-education-google-chromebooks-teams-2021-1?op=1&amp;amp;scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;according to audio from a leaked meeting obtained by &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he told his employees that “[i]n many cases, when schools are buying Chromebooks or Windows PCs, Chromebooks are still faster and cheaper, they are easier to deploy and manage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3o91qz"&gt;As students attend school from home, they’re obviously not going to be coming home to a different PC. A lot of kids I know have never used a traditional computer: they spend their time on Chromebooks and tablets instead. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s Swift 5 (late 2020) puts the ‘ultra’ in ‘ultraportable’</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A lightweight laptop that doesn’t cut too many corners&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="XJUMfP"&gt;If you need a laptop that’s not just light, but among the lightest of the light, you’re looking for the 14-inch Acer Swift 5. At just 2.31 pounds, it’s one of those devices that messes with your mind. When I pick it up, I feel like I must be holding a hollow chassis. When I put it in my backpack, I spend the day worrying that I might have left it at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vwq1Hr"&gt;Sure, there are lighter laptops out there — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22239215/asus-expertbook-b9450-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Asus’ Expertbook B9450&lt;/a&gt;, LG’s Gram 13, Acer’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/2/20750669/acer-swift-7-laptop-review-price-spec-features"&gt;Swift 7&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung’s Galaxy Book S, and Dynabook’s Portege X30L-G all weigh a bit less — but some of these models are either significantly more expensive than the Swift 5 or a step down in performance. If you’re looking for a real-deal processor for a mainstream consumer audience, the Swift 5 is about the lightest you can go.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkoHaU"&gt;The model I tested, priced at $1,299.99, is a solid all-arounder without too much to criticize and not too much to gush about. Its standout feature is its weight and the performance-per-pound that it offers. Of course, for many students, remote workers, and frequent travelers, that could justifiably be a deciding factor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QwMUM5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10310264"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The back of the Acer Swift 5, angled to the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f8Zq09wogzPoXXOmhcUNxKtShU4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22266602/mchin_190423_4390_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer calls the color “a nourishing, plant-based hue.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oODc6g"&gt;Acer Swift 5 design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MSIEGq"&gt;The first thing you may notice when looking at this Swift 5 is its unusual color. Our unit is a dark bluish-green hue called “mist green,” a new shade for the Swift line. Acer says it’s meant to convey a “restful, balanced lifestyle”; while I’m not sure I quite see that, I do appreciate that it’s slightly different from the infinite black and gray laptops you’ll see out there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="aMDePl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10310225"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j53V3o"&gt;The unique finish also includes a new “silver-ion antimicrobial agent,” which Acer says will help to kill lingering bacteria. I’m not sure how many people are catching diseases from their laptops to begin with, but I suppose it can’t hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRL2ER"&gt;The screen bezels have shrunk from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21112598/acer-swift-5-laptop-review-price-spec-features-weight-design"&gt;last year’s Swift 5&lt;/a&gt; design, giving the display a more modern appearance. In particular, a large bottom bezel that used to hold a flashy Acer logo is gone. (That logo is now at the top of the keyboard deck.) Last year’s model had an 86.4 percent screen-to-body ratio, while this year’s clocks in at 90 percent. The screen is also brighter than its predecessor’s (321 nits as tested, to last year’s 300 nits) with great colors and contrast, though its 16:9 aspect ratio is a bit cramped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saoVwM"&gt;The Swift also provides good connectivity for such a thin device (it’s just 0.59 inches thick). You get one USB 3.2 Gen 2 (supporting Thunderbolt 4, DisplayPort, and charging), two USB 3.2 Gen 1, one HDMI 2.0, one combination audio jack, and Acer’s AC port. It would be nice to have an SD slot or a second USB-C, but that’s a passing grade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mpyT5"&gt;Elsewhere, the Swift 5 provides a smooth and accurate touchpad as well as a solid keyboard with comfortable keys. I hit my standard typing speeds and didn’t make a single error on my usual typing test, which has never happened to me before. For authentication, there’s a reliable and fast fingerprint reader below the arrow keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NT5y5x"&gt;The only real downside of the Swift’s thin and light build is that it feels a tad flimsy. There is a bit of flex in the screen and some very noticeable flex in the keyboard. I wouldn’t say it all feels &lt;em&gt;cheap &lt;/em&gt;— the build is clearly a step up from budget fare like the Swift 3 — but it will feel and look plasticky next to more expensive ultraportables like the Dell XPS 13.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard is backlit, too!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TgDDML"&gt;Acer Swift 5 performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="W7PCe4"&gt;The biggest news about this new Swift 5 is its brand-new Tiger Lake processor, the quad-core Core i7-1165G7. With this chip come a number of new features, including Thunderbolt 4, Wi-Fi 6, and Iris Xe integrated graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Yb1Lf"&gt;The Swift is also certified through Evo, Intel’s verification program for Tiger Lake systems. To earn an Evo badge, a laptop has to provide a variety of benefits like one-second wake time, nine hours of battery life with real-world use, and reliable performance. Not every Evo-certified system I’ve tested has hit those marks in my testing, but the Swift 5 certainly came close.       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GZ55vu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’re not compromising horsepower for this form factor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jm8QXm"&gt;In addition to the processor, the $1,299.99 system includes 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. There’s also a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.acer.com%2Fen-us%2Fswift-5-laptop-sf514-55ta-56ch%3Finternal_source%3Dus.acer.com%26internal_medium%3Dreferral%26internal_campaign%3DCLM%26internal_content%3DNX.A6SAA.002&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22256779%2Facer-swift-5-2021-review-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$999.99 base model&lt;/a&gt; available, including a Core i5-1135G7 (also with Xe graphics), 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. Either of these models is a fine purchase, but folks who don’t need their Swift to do anything graphically intensive should probably be just fine with the $999 configuration. Reviews have shown that the Core i5-1135G7 &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/That-awkward-moment-when-a-Core-i5-1135G7-can-outperform-the-more-expensive-Core-i7-1165G7.512848.0.html"&gt;often matches and sometimes outperforms&lt;/a&gt; the Core i7-1165G7 in CPU-intensive tasks. Some other excellent laptops with similar portability benefits also fall between the $999 and the $1,299 price points, making the $1,299 model a somewhat harder sell. Asus’ 2.49-pound, 0.54-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21494523/asus-zenbook-14-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-features-price"&gt;ZenBook 14&lt;/a&gt; with equivalent specs is just $1,099.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrvntS"&gt;You’re not compromising horsepower for this form factor. The Swift 5 is the fastest Tiger Lake laptop I’ve reviewed so far (apart from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21440302/intel-tiger-lake-hands-on-tests-core-i7-1185g7-processor-release"&gt;a very high-clocked reference design&lt;/a&gt;), though it’s not quite on the level of some recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21423498/lenovo-ideapad-slim-7-2020-amd-review"&gt;AMD Ryzen products&lt;/a&gt;. I certainly never noticed any slowdowns or errors in my day-to-day work. And while this isn’t a laptop you’d buy for gaming, Iris Xe graphics are good enough to run some lighter fare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38gxpz"&gt;The bottom of the chassis got warm during an intense day of Chrome multitasking, downloading and updating, photo editing, Zoom calls, Spotify streaming, and Netflix watching, but it was never uncomfortable to touch. I often heard the fans while the Swift was in Performance Mode, as well as a very occasional coil whine, but swapping to Silent Mode eliminated both of those. (You can easily toggle between cooling profiles with Fn+F.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Swift 5 lid, closed, seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-i-VTStPikILLCPrbnhbWHSuY3A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22266601/mchin_190423_4390_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The viewing angle is up to 179 degrees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fWpqX4"&gt;And battery life was a pleasant surprise. I averaged eight hours and five minutes of continuous multitasking (around 200 nits of brightness) on this version — a big step up from the six hours I got out of last year’s Swift 5. Battery life also improved significantly after I got rid of some programs that came loaded onto this machine, including ExpressVPN, Amazon (which is pinned to the taskbar), and Norton. It only takes a few minutes to dump all of these programs, but considering that this laptop costs over $1,000, it’s still frustrating that Acer is loading it with budget crapware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsIYI0"&gt;The final thing I’ll discuss is videoconferencing software since that’s important functionality for many mobile professionals. The results here are mixed. The good news is that the Swift 5 now supports AI-enhanced background noise suppression and Wi-Fi 6. Those are difficult to test, but I did do a number of Zoom calls on the Swift 5, and nobody had trouble hearing me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2HfKQ"&gt;In less-good news, the 720p webcam is fairly grainy. (It’s not good enough to support Windows Hello.) The dual stereo speakers also deliver some of the weakest audio I’ve heard from a laptop — bass in music was quite thin. The Swift does come loaded with DTS Audio Processing, which allows you to swap between preset profiles for music, movies, and games, and to tweak equalizer settings yourself. There’s no profile specific to videoconferencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Swift 5 open, seen from the front. The screen depicts a green, blue, and white background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lQ6RT6NzgKsZJ9CnWQ_aXWVjOlA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22266605/mchin_190423_4390_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Swift 5 includes dual copper heat pipes, and a fold-under hinge provides extra airflow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="oGbQiE"&gt;Inside its thin and light exterior, the 2021 Acer Swift 5 is a midrange laptop through and through. There are compromises but no disasters. Most aspects of it (the keyboard, the touchpad, the screen, the connectivity, the battery life) are just fine. Others (the webcam, the audio, the bloatware) are underwhelming but serviceable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="EsZd35"&gt;If these factors are what you care most about, you can get similar quality for less money in Acer’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21377208/acer-swift-3-review-2020-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Swift 3&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21815008/acer-aspire-5-review-2020-15-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Aspire 5&lt;/a&gt;, Asus’ ZenBook 14, HP’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Envy x360&lt;/a&gt; 13, and plenty of more affordable machines. If you’re paying a premium for this Swift 5 configuration, you’re paying for the exceptionally lightweight build. The portable chassis — and the power Acer has packed into that portable chassis — is where the Swift 5 is at the top of its class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="Sq1Opk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10310273"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Subscribers of Apple TV Plus will continue to get credit refunds until June</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tqsWxjsHFChML6wk9CwJdtIgMlY=/128x0:1505x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68744478/Apple_introduces_apple_tv_plus_03252019_big.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RUJvIq"&gt;Apple has notified subscribers of its Apple TV Plus streaming service that they’ll continue to get refund credits on their accounts until June, following a second extension of its free trial program earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/30/apple-tv-subscribers-will-continue-receiving-credit-refunds-until-june"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9 to 5 Mac&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gl2Iwp"&gt;Apple extended the free year-long trials of Apple TV Plus to customers until July 2021. The trials were included with the purchase of any Apple device (an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV) and were initially set to last until November 1st, 2020. This was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508148/apple-tv-plus-free-period-extended-february-2021-streaming"&gt;the second extension&lt;/a&gt;; an earlier extension had pushed back the free trial end date to February, allowing users who started a free trial between November 2019 and June 2020 to get up to five months of additional access for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XACfxV"&gt;But before Apple issued the first extension of the free trial, some users had switched to paid subscription status in the meantime, and Apple gave these customers refund credits. It’s doing the same thing for the second extension. &lt;em&gt;9 to 5 Mac&lt;/em&gt; says affected subscribers are being advised via email that they’ll receive monthly credits of $4.99 (or the local equivalent) to their Apple accounts, which will be automatically applied for each month the subscriber is charged between February and June. The credits can be used toward App Store purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
