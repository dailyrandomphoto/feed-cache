    <title>Fortnite’s Halloween event turns Ariana Grande into ‘the galaxy’s greatest monster hunter’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dezU-tWko-tm50sRL6NlIey-LRA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70014560/Fortnitemares_2021___The_Convergence.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="50Mkfp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s big Halloween event, Fortnitemares, is making its return. But this year’s edition comes with a fun twist: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;one-time &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; performer Ariana Grande&lt;/a&gt; is now officially part of the game’s lore, with a questline that turns her into “the galaxy’s greatest monster hunter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meU9nn"&gt;The event runs from today until November 2nd, and — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22666441/fortnite-chapter-2-season-8-battle-pass-cubes"&gt;in keeping with this season’s theme&lt;/a&gt; — it’s centered on the ever-present cubes that now dominate &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s island. The story event is called “The Wrath of the Cube Queen,” and developer Epic describes it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6fCOA9"&gt;Since Fortnitemares began (and even before), the cubes have been mobilizing. Their migration towards the island’s center wasn’t just to spread corruption — they’re now at the center forming the Convergence. What is the purpose of this mysterious structure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAm1c1"&gt;You’ve come across the cubes and fought back the cube monsters, but a new force has joined their ranks: Caretakers are the Cube Queen’s strongest warriors yet. Tall, foreboding, shadowy apparitions, their spectral tendrils pull you directly into the sideways for a showdown on their home turf. Survive a Caretaker’s assault and you’ll walk away all the richer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpziAi"&gt;Things don’t end there. The Cube Queen’s wrath has given rise to a new sideways weapon — the sinister sideways scythe — as well as returning items like witch brooms and the pumpkin rocket launcher. Use the scythe and these wicked supplies to hold your own in battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="xNoMN7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_n2pGPT3jAI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KrV2Dm"&gt;The event will also include the return of the Horde Rush mode, as well as new quests from several characters. This is where Grande comes in: a new version of her, called “Spacefarer Ariana Grande,” will be introducing a questline about hunting monsters. As per usual, completing quests will unlock some free goodies like gliders and pickaxes. Check them out in the gallery below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="okwgH6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10814251"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YYqTmf"&gt;While the main event itself is starting now, Epic has been getting into the Halloween spirit for the last week or so, with new additions to the game ranging from &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;’s Rick Grimes to Frankenstein’s monster to a skeleton designed by street artist Kaws. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710510/fortnite-fortnitemares-halloween-event-spooky-short-film-festival-epic-games"&gt;There’s even a short film festival coming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s latest live-action Cowboy Bebop teaser makes bounty hunting look easy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qcZZ0a2Wb_03LjO1YBHp_07O1Qc=/534x0:3087x1702/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70014554/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_8.08.11_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5KbShh"&gt;It’s still not a full trailer, but Netflix showed off the best look yet at its upcoming live-action &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; adaptation in a new teaser to celebrate the one-month countdown to the show’s debut on November 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqH5Js"&gt;Like the previous teasers for the show (which so far have included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22634321/netflix-cowboy-bebop-release-date-john-cho-photos"&gt;stills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22691323/cowboy-bebop-netflix-opening-title-sequence-watch"&gt;the opening credits&lt;/a&gt;), the latest video, titled “Cowboy Bebop: The Lost Session,” isn’t actually made up of footage from the show but does show off the key trio of Spike Spiegel (John Cho), Jet Black (Mustafa Shakir), and Faye Valentine (Daniella Pineda) in action as they hunt down a bounty, get some noodles, and fight through an army of thugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AgRa9W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Netflix’s Cowboy Bebop is out on November 19th, check out the first photos","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22634321/netflix-cowboy-bebop-release-date-john-cho-photos"},{"title":"Watch the opening title sequence for Netflix’s Cowboy Bebop series","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22691323/cowboy-bebop-netflix-opening-title-sequence-watch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gKuKrR"&gt;That said, it's a &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;fun teaser, shot with kinetic, color-coded shifting frames that bounce between Spike, Jet, and Faye as they bicker and brawl back and forth. Translating anime to live-action is always a trickier proposition, but hopefully, the actual show can manage a similar energy when it comes to Netflix next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzvD6g"&gt;It is still somewhat concerning that Netflix still hasn’t shown off any actual footage of Cowboy Bebop yet, but with the show just weeks away, odds are that a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; trailer should arrive soon. In the meantime, the classic anime &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723502/netflix-original-cowboy-bebop-anime-watch-before-live-action-adaptation"&gt;starts streaming on Netflix on October 21st&lt;/a&gt;, so you’ll be able to catch up in time for the remake next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNOmVs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How public radio is trying to save print</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FVSUQHREagtAGPk8VQVYpocbsVU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70014495/newspaperRadio.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Why Chicago Public Media and the Chicago Sun-Times are exploring a merger&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="o1eiS8"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; needs help. After being bought and sold several times over the last decade, the 73-year-old paper is looking for a more stable home to continue its award-winning reporting — and it may have finally found it in an unexpected place: a radio station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwrNBb"&gt;Chicago Public Media, which owns the radio station WBEZ, is currently in talks with the &lt;em&gt;Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; to merge. A final deal would combine their newsrooms and audiences in hopes of creating a financially stable enterprise for both teams. Similar mergers and acquisitions have become a common way to bolster the struggling print industry, but if radio were to take on a major newspaper, that would be a first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8jDnH"&gt;“Audio is a growth business,” says Jim Friedlich, chief executive of &lt;a href="https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/"&gt;The Lenfest Institute for Journalism&lt;/a&gt;, who advised CPM on the potential merger. “Now Chicago Public Media and other media with audio roots have both the wherewithal and the self-confidence to take a bold step like this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJUIc5"&gt;Since 2004, US newspapers have &lt;a href="https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-news-desert/loss-of-local-news/loss-newspapers-readers/"&gt;shut down at a rate of 100 per year&lt;/a&gt;, a pace that’s &lt;a href="https://www.poynter.org/locally/2021/the-coronavirus-has-closed-more-than-60-local-newsrooms-across-america-and-counting/"&gt;only accelerated&lt;/a&gt; since the start of the pandemic. To stay afloat, some smaller newsrooms have given up independence, being bought by &lt;a href="https://www.cnhi.com/"&gt;news conglomerates&lt;/a&gt; or becoming joint entities with other local outlets — and public radio and TV stations have increasingly offered themselves up &lt;a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/public-media-mergers-playbook-2/"&gt;as partners&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/wnyc-other-public-radio-stations-acquire-gothamist-and-sister-sites/"&gt;New York Public Radio acquiring the website &lt;em&gt;Gothamist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was one of nine similar deals in recent years, triggering researchers to document the trend by creating the &lt;a href="https://publicmediamergers.org/about/"&gt;Public Media Mergers Project&lt;/a&gt;. Public radio has been a particularly strong force, holding its ground amid digitization and the podcasting craze (partially because it’s &lt;em&gt;participated in it&lt;/em&gt;), and it might be strong enough to help print do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="4HQo0d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QD8cgK"&gt;WBEZ may be particularly well suited to supporting the &lt;em&gt;Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt;. The station is a big name, pulling in 550,000 weekly broadcast listeners, according to CEO Matt Moog, while also being the audio house that brought us &lt;em&gt;Wait Wait... Don’t Tell Me!&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/about"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Moog tells me the organization has been “breakeven or better for the past seven years, even through the pandemic.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRzUU7"&gt;Part of the financial health of public media stations in general involves the &lt;a href="https://www.501c3.org/frequently-asked-questions/what-benefit-does-being-501c3-offer-my-nonprofit-and-its-contributors/"&gt;financial perks of being a nonprofit&lt;/a&gt;. Listeners and viewers are incentivized to donate since contributions are tax-deductible, and the organizations are exempt from corporate income taxes (as well as sales and property taxes, in some cases). They can apply for grants reserved for nonprofits while reserving the right to pull at heartstrings — and wallets — by saying their programming is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBDHfAevWxg"&gt;funded by “viewers like you.”&lt;/a&gt; In addition to more than a dozen or so public-media mergers in the past decade, there have also been cases of newspapers &lt;a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/11/04/historic-shift-salt-lake/?utm_source=Hot+Pod&amp;amp;utm_campaign=0d5b5da4cc-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_9_23_2021_9_51_COPY_01&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_f85dcd1354-0d5b5da4cc-92382929"&gt;converting to&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/news/h-f-lenfest-launches-institute-journalism-new-media-donates-philadelphia-inquirer-daily-news-philly-com-makes-20-million-gift-new-endowment-ensure-future/"&gt;becoming affiliated with&lt;/a&gt; a nonprofit without the support of NPR or PBS affiliates in order to access these exact benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLWK8J"&gt;Newspaper closures, on the other hand, have been &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/local-journalism-in-crisis-why-america-must-revive-its-local-newsrooms/"&gt;attributed&lt;/a&gt; to fewer paid subscriptions, as consumers flock to free sites and social media, and the resulting disinterest of advertisers. Between 2008 and 2018, it’s estimated that advertising revenue for newspapers &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/local-journalism-in-crisis-why-america-must-revive-its-local-newsrooms/#footnote-2"&gt;dropped by 68%&lt;/a&gt;, even as digital advertising revenue increased for those same publications. What’s more, certain types of local reporting — public-service and investigative journalism in particular — are often the most expensive, says Friedlich. Many local public-service stories involve “long lead times” and “deep investigations,” he says, as well as steps that are relevant to a story’s locale, like doing environmental testing or submitting freedom of information requests to local government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zyORN7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;WBEZ reaches 550,000 weekly broadcast listeners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k4bns5"&gt;When donations are incentivized by nonprofit status, they can help cover those costs. In 2016, The Lenfest Institute, a nonprofit, &lt;a href="https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/news/h-f-lenfest-launches-institute-journalism-new-media-donates-philadelphia-inquirer-daily-news-philly-com-makes-20-million-gift-new-endowment-ensure-future/"&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Philadelphia Inquirer&lt;/em&gt; newspaper, making contributions tax-deductible if they’re made to the institute to support the &lt;em&gt;Inquirer&lt;/em&gt;. Under this arrangement, Friedlich says, the resulting&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;donor support has comprised “a critical 5 percent” of the paper’s annual revenue, being used for “meaningful initiatives in digital transformation, investigative news, and diversity, equity and inclusion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzAQu2"&gt;Public radio has taken the already powerful funding strategy of nonprofits and made it its own. Stations across the US have &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2013/10/22/236245578/not-another-pledge-drive"&gt;established a reputation&lt;/a&gt; that they will ask for — and receive — donations from listeners, and it’s also commonplace to hear that a “generous donor” agreed to match fundraiser contributions or that a certain program was “sponsored” by a local business. Strong public radio stations “have built out sophisticated developments and business-side teams,” says Elizabeth Hansen-Shapiro, lead researcher for the Public Media Mergers Project and CEO of the &lt;a href="https://www.nationaltrustforlocalnews.org/"&gt;National Trust for Local News&lt;/a&gt;. “They have a really strong basis of financial support, in terms of major gifts &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; membership &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; sponsorship. The business model itself is pretty robust and diversified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kaN6G"&gt;This may be how CPM and the &lt;em&gt;Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; could stand to succeed. Though exact plans are still in flux as CPM and the &lt;em&gt;Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; iron out the formal deal, they’re said to take several cues from what public radio already does well. For one, Moog says, he intends to apply public radio’s financial infrastructure to the &lt;em&gt;Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; existing efforts: the news site would no longer have a paywall, he says, but instead a membership program with a free tier, “the same way it happens with public media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mKgo8M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Sun-Times could end up focusing on memberships over subscribers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ucIle"&gt;Taking cues from public radio will also mean, quite simply, producing audio. It’s a strength of both teams, according to Moog, who says that future plans could include podcasts, “interactive audio chats,” or &lt;em&gt;Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; staff reporting on air. The teams have had success collaborating on audio before, with the &lt;a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/9/20/20854262/motive-podcast-episode-1-download-listen"&gt;true-crime podcast &lt;em&gt;Motive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. WBEZ’s vice president of communications tells me the show has been downloaded several million times; that number includes downloads for subsequent seasons that were produced without the&lt;em&gt; Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt;, but Moog describes the initial season as one of the most successful podcast products WBEZ has produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4fhR5u"&gt;If &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/motive/id1479220905"&gt;Apple ratings&lt;/a&gt; can serve as a crude metric, &lt;em&gt;Motive&lt;/em&gt; might have outperformed &lt;a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/pages/podcasts"&gt;other &lt;em&gt;Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; podcasts&lt;/a&gt; as well, gaining a few thousand ratings as opposed to &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-best-movies-with-richard-roeper-and-roe-conn/id1488397079"&gt;a few dozen&lt;/a&gt;. The task of getting the podcast in front of so many listeners was supported by CPM’s ability to broadcast promotional material to its millions of monthly listeners, and the show likely gained traction because of podcast listeners’ existing fascination with true crime, which was bolstered by the &lt;em&gt;Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt;’ investigative reporting chops. In the audioverse, it was a match made in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhDdAp"&gt;There are still risks for radio, of course, as well as for the outlets they take on. In the time that’s passed since New York Public Radio bought and revived &lt;em&gt;Gothamist &lt;/em&gt;in 2018, it’s struggled financially. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://current.org/2021/04/new-york-public-radio-lays-off-14-staffers-including-newsroom-leaders/"&gt;14 people were laid off&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;em&gt;Gothamist&lt;/em&gt;’s editor in chief, as one of several measures to reduce a multi-million-dollar deficit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCHRHZ"&gt;Both Moog and Hansen-Shapiro expressed that the example of NYPR shouldn’t be cause for concern about the state of public media, which Moog describes as “generally quite healthy.” Public radio benefits from many of the same feel-good, “intimate” elements that have given podcasts their foothold, and that’s on top of its ability to broadcast, particularly to people Moog describes as “engaged” and “loyal” listeners. “From a podcasting point of view, our ability to connect with that audience and promote some of the audio work that we’re doing is really significant,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="a5KQ20"&gt;Hansen-Shapiro agrees. In an industry where needs abound, but funding can be tight, “the advantage that public media stations have is that they’ve been at this game a lot longer.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple updates iMovie to adjust focus in iPhone cinematic mode footage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gr5SwDSEwT7Dzjn67dnacsKoKF4=/73x0:2197x1416/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70014408/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_12.17.21_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dTR5rg"&gt;Apple has updated the iMovie app for Macs to let users edit and adjust the focus in videos recorded using the iPhone 13’s new “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673545/iphone-13-pro-camera-cinematic-mode-video-features-macro"&gt;cinematic mode&lt;/a&gt;” — though you’ll need to wait until you can update to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22725047/macos-monterey-release-date-compatibility-features-m1-pro-max-chip"&gt;the latest macOS Monterey on October 25th&lt;/a&gt; to take advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8ZSRt"&gt;Introduced in September with the latest clutch of iPhones, cinematic mode uses machine learning to automatically pull focus to the key part of a frame (usually whatever face is biggest and turned towards the camera). It also lets people tap their phone screen to adjust the focal point while recording, and during playback after the video has been shot. Now, iMovie users who have the latest macOS Monterey will be able to make those same adjustments on their computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SGthhm"&gt;Here are the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/-/id408981434"&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt; for iMovie 10.3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="V3aGZj"&gt;Cinematic Mode&lt;br&gt;• Edit videos recorded on iPhone 13 in Cinematic mode (requires macOS Monterey)&lt;br&gt;• Use the Cinematic control in the inspector to modify the intensity of the depth effect&lt;br&gt;• Choose to focus on faces or other objects by selecting them in the viewer&lt;br&gt;• View and delete focus points in the video timeline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnvs9Z"&gt;Optimized for Apple silicon&lt;br&gt;• Improved performance and efficiency with optimizations for M1 Pro and M1 Max on the new MacBook Pro&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wZMOhD"&gt;Also of note: iMovie has been optimized for the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;M1 Pro and M1 Max chips&lt;/a&gt;, just like &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2021/10/final-cut-pro-and-logic-pro-updated-on-the-new-macbook-pro-with-m1-pro-m1-max/"&gt;Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro&lt;/a&gt;. The new chips are Apple’s most powerful yet (just like every year), with the M1 Pro delivering 70 percent better CPU performance and twice the graphics performance of the original M1. Check out all the details on the new chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fisher-Price’s iconic Chatter Telephone now makes actual phone calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fGZ3ULeWFrvvzLc5MrNwS0ovFFA=/0x486:2000x1819/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70014351/6470479cv12d.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fWK9ZU"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 4 is often held up as a pinnacle of phone design, but what about the Fisher-Price Chatter Telephone? With its friendly features (a big smiley face painted on the front) and mobile design (thanks to its four wheels), the Chatter Telephone has long been the gadget of choice among the aesthetically discerning &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the under-4s. This week, to celebrate the device’s 60th anniversary, Fisher-Price has blown our minds once more with its courage and innovation: the Chatter Telephone now makes and receives phone calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoS4DB"&gt;The new Fisher-Price Chatter Telephone Bluetooth edition is, admittedly, an accessory rather than fully-fledged mobile device. It connects to your Android or iOS phone over Bluetooth, and, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/fisher-prices-iconic-toy-telephone-now-actually-makes-p-1847846984"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you can actually dial numbers using the plastic rotary dial and answer and hang up calls by lifting and replacing the handset on the cradle. There’s even a loudspeaker function, for when you’re taking that super important conference to try and nail down &lt;em&gt;who took your nose&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mMbwYd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10815220"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xBxZue"&gt;It’s not all good news though. Rather disappointingly, the $60 gadget charges via the extremely outdated microUSB, but I guess that is an appropriately retrograde choice. The phone is available to preorder &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ffisher-price-chatter-telephone-with-bluetooth%2F6470479.p%3FskuId%3D6470479&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;exclusively at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s not clear when it will be shipping. You can, at least, rest assured that supplies won’t be affected by the chip shortage, and we expect that more than a few households will be adorning their home offices with one of these beauties come Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google has tried everything but building the best phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google’s new Pixel 6 phones, regular and Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gusZPuJr34vU1-mHF75a1mAI2qM=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70014329/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2SokbT"&gt;At 1PM ET, Google will try its best to convince millions of people to buy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22722823/google-pixel-6-pro-event-android-12-magic-eraser-rumors"&gt;a Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; instead of Apple’s iPhone 13 or a Samsung Galaxy. Will it work? That depends on whether Google does something it’s never managed to do with a phone launch: fire on every cylinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aufYAF"&gt;The Google Pixel has never been the it phone, the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink phone, the phone early adopters crave. Samsung originally cornered the Android side of that market with the Galaxy Note, and it was 2017 when Apple crossed the $1,000 mark with the iPhone X and followed it up with the pricey Pro and Pro Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMdADX"&gt;Google has arguably never had a truly flagship phone to call its own: while the search giant’s incredible camera software has made the Pixel punch above its weight for years, the company’s otherwise been competing in the budget flagship tier. The Pixel, Pixel 2, Pixel 3, and Pixel 5 were all priced to take on an entry-level iPhone, instead of shooting for the moon — which makes some sense, considering how little in the way of marketing, carrier partnerships and raw hardware prowess Google could muster for each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqADM8"&gt;While Google has arguably had a hand in every flagship Android phone release going back to the T-Mobile G1 / HTC Dream in 2008 and the Nexus program from 2010 to 2015, it was never in charge of its destiny to the degree an Apple or even Samsung is today. Until 2019’s Pixel 3a, every Google phone relied on a revolving door of third-party smartphone manufacturers for its hardware stack, including Motorola, HTC, LG, and Huawei. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Rl4L0"&gt;The budget Pixel 3A was the first device to find a sales niche by bringing Google’s excellent camera to a $399 phone (briefly winning &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/idc-google-outsells-oneplus-with-7-2-million-pixel-smartphones-in-2019/"&gt;an estimated 0.4 percent marketshare&lt;/a&gt;). It was also the first phone that was fully developed by a Google team including former HTC designers and engineers. (The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/30/16949366/google-htc-smartphone-pixel-design-team-deal-closed"&gt;acqui-hired them for $1.1 billion&lt;/a&gt; in 2018.) After the failure of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923660/google-pixel-4-xl-review-camera-radar-face-unlock-90hz-display-telephoto"&gt;Pixel 4&lt;/a&gt;, that Pixel 3A’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496547/google-pixel-5-4a-5g-play-it-safe"&gt;balance of simplistic design, capable camera and mid-range features&lt;/a&gt; has informed every subsequent Google phone launch — until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7Vyjuv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 6 is a turning point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60X28x"&gt;Google has been signaling for months that the Pixel 6 is a turning point. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;The Google phone is premium again&lt;/a&gt;. We haven’t seen Google-branded hardware this comparatively ambitious since the priciest Nexus phones, and we likely haven’t seen a marketing budget this big &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/22/13013766/google-pixel-phone-event-ads-challenge-apple"&gt;since the very first Pixel&lt;/a&gt;, if ever. Google hardware boss Rick Osterloh &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;told us in August&lt;/a&gt; that the company is “ready to invest a lot in marketing” in order to grow the brand, and the budget was apparently significant enough for CFO Ruth Porat to namedrop it on an earnings call. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aJpOLyDpTxiF9Hkk1BkNW8lfQXk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938223/screen.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tgvK7Q"&gt;The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro also have a design like no other phones, placing their multiple cameras into a huge camera bar reminiscent of a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; droid, with a distinctive pop of color up top. The reported presence of a new 50-megapixel camera that pulls in 150 percent more light shows that Google’s finally moving forward, alongside a wide-angle sensor and a 4x periscope zoom on the Pro — while up front, large curved screens with high refresh rates, hole-punch cameras, and minimal bezels cement the premium look of both phones. They’ve reportedly got gigantic batteries, too, up to 5,000mAh, addressing the biggest issue that sunk the Pixel 4, and an under-display fingerprint reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nT4q8p"&gt;And for the very first time, a Pixel will have Google’s own chip at its heart: a new SoC called Tensor designed by Google itself with “totally differentiated” AI performance (it may contain &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676099/google-pixel-6-tensor-processor-rumor-arm-cortex-x1-core-mystery-strange"&gt;an unusual combination&lt;/a&gt; of off-the-shelf CPU and GPU cores). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gfnvS6"&gt;The idea seems to be that Google will pull an Apple — by controlling the whole hardware and software stack, it could theoretically offer features and optimized performance like we’ve never seen from the company’s previous Qualcomm-based phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZZZYk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22722823/google-pixel-6-pro-event-android-12-magic-eraser-rumors"&gt;According to leaked product pages&lt;/a&gt;, the new Pixels will introduce four perks in particular that likely owe something to the new chip: a Magic Eraser feature that can automatically remove an unwanted object from a photo, a Face Unblur feature that can stabilize a blurry photo, a Live Translate feature for real-time language translation without an internet connection — and a guaranteed five years of security updates. Nevertheless, I have to wonder if any of it will be enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lU9fT"&gt;Apple’s iPhones have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;never been stronger&lt;/a&gt;, with the iPhone 13 lineup improving on the already-capable iPhone 12 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676532/apple-event-iphone-13-incremental-refinement-upgrade-specs"&gt;in practically every way&lt;/a&gt;, and this year it’s the Pixel’s cameras that are playing catch-up. Carriers have been pushing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22684911/iphone-13-true-cost-of-free-phone-iphone-13-pro"&gt;unheard of iPhone trade-in deals&lt;/a&gt; that effectively offer even a $1,000 model for “free” over 24 months even if you’re trading in a three-year-old iPhone, making those offers even sweeter. Given the relative value of an old Pixel phone, it’s very hard to imagine AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon offering Google’s customers the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XndZWa"&gt;Leaked prices are giving me pause, too. Multiple sources are reporting Target is internally listing the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro at $599 and $898 respectively. That would mean they start &lt;em&gt;cheaper&lt;/em&gt; than the Pixel 5, which seems weird — while I’ll happily take a lower price if I can get it, it suggests that Google’s either subsidizing these phones itself (perhaps because it’s not getting that boost from carriers) or it’s cutting some corners. While I would hope Google has figured out its quality control, many of the company’s phones have had some ugly issues in the past, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/31/16957332/lg-bootloop-lawsuit-settlement-g4-v10-v20-nexus-5x-g5"&gt;manufacturing defects&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/11/18306552/google-huawei-nexus-6p-class-action-lawsuit-settlement-agreement-compensate"&gt;battery issues&lt;/a&gt; that led to bootloops with the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/15/16889854/pixel-2-xl-lg-display-oled-blue-shift"&gt;screen quality control issues with the Pixel 2 XL&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/reports-of-pixel-3s-bricking-with-edl-message-are-growing/"&gt;growing number of mysteriously bricked Pixel 3s&lt;/a&gt;. Some Pixel 5 phones also had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549778/google-pixel-5-display-gap-issue-normal-design"&gt;a weird display gap&lt;/a&gt;. I know people who won’t even consider a Google phone anymore, burned by one too many bootloops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNW7NH"&gt;At the very least, the prices suggest to me that Google probably doesn’t have other premium hardware features up its sleeves — Google might meet the iPhone, but it probably won’t beat it this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOWTLS"&gt;Luckily for Google, its definition of success is relative. &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Google-aims-to-double-smartphone-output-with-new-Pixel-6"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Google is merely trying to produce 7 million of its new Pixel 6 phones, reportedly only double the company’s smartphone shipments last year. (Apple and Samsung have been known to ship 80 million phones &lt;em&gt;per quarter.&lt;/em&gt;) The company doesn’t need to break the Apple-Samsung duopoly by convincing us to forgo an iPhone or Galaxy this year; it just needs a win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mP2Yup"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Easy, right?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dbm3YH"&gt;Google just needs a phone that stands out from the pack, a massive marketing and awareness campaign, carrier partnerships across the globe, a class-leading camera, great battery life, speedy performance, an attractive design, good reviews, and no red flags. If it all works out — if Google can hit on all cylinders — perhaps it can use that success as a springboard to go even harder next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OL5I1O"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s app privacy briefings go live in the Play Store in February 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pBL5qKpzg9Uu1ehiPV-LpCAzGGw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70014235/Details_Page_v04.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GNM3Zb"&gt;Google is one step closer to launching its new data privacy section for Play Store apps. App developers can now &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/10/launching-data-safety-in-play-console.html?"&gt;fill out the relevant details&lt;/a&gt; via Google’s new “Data safety form” on the Play Console. The company says the required information will be visible to users from February 2022 and mandatory for developers to submit by April that same year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iG1hYV"&gt;This new feature was announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422894/google-play-app-privacy-info-apple-app-store-labels"&gt;back in May&lt;/a&gt;, after Apple started showing similar privacy and data disclaimers for apps in the App Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;last December&lt;/a&gt;. The data section is supposed to give consumers a quick and simple overview of what apps are doing with their information. Developers will be encouraged to tell users the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="cx5Ovp"&gt;What type of data their app collects, including “location, contacts, personal information (e.g., name, email address), financial information, and more”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3T7SpH"&gt;Whether this data is optional or required to use the app &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mMjMR5"&gt;Whether or not the app encrypts data in transit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="besfBZ"&gt;If the app been independently reviewed “for conformance with a global security standard”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="vE9EIU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pNAS_0IcHtM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4sq6Vf"&gt;Developers can now enter this information via the Google Play Console, and Google has added &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10787469"&gt;guides for developers&lt;/a&gt; to help them navigate this new requirement. “Following our common protocols, we’ll begin gradual rollout today and expect to expand access to everyone within a couple of weeks,” said Google in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ExQxnT"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pixel 6 will reportedly double Google’s smartphone production</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wNNn6v-f4SFmFVz3YHpmQLpGlLM=/162x0:1935x1182/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70014156/Google_Pixel_6_Pro__Alt_Angle_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Pixel 6 Pro. | Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bgqQDf"&gt;Google is planning a major increase in its smartphone shipments with the impending launch of the Pixel 6, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Google-aims-to-double-smartphone-output-with-new-Pixel-6"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Japanese publication says that Google has ordered more than 7 million Pixel 6 smartphones to be produced, roughly doubling its entire 2020 production. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; cites figures from IDC saying that Google produced 3.7 million phones last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZona3"&gt;And according to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;, it’s not just the Pixel 6 that’ll account for the boost in shipments — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;lower-end Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt;, released earlier this year, is said to have received more than 5 million orders. Together with the Pixel 6, which will be announced in full later today, that means Google should more than triple its 2020 smartphone output. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYWtjJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reports that Google is “attempting to capitalize on its position as the only US maker of smartphones running on the Android operating system” and increase market share following the sanctions-induced collapse of Huawei’s mobile business. The company is said to be targeting Apple, Samsung, and Xiaomi, the three current leading vendors. For comparison, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723209/apple-iphone-13-chip-shortage-manufacturing-report"&gt;Apple is said to be shipping around 80 million iPhone 13 units in 2021 alone&lt;/a&gt;, so the Pixel is still going to be very far behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tl6LzX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Pixel 6: what to expect from Google’s thoroughly pre-announced phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22722823/google-pixel-6-pro-event-android-12-magic-eraser-rumors"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zq9eFi"&gt;Google’s Pixel phones have generally been well-received for their cameras and software design, but have often had their quirks and have never shipped in significant enough volume to make a major impact on the industry at large. In the US, Pixel market share has trailed the likes of Lenovo, LG, and OnePlus, with Apple and Samsung in a different league altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BntBaV"&gt;Details of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro have already been widely disseminated, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;including by Google itself&lt;/a&gt;, and the phones are set to be officially launched at 1PM ET today. Alleged pricing info from Target leaked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732322/pixel-6-pro-price-leak-us-eu"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that the Pixel 6 line will start at $599. If that’s the case, it would be further evidence of Google’s attempts to increase its market share. Last year’s Pixel 5 had relatively mid-range specs and started at $699.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jk0A67"&gt;Google is also working on a new Pixelbook laptop running ChromeOS, according to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;. No details of the product were given, though &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; points to its previous reporting that said Google was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652003/google-chromebook-cpus-custom-design-2023-report"&gt;developing its own chips for Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt;. The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro will be the first Pixel phones to use a Google-developed SoC known as Tensor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This Raspberry Pi add-on lets you control Lego robots</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mol_PQ7mr6A40rdJ4YX9sPqdDTk=/0x0:8688x5792/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70013997/RC_Car_Build_HAT_wide.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Raspberry Pi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lK83ST"&gt;Raspberry Pi is releasing an add-on that will let you use many of its tiny, inexpensive computers to control certain Lego robot motors and sensors. The add-on is called the Build HAT (&lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/introducing-raspberry-pi-hats/"&gt;HAT stands for Hardware Attached on Top&lt;/a&gt;), and slotting it onto a Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins will give you four ports that you can use to control &lt;a href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/products/lego-education-spike-prime-set/45678#lesson-plans"&gt;Lego Education’s SPIKE components&lt;/a&gt;, which the HAT and its software are specially designed for. It’ll also connect to most other parts that use an LPF2 connector, including the components from the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Frobot-inventor-51515&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F19%2F22729239%2Fraspberry-pi-build-hat-lego-technic-spike-education-python" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lego Mindstorms robot inventor kit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dq5kVq"&gt;There’s also a Python library (basically a set of commands you can use to control the robot) available to go alongside the HAT, which will let you write software to control the robot parts you’ve got hooked up. Programing Lego’s SPIKE components with Python isn’t a unique selling feature from Raspberry Pi — the SPIKE kit comes with a hub that supports connecting six devices (compared to the Build HAT’s four) that can also store and run Python programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ykDrL2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Adding a Pi to a project gives you a lot of flexibility&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1M29dg"&gt;However, you’re going to get more flexibility with a Raspberry Pi. You have to program Lego’s hub using a separate computer or iPad, whereas the Build HAT will be attached to its own computer that you can likely plug a keyboard, mouse, and monitor into, depending on which Raspberry Pi you’re using. The SPIKE Hub also only has LPF2 ports (though it has six, compared to the Build HAT’s four), whereas the Pi has GPIO pins that you can use to connect other devices, electronics, and sensors. That gives you a ton of flexibility in what you can add to your robots. The Build HAT also will let you control your motors and sensors at a lower level if that sort of thing is your jam.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CYKYrQ3v_Bj5QGKR9I8cqv2MKrU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22930933/Build_HAT_close_up.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raspberry Pis always add a fun DIY aesthetic to a project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cga8Ki"&gt;Raspberry Pi says that hooking the Build HAT up to an 8V power supply with a barrel plug will let it provide juice to both the Lego accessories connected to it and the Raspberry Pi itself. The company will sell a specific 48W power supply to go along with it if you don’t have one that’s capable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BkX8nb"&gt;This is obviously a pretty niche product, but I’m glad it exists. If your kid or students are playing around with Lego’s SPIKE robots but want to go deeper into programming and electronics modding, the Build HAT could be a good way to help them do that with the motors and sensors you already have. Plus, Raspberry Pi and Lego seem to be a perfect match for each other — both brands have a sort of DIY spirit and could make some interesting projects if they end up doing more work together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YnJND"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dbrand reveals new PS5 Darkplates days after pulling the originals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tCCqW2RSkykamm0Um-SzCYdcC90=/0x0:2250x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70013454/Darkplates_2.0___C.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dbrand’s new Darkplates.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Dbrand&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nweXFI"&gt;Dbrand has revealed a brand-new design for its PS5 Darkplates just days after yanking the originals from sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFDLlc"&gt;If you weren’t familiar with the original Darkplates, they looked exactly like the side shells of a PS5, but instead of being white, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306874/dbrand-ps5-darkplates-matte-black-hands-on-review"&gt;they were matte black&lt;/a&gt;. In its marketing of the first version, the company baited Sony to “Go ahead, sue us,” and Sony unsurprisingly followed up with a legal threat. &lt;em&gt;Shockingly&lt;/em&gt;, just days after &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/q94jua/darkplates_are_dead_thanks_sony/"&gt;making a big public stink about Sony forcing it to&lt;/a&gt; pull the old version, Dbrand is already ready with a new design. The company says they’ve been in development since September, but conveniently would not tell us when Sony sent the cease-and-desist to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vYEuzcrSciEikwTiMdAR5qM_ISY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22937555/ps5_darkplates_2.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yZoenF"&gt;Darkplates 2.0 look a little different than the original model. While they still attach to the sides of the PS5, the new Darkplates are more rounded instead of having quite as much of the sharp, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/6/11/21288541/playstation-5-ps5-sony-design-memes-roast-twitter-router-face-building"&gt;popped collar-look&lt;/a&gt; that’s closely associated with Sony’s console. (They also now have a prominent vent right next to the PS5’s fan.) The new Darkplates come in three colors — matte black, a “retro gray,” and white.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4nTE-W_Da9M2HuJ7_7pftQSgtpg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22937470/Darkplates_2.0___Hero___Classic_White.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dbrand&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darkplates 2.0 in white.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NifcTp"&gt;But is the new design enough of a difference to avoid Sony’s ire? Dbrand claims so, even going so far as to bold some of the text for us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="cIfsIx"&gt;By creating a &lt;strong&gt;brand new design&lt;/strong&gt;, Darkplates 2.0 successfully closes the loop on this dispute and &lt;strong&gt;neutralizes any future infringement claims from Sony&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SJ5nFq"&gt;However, in the original cease and desist letter, Sony threatens to initiate legal action unless Dbrand does three things: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EngT1U"&gt;1. Promptly and permanently cease and take down all marketing and promotion for and cease all sales worldwide of faceplates featuring the product configuration of SIE’s PSS faceplates or any similar product configuration, including without limitation all faceplates currently for sale at dbrand com; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AD2uE6"&gt;2. Promptly and permanently cease and take down all marketing and promotion for and cease all sales worldwide of products or packaging bearing the PlayStation Family Mark, the Modified Shape Mark Design, any other PlayStation Mark, or any other indicia of SIE; and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZv2Yh"&gt;3. Promptly and permanently cease and take down all use worldwide of the PlayStation Marks, any similar marks, and any other marks, branding or indicia associated with SIE or its affiliates, including without limitation within product names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="80oXCZ"&gt;Dbrand wouldn’t go quite that far, saying the company is effectively complying with items two and three. The company also raises its own version of the question: “Is Sony still going to sue you assholes?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="fe7spV"&gt;The answer? Probably. The difference this time is that we’ve created an original design for which they have no basis to allege infringement. If they want to try, they’d better be ready to pay our legal fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="QmJT38"&gt;The new Darkplates will cost $59 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fspecial-edition%2Fps5&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22733642%2Fdbrand-new-ps5-darkplates-sony-legal-threats" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;during preorders&lt;/a&gt; and $69 when they’re available on a regular basis. Dbrand says the first batch will ship in November, and stock will go out in monthly waves after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yp4H1x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction 9:10PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The new Darkplates come in three colors, not two. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
