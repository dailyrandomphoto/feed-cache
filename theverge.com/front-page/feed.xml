    <title>Twitter is shutting down Fleets, its expiring tweets feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l6YRRBMwlBs1F50JZksldDXUiYw=/61x5:985x621/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581782/fleet_blog_1.jpg.twimg.1920.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter just rolled out Fleets to everyone in November. | Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XZ5Fv8"&gt;Say goodbye to Fleets, the row of fullscreen tweets at the top of the Twitter timeline that expire after 24 hours. The ephemeral tweet format is shutting down due to low usage after launching widely just eight months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQE7QK"&gt;Starting on August 3rd, users will instead just see active Spaces — Twitter’s live audio chat rooms — at the top of their timelines. And the composer for traditional tweets will be updated with more camera editing features from Fleets, like text-formatting and GIF stickers over photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yimr8Q"&gt;Twitter’s decision to axe Fleets is not just an admission that the feature didn’t work but that the company still hasn’t figured out how to get people tweeting more. For years, Twitter has struggled to get new users to post regularly and not just consume other people’s tweets. Fleets was its shot at using Stories, the popular social media format invented by Snapchat and further popularized by Instagram, to lower the pressure around tweeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUiu6Y"&gt;“We hoped Fleets would help more people feel comfortable joining the conversation on Twitter,” Ilya Brown, Twitter’s vice president of product, said in a statement. “But, in the time since we introduced Fleets to everyone, we haven’t seen an increase in the number of new people joining the conversation with Fleets like we hoped.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYqk9Z"&gt;Killing the feature now is especially sudden since Twitter just rolled it out to everyone in November and started testing ads between fleets last month. At the time, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22461070/twitter-fleets-stories-ads-monetize-instagram-snap"&gt;called the ads an “experiment”&lt;/a&gt; with a handful of advertisers. It’s unclear if those fullscreen ads will show up in other parts of the app in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qfCzKS"&gt;“If we’re not evolving our approach and winding down features every once in a while – we’re not taking big enough chances,” Brown said. “We’ll continue to build new ways to participate in conversations, listening to feedback and changing direction when there may be a better way to serve people using Twitter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qt7gPC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mamzyT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will pay $1 billion to creators through 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZXy_7yGeouhYRdwEpv7HNsLdm9E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581698/acasto_180123_1777_0003_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vLKxvE"&gt;Facebook plans to pay out &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/investing-1-billion-dollars-in-creators/"&gt;$1 billion to creators&lt;/a&gt; over the next year and a half as part of an effort to court content makers to its many services. The money will be awarded to creators who use Facebook products in different ways: on Facebook, creators can get a cash bonus for running ads on their videos or reaching certain tipping milestones during livestreams; on Instagram, creators can get paid for enabling ads on their IGTV videos, getting tipped in livestreams, or creating popular videos on Reels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6woKzB"&gt;The money is available to creators on an invitation-only basis for now, and new options for making money will be announced later. Facebook indicated it would expand availability to more creators later in the year, launching a “dedicated place for bonuses within the Instagram app this summer and in the Facebook app this autumn.” The initiative is meant to make Facebook “the best platforms for millions of creators to make a living,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote today. The money will be disbursed by the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lsAcGDNDj1x0f_NEV6WmOdGSAoI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717442/Stars_Assets_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook displays a “Stars Challenge” offering a cash bonus for receiving paid virtual tips during a livestream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gilZyV"&gt;It’s an aggressive move from Facebook after years of other companies &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/12/technology/facebook-creators-tiktok-youtube.html"&gt;building more compelling locations&lt;/a&gt; for creators to build a platform and a business. More recently, apps like TikTok and Snapchat have offered to pay creators outright for posting successful videos to their platform. Snapchat paid out $1 million per day for a period of time to bolster its TikTok competitor, Spotlight. Facebook already offers some ways for creators to get paid, but the options differ across services. And some features, like Reels, may not pay out to creators at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOskXN"&gt;Facebook’s approach is more confusing than other companies, framing the money as a “bonus” for completing various activities and goals, rather than focusing on a single product. But the intention seems to be investing cash to juice the company’s many different services all at once, helping them stand out as the apps start to see new competition from companies like TikTok and Clubhouse. Last month, Facebook announced that it wouldn’t take a cut from creators making money with a number of its services until 2023, in another attempt to make the network more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dmky5K"&gt;The company appears to be serious about turning creators into a new source of revenue. With ad issues elsewhere on the platform, direct tipping and payments can offer the company a backup if they grow to a big enough scale — though there’s certainly a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 Beta 3 has a wild new way to handle auto-rotation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Android 12 " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e9G7mUHvR5zLXrFDfxtok0cbrYo=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581623/VRG_1777_Android_12_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yjww9f"&gt;Google is releasing the latest beta for Android 12 right on schedule. Beta 3 for Android 12 continues adding features, including scrolling screenshots, faster on-device universal search for apps, improved auto-rotate, and more. Google says this version of Android 12 has the “Android 12 APIs and the official SDK,” which means there shouldn’t be major feature changes in the upcoming betas. That should mean Android 12 is still on track for a fall release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQ2qkg"&gt;The most interesting new feature in Android 12 Beta 3 is “better, faster auto-rotate.” Google is now using the front-facing camera and face detection to determine what orientation you’re trying to hold the phone (instead of just depending on the accelerometer). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHffI1"&gt;“This is especially helpful for people who are using their devices while lying down on a couch or in bed,” writes Dave Burke, VP of engineering for Android. That means you could be lying on your side in bed with the phone in a horizontal position but because the camera can see your face is also horizontal, it will stay in portrait mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="94AWrq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Android will be the best OS for people who don’t want to get out of bed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2BM6XQ"&gt;Burke is quick to emphasize that this face detection happens locally in Android 12’s “&lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/our-work-keep-you-safe/"&gt;Private Compute Core&lt;/a&gt;, so images are never stored or sent off the device.” When I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;first previewed Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, I had to spend a bit of time explaining what the Android Private Compute Core (APCC) is: a special and secure area of the operating system for running algorithms that might contain sensitive data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIXpf0"&gt;The APCC’s prominence in the original announcement was a clear hint that Google intended to create more Android features that might potentially raise privacy concerns — and here we are, seeing that hint become reality. As I wrote then, “an easier way to think of it is if there’s an AI function you might think is creepy, Google is running it inside the APCC so its powers are limited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1gueX"&gt;Burke says Google has also “optimized the animation and redrawing and added an ML-driven gesture-detection algorithm.” He claims that will reduce auto-rotate latency by 25 percent. Auto-rotate on Android has historically been fairly janky — and wildly inconsistent across different manufacturers — so hopefully these claims will be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvI8oU"&gt;The auto-rotate wizardry is cool, but the feature that will probably elicit the most cheers from Android users is a consistent, system-level way to create scrolling screenshots — aka screenshots that let you grab more than one screen in a single image like on a webpage. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="How scrolling screenshots work in Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eLUIP0pmt056-IAaYj0BQ1kmgyU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22715942/scrolling_screenshots.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How scrolling screenshots work in Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JDmM9E"&gt;Android 12 has new toggles that let you turn off the camera or microphone at a system level. With Beta 3, now the enterprise administrator in charge of your business (or government) phone will be able to control those toggles, locking you out of access to them if that’s appropriate for your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6kXiA"&gt;Google is also pushing developers to use &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/appsearch/package-summary"&gt;a new AppSearch on-device search engine&lt;/a&gt; both within their apps and across the entire phone. Developers will be able to pick and choose what parts of their apps get indexed for universal search across the device or within other apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MjWcQL"&gt;Google also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573033/google-android-12-games-download-dashboard-developer-summit"&gt;recently announced that Android 12&lt;/a&gt; will allow users to begin playing games before they’ve finished downloading. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525023/android-12-beta-2-wifi-privacy-location-microphone-camera"&gt;as with Beta 2&lt;/a&gt;, there may be some smaller, unannounced tweaks yet to be uncovered. Beta 3 should be rolling out to Pixel phones today, alongside a &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/devices"&gt;small handful of devices&lt;/a&gt; from Oppo, Realme, Sharp, OnePlus, and others (but not Samsung, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ueW2oE"&gt;As for the final release of Android 12, it will arrive on Pixel phones first but may also hit some of those manufacturers early on. Google has been improving its release cadence for Android updates — but it is still never going to match the speed you see on iOS. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse launches its DM feature Backchannel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cicv7c0XMBuxRGTkPL8GOpkbo6k=/1x0:4516x3010/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581629/clubhousebackchannel.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Backchannel, Clubhouse’s messaging feature | Image: Clubhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BwU93z"&gt;Now, you can slide into people’s Clubhouse DMs. The social audio company is launching its direct messaging feature, Backchannel, today for all users on both iOS and Android. For now, users can chat one-on-one, in groups, and send links. They cannot yet send images or videos, but a spokesperson says that functionality is coming, along with a “few other features.” There will also be an optional secondary inbox where message requests will live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JTLTqh"&gt;The functionality is designed to help moderators chat among themselves during an active room; let people connect after an event; and broadly, foster text conversations that otherwise would have to take place in a separate app. We can’t say this development is much of a surprise, though: Clubhouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543877/clubhouse-backchannel-text-chat-private-leaked-feature"&gt;accidentally leaked&lt;/a&gt; the feature in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0BUvv"&gt;Still, this is a critical development for the app, which the company now says has been downloaded over 8 million times on Android devices with more than 500,000 rooms created daily. Its competitors, notably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455799/twitter-spaces-web-browser-clubhouse-social-audio-room"&gt;Twitter Spaces&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22540508/facebook-live-audio-rooms-clubhouse-rival-spaces-greenhouse"&gt;Facebook Live Audio Rooms&lt;/a&gt;, both allow people to text chat while also running or participating in an audio conversation, so Backchannel brings Clubhouse more up to par and ensures users keep their conversations, and more of their social life, on the app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome will soon let you turn on an HTTPS-first mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_r8KrZizCVMCHbvjI9ve77AW2hY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581624/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fr25r3"&gt;Google is working to make browsing more secure by soon offering an HTTPS-first option, which will try to upgrade page loads to HTTPS, the company announced on Wednesday. If you flip this option on, the browser will also show a full-page warning when you try to load up a site that doesn’t support HTTPS. The company is also announcing that it’s “re-examining” the lock icon in the URL bar and plans to experiment with a change to how that looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3cJEO"&gt;HTTPS is a &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-https/"&gt;more secure version of HTTP&lt;/a&gt; (yes, the “S” stands for “secure”), and many of the websites you visit every day likely already support it. Since HTTPS encrypts your traffic, it’s a helpful privacy tool for when you’re using public Wi-Fi or to keep your ISP from snooping on the contents of your browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLt1DC"&gt;Google has been encouraging HTTPS adoption with moves like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17365362/google-chrome-secure-indicator-https"&gt;marking insecure sites with a “Not secure” label in the URL bar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/03/a-safer-default-for-navigation-https.html"&gt;using https:// in the address bar by default&lt;/a&gt; when you’re typing in a URL. For now, this HTTPS-First Mode will be just an option, but the company says it will “explore” making the mode the default in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0a8MY4"&gt;The HTTPS-First Mode will be available starting with Chrome 94, according to Google. Currently, &lt;a href="https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule"&gt;that release is set for September 21st&lt;/a&gt;. And HTTP connections will still be supported, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgEEHK"&gt;As for the experiment with the lock icon, I’ll let Google explain what the potential issue with the icon is, &lt;a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/07/increasing-https-adoption.html"&gt;from a blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pnPDPg"&gt;As we approach an HTTPS-first future, we’re also re-examining the lock icon that browsers typically show when a site loads over HTTPS. In particular, &lt;a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub45366/"&gt;our research&lt;/a&gt; indicates that users often associate this icon with a &lt;em&gt;site&lt;/em&gt; being trustworthy, when in fact it’s only the &lt;em&gt;connection&lt;/em&gt; that’s secure. In a recent study, we found that only 11% of participants could correctly identify the meaning of the lock icon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6kjBhH"&gt;So starting with Chrome 93, the company plans to swap the lock icon with a downward-facing arrow as part of an experiment. To me, an arrow feels like something you might feel more encouraged to click on than a lock to learn more information about your connection, so I can see the reason behind the change. Here’s a GIF of what you can expect to see:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gk9vNWwnT6x_VQSqAhDHJmIYbuY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717298/pasted_image_0.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u4XKx7"&gt;Even though the lock is changing to an arrow, Google will still show the “Not Secure” label for sites that aren’t secure, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An AI model shows health centers in California aren’t prepared for power outages  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sylmar Converter Station, a piece of power grid infrastructure operated by LADWP, for a story about how an Oregon wildfire almost caused the lights to go out in California on Friday night. Sylmar Converter Station is the terminus of the Pacific DC Intertie" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wwynCGxiwSa8a-fu_1uvIT0Pb-c=/42x0:3959x2611/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581619/1233958488.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wildfires in the West can lead to power outages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f1lvuv"&gt;There are around 20 federally qualified health centers in the areas touched by the Lava, Tennant, and Salt fires, which started in Northern California at the end of June. The centers are part of the state’s healthcare safety net and offer &lt;a href="https://www.chcf.org/publication/californias-federally-qualified-health-centers/#related-links-and-downloads"&gt;primary care&lt;/a&gt; to low-income patients in the area. Despite the fire risk to the facilities, none of those 20 centers had backup generators, says Andrew Schroeder, who runs analytics programs at the humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJc5Zw"&gt;That’s key information for officials and aid groups: if the power went out because of the fires, those centers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20932780/california-blackout-healthcare-electricity-fires"&gt;might not be able&lt;/a&gt; to keep medications and vaccines refrigerated or turn on computer systems with patient medical records. But before May, that’s not information Schroeder or anyone else working on response efforts would be able to look up. Despite the threat of outages and shutoffs during extreme heat and fire season, states and industry associations often don’t know which facilities have backups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5pumI"&gt;“We had a lack of information about where health centers have generators, where they have solar panels, have people installed battery backups for refrigerators, and things like that,” Schroeder says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWvjjA"&gt;Now, thanks to a new AI model finished at the end of May, they have a better picture of the backup plans at these health centers just in time for what’s projected to be a devastating fire season. It shows a sparse landscape: only around 30 percent of facilities have backup power and access to refrigeration for medical supplies, says Jeni Stockman, senior program manager at artificial intelligence company Macro-Eyes, which built the tool. “It suggests there’s a huge gap in the resiliency of sites,” she says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PiBQFO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a huge gap in the resiliency of sites”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qO57FN"&gt;The information is acutely important for the response to the COVID-19 pandemic because the vaccines for the disease have to be stored at cold and ultracold temperatures. Sending shots to a place that couldn’t keep them cold during a power disruption &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/science/2021/2/16/22285394/covid-vaccine-power-outage-freezer"&gt;risked losing the doses&lt;/a&gt;. So Macro-Eyes worked with the California Primary Care Association (CPCA) on a project funded by Direct Relief to build a tool that would map out the resources at each center. The groups soon realized it could have other applications outside of COVID-19, like where to direct aid in other emergencies, says CPCA Acting President Robert Beaudry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mD36bZ"&gt;“Because of the fires, and because of [power company] PG&amp;amp;E’s ongoing problems, we have power outages in California. We wanted to know which of our health centers could continue to operate,” Beaudry says. “The more information that we had around these types of issues, the more we could inform emergency preparedness in California.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RXozT"&gt;The project was modeled off of work Macro-Eyes did in Sierra Leone mapping out what resources health facilities had at any given time. The government didn’t have good information about which health centers had access to electricity and which didn’t, says Benjamin Fels, the founder and CEO of Macro-Eyes. “In the context of COVID-19, when you get these really scarce vaccines, you don’t want to send them to a point on the map where they cannot be kept cold — because that basically means you’re throwing them away,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DfUQSD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When you get these really scarce vaccines, you don’t want to send them to a point on the map where they cannot be kept cold”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yeNln4"&gt;In conversations with Schroeder and Direct Relief, the company realized people in California didn’t have that information, either. Hospitals in the US that get federal funding are required to have backup generators. But outpatient and community care clinics, including federally qualified health centers, often don’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WaUF6R"&gt;The facilities can charge Medicare and Medicaid for services, so they have to report certain information to the federal government — demographic information about the patients they serve, insurance status of those patients, and so on. It’s a very extensive form, Schroeder says. “What it doesn’t contain is much of any information about the actual infrastructure of the places,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="py9avA"&gt;The CPCA has surveyed centers to find out what resources and power sources they had available, but those haven’t dredged up much information. Beaudry says the association had a sense of the power resources for around 8 percent of the sites in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeZ4zT"&gt;Macro-Eyes’ model helped fill in the rest of the picture. It pulls in data from a range of publicly available sources — like lists of places that had permits for generators and satellite images for solar panels. From there, it’s able to infer which similar types of health sites might have the same features. If, for example, the model already has information from survey data on three health centers out of 10 that have similar locations and serve a similar number of people, it could project that the remaining seven would have the same resources as the first three. Health centers can then confirm whether the model got it right, which helps the AI continue to learn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Goz5Hd"&gt;Mapping out the data helped CPCA see where there are limitations in access to power. Officials and aid groups could use that information to decide where they should send supplies. That could include anything from COVID-19 vaccines (which need to be frozen) to insulin, which has to stay refrigerated, Schroeder says. “We often support needs for insulin after disasters,” he says. “We need to know where we’d feel confident sending things that require cold storage, without also sending some kind of ability to back up their refrigeration capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="61xhz3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We need to know where we’d feel confident sending things that require cold storage”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="62n3G9"&gt;The data could also help organizations figure out which places in the state could use extra generators. “We can see where there’d be islands of rural health populations that would be potentially disconnected,” says DeeAnne McCallin, the director of health information technology at CPCA. She says the California Department of Public Health recently told CPCA that they may have extra freezers or refrigerators available and asked if there were any health centers that could use them. That’s the kind of inquiry the data could help answer.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGnAN4"&gt;It’s also valuable for the health centers themselves because they’re able to see during an emergency if there’s a nearby facility with access to a generator or a refrigerator that they could direct patients to or use to store supplies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNw0Gc"&gt;The Macro-Eyes modeling tool can be used in places other than just California. The company and Direct Relief think that the Gulf Coast, which has been battered by increasingly devastating hurricanes, could be a good next target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8u3Q1"&gt;Major disasters — like those Gulf Coast storms, Hurricane Maria, and the California fires — have made it clear that having a backup power plan is a key piece of preparedness. That’s especially true for healthcare, which is vital during disaster response. “We’ve designed a health care system which is really in some ways very sophisticated, and very unequal, but really fragile when it comes to access to power,” Schroeder says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x31Zze"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BV4E2E"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9aYM4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcVRLH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>European Union proposes roadmap for slashing greenhouse gas emissions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="European Union Unveils Landmark Climate Plan" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bY4h7gohhRCtwXLFEQ_iYvGGCoE=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581493/1233974542.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aR3LPZ"&gt;The European Union put out a sweeping set of proposals today that could drastically cut its greenhouse gas emissions if the plan ultimately becomes law. Internal combustion vehicles would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576994/european-union-gas-vehicle-ice-ban-2035-electric-cars"&gt;phased out by 2035&lt;/a&gt;, and it would rope industries like aviation and shipping, which were previously exempt from some EU climate policies, into compliance. The bloc also intends to influence polluters outside its borders by potentially making importers pay for their pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPPqKd"&gt;All in all, it’s a roadmap to achieving a goal that Europeans have been hashing out for years. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21019624/europes-green-deal-on-climate-change-failed-its-first-test"&gt;In 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, put forward a “Green Deal” to get the continent to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Reaching that target requires incremental progress. So last year, the EU said it would cut its greenhouse gas pollution by 55 percent by 2030, compared to pollution in 1990. (That’s why the EU is calling its new set of proposals “Fit for 55,” a name that’s elicited some &lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/horny-for-40-fit-for-55-eus-climate-plan-branding-raises-eyebrows/"&gt;teasing&lt;/a&gt; online.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="cp75sc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is the ultimate now or never moment.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BxlyqV"&gt;While that’s ambitious, it’s the kind of action that’s needed to meet the scale of the climate crisis. Planet-heating emissions globally need to drop in half this decade and ultimately reach close to zero by the middle of the century, &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;climate scientists have found&lt;/a&gt;. That would spare us some of the worst effects of climate change by meeting one of the targets of the landmark Paris agreement, which is to limit global warming to roughly 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Humans have already pushed global average temperatures to 1.1 degrees of warming, triggering more extreme weather, coastal flooding, and species loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lsl5aX"&gt;“This is the ultimate now or never moment,” European Commissioner for Economy, Paolo Gentiloni Silveri, said in a &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3541"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “With every passing year the terrible reality of climate change becomes more apparent: today we confirm our determination to act before it is really too late.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTd5SN"&gt;Perhaps the biggest change that EU residents will feel is in transportation, which accounts for 22 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in the bloc. The commission proposed ratcheting up emissions standards for new cars and vans. Under the existing proposal, they would need to slash their pollution by 55 percent in 2030 and 100 percent in 2035. That will ultimately take new gas-powered cars off the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ryA1Hv"&gt;Fuel used for shipping, aviation, and heating buildings would also change under the plan. One of the biggest tools the EU has for regulating pollution is its Emissions Trading System (ETS). That places a cap on how much pollution certain industries are allowed to produce and sets a price on carbon. Aviation used to get free emissions allowances, but the commission now wants them to fully pay for their carbon like other industries. Shipping would be regulated under the Emissions Trading System under the new plan, and a similar but separate system would be created for road transport and buildings. That would incentivize each sector to increase energy efficiency and more hastily turn to cleaner fuels.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T59iN6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tougher environmental standards for industries globally&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9PnHzE"&gt;The EU doesn’t want its carbon price to disadvantage European businesses or encourage more polluting abroad. So it also proposed putting a carbon price or tax on imports for products like steel and cement that have large carbon footprints. This provision could cause a kerfuffle with the World Trade Organization, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/world/europe/climate-change-carbon-green-new-deal.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. But the measure aims to encourage tougher environmental standards for industries globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zuJPMI"&gt;Renewable energy will need to replace most fossil fuels if the EU is to reach its climate ambitions. The commission now envisions that renewables will make up 40 percent of the bloc’s overall energy production by 2030. Renewable energy, including solar and wind, made up just over 15 percent of the EU’s &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/infographs/energy/bloc-2a.html"&gt;energy mix&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXX7Ve"&gt;Beyond slashing greenhouse gas emissions generated by people, the EU also wants to get better at drawing them down through natural carbon sinks like forests. It wants to plant 3 billion trees across the continent by 2030. Conserving forests and other ecosystems is important for plants, people, and animals. But repairing the climate by planting new trees has been a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign"&gt;tricky, controversial enterprise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0dC53"&gt;That makes the EU’s other proposed schemes for reducing pollution the most important priorities for the roadmap. But the plan won’t materialize right away. It could take a couple of years just for the proposals to be approved by the European Parliament and member states.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcMF2w"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bFCXc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s rollable OLED TV is finally coming to the US for a staggering $100,000</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ZMj2BPZ9XNcv2YyQ_8EZJpQWxE=/15x0:794x519/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581247/LGR2.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="djPmP4"&gt;LG’s futuristic rollable OLED 4K TV is coming to the US for an eye-popping price of $100,000. First introduced as a stunning prototype at CES 2018 (and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18171013/lg-rollable-tv-oled-4k-tv-features-photos-video-release-ces-2019"&gt;turned into a real product&lt;/a&gt; the next year), the 65-inch set can roll itself up and then back down to fully disappear into its housing unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQi67S"&gt;That cabinet also contains a front-firing Dolby Atmos sound system. The OLED R has a middle mode between being fully unfurled and rolled down. LG calls this Line View, and you can use it to display a clock, photos, music controls, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VlgKH07tBx51aEoBWMjncUrJcpA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13673293/backspedup.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is what the back of the OLED R looks like when rolling down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nNvg2F"&gt;From a picture quality perspective, the OLED R has technically already been surpassed by newer LG models; the more traditional G1 series introduced earlier this year can get brighter than any of the company’s prior OLEDs, including the rollable. But the OLED R’s panel still checks all of the boxes you’d want from a modern TV: it’s got Dolby Vision, 120Hz 4K gaming, variable refresh rate, auto low latency mode, and more. And as I’d damn well hope for $100,000, all four of its HDMI ports are HDMI 2.1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbMjkq"&gt;But if you’re shelling out this kind of money for a television, you’re in it for the rolling trick more than anything else. The OLED R is rated for 50,000 unfurls, which should give you many years to blow the minds of everyone visiting whichever of your mansions you put it in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6SbJU"&gt;LG says preorders will open for the OLED R in August, but I’m already seeing an “add to cart” button &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Ftvs%2Flg-oled65r1pua-signature-oled-4k-tv&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F14%2F22577063%2Flg-oled-r-rollable-tv-us-pricing-features-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on the company’s store&lt;/a&gt;. For the absurdly rich out there, it’s got to be a tough call between this and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166062/samsung-110-inch-microled-4k-tv-announced-features"&gt;Samsung’s 110-inch MicroLED TV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Teenage Engineering’s OP-1 finally gets USB audio support a decade after it was released</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Auj3RgIqdnxUGmv555upqZeMW0=/1x0:4095x2729/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580989/6076a6c4f88c8300047961c1_original.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YEEjEm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/28/3270259/teenage-engineering-op-1-accessories-launch-profile"&gt;Teenage Engineering’s OP-1&lt;/a&gt; has one of the most iconic synthesizers around since it was first released over a decade ago, but the music-making machine is still getting new features: the company just announced its 243rd firmware update that adds USB audio support to the OP-1 for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VzU4P"&gt;The added feature turns the OP-1 into a full-fledged external audio unit. That means you can directly send audio from an OP-1 to DAW software like Ableton Live, Pro Tools, or Logic Pro on a PC or Mac or mobile versions of those applications on iOS and Android (like Garageband) without having to use any workarounds or hacks. Additionally, you’ll be able to sample and record on the OP-1 directly from a connected USB audio device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XuJsyL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Send audio right to Ableton, no tricks or workarounds required&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="THciGL"&gt;It’s a major addition to the device, which should help make it a lot more useful for creators looking to use their favorite software to put together new tracks and remixes using the OP-1.   Teenage Engineering says it was able to add the new functionality by applying the work it had done in developing a similar USB audio feature for its newer OP-Z synthesizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2opj77"&gt;The new firmware update (like the previous 242 ones) is free to all OP-1 owners, which is a nice touch to see for such a big update. Additionally, it’ll work on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; OP-1 units, no matter how old. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU proposes phasing out new internal combustion cars by 2035</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Exceeding the limit values for nitrogen dioxide in Germany" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_epzRPSLDXqa-wyPLdG2XcmN8XE=/128x0:2899x1847/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580985/1233240471.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michael Kappeler / picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4Sjai9"&gt;The European Union has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com./business/retail-consumer/eu-proposes-effective-ban-new-fossil-fuel-car-sales-2035-2021-07-14/"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; phasing out gas-powered internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035, part of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/world/europe/climate-change-carbon-green-new-deal.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;a sweeping new plan&lt;/a&gt; to drastically reduce carbon emissions on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oplpo4"&gt;If passed, the legislation would require a 55 percent cut in overall CO2 emissions from new vehicles by 2030 compared to current levels. As it stands, the EU only currently requires a 37.5 percent cut by 2030 — which is weaker than even the United States is targeting. By 2035, though, the EU proposes a 100 percent cut, effectively banning new gas and even hybrid cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCCagJ"&gt;The effective ban would be an effective tool for cleaning up air pollution, as passenger cars make up about 12 percent of the total CO2 emissions in the EU. It would also be a big boost to all-electric vehicles, and the companies that have committed the most money to developing them like Volkswagen, which says it wants &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/13/volkswagen-wants-half-of-its-vehicle-sales-to-be-electric-by-2030.html"&gt;half of its total vehicles sold in 2030&lt;/a&gt; to be fully electric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPSvOx"&gt;To support the switch to electric, the EU said Wednesday in its proposal that it wants member countries to install public charging stations no more than 60 kilometers (37.3 miles) apart on major roads by 2025. The EU ultimately expects 3.5 million new charging stations by 2030 and 16.3 million by 2050. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4dq42c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A big buildout of charging infrastructure is also part of the proposal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OVDdmq"&gt;The proposal, which was developed by the EU’s executive branch, must be approved by the entire 27-country bloc. Some countries have already announced similarly aggressive targets, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287284/ford-electric-vehicles-ev-europe-2030"&gt;handful of automakers&lt;/a&gt; have laid out a roadmap for phasing out new gas-powered vehicles on the continent as well. But there could be resistance. France, for instance, is currently targeting an internal combustion phase-out by 2040 and is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-12/france-pushes-back-against-eu-banning-combustion-cars-by-2035"&gt;looking for more wiggle room on hybrids&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0OTS7"&gt;Outside the EU, the United Kingdom has announced plans to ban the sale of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21572312/uk-ban-combustion-engine-vehicles-sale-electric-cars"&gt;new combustion engine cars by 2030&lt;/a&gt;, while California is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;looking to do the same by 2035&lt;/a&gt;. The EU’s regulations are particularly important, though, because it is home to many of the world’s biggest automakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoMgm7"&gt;At the federal level in the United States, President Joe Biden has started to unwind Trump-era decisions to weaken vehicle emissions standards. In April, he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404403/california-tailpipe-standards-epa-transportation-department"&gt;moved to restore California’s power to set its own standards&lt;/a&gt;, and later this year, his administration is expected to set &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/01/climate/biden-electric-cars-tailpipe-emissions.html"&gt;average fuel economy standards of 51 miles per gallon by 2026&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
