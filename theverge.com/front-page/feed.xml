    <title>YouTube has run the numbers to see how vloggers open their videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HjqD1R5jYjt_vZXO6oJ4NDaLwUk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69264132/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2b8UnS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/trends/articles/hey-guys/"&gt;YouTube has run the numbers&lt;/a&gt; and discovered what greeting its vloggers most use to open videos: “Hey, guys.” Those findings may not be surprising if you’ve watched a lot of YouTube, but the report actually shows a lot more, including what the runners-up are, how greetings have changed in popularity over time, and how video genre affects the most common openings. Let’s just jump into it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRxQVj"&gt;To get these findings, YouTube did quite a bit of data analysis, looking at the auto- and creator-generated captions from over a million videos. YouTube picked videos that had over 20,000 views from channels that had over 20,000 subscribers, so it is worth noting that the results are more reflective of how relatively popular videos open, rather than of every single video on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UTOOlBTlhg5z-ukWLhW8C8S7170=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504241/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.05.16_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The runners-up have changed over time, but “Hey, guys” has always been dominant. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dNiKuG"&gt;YouTube also breaks down how creators of different genres open their videos. For example, sports videos are way more likely to start with “What’s going on?” while travel videos start with a “Good morning” 9 percent of the time. “Hey, guys” comes in second for opening tech videos, with “Ladies and gentlemen” barely edging it out (though I do prefer &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/i09V6SkVkz8?t=46"&gt;Tom Scott’s&lt;/a&gt; “Ladies, gentlemen, and all in between”).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ErESGkQHEuG5rtKgeElr11hdpxg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504243/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.34.19_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There sure are some outliers here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KQuBeG"&gt;The article also takes a look at international greetings from Brazilian, French, German, and Mexican creators. Surprisingly, only one has a phrase in the top spot that translates to “Hey, guys,” making it seem like more of an English-speaking opening than a global one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Co16-ezXisx7CloZ_d9LidhJ_pE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504222/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.22.52_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Coucou tout le monde” is how I’m greeting everyone from now on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CBHviN"&gt;To play around with the interactive timeline of greetings for yourself (and get a look at some famous channel openings from the infamous “Hey VSauce, Michael here” to “What’s up, Greg?”), you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/trends/articles/hey-guys/"&gt;head over to YouTube’s article&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps it’ll do a breakdown of how people end their videos next so I can get a good idea of how I should be ending these blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>State attorneys general pressure Facebook to abandon plans for children’s Instagram</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ET5Q-lbn2IAyfCbW4-NKQg9HliI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69264000/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XMGgWR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20702192-naag-letter-to-facebook-on-ig-kids"&gt;In an open letter today&lt;/a&gt;, the National Association of Attorneys General called on Facebook to abandon plans for an Instagram platform focused on children under the age of 13. The letter is signed by 44 different state-level attorneys general (including non-states like Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands), representing a majority of US territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0WW96"&gt;“It appears that Facebook is not responding to a need, but instead creating one, as this platform appeals primarily to children who otherwise do not or would not have an Instagram account,” the letter reads. “The attorneys general urge Facebook to abandon its plans to launch this new platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o5bXMO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The attorneys general urge Facebook to abandon its plans”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TvUicq"&gt;Plans for the child-focused Instagram were &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-instagram-for-children-under-13"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News&lt;/em&gt; in March&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently confirmed by the company. But while internal emails reported by &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed&lt;/em&gt; identified the project as a company priority, Facebook insisted at the time that there was no specific timeline for release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWUcOm"&gt;While the letter has no formal legal power, it emphasizes the significant legal risk Facebook will face in undertaking the project. In the US, children under 13 are subject to enhanced legal protections under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (or COPPA), which places particularly stringent rules against data collection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFVU2E"&gt;Social networks have traditionally complied with the act by banning users under the age of 13, but it has not entirely protected them from regulatory action. Most recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963459/youtube-google-coppa-ftc-fine-settlement-youtubers-new-rules"&gt;Google agreed to pay $170 million&lt;/a&gt; after a Federal Trade Commission investigation about the company’s data collection from YouTube videos featuring children’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vp4N5k"&gt;State attorneys general have been particularly active in the enforcement of COPPA protections, so the NAAG letter carries with it an implicit legal threat: if Facebook proceeds with its plans for an Instagram for kids, these same attorneys general will be watching very closely for COPPA violations and will be eager to file suit over any violations they find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prhWfv"&gt;Reached for comment, Facebook said it would not sell ads on any Instagram app targeted at young children but did not back off on its interest in developing the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LTtfBm"&gt;“We’ve just started exploring a version of Instagram for kids,” said Facebook policy representative Andy Stone. “We agree that any experience we develop must prioritize their safety and privacy, and we will consult with experts in child development, child safety and mental health, and privacy advocates to inform it. We also look forward to working with legislators and regulators, including the nation’s attorneys general. In addition, we commit today to not showing ads in any Instagram experience we develop for people under the age of 13.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bird is reportedly taking its electric scooter company public via SPAC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V8hOL9zo0YMpah5ab9ZRNaKGxPo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69263773/vpavic_190730_3572_0055.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bs57Pj"&gt;Bird, the electric scooter company that helped launch the global micromobility boom, is planning to go public via a reverse merger with a special acquisition company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;or SPAC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://dot.la/bird-ipo-2652932971.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;dot.LA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Bird is merging with &lt;a href="https://swbk2.com/"&gt;Switchback II Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, a Dallas-based “blank check” company focusing on companies reducing carbon emissions, according to documents reviewed by the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Y3I2h"&gt;Bird is the latest transportation company, but one of only a few e-scooter companies, to go public. A record number of companies have gone public this past year by merging with SPAC shell corporations, which avoids the scrutiny of a traditional IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s9pVxG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bird is the latest transportation company, but one of only a few e-scooter companies, to go public&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x5yNeC"&gt;Reports first surfaced last November of Bird’s SPAC ambitions, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-16/scooter-startup-bird-is-said-to-discuss-going-public-via-spac?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;after &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the Santa Monica-based company was working with Credit Suisse to find a potential partner. Spokespersons for Bird and Switchback II Corporation did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PcfRbP"&gt;The deal will net Bird hundreds of millions of dollars in cash, which it can use to fund its operations as it continues to chase profitability. Scooter sharing is a cash intensive business, with companies routinely spending more on each scooter than they take in with revenue. Very few companies operating scooter fleets have succeeded in turning a profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9LqFX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;dot.LA&lt;/em&gt;, which&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has gotten a look at the pitch deck, has more details about the transaction: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Vspn85"&gt;The transaction values Bird at $2.3 billion, below the $2.85 billion valuation it reached in the beginning of 2020. But that was before the pandemic, which drove 2020 revenue down to $95 million, a 37 percent decline from 2019, according to a deck pitching the deal seen by dot.LA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OdOyeb"&gt;Bird first launched its scooter sharing service in Santa Monica in September 2017. Since then, it has grown to over 100 cities, facilitated over 10 million rides, and raised cash at an unprecedented pace. It has the distinction of being the fastest startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/1/17634330/bird-electric-scooter-sharing-paris-tel-aviv"&gt;to achieve a $2 billion valuation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8upTWB"&gt;But the pandemic has taken a serious toll on the company. Bird saw its ridership numbers plummet at the onset of the lockdown last spring. Last March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231802/bird-electric-scooter-company-workplace-culture-layoffs"&gt;the company laid off over 400 employees&lt;/a&gt; in a now infamous Zoom call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e4Rbco"&gt;&lt;q&gt;But as lockdowns ease and customers return to scooter sharing, Bird’s woes continue&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1O8Hi7"&gt;But as lockdowns ease and customers return to scooter sharing, Bird’s woes continue. The company was snubbed by a number of major cities issuing permits to scooter operators, including Chicago, Paris, and San Francisco. Bird was recently selected to participate in New York City’s inaugural scooter program — a decision that may have helped buoy the company’s long-term financial prospects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhZWav"&gt;Bird has grown increasingly reliant on revenue from its franchising program, in which the company sells its older scooters to small operators and takes a cut of each ride. The program, which is called Bird Platform, has led some operators to fall into deep debt, &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/bird-is-quietly-luring-contract-workers-into-debt-through-a-new-scooter-scheme-3fa34fb4a0f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last year. The company has since launched Bird Platform in countries like Switzerland and Estonia, cheering investors who hope it will lower Bird’s labor and capital expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYb8iV"&gt;In January, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.theinformation.com/articles/after-tough-year-spacs-tempt-bird-lime&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332624/bird-europe-investment-scooter-expansion-new-hires&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22096665__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Bird was nearing a deal to raise more than $100 million in convertible debt from some of its existing investors. The debt, which could eventually be converted into stock, would help Bird avoid selling shares at a lower price than in earlier fundraising rounds. But the company has yet to disclose whether that deal has gone through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqjpFF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford’s first electric pickup truck will be called the F-150 Lightning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B1Pf-X-mdmwpESiTQASXD6ctr5A=/590x0:6961x4247/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69263580/Lightning_16x9.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aQ4WAd"&gt;Ford announced the name of its upcoming electric pickup truck: the F-150 Lightning. The new electric vehicle is set to debut on May 19th at an event held at the automaker’s Dearborn, Michigan, headquarters. It will also be live-streamed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ueQFDS"&gt;The Ford F-150 has been the bestselling truck (and vehicle) in the US for more than 40 years, so its imminent electrification is a big deal. As such, Ford is treating the reveal as a major event, with dozens of ways to tune in across multiple platforms. The company is also hosting 18 in-person events around the country, including in Times Square and Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jqozj"&gt;The Lightning branding had &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a36302400/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-name/"&gt;leaked prior to today’s announcement&lt;/a&gt;, and as &lt;em&gt;Car &amp;amp; Driver &lt;/em&gt;noted, it’s a somewhat familiar name for Ford, having appeared on &lt;a href="https://performance.ford.com/enthusiasts/collector-vehicles/svt/f-150-lightning/1993.html"&gt;the automaker’s SVT F-150 street trucks from the early 1990s&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bs2cLD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a somewhat familiar name for Ford&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zzCa7U"&gt;But while we’re set to get a closer look at the truck in the weeks to come, the F-150 Lightning won’t actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21288000/ford-electric-f-150-2022-sale-launch-jim-farley"&gt;go on sale until 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21441276/ford-electric-f150-truck-factory-break-ground-michigan"&gt;Ford recently broke ground&lt;/a&gt; on a new $700 million manufacturing plant in Michigan where the F-150 Lightning’s production line will be built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyoB4X"&gt;Ford has let a few details about the F-150 Lightning slip, including dual-motor configurations, mobile power generation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383460/ford-bluecruise-hands-free-adas-f150-mustang-mache"&gt;“hands-free” driver assist options&lt;/a&gt;, and over-the-air software updates. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303479/ford-2021-f-150-active-drive-assist-hybrid-specs-features-photos"&gt;2021 F-150 PowerBoost&lt;/a&gt; is the company’s first plug-in hybrid version of the popular F series, with an EPA-estimated rating of 25 mpg on the 4x2 models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuZtjl"&gt;Like all automakers, Ford is currently engaged in a costly project to boost its high-tech offerings, including EVs, partial and fully autonomous vehicles, connected-car services, and shared vehicles like electric scooters. The company has said it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22267195/ford-electric-autonomous-investment-29-billion"&gt;spend $22 billion&lt;/a&gt; to produce over a dozen electrified models (including EVs and gas-electric hybrids) by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YA0Gll"&gt;The electric and hybrid F-150s are just one piece of Ford’s push into electric vehicles. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265570/mustang-mach-e-review-electric-ford-ev-photos-video"&gt;Mustang Mach-E electric SUV&lt;/a&gt; is currently being delivered to the first customers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373903/mustang-mach-e-deep-sleep-12v-battery-jump-start"&gt;despite some early delays&lt;/a&gt;. Ford has also invested more than $500 million into electric truck startup Rivian and is working with the company on an electric vehicle for Lincoln. And the company has also entered into a partnership with Volkswagen that will see the US automaker &lt;a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/ford-promises-highly-differentiated-meb-based-model"&gt;use the German giant’s battery tech in an electric car slated for the European market in 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCfSgz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A classic point-and-click adventure game mashed with a Hollywood movie&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="b2DGWy"&gt;Luis Antonio has been thinking about time loops for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FCaow"&gt;In 2006, when he was working as an artist at Rockstar Games, the studio was soliciting pitches from staff for a new game idea. “I thought, ‘Let’s do a time loop game,’” he explains. “I was thinking something Hitchcock, like &lt;em&gt;The Birds&lt;/em&gt;.” The studio didn’t take much interest. “They didn’t even look at it.” The same thing happened a few years later when he was working at Ubisoft. But he kept thinking about it. He tried to get some friends to work on the concept with him, but nobody wanted to give up their free time. “I gave up on the idea,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f4Q4JK"&gt;Years later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/26/10828070/the-witness-jonathan-blow-thekla-interview-ps4-pc"&gt;when Antonio was working as an artist on &lt;em&gt;The Witness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was developed by a much smaller indie team, he noticed that everyone around him seemed to be working on a side project. They would squeeze in some time with their personal creation while on lunch or after work. So he decided to learn how to program and pick up the concept again. “If I want this idea to be explored to its full potential, it makes sense that I actually do it myself,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPA1ZQ"&gt;That side project has gone on to become a big production called &lt;em&gt;12 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;. Antonio is now working with a small team and has partnered with publisher Annapurna Interactive, with a voice cast featuring stars Daisy Ridley, Willem Dafoe, and James McAvoy. &lt;em&gt;12 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; is a tense thriller that has players reliving the same period of time over and over again — the titular 12 minutes — as they try to uncover a startling mystery. “It grew into a more refined and nuanced experience,” Antonio says of the long road from side project to full commercial release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ZD3a74MNlTDWFs2-ving85Tsfo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22503940/TwelveMinutes_Screenshot_01.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dqGXS8"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;12 Minutes,&lt;/em&gt; you play as a husband, voiced by McAvoy, who comes home from a long day to what should be a romantic evening with his wife, played by Ridley. They live in a tiny apartment, and just as they’re about to sit down and enjoy dessert, a man claiming to be a cop (played by Dafoe) bursts through the door and accuses the woman of murder. When the man interferes, the supposed cop chokes him — but instead of dying, the man goes back in time to the beginning of the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tUnou"&gt;At least, that’s how things went for me the first time I played. &lt;em&gt;12 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; is a game about experiencing the same period of time repeatedly, choosing different actions each time to hopefully learn new information. During my second loop, I knew Dafoe’s character would tie up my wrists, for instance, so before he arrived, I grabbed a knife to cut myself free. (I still ended up dying.) There are lots of little elements like this tucked away; Antonio describes &lt;em&gt;12 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; as a game about “accumulated knowledge.” The more you play, the more you understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wbyif4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“By removing possibilities, the experience becomes a lot more pleasant.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NBB6ZX"&gt;Despite the star power behind the game, &lt;em&gt;12 Minutes &lt;/em&gt;still largely sticks to its indie roots. It’s a tight, compact experience. The apartment is small, as is the list of actions at your disposal at any given moment. You view the world from a top-down perspective, which was originally a practical choice — it made movement simpler for a first-time programmer — but ended up giving the game a distinct look. You never actually see the characters’ faces, so the game relies on animation and dialogue to convey meaning and emotion. It plays a bit like an old-school point-and-click adventure game mashed with a cinematic thriller — and that’s by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nc3ll7"&gt;Antonio says he loves classic LucasArts adventure games but also finds the genre frustrating at times. “Point-and-click games have this ambiguity,” he says. “There’s a window, but you don’t know if you can open it or not. Suddenly, you can open it because you dragged this thing over. There’s this frustration that comes out of the way they were designed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrYjMu"&gt;That’s something he wanted to change with &lt;em&gt;12 Minutes.&lt;/em&gt; “How can I make a very tight vocabulary where, the moment you get into the apartment, there are no questions about what you can use and what you cannot use? If you have a glass of water and you have a sink, I don’t have to tell you what’s going to happen if you drag the glass to the sink. All of the elements you can use are very clear. After one loop, you know everything you have for the rest of the game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUgKFK"&gt;The small space of the apartment, and the relatively limited number of items in it, are designed to make the experience clearer and more intuitive. Designing &lt;em&gt;12 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; became a process of removing things — objects, interactions, etc. — in order to make everything easier to immediately understand. “The more open it is, the more frustrating it is,” says Antonio. “By removing possibilities, the experience becomes a lot more pleasant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nwmSuWNgVswYG0k1B1ZeiylcI-A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22503941/TwelveMinutes_Screenshot_05.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BvW1A7"&gt;One example is the time element. Despite how important it is, it’s not exactly front and center; you won’t see a timer counting down 12 minutes. But after a few loops, you can get a sense of how much time has passed. Maybe you’ll remember the sound of a car outside that drives by a few minutes in or notice as the sun starts to set. It’s subtle, but that wasn’t always the case. “Early on, there were clocks everywhere,” says Antonio. “You could look at a phone to see the time, there was a clock on the wall. But I realized that if you do four or five loops, you get a feel for when things will happen.” This also had the side benefit of further immersing players in the time loop, forcing them to pay closer attention to small details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDdWHE"&gt;The same goes for the loop itself. In &lt;em&gt;12 Minutes,&lt;/em&gt; you die repeatedly, but because it happens so quickly, it’s not particularly frustrating. You have enough time to make some progress, but if you make a mistake, you don’t have to wait long to try again. “Imagine the loop is five hours, and by hour four and a half, you make a mistake and want to try everything again,” says Antonio. “Here, nothing is further away than a couple of minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9vMet4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Willem didn’t want to be in a room saying lines to a wall.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RObSie"&gt;And while one of the big selling points of the game is its star-studded cast, originally, voice acting wasn’t even part of the plan. It wasn’t until Antonio partnered with publisher Annapurna, which has plenty of connections on the film side, that it became a possibility. He was able to direct the actors remotely; McAvoy and Ridley were on a soundstage in London, while Dafoe zoomed in from Berlin. Often in games, voice actors record their lines independently, but that wouldn’t really work for &lt;em&gt;12 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;, where the interactions between characters are so vital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DAnef4"&gt;“When an actor says a line, the way he says a line will decide how the other one replies,” Antonio explains. “They would bounce a lot off each other, and the whole conversation could have a completely different texture. After four or five sessions, they were comfortable with the material.” Plus, he adds, “Willem didn’t want to be in a room saying lines to a wall.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="UpBfWk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;12 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; is listed as “coming soon,” and it’ll be available on PC and the Xbox One and Series X when it does launch. For Antonio, it was a chance not just to create his own game, but also merge two things he loves — adventure games and film — in an approachable way. It required patience, years of refinement, and lots of evenings and weekends spent teaching himself to code. “I didn’t know it would be this complicated,” says Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leak of Sony’s upcoming 1000XM4 earbuds reveals all-new design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ioV9w5Iz7yP5BtZkCL15FDDsKq0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69263399/cwelch_190702_3528_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XScrzv"&gt;Sony is nearing the release of its next set of noise-canceling true wireless earbuds, according to a post at &lt;a href="https://thewalkmanblog.blogspot.com/2021/05/sony-wf-1000xm4-full-design-leaked.html?m=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Walkman Blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There are images of the WF-1000XM4 from pretty much every angle, and they line up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295503/sony-wireless-earbud-wf-1000xm4-possible-leak"&gt;an initial leak back in February&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikfFRE"&gt;The new design differs quite substantially from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features"&gt;the aging 1000XM3s&lt;/a&gt;. Sony has seemingly downsized these earbuds quite a bit; they no longer have the flattened pill shape and are thus closer in line with competitors like the Galaxy Buds Pro, Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2, and other earbuds with a round outer design. Sony has moved its logo to the side, so the branding won’t be so obvious this time around. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2qfJ8H2xQ18qNiBgXoeTqYP9Rvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22503955/wf1000xm4_leak_02.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony has made some major design changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="60DsAv"&gt;The company is sticking with its signature black and copper / rose gold aesthetic. These earbuds are mostly black, but there are accents around the external mics used for noise cancellation. Sony has also revamped the charging case, which will apparently support wireless charging — something offered by many premium earbuds released after the 1000XM3s. The case might charge faster when plugged in as well since the charging output has been increased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVnRpk"&gt;Based on Sony’s Federal Communications Commission confidentiality requests, &lt;em&gt;The Walkman Blog &lt;/em&gt;suspects the WF-1000XM4 earbuds could be officially announced as soon as next month. Will they have water and sweat resistance this time? That was a significant omission on the previous model. What about LDAC support? Hopefully we’ll know all the details in just a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Welcome to Infrastructure Week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N9MqNKcOtWP3F4au5YpxaLyUDLc=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69262797/VRG_ILLO_4528_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LK0waq"&gt;For years, “infrastructure week” was a kind of running joke in Washington — a stand-in for all of the boring but popular rebuilding work that could happen if Donald Trump ever decided to get serious. Under Joe Biden, this idea has become something more tangible: the trillion-dollar American Jobs Plan, which lays out investments in everything from bridges to broadband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMdP0L"&gt;But while Congress grinds away on the details, we still want to think bigger. The pandemic showed just how shaky America’s foundation really is, whether it’s having enough hospital beds to survive a pandemic or having a connection fast enough to support a Zoom call. Fixing our infrastructure means looking at all of that — even the stuff like power grids and credit systems that only get noticed when they break. It also means building out infrastructure for the next generation of technology, whether it’s satellite internet uplinks or a nationwide EV charging network. If we’re going to live in the future, we need to take a close look at the infrastructure we’ll need to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jTys0C"&gt;So starting today, we’re doing just that. All week, we’ll be running down the hidden structures that make our world work — in interviews, on video, and even in a live event focusing on how we can build a better internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzvizH"&gt;Welcome to Infrastructure Week. It’s been a long time coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fa0OwN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="yAJAHo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Venom: Let There Be Carnage, &lt;/em&gt;the extremely on-the-nose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/2/17929154/venom-movie-review-tom-hardy-marvel"&gt;sequel to 2018’s &lt;em&gt;Venom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has gotten its first trailer ahead of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21235283/spider-man-spiderverse-homecoming-delay-release-date-trilogy-marvel-venom-doctor-strange-thor"&gt;pandemic-delayed&lt;/a&gt; September 24th release date. It promises more of the peculiar buddy cop comedy and Tom Hardy’s over-the-top acting that made the original a surprisingly fun watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzC9fa"&gt;Picking up after the last movie, the trailer shows that Eddie Brock and the Venom symbiote have achieved a sort of domestic peace: a “no eating people” sign is tacked up on the wall of Brock’s apartment, and Venom helps Eddie make breakfast in what might be the worst &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; impression of all time. He’s trying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J8viW4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No eating people”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nkPRyF"&gt;Things shift focus to Cletus Kasady, a murderous serial killer (Woody Harrelson, doing his best &lt;em&gt;Dark Knight&lt;/em&gt; Joker impression) who gets a hold of his own symbiote, the titular Carnage, setting up the movie’s headline brawl. (Presumably, the film will have some sort of explanation for why on earth Kasady is being selected, of all people, to be the test subject for an incredibly powerful alien symbiote.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcH4qb"&gt;Despite the almost-exclusive focus on Spider-Man villains in the trailer, there’s still no sign of the heroic web-slinger himself (whether played by Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire, or any of the &lt;em&gt;Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt; crew). That’s presumably due to the intricate corporate negotiations around the character’s appearance in Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. (&lt;em&gt;Venom&lt;/em&gt; and its sequel are made by Sony, not Kevin Feige’s Marvel Studios, which produces the Holland &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; films and almost every other major live-action Marvel film these days.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hb6hhu"&gt;Also of note: the trailer prominently focuses on the fact that &lt;em&gt;Venom: Let There Be Carnage&lt;/em&gt; will debut exclusively in theaters. With vaccines rolling out and theaters starting to reopen, it seems that Sony is betting heavily on the fact that crowds will be ready to come out in person to see the movie on September 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FdV2GA"&gt;Best Buy has an attractive deal on Razer gaming gear, including headsets, keyboards, mice, and mouse pads. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740160956824871654#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;If you buy any two listed on the site&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll get 20 percent off the total at checkout. But if you get three, you’ll get 25 percent off the total. This deal seems especially great if you just got a gaming PC and are looking to get set up with all of the peripherals you need. For around $50, you can get the BlackShark V2 wired headset, the excellent Viper ambidextrous mouse, or the DeathAdder V2 wired gaming mouse. Near the $100 level, you’ll be opened up to deals on wireless gaming mice, keyboards, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8KFhLo"&gt;
&lt;p id="gMMfWX"&gt;Digital storefront Eneba is selling copies of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22420738/resident-evil-village-review-playstation-xbox-pc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for PC (redeemable on Steam) &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fsteam-resident-evil-village-resident-evil-8-steam-key-global%2Fgames-federation&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22428452%2Frazer-pc-gaming-sale-mouse-keyboard-headset-re-village-apple-watch-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for around $43&lt;/a&gt; when you use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;REVILLAGE &lt;/strong&gt;(per &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15014047-resident-evil-village-pc-digital-download-code-45-45?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+SlickdealsnetFP+%28Slickdeals+Frontpage%29" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This game just came out last week, and it regularly costs $60 for a new copy. &lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;’ page says this deal has expired, but the offer code still worked at the time of publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gyY2df"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10492101"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lVH1SD"&gt;I’m resurfacing a good deal from last week on the Apple Watch SE that’s still happening at B&amp;amp;H Photo. You can get the Nike edition of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594568-REG%2Fapple_myyu2ll_a_watch_nike_se_gps.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22428452%2Frazer-pc-gaming-sale-mouse-keyboard-headset-re-village-apple-watch-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;40mm Watch with GPS and LTE connectivity for $289&lt;/a&gt;. This configuration usually costs $329, so you’re getting a decent discount. Considering this is just $10 more than the GPS model, it’s a no-brainer of an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dd4m7o"&gt;Even as the Series 6 drops in price (we saw the all-red 40mm GPS model selling for $250 a few weeks ago), this is still a good deal because of the cellular connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u8ZbMf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="imZZYO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dZGQoR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
