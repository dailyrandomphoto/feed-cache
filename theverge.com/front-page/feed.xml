    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Looking back at a decade without Jobs — Apple’s biggest decade ever&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1KA34Z"&gt;On August 24th, 2011 — ten years ago today — Apple co-founder Steve Jobs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/8/25/2383755/steve-jobs-resigns-as-apple-ceo-replaced-by-tim-cook-jobs-takes"&gt;resigned as CEO&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the world’s &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-brand/apple-usurps-google-as-worlds-most-valuable-brand-idUSTRE74800D20110509"&gt;newly minted&lt;/a&gt; most valuable brand in the hands of his successor Tim Cook. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/8/25/2383755/steve-jobs-resigns-as-apple-ceo-replaced-by-tim-cook-jobs-takes"&gt;Just six weeks later&lt;/a&gt;, Jobs died. Needless to say, Cook had some big shoes to fill: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/08/25/steve-jobs-apples-ceo-retrospective-products"&gt;Jobs is remembered&lt;/a&gt; as the visionary CEO and marketer behind the Mac, iPhone, iPad, iPod, iTunes, and the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="444Mz3"&gt;A decade later, what has Tim Cook built?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OOOyqG"&gt;The most valuable and profitable company in the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uREFDS"&gt;Apple is bigger than oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fX5KWq"&gt;A company that turns a web of complex components into sophisticated computing devices now makes more money than those that effectively pump barrels of cash out of the ground. And it’s because Tim Cook meticulously crafted the overseas supply chains to make it so, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/29/2910338/tim-cook-china-foxconn-zhengzhou-factory-visit"&gt;contracting manufacturers like Foxconn&lt;/a&gt; which employ hundreds of thousands of Chinese laborers for Apple’s production lines, and delivering a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/28/apple-price-hikes-and-services-growth-produced-a-42point5percent-gross-margin.html#:~:text=Apple's%2038%25%20gross%20margin%20was,certain%20as%20death%20and%20taxes.&amp;amp;text=In%20its%20quarterly%20earnings%20report,%2C%20the%20figure%20was%2040%25."&gt;remarkably steady gross margin&lt;/a&gt; for years. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/09/apple-pips-exxon-as-worlds-biggest-company"&gt;In August 2011&lt;/a&gt;, shortly before Jobs stepped down, Apple had already briefly passed Exxon to become the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, on the back of Tim Cook’s efforts as COO and interim CEO. Even in 2019, when Saudi Arabia opened up state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco for trading, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21350154/apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-saudi-aramco"&gt;it didn’t dominate for long&lt;/a&gt;: Apple surpassed it last July on its way to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375223/apple-2-trillion-market-cap-first-us-company-stock-price"&gt;$2 trillion market cap&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple is approaching $2.5 trillion now. It’s more profitable than Saudi Aramco, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bwuafe"&gt;By any metric imaginable, Tim Cook has grown Apple into a behemoth over the past decade. Revenues reached a record $111 billion this holiday season, &lt;em&gt;quadruple&lt;/em&gt; what the company saw the same quarter in 2011. Profits more than quadrupled from $6B in Q1 2011 to $28.8B in Q1 2021. The company holds nearly $200 billion in cash, more than double &lt;a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Latest-News-Wires/2011/0729/Apple-cash-on-hand-76-billion.-US-Treasury-74-billion"&gt;the already-staggering $76 billion&lt;/a&gt; it had in 2011, and Apple has more than doubled in size with 147,000 full-time employees — compared to 60,400 the year Jobs stepped down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVt7jh"&gt;As of June 2021, Apple now makes an average of $10,000 &lt;em&gt;every second&lt;/em&gt;, $3,600 of which is pure profit. How long ago did you start reading this story? Chances are Apple grossed half a million dollars by the time you finish this sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9wCXJ1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="es" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple first quarter revenue:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Q1 2021: $111.4 billion &lt;br&gt;Q1 2020 $91.8 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2019 $84.3 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2018 $88.3 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2017  $78.4 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2016  $75.3 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2015  $74.6 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2014  $57.6 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2013 $54.5 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2012 $46.3 billion&lt;br&gt;Q1 2011  $26.7 billion&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Erlichman (@JonErlichman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JonErlichman/status/1354544947127603201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lQBNui"&gt;All of these numbers reflect how Cook’s Apple relentlessly pumped out premium products that consumers were eager to buy, steadily improving them year by year, at a pace Jobs’ Apple never did. Between 2013 and 2018, Apple sold more iPhones &lt;em&gt;every single year&lt;/em&gt; than it did during the five years Jobs was in charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbqS8w"&gt;For some, the dollar signs alone are proof Cook has been a complete success. If you spent $1,000 on Apple stock the week Steve Jobs stepped down, it’d be worth nearly $11,000 today, not including dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kr24C0"&gt;But measuring Apple by financial performance alone is only half the story. If you were hoping Cook would be a Jobs-esque product visionary, you probably haven’t been quite as impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FdasIY"&gt;Hardware swings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OQzIu9"&gt;As the venerable tech journalist Walt Mossberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21026112/apple-tim-cook-iphone-watch-tv-decade-blockbusters-walt-mossberg"&gt;wrote for us two years ago&lt;/a&gt;, Tim Cook’s Apple has yet to produce a truly game-changing hardware product — nothing on the scale of the iPhone, iPad, or Mac. The biggest new Apple products under Tim Cook are either iPhone accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods, or products his Apple delivered because they were what customers were asking for — like iPhones with larger screens. “Steve was pretty adamant that big phones aren’t something we’re going to do,” says tech analyst and former Apple marketing director Michael Gartenberg, noting it was part of the discussion around the iPhone 6 Plus launch in 2014. “Tim said consumers want it, we’ve got the capability to do it, so we’re going to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOzDOB"&gt;But there have also been some surprisingly public failures, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;the unceremoniously canceled AirPower charging pad&lt;/a&gt;, the difficult-to-upgrade Mac Pro that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/6/22520378/apple-wwdc-2021-developer-insult-macbook-pro"&gt;Apple admitted&lt;/a&gt; was a mistake, and most of all, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;the shameful five-year saga&lt;/a&gt; where Apple’s flagship MacBook laptops had keyboards that just couldn’t be trusted not to break. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple iPhone 6 Plus" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QTJTeQw4Q7EadQ6r8cmLsXtGOcI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/797122/DSCF1788-2040.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 6 Plus came with a 5.5-inch screen, compared to 4- and 3.5-inch screens on previous devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new Macbook with Retina Display hands-on photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1nqAefnJebZoae2_Ubp7h-PASKo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3486508/DSC06543.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s dust-intolerant butterfly keyboards were first introduced in its 12-inch MacBook in 2015.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s8cNuR"&gt;And whether he was chasing Steve Jobs’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2012/7/12/3151491/fighting-words-apple-post-pc-microsoft-pc-plus"&gt;notion of a post-PC world&lt;/a&gt; or attacking it on his own terms, Cook’s Apple spent years focused on the iPad at the expense of the Mac, only to discover it was alienating some of its most important fans: the Apple developers it relied on to create iPhone and iPad apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyYyUd"&gt;(It’s particularly egregious when you consider that 2013 Mac Pro and 2016 MacBook Pro were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/10/4412350/apple-new-mac-pro-wwdc-2013"&gt;supposed to be Apple’s &lt;em&gt;answers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the idea it’d abandoned Mac power users.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9FFBW"&gt;The Apple Watch is now a hit product in a category of one, as Google and others continue flailing to compete. But part of the Apple Watch’s success is simply how expectations lower over time. When it was announced in late 2014 as Cook’s first big new product, it &lt;a href="http://watch-apples-most-personal-device-ever/"&gt;was explicitly introduced&lt;/a&gt; as a product innovation on par with the Mac, iPod, and iPhone, with its digital crown touted as “Apple’s most revolutionary navigation tool since the iPod Click Wheel and iPhone Multi-Touch.” The pitch was that it could change your life by changing your health — and that it was a luxury product, too, with an 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition variant starting at $10,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NOoMk"&gt;But Apple had to reboot the entire Watch interface and ditch the ultra-luxury versions before finally finding its footing with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;the Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. Even now, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496813/apple-watch-heart-monitor-ekg-false-positive"&gt;not a lot of evidence&lt;/a&gt; it’s meaningfully improving people’s health, aside from the occasional &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-watch-lifesaving-health-features-read-5-peoples-stories/"&gt;anecdotal reports&lt;/a&gt; about people whose watches detected a fall or a heart rate spike in time to save their life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yRXji-2nkZoIEDyK5zfqVvBP0po=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7680355/akrales_161216_1332_A_0128_v1.0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple AirPods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TjrwlP"&gt;Apple’s AirPods, its second big wearable product under Cook, are also a smash hit. But in many ways, AirPods are symbolic of the entire Cook era, where a seemingly obvious idea, executed at scale and tied tightly to the iPhone, becomes not only a business but also a cultural success. “It’s that process, that continued refinement of Apple, that has been Tim Cook’s genius,” says Gartenberg, pointing out how Cook’s Apple did the seemingly impossible by transitioning the Mac away from Intel processors practically overnight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVZCZd"&gt;While it’s too early to tell, the M1 chip may go down as one of Cook’s biggest swings: his Apple channeled the company’s relentless efforts to improve its Arm-based iPhone processors year after year after year into a new M1 laptop chip that blew away the skeptics, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;upending our entire concept of laptop performance overnight&lt;/a&gt;. Jobs may have bought P.A. Semi in 2008 to reduce the company’s reliance on partners to power the iPhone, but by 2011 Apple hadn’t yet introduced its own CPU cores inside an Apple A-series chip, much less its own graphics. Cook’s Apple made it happen, and Cook took a victory lap this April &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/20/22394756/apple-tim-cook-mission-impossible-heist-action-movie-stunt-lasers"&gt;by adding the new M1 chip into the iPad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3arxXhPSmHQTGpoozfYbnBaHBXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458386/tim_cook_spy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tim Cook smiles in a Mission: Impossible-esque marketing video where he infiltrates Apple to plant an M1 chip in the iPad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VckANs"&gt;Still, both the AirPods and Watch have fundamentally been accessories for the iPhone, not new computing platforms in their own right: standalone Watch apps have not become a booming market. Cook’s biggest promises have mostly yet to pan out: he spent a year after Jobs’ death talking about Apple’s TV efforts, only to totally start over with the Apple TV Plus streaming service. He’s repeatedly said Apple’s greatest contribution to the world &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/08/tim-cook-teases-new-apple-services-tied-to-health-care.html"&gt;would be in health&lt;/a&gt;, with the Watch and the Peloton-like Fitness Plus platform the small beginnings of that effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mPH0j"&gt;And while Cook has teased for half a decade that augmented reality might become a new platform — calling it “a big idea like the smartphone,” “profound,” and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview"&gt;“critically important” to Apple’s future&lt;/a&gt; — it’s largely just been teasers. Very little has come of ARKit, which brought basic augmented reality apps to the iPhone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16329366/ios-11-apple-arkit-best-new-ar-apps"&gt;since its 2017 debut&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple’s rumored AR headset has — if understandably — been a year or two away &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/27/17291964/apple-vr-ar-headset-report"&gt;for the last three years in a row&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="p4rApd"&gt;The services turn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lqjmoz"&gt;If Tim Cook stepped down from Apple tomorrow, though, analysts wouldn’t be asking if a product visionary will take his place — they’d be wondering whether the next CEO will continue turning Apple into a services company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6PPhT"&gt;In the second quarter of 2016, Cook and Apple CFO Luca Maestri drew financial analysts’ attention to a remarkable fact it had quietly been disclosing for well over a year — Apple was becoming a services company, too. The App Store and the company’s other paid subscriptions were accelerating quarter over quarter and year over year — and they had raked in $4.8 billion in Q1 2015 &lt;em&gt;alone&lt;/em&gt;. In 2017, after pulling in over $7 billion per quarter for three fiscal quarters in a row, Apple declared its services business was the size of a Fortune 100 company all by itself. Last quarter, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY21_Q3_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf"&gt;Apple saw a record $17.5 billion in services revenue&lt;/a&gt;, nearly half the size of the iPhone and more than double any other hardware category. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="D4FSqQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s services business eclipsed the Mac and iPad years ago&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WUgNc5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;As emails from the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt; (#10) revealed, the App Store alone had already eclipsed the company’s entire Mac and iPad businesses in 2016, with only the iPhone towering above it. Add movies, music, books, magazines, paid iCloud storage plans, AppleCare, Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple TV Plus, Apple News Plus, and Apple Fitness Plus, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses"&gt;you’ve got a wide array of services collectively pulling in billions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41rcor"&gt;It’s not clear which of these make a dent beyond the App Store, as Apple stopped talking about Apple Music’s paid subscribers after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761603/apple-music-60-million-subscribers-eddy-cue-spotify"&gt;it hit 60 million in June 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and the company still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394404/apple-tv-plus-free-trial-july-2021-ted-lasso-second-season-timing"&gt;effectively gives away Apple TV Plus for free&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3NcAu"&gt;But Cook’s sights are set beyond content services, too: with Apple Pay, the Apple Card, Apple Cash, and the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575852/apple-pay-later-report-affirm-paypal-klarna-monthly-installments"&gt;Apple Pay Later&lt;/a&gt;, the company seems to be edging into banking as well, locking in a cut of your transactions at the same time it’s locking you into its software ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eSusHKkETOnKHF0qDJKLjVLYKVM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803090/apple_card.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Card.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m07x0x"&gt;There is one place that Cook’s Apple admirably won’t go: while some of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22526881/apple-icloud-plus-privacy-subscription-services-revenue-wwdc-2021"&gt;Apple’s service upsells&lt;/a&gt; can be highly annoying, Cook has been a champion for user privacy, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/1/9437717/apple-ceo-tim-cook-privacy-car-npr-interview"&gt;calling it “a fundamental human right,”&lt;/a&gt; and famously fighting the FBI over requests that, privacy advocates agreed, might lead to governments having backdoors into users’ phones. It’s the rare tech giant that isn’t using your data as a revenue stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzNlcV"&gt;Some of Apple’s services play goes back to the days of Steve Jobs. One year before he died, he delivered an internal strategy presentation where he declared 2011 the “Year of the Cloud,” and that Apple should “tie all of our products together, so we further lock customers into our ecosystem.” But the majority of Apple’s services today were introduced on Tim Cook’s watch, and Apple Pay in particular should go down as one of the company’s game changing moves — while other phone makers do have a direct equivalent, it was Cook’s Apple that drove instant, seamless, touchless payments across large parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LF4zDI"&gt;Growing pains&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SpOXfI"&gt;The question now is whether Apple can keep up with its all-encompassing pursuit of growth, because after a decade some cracks are beginning to show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOIjYE"&gt;Consumers, competitors, and lawmakers around the world are starting to treat Apple like just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22521476/apple-walled-garden-carrier-app-store-innovation"&gt;another giant company trying to extract revenue&lt;/a&gt; any way it can — and as the company has become responsible for a billion devices and 2 million apps, its reputation is starting to take some brutal body blows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cb9cLL"&gt;Apple has never apologized so much as it has in the past few years, whether it’s for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573710/apple-battery-gate-throttle-iphones-settlement-amount"&gt;artificially slowing down older iPhones&lt;/a&gt; to preserve their batteries, secretly having human contractors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836760/apple-apology-siri-audio-recordings-privacy-changes-contractors"&gt;listen to Siri recordings&lt;/a&gt;, or backing away from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app"&gt;forcing a developer to add in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s “What happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone,” one of many privacy ads the company created.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LWRwsS"&gt;Even as Tim Cook continues to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282158/apple-services-privacy-credit-card-tv-data-sharing"&gt;push Apple as a privacy company&lt;/a&gt;, where what happens on your phone stays on your phone, Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;grappling with the reality of child porn&lt;/a&gt; and making potentially worrying privacy concessions as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4FVY8"&gt;The company’s embroiled in lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny around the globe alleging the App Store is a monopoly, and while it’s entirely uncertain whether judges will agree, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;Apple’s own internal emails&lt;/a&gt; do a pretty good job of showing how the company values lock-in and favors some developers over others, despite Tim Cook’s testimony under oath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wasIlc"&gt;Even as Apple tries to maintain the image of a technological leader that puts people first, the company has deployed an army of lobbyists to kill regulation it opposes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525542/apple-right-to-repair-bill-california-lobbyist-comptia"&gt;in California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22357121/arizona-hb2005-app-store-bill-dead-apple-google-big-tech-lobbying"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;North Dakota&lt;/a&gt;, Louisiana, and Georgia — where Apple &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/20/apple-takes-on-state-legislatures-georgia-506299"&gt;reportedly threatened to pull its investment from a historically Black college&lt;/a&gt; if a challenge to its App Store went through. The company has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/23/technology/apple-google-south-korea-app-store.html"&gt;asked the Biden administration to pressure the South Korean government&lt;/a&gt; from enacting a similar law. Even as Apple projects an image of its App Store as a trustworthy place to shop, it’s become increasingly obvious that its 500 human reviewers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;don’t have time to catch the most egregious scams&lt;/a&gt; successfully bilking users out of millions of dollars, even though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;emails show&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s been aware of the problem for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpwKLQ"&gt;Cook’s all-important supply chains have consistently been under fire, too, with reports &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166286/apple-china-labor-violations-temporary-workers"&gt;that Apple turned a blind eye&lt;/a&gt; to labor law violations in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tEM7mK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple employees are organizing, now under the banner #AppleToo","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"},{"title":"Sweetheart deals and plastic knives: all the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"},{"title":"Apple isn’t just a walled garden, it’s a carrier","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22521476/apple-walled-garden-carrier-app-store-innovation"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="d6dZ8Z"&gt;Although Apple prides itself on a culture of secrecy, it’s currently undergoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453302/apple-culture-secrecy-leak-antonio-garcia-martinez-letter"&gt;a wave of employee activism that might change that culture forever&lt;/a&gt; in ways beyond Cook’s control — although the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;may be illegally trying&lt;/a&gt; to control it anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zqKNr"&gt;And even though Tim Cook has touted diversity for many years, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/30/7133103/thank-you-tim-cook"&gt;deserves credit&lt;/a&gt; for coming out as the first openly gay CEO of a Fortune 500 company, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/"&gt;Apple’s own leadership page&lt;/a&gt; is still &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="I8TABB"&gt;It’s possible Tim Cook won’t be the one to solve these problems. He’s been with the company for 23 years, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/apples-ceo-is-making-very-different-choices-from-mark-zuckerberg.html?showTranscript=1"&gt;he recently told Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; he probably won’t still be there after another decade has passed. But few of them were problems in the Steve Jobs era: many are a function of the Apple that Tim Cook built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OSf1Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Forza is getting a colorful, translucent controller for Xbox Series X</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sQBhwWVzhRwe2i8FbMZcFGD9gH0=/115x0:1309x796/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69770082/E9kzcDxWUAIHL3y.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aChGJC"&gt;Microsoft revealed a colorful &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fforza-horizon-5-limited-edition%3Focid%3DEvent_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Video_lrn_8.24.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F24%2F22639740%2Fxbox-series-x-forza-horizon-5-colorful-translucent-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new custom Xbox Series X / S controller&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; during its Gamescom 2021 Xbox stream. Much of the controller is a translucent yellow, but it also features blue and pink as accent colors, with “paint splotches” splashed across the front, pink buttons with blue letters, and the blue and pink control sticks. The controller also has black grips that look to have a rubberized texture, which will differ from the bumpier texture used on other Series X controllers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzDBKs"&gt;The new controller costs $74.99, which is a $15 increase from the $59.99 price of standard controllers, but it also comes with some exclusive &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5 &lt;/em&gt;DLC. You can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fforza-horizon-5-limited-edition%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DnOD%2FrLJHOac%26ranSiteID%3DnOD_rLJHOac-2Y7ZkhUqYxeTLH2oVnNM6w%26epi%3DnOD_rLJHOac-2Y7ZkhUqYxeTLH2oVnNM6w%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2200057_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__6t91u1iv2gkfqmcc1aulhv0fbf2xrme3oxwvxr3100%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%2528nOD_rLJHOac-2Y7ZkhUqYxeTLH2oVnNM6w%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_6t91u1iv2gkfqmcc1aulhv0fbf2xrme3oxwvxr3100&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F24%2F22639740%2Fxbox-series-x-forza-horizon-5-colorful-translucent-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder it from Microsoft’s online store now&lt;/a&gt;, and it will be available on November 9th, the same day as the &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvPogM"&gt;Microsoft also shared &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPgUk3NZcbI"&gt;a thrilling trailer&lt;/a&gt; showing off the first eight minutes of the game, which includes a number of cars dropping out of planes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sdC57J"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CPgUk3NZcbI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vDZEI2"&gt;Microsoft has revealed quite a few new controller colors since the Series X / S launched last year, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607786/microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-aqua-shift-special-edition-blue-rubber-side-grips"&gt;a dazzling blue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529221/cosmic-red-ps5-controller-hands-on-series-x"&gt;a bright red&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fxbox-wireless-controller%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F24%2F22639740%2Fxbox-series-x-forza-horizon-5-colorful-translucent-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a neon green&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fspacejamanewlegacy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F24%2F22639740%2Fxbox-series-x-forza-horizon-5-colorful-translucent-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;controllers themed after &lt;em&gt;Space Jam: A New Legacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And if none of the currently available controllers are your style, you can design your own custom controller with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22531865/microsoft-xbox-design-lab-series-x-colors"&gt;newly reopened Xbox Design Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The biggest announcements and trailers from Xbox at Gamescom 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BfAybQP0Bt3EM7l1lSljWwaF8po=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69770054/MFS_Volocopter.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="81NLks"&gt;Microsoft had a good showing at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22531138/e3-2021-summer-game-fest-news-announcements"&gt;this year’s iteration of E3&lt;/a&gt;, and the company returned to show off its upcoming slate of games at Gamescom 2021. There were the usual suspects — like &lt;em&gt;Forza&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; — along with a few surprises like cloud streaming coming to Xbox consoles. (Curiously, &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; did not make an appearance.) And the company continues to put a big focus on its Game Pass subscription service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKvQUz"&gt;If you weren’t able to check out the nearly 90-minute-long event live, here are the best trailers and biggest announcements you missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="umJRpc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BomfVh2PSkM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6qVi9B"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22403262"&gt;xCloud coming to Xbox consoles this holiday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="caKpX1"&gt;Microsoft revealed that it’s bringing its cloud gaming service xCloud to both the Xbox One and Series X / S this holiday season, which will let users stream Game Pass titles before they’ve even downloaded them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uR0q74"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7fytkGUU7jk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BzE7Dn"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; adds some slick cars — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639740/xbox-series-x-forza-horizon-5-colorful-translucent-controller"&gt;and a controller&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HLYvfg"&gt;We already know that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586277/forza-horizon-5-biomes-playground-games-microsoft-xbox"&gt;the landscapes of &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5 &lt;/em&gt;will be beautiful&lt;/a&gt;, and now we know there will be some cool cars, too. That includes the 2021 Bronco Badlands, alongside the Mercedes AMG One; one for the streets, the other for off-roading. In addition to being in the game, the two vehicles will grace the cover as well. &lt;em&gt;Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; launches on November 9th for Xbox and PC. Oh, and you can pick up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639740/xbox-series-x-forza-horizon-5-colorful-translucent-controller"&gt;a sick translucent controller&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pWvVKT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S90uou_Jrqo?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=7&amp;amp;start=7" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DNT7QD"&gt;Game Pass gets another flood of new titles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ORzlbD"&gt;As has become routine for Microsoft, the company used its showcase as a chance to show off its Game Pass subscription service. Most notably, the company announced a handful of brand-new titles that will debut on the service, including a slate of indies from Humble Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wDdMin"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8KvZxjlCdlI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hL9ybV"&gt;A closer look at &lt;em&gt;Dying Light 2&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1bBlQZ"&gt;Microsoft opened up the show with an in-depth look at zombie parkour game &lt;em&gt;Dying Light 2&lt;/em&gt;. The gameplay trailer featured plenty of zombies, and — according to developer Techland — it will have twice the number of parkour moves compared to the original. The game launches on December 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JDq9Ja"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kBmH2nMiaXs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="U6lcMV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639738/microsoft-flight-simulator-updates-electric-air-taxis-competitive-multiplayer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is getting plenty of updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ptgbnw"&gt;The team behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593883/microsoft-flight-simulator-xbox-series-x-s-review"&gt;the startlingly realistic &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; detailed a number of updates coming to the game which include a new racing mode; a series of historic planes; a world update covering Germany, Switzerland, and Austria; and even the addition of electric air taxis that will pave the way for helicopters in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rPcltQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gKIJDo8AZVI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Stit9v"&gt;A history lesson via &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SLWlcK"&gt;Things took a turn for the low-tech during a segment focused on medieval weaponry. The developers behind strategy sim &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV&lt;/em&gt; took some time out to talk about the trebuchet and how it will fit into the game. &lt;em&gt;Age&lt;/em&gt; launches on October 28th on PC — including Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hlpdkv"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgGqVOHamJA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nP9ZIi"&gt;A new action RPG for 2022&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="k41ZpK"&gt;One of the few new game reveals was &lt;em&gt;Stray Blade&lt;/em&gt;, described as “a brutal action RPG with intense combat &amp;amp; adventurous exploration.” It’s launching next year on Xbox Series X / S, and you can get a glimpse of it in the trailer above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CFB69e"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AsKImC3_UGQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SkzDIj"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Crusader Kings&lt;/em&gt; comes to console&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4WmSMF"&gt;PC strategy game &lt;em&gt;Crusader Kings III&lt;/em&gt; is making its way to console with a port for the Xbox Series X / S. Microsoft says that “the UI has been customized to work with the Xbox Wireless Controller, including the addition of radial menus, ensuring that none of the depth and detail of the &lt;em&gt;Crusader Kings III&lt;/em&gt; experience has been lost in translation.” The release date should be announced “soon,” and the game will be available through Game Pass when it does launch, and developer Paradox says &lt;a href="https://www.crusaderkings.com/en/console"&gt;it’s coming to PS5 as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Flight Simulator’s next updates add electric air taxis and competitive multiplayer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/voDLb_ks_Y8qHGvMxaS3yhddWq0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69769783/MFS_Reno_Air_Race.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3GR33f"&gt;Microsoft has revealed the next major additions coming to &lt;em&gt;Microsoft&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator &lt;/em&gt;later this year, including the Volocopter VoloCity air taxi; updated maps for the Germany, Austria, and Switzerland regions; and a competitive online multiplayer racing mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoIngw"&gt;First up is a new series of “Local Legends” planes that are being added to &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, which will offer planes that are famous in a specific region that might not be as well known. The goal is to have these planes roll out alongside &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;’s world updates, so the first Local Legend plane will coincide with the upcoming World Update VI (featuring Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) and offer a hyper-realistic re-creation of the Junkers JU-52.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The world update will release on September 7th, free of charge, while the Junkers JU-52 will cost $14.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MwqXjg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EsIEnwMSjvU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3LKIku"&gt;On the flip side of things, Microsoft is also adding a far more futuristic aircraft in a November update: the VoloCity air taxi from Volocopter, an eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) helicopter with big ideas about rethinking urban mobility (even if the first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2018/1/8/16866662/volocopter-flying-taxi-first-us-flight-intel-ces-2018"&gt;real-world flights&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974817/volocopter-flying-taxi-station-voloport-singapore-test-flight"&gt;have been somewhat underwhelming&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="y9b1lG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Exclusive: Volocopter’s air taxi takes flight for first time in the US","url":"https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2018/1/8/16866662/volocopter-flying-taxi-first-us-flight-intel-ces-2018"},{"title":"The flying taxi future is coming, but it’s elitist and underwhelming ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974817/volocopter-flying-taxi-station-voloport-singapore-test-flight"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6ck9rT"&gt;Lastly, this fall Microsoft is adding the Stihl National Championship Air Races as “the first major expansion” to &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;. The new expansion will be an eight-player racing mode, and it’ll allow players to fly World War II era planes at breakneck speeds to prove who’s the best pilot of all. There’s no specific release date yet, however, although it should be out sometime in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SzCOT8"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnljQuHhvM8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="icG9BW"&gt;The new racing mode will feature one major break with reality, though: &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22637999/microsoft-flight-simulator-stihl-national-championship-air-races-p-51-sea-fury"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; Jorg Neumann tells &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that due to contractual agreements with manufacturers, the game can’t show planes being damaged, so when players collide in races, the planes will simply disappear. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox consoles are getting xCloud this holiday so you can stream before you download</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T17Vp7ngDaulgwC87EJgiulPolU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69769654/acastro_210429_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LNKVsg"&gt;Microsoft its bringing its Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) service to Xbox One and Xbox Series S / X consoles this holiday. The integration of xCloud will let Xbox owners simply click play on an Xbox Game Pass game and stream it immediately, allowing players to try games before they commit to the often hourslong process of downloading big titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mM7Eat"&gt;More than 100 Xbox Game Pass titles will be available as part of this initial xCloud integration, and Xbox players will be able to try games as they wait for them to download fully. This xCloud integration also lets Xbox players jump into multiplayer games as soon as friends send an invite, avoiding having to wait for the install to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4X8ax_K8ERgdjzJOa0K7L7dUOMU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802296/Play___Minecraft_Dungeons.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;xCloud integration in the Xbox dashboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fA5Sjfsim5U23N2FXiJUwzr7yjA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802300/Xbox_Game_Pass___Minecraft_Dungeons.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A cloud logo will appear on games that can be streamed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HCoo2H"&gt;Microsoft will update its Xbox dashboard on Xbox One and Xbox Series S / X consoles to include a cloud icon, to show which games can be instantly streamed. Much like the rest of Xbox Cloud Gaming, the streams will support up to 1080p and 60fps so it won’t be a replacement for those with 4K TVs just yet. Microsoft is very much marketing this as a try before you download service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FroFyW"&gt;As this is also arriving on Xbox One, it does mean that Xbox Series S / X exclusive games like &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Medium &lt;/em&gt;will also be available on older Xbox One consoles soon. Microsoft isn’t committing to a date for&lt;em&gt; Microsoft Flight Simulator &lt;/em&gt;on xCloud just yet, saying it’s “coming in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmri2N"&gt;This new xCloud integration will be available for Xbox Insiders this fall ahead of the broader release, and Microsoft plans to announce testing details soon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to get rid of those irritating Chat and Rooms tabs in mobile Gmail</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-NWbNxNDB-6F2M8zkoHAL5ovbkE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69769622/acastro_201210_1777_gmail_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DaSkVR"&gt;In August 2020, Google decided to add a tab for its Meet videoconferencing platform to Gmail. Not a big deal for the desktop version — although you can still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598038/how-to-google-meet-gmail-hide"&gt;choose to get rid of it&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t intend to use Meet at all — but it could be a real issue for the mobile app, because it expanded the bottom margin of the app and gave you approximately three fewer lines to work with. So we provided directions for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21363976/google-meet-gmail-tab-how-to-android-ios"&gt;how to get rid of the Meet tab&lt;/a&gt; on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Obe4Wh"&gt;Now Google has added the ability to access its Chat and Rooms features directly from Gmail. As a result, many people are finding that the tabs are back at the bottom of their mobile screens, once again taking up precious space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gmail with the Chat and Rooms tabs." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GJL4ZzJz7jNb1olpHLDU4u3x4JU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802439/Screenshot_20210824_095042.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gmail with the Chat and Rooms tabs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gmail without the Chat and Rooms tabs." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HfSrhUdHU7Ukj1LoJ2FzOL84qU0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802440/Screenshot_20210824_094950.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gmail without the Chat and Rooms tabs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9tim1m"&gt;You can get rid of the new tabs the same way you got rid of the “Meet” tab. If you can’t remember how, or if you’re confronting this issue for the first time, here’s how to deal with it. These instructions apply to the Gmail app on both Android and iOS. (Note: your directions may vary slightly depending on your Android phone.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ZUu4az"&gt;Select the three-line “hamburger” icon in the upper left corner, scroll down, and tap on “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TGx5lA"&gt;Select the Gmail account you want to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O0qbM6"&gt;On an iPhone, toggle off “Show the chat and rooms tab” near the top of the page. On an Android phone, scroll down to the “Chat” category and uncheck “Show the Chat and Rooms tabs.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="On an iPhone, toggle off “Show the chat and rooms tab.” " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g3On3zULu4CzlrvbLS-PYZIj_ak=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802573/chat_rooms_ios.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On an iPhone, toggle off “Show the chat and rooms tab.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Uncheck “Show the Chat and Rooms tabs.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pc4zzFR19ppMAVcuL--6w29rXHM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802447/Screenshot_20210824_094359__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On an Android phone, uncheck “Show the Chat and Rooms tabs.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yl14YY"&gt;And that’s it! You’ve reclaimed some space on your Gmail app. Incidentally, if you want to show all the tabs — for Chat, Rooms, and Meet — just go back to the same settings page and check (or toggle on) both the “Show the Chat and Rooms tabs” and the “Show the Meet tab for video calling” boxes. All three tabs will appear in a single line at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1HtNJl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best free apps for video calling","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21286781/best-video-call-apps-free"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>TikTok tests shopping tabs with select Shopify merchants</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/upNzPVS6axxLE_j6YPwjRfJ2bcE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69769612/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FaYg5S"&gt;TikTok &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-ways-to-discover-and-shop-on-tiktok"&gt;announced it’s piloting a new in-app shopping experience&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday as part of its ongoing partnership with Shopify (&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/24/technology/tiktok-shopify.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). TikTok Shopping allows select merchants from the US, Canada, and the UK to use &lt;a href="https://news.shopify.com/scaling-social-commerce-shopify-introduces-new-in-app-shopping-experiences-on-tiktok"&gt;a new shopping tab and product links&lt;/a&gt; to sell products from Shopify storefronts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Um9Pyv"&gt;The shopping tab is basically a dedicated section of a TikTok profile with a scrollable list of products that you can click through to be taken directly to a merchant’s Shopify storefront. Product links offer similar integrations by allowing merchants to link directly to a product from a TikTok post. In its current form, this isn’t really a full-blown monetization option for creators. The new shopping features require a TikTok for Business account and a Shopify storefront, two things not every creator will have. It’s really more of an expansion of &lt;a href="https://news.shopify.com/dancing-to-a-new-beat-shopify-brings-commerce-to-tiktok"&gt;the advertising partnership TikTok and Shopify embarked on&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 than the future of making money on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YmwEm2SX4tPGT0ICeQq3umn2wsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802804/TikTok_Shopify_Image2.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The shopping tab and product links as used by Kylie Cosmetics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S8VJnH"&gt;Besides clear parallels to what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165957/instagram-reels-shopping-update-global"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21399858/facebook-shop-app-update-sell-product-instagram"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; have been working on, TikTok Shopping might be familiar because the company has been testing it in a more limited form. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430513/tiktok-in-app-shopping-instagram-facebook-europe-test"&gt;Earlier this year, TikTok piloted the shopping tab&lt;/a&gt; with streetwear brand Hype in the UK. It’s not clear how many merchants are part of this expanded Shopify pilot, but TikTok does have one celebrity brand on board in the form of Kylie Cosmetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqFTnI"&gt;Shopping makes sense for TikTok. The company’s endless stream of highly personalized video suggestions feels like a natural fit for QVC-esque informercials — &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-live-stream-shopping-feature-in-app-purchases-2021-2"&gt;TikTok even previously looked into introducing something similar&lt;/a&gt;. TikTok’s first big steps into shopping start soon: Shopify says the shopping tab and product links will be enabled for merchants in the coming weeks, with plans to bring the features to more regions outside of the US, UK, and Canada in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US Apple Maps users are getting the ability to rate places and add their own photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/67lhjtovfqRPKE0O5WbrOpYqTx0=/0x138:1125x888/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69769463/Image_from_iOS.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BV4ZwY"&gt;Apple Maps’ built-in ratings and photos system is rolling out to the US and Canada, letting users add their own information to points of interest on the map (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/23/apple-maps-native-review-feature-us-users/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The system uses a thumbs up / thumbs down rating, and currently exists alongside Apple Maps’ existing integrations like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="40viqo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10715914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ltg8GS"&gt;According to Apple, the feature started rolling out in the US and Canada on Monday, so there aren’t many places that have ratings yet. However, an Apple spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the feature launched with iOS 14 and has been available in other countries like Japan or Australia for some time. That makes it possible to see how they show up by looking at point of interest cards abroad, where we can see the number of ratings and what percentage of them are positive for the location overall, as well as for any specific amenities that users rated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image showing the product card for Apple’s Ginza store. Included is a label saying 21 ratings, with a thumbs up icon and a label that reads 95 percent. There’s also thumbs up / thumbs down buttons, and breakdowns for customer service and products ratings, both with a thumbs up icon and percentage label." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C2ZVmZkfsn0sFGYeaem16dFlzcI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801638/IMG_2305.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Ginza store in Tokyo has solid ratings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9jN6Py"&gt;According to Apple’s introduction screen for the feature, Maps will suggest contributions for you based on your device’s location history, as well as photos in your photos library (the analysis for which Apple says happens on-device). Your name also &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/08/23/apple-maps-ratings-and-photos-feature-debuts-in-us"&gt;doesn't appear to be publicly linked&lt;/a&gt; to the ratings you provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9Odr7"&gt;So far, the ratings and photos system is rudimentary — you’re not able to leave any written feedback, and the app is still pulling photos, reviews, and ratings from other sources like Yelp or Tripadvisor. However, it does seem like Apple could be laying the groundwork here for a Google Maps-like system with data provided by Apple Maps users instead of being pulled in from other sources. If Apple does go that route, it could be bad news for Yelp, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/26/21401031/yelp-competition-google-stoppelman-interview-basecamp-epic-apple"&gt;already competing with Google’s user reviews and photos in search results&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrPBvL"&gt;Ratings aren’t the only user-generated information Apple’s added to maps — it also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275558/apple-maps-beta-accident-speed-trap-reporting"&gt;added the ability to report accidents, hazards, and speed checks&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fios-14-5-offers-unlock-iphone-with-apple-watch-diverse-siri-voices-and-more%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F24%2F22638723%2Fapple-maps-ratings-photos-us-rollout-ios-yelp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best gaming laptops in 2021: seven laptops to get your game on</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best gaming laptop at every size and price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="SKtFh9"&gt;The best gaming laptops are changing every year. The early days of mobile gaming were largely desktop replacements — clunky chassis, multiple power bricks, and RGB lighting galore. But the top contenders now are different. Manufacturers are finally putting powerful specs in sleeker, more portable, and more professional builds. They have excellent, fast refreshing screens that are necessary for a great gaming experience. These laptops aren’t just great for gaming, but for everyday work as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiHviH"&gt;The best gaming laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;. It can handle the most demanding games on the market today and also makes a great daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRi2QJ"&gt;We’ll be updating this page regularly as the best gaming laptops hit shelves throughout this year. Some exciting updates are on the way. AMD and Nvidia have announced their next-gen series of mobile processors and mobile graphics cards — the Ryzen 5000 series and the GeForce RTX 3000 series, respectively — and we’re already seeing them in premium gaming laptops across manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGRnFN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;QHD screen&lt;/a&gt; is another feature to watch for in the best gaming laptops. A growing number of manufacturers are releasing configurations with 1440p displays, even in gaming laptops under $2,000. These options can hit a sweet spot for many gamers: a better experience than 1080p without the price premium or raw horsepower required for a 4K display. You can expect decently high refresh rates from these panels as well, depending on the model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5KtNO"&gt;One more thing to keep in mind with the best gaming laptops is the power you can expect. Not all chips with the same name are created equal — the RTX 3070 in one laptop may not deliver the same frame rates as the RTX 3070 in another laptop due to its wattage (as well as other factors like the processor and cooling). Nvidia now requires companies to disclose clock speeds and graphics power on each model’s product page, but plenty of manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;haven’t done that yet&lt;/a&gt;. Your best bet, if you can’t find those numbers on a company’s website, is to read some reviews and make sure the model you’re considering will deliver the frame rates you’re looking for. We will note the wattage used in any laptops we review with the new RTX graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dqOSgQ"&gt;Asus’s ROG Zephyrus G14 was our top gaming laptop pick for quite a while. It did just about everything right, and we weren’t sure whether Asus could ever replicate its resounding success. But somehow, the company managed to make the G14 just a bit bigger, and a heck of a lot better. In doing so, it’s created the ROG Zephyrus G15, the best 15-inch rig you can buy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsXGzm"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not making any compromises on performance for that portability: it’s powered by the top mobile chips that AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and includes a fast 165Hz QHD (1440p) display. Together, those components can handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. The panel has excellent color reproduction as well, so your games will look great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMlhzT"&gt;But it’s not just the gaming; almost everything else about the G15 is great, too. The audio (pumped from a six-speaker array) has strong percussion and bass, the keyboard and touchpad have a satisfying click, the port selection leaves little to be desired, and the battery can last for a whopping eight and a half hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MktsFD"&gt;The G15 won’t be the laptop for everyone. There’s no webcam, which is a significant oversight, and some may prefer something more affordable, or with a flashier aesthetic. But as a package, the G15 is the one to beat. Not only is it the best gaming laptop you can buy, but it’s also one of the best laptops you can buy, period. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gXl1tL"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ibDYbq"&gt;The best gaming laptop in a 14-inch chassis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PjVXGI"&gt;The ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best 14-inch gaming laptop you can buy. We most recently reviewed last year’s model, which includes AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series up to the eight-core Ryzen 9 4900HS and an Nvidia RTX 2060 GPU. There’s a brand-new model out featuring the Ryzen 5000 series and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series graphics, which we’re looking forward to getting our hands on ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvmPMM"&gt;For well under $2,000, the Zephyrus crams one of the most powerful mobile processors on the market into a super portable 14-inch chassis. With capable cooling to boot, the laptop delivers frame rates we’ve never seen in a laptop of this size before. It handled every game we threw at it without breaking a sweat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRoiIm"&gt;But aside from its excellent gaming performance, the G14 makes a great daily driver. The keyboard, touchpad, display, and port selection are all excellent. Even the battery life is good — something we almost never get to say about gaming laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yypId"&gt;There are a few downsides to the G14, but they’re fairly small and user-dependent. The most significant note is that it lacks a webcam; you’ll need an external one if you plan on taking video calls. There’s also some bleed in the backlighting, there’s no Thunderbolt connectivity (since it’s an AMD system, and that’s an Intel standard), and the fans can get louder than most under load. But these are very much nitpicks that won’t have a large impact on plenty of people’s gaming experience. Overall, we have very few complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eM7Jm"&gt;Asus recently collaborated with DJ Alan Walker on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629096/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-alan-walker-edition-dj-deck-gaming-laptop"&gt;Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition&lt;/a&gt;, with a box that becomes  DJ deck. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a monster of a gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yzdsDK"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jT5h16"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E8Fdz3"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 delivers some of the best gaming performance you can find in a laptop — but that’s not even its superpower. What makes Razer’s 17-inch flagship so impressive is it packs that unbelievable power into a thin and attractive chassis. It’s just 0.8 inches thick and only requires one charging brick — so you can carry it around in a backpack or briefcase without compromising on power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaBYbX"&gt;Gaming enthusiasts can opt for a model with a 300Hz screen — the highest refresh rate you can get on a laptop — while folks who want to combine gaming with some creative work can opt for a 120Hz touchscreen configuration. Both models come with a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, which adds a touch of color to the Pro’s design without being too obnoxious for the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsGaDN"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 certainly isn’t cheap, but it’s the laptop to buy if you want the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 Advantage Edition is powered by an impressive AMD processor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2kvoth"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465565/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SAASF8"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HhOl4t"&gt;The ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition is one of the few gaming laptops you’ll find that includes both an AMD processor and an AMD GPU. Not to worry — it delivers gaming performance on par with what you’ll see from laptops with Nvidia’s top GPUs. It also delivers one of the best gaming battery experiences we’ve ever seen — it was able to maintain playable frame rates on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;for over an hour with no charger attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHVLju"&gt;Speaking of battery, we averaged nine hours and 16 minutes of work use between charges, which makes the Strix G15 far and away one of the longest-lasting gaming laptops on the market. That’s doubly impressive because it’s powering a ton of flashy LEDs, including a per-key RGB keyboard and a colorful light strip around the front edge of the deck. If you’re looking for a jazzy, bold design and you’re all-in on AMD, the Strix G15 Advantage edition is the best gaming laptop for you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE is the best gaming laptop you can buy for $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DMtcRV"&gt;The best budget gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hCCjrZ"&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE offers a great gaming experience at a price range far below that of many competitors. You can buy it for around $1,000, and it doesn’t ask too many compromises for that price. While it only comes with a 60Hz screen, the hardware inside (especially AMD’s Ryzen 7 processor) is capable of maxing that out on all kinds of demanding games at native 1080p resolution, so you can reliably expect a playable experience from your favorite titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6ozmE"&gt;We’re also impressed by the G5’s connectivity. It includes a Mini DisplayPort, an HDMI, and an Ethernet jack — all ports you don’t see every day on laptops at this price point. Overall, if you’re looking for great value for your money, the G5 is your best bet. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade 15 is the 15-inch gaming laptop to beat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="n9BvYP"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wzRw2D"&gt;A great thin and light gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="EcPuJg"&gt;The Blade 15 isn’t as powerful as its 17-inch sibling, but it may be a more pragmatic purchase for many people. If you’re looking for a balanced combination of performance and portability, the Blade 15 may hit that sweet spot. It still packs the top chips on the market and can come with a 300Hz display, but at just 4.7 pounds and 0.7 inches thick, it’s comparable in size to a number of 15-inch productivity machines like the Dell XPS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8vpQe"&gt;In addition to its reliable gaming performance, the Blade 15 works well as a productivity machine. We’re big fans of its keyboard, which is quite comfortable to use and has per-key RGB lighting, and the touchpad, which is roomy with a satisfying click. Our primary complaint is that this Blade got quite hot during our game testing — not only did the processor reach 99 degrees, but the hinge and palm rests were uncomfortable to touch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7lPrCK"&gt;The best laptop with flashy RGB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SK7elL"&gt;If you’re looking for a “traditional” premium gaming laptop with colorful, flashy panache, the ROG Strix Scar 15 is for you. The Strix’s keyboard isn’t just one of the most comfortable that we’ve ever tested on a gaming laptop; it also has some of the coolest per-key RGB lighting we’ve ever seen with all kinds of effects. There’s also a colorful light strip wrapped around the front of the deck (customizable as well) and a colorful glowing logo on the lid. In short: if you use this in public, people will notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZuwqX"&gt;Of course, the Strix is great on the inside as well, delivering some of the best frame rates you’ll find from a 15-inch laptop with Intel’s and Nvidia’s top chips. You’ll get the full benefit of their power with a 300Hz screen option as well. And the Strix comes preloaded with various programs to help customize your gaming experience. You can personalize color profiles, bandwidth allocation, and more based on the type of game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="tCRMB0"&gt;A gaming laptop with desktop-class parts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SH9RLt"&gt;If money and desk space are no objects for you, you might be interested in the Alienware Area-51m. This hefty rig is essentially a desktop in laptop form. It pairs a desktop-class processor and a full-power mobile GPU with a 17-inch display and a full-size keyboard, delivering true desktop performance in a chassis that’s still (technically) portable. PC enthusiasts will also appreciate that you can update many of the components yourself, including the processor, RAM, and storage. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Destiny 2: The Witch Queen offers the game’s biggest expansion in years on February 22nd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oZhajc0oAEbMP8CRZ5B5qBrBKxw=/300x0:2127x1218/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69769355/Screen_Shot_2021_08_24_at_12.20.54_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nG6w8W"&gt;Bungie has officially taken the wraps off of the next major expansion for &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt;, which will continue the story of the sci-fi space series and see players finally face off against Savathûn, the titular Witch Queen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dl7Vni"&gt;Savathûn (the sister of Oryx, the main villain in the original game’s &lt;em&gt;Taken King&lt;/em&gt; expansion) is a foe that’s been teased for over seven years, with her machinations behind many of &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt;’s previous major events (including the corruption of the Dreaming City). The addition of the Witch Queen marks the first time that players will be able to face off against her in person, though. And, as the trailer has revealed, she won’t be alone: Savathûn has managed to harness the player’s own powers of Light to empower Hive Guardians with similar abilities. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wPWCY_WamodIRdBPgZO995KZmow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802814/Screen_Shot_2021_08_24_at_12.20.41_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Mgu4Ye"&gt;The expansion will also feature a new location, Savathûn’s Throne World, along with a new campaign, weapons, armor, and of course, one of &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt;’s hallmark raids. Additionally, Bungie is adding a new weapon type: the Glaive, a first-person melee weapon with both ranged and up-close combat types. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DfMGaj"&gt;Also, &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt; will bring a major new addition to &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;: customizable weapons, which players will be able to modify with unique abilities, mods, and stats that are built to their own personal specifications. That system will start with the newly added weapons in &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt;, but Bungie plans to expand it to other weapons over time. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ef2010LUQI5wilJkf2CaAv2O6zk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802815/Screen_Shot_2021_08_24_at_12.21.27_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yke4b3"&gt;To tide players over while they wait for &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;’s upcoming season 15 content, titled &lt;em&gt;Season of the Lost&lt;/em&gt;, will focus on the long-missing character Mara Sov (queen of the Awoken faction). It will set the stage, plot-wise, for &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt;’s bigger changes when it arrives in 2022. &lt;em&gt;Season of the Lost&lt;/em&gt; will last for the full six months between now and &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt;, making it an unusually long season for &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt; players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmAKHr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Season of the Lost &lt;/em&gt;will also include a reworked Trials of Osiris mode that looks like it will encourage players of all skill levels to participate in the pinnacle player-vs-player experience. The reworked Trials of Osiris mode will also see the soft launch of Bungie’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632554/call-of-duty-warzone-vanguard-raven-new-map-destiny-2-anti-cheat"&gt;anti-cheat software&lt;/a&gt; when it arrives on September 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cpjvdJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Call of Duty: Warzone and Destiny are making moves to fight cheaters","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632554/call-of-duty-warzone-vanguard-raven-new-map-destiny-2-anti-cheat"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9vO1ni"&gt;Bungie is also launching crossplay today as part of the &lt;em&gt;Season of the Lost&lt;/em&gt;, allowing Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Stadia players to finally play together for the first time in &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt; history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNN8dO"&gt;As the company had previously announced, &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt; will be followed by another major expansion, called &lt;em&gt;Lightfall. &lt;/em&gt;But&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Bungie also revealed the &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; expansion, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2: The Final Shape&lt;/em&gt;, which the company describes as the “dramatic conclusion” to The Light and Darkness Saga that players have been experiencing for the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/66gsP4w1OpY5HrsHBsCsSPhtctE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802752/Screen_Shot_2021_08_24_at_12.14.10_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WH6ZgZ"&gt;This fall also marks Bungie’s 30th anniversary, and the studio is bringing both free and paid content to &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; to celebrate — and to help keep players busy while they wait for &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt; next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0h513S"&gt;All players will be able to enjoy a new six-person event, Dares of Eternity, later this year. But the main event is a purchasable Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack, which will feature a variety of cosmetics inspired by Myth and Marathon and a new exotic weapon. The pack also comes with a new “treasure-themed” dungeon set on the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/9/21/6760715/destiny-loot-cave-engrams-farming"&gt;Cosmodrome’s “Loot Cave”&lt;/a&gt; that will reward armor inspired by the popular Thorn weapon, and old classics like Eyasluna and Thousand-Yard Stare. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/54K-KlWPshAysN8Sq698Kctvzzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802794/Screen_Shot_2021_08_24_at_12.22.58_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nMRh6k"&gt;Also teased as part of the 30th anniversary event: the Loot Cave dungeon will return the iconic Gjallarhorn exotic rocket launcher, best known for being the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/14/9152603/xur-gjallarhorn-on-sale"&gt;single most powerful weapon&lt;/a&gt; players could get in the early days of the original &lt;em&gt;Destiny. &lt;/em&gt;Bungie would go on to nerf the powerful weapon in future updates, before bringing it back as a more balanced, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/14/11940958/destiny-gjallarhorn-return-rise-of-iron-e3-2016"&gt;reworked version in the &lt;em&gt;Rise of Iron&lt;/em&gt; expansion&lt;/a&gt;. But despite its popularity, Gjallarhorn hasn’t been available in the sequel — until now, that is. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MpubeRWob4ODfUfCRj2n9zJoAyQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802786/Screen_Shot_2021_08_24_at_12.23.33_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8LArK4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2: The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt; will be available on Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Stadia, and PC on February 22nd, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
