    <title>Xbox cult classic Stubbs the Zombie is getting remastered for modern consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oNNnS-KUNUv0kPKuRyUOptPYOJ0=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833376/Stubbs_KeyArt_Xbox.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Aspyr Media&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k2Vyqy"&gt;If you ever wanted a zombie game where you played as the undead instead of fending off against it, you’ll have another chance soon. &lt;em&gt;Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse&lt;/em&gt; is being rereleased on March 16th for PC, PS4, Switch, and Xbox One and will be playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X / S via backwards compatibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8Dgr5"&gt;Aspyr Media, the company that originally published &lt;em&gt;Stubbs the Zombie,&lt;/em&gt; is handling the port. The studio recently worked on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301436/star-wars-episode-1-racer-ps4-switch-release-price"&gt;porting &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Episode I: Racer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to modern consoles, so it’s safe to say this remaster is in good hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjJcXK"&gt;Originally released in 2005 on the Xbox, &lt;em&gt;Stubbs the Zombie &lt;/em&gt;has players control the titular character with the main goal of wreaking havoc and devouring human brains. It’s a third-person action title developed by the now-defunct Wideload Games. The game also came to Windows and Mac OS X roughly a month after its original release date, with a release on &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/news/1041/"&gt;Steam coming nearly two years later&lt;/a&gt;, which was later removed from the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3slmw"&gt;The announcement is good news for fans who played the 2005 original. In recent years, &lt;em&gt;Stubbs the Zombie&lt;/em&gt; has become one of the rarest games to own on the original Xbox. Microsoft made the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080520083014/http://majornelson.com/Default.aspx"&gt;game available digitally for the Xbox 360 in 2008&lt;/a&gt; as an Xbox Originals title, but the company &lt;a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/xba_gapp/stubbs-the-zombie-gone-from-the-marketplace-why/9131cced-77ca-4fb4-b60f-40a649004c7b#:~:text=Yes%2C%20Stubbs%20the%20Zombie%20is,keep%20an%20eye%20on%20it."&gt;pulled it from the Xbox Live Marketplace in late 2012&lt;/a&gt;. With no other ways to play the game in nearly a decade, your only option was to own an original Xbox console and a physical copy, which is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2047675.m570.l1313%26_nkw%3DStubbs%2BThe%2BZombie%2Bin%2BRebel%2BWithout%2Ba%2BPulse%2B%26_sacat%3D0&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22280459%2Fstubbs-the-zombie-remaster-release-date-pc-playstation-switch-xbox" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pretty pricey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Knockout City is a new dodgeball game from the makers of Mario Kart Live</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GpCvpSfuThybOmLddWWphrLKLY0=/19x0:3259x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833380/KOC_Key_Art_Standard_Horizontal_Logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Velan Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SLeiHC"&gt;Velan Studios, the studio behind the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514758/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;mixed-reality racer &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has revealed its next title: &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a team-based online dodgeball game. And it’s launching soon, as the game will be released on May 21st on Origin, Steam, the Playstation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, with enhancements for the PS5 and Xbox Series X. EA is publishing the game under its EA Originals label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipAUZl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt;’s take on dodgeball is similar to what you probably played in gym class. You and your team are trying to hit your opponents with balls while simultaneously avoiding and catching the balls thrown at you. In addition to straight-on throws, you can curve your shots, lob balls over obstacles, and even fake throws to try to catch your opponent off-balance. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C7CUnJUcd9ZOGbcpqjS8dY0EjpU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307605/KOC_SCREENSHOT01_ACTION_13c.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Velan Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sEzk7H"&gt;But there’s quite a bit that you probably didn’t have to deal with when you played dodgeball as a kid. There are balls with special powers, like a bomb ball that will blow up (hopefully not in your hands). You can also turn &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt; into a ball, and your teammates can pass you around, chuck you at enemies, or even use your balled-up form for a special attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQTEWK"&gt;You’ll automatically lock onto nearby opponents, meaning that you won’t have to worry as much about aiming as you would in other team-based games. Instead, &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; seems to be more about strategically timing your throws or coordinating with your teammates to get a good angle on someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVJqJG"&gt;The game also has a slick street-inspired style that’s aided by the huge variety of in-game cosmetics available. You can unlock new cosmetics through completing certain tasks or by buying them with Holobux, &lt;em&gt;Knockout City’s &lt;/em&gt;in-game currency. And from what I could tell, the game seems to have a great soundtrack. During a preview event, I heard a jazzy big-band song that would feel right at home in an &lt;em&gt;Incredibles&lt;/em&gt; movie.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U1Me6FIccO4f609xJDvJpsXFk9M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309109/KOC_SCREENSHOT02_CREWS_03.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Velan Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cyV0DL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knockout City’s&lt;/em&gt; approachable-looking take on dodgeball and its distinctive style all reminded me a lot of &lt;em&gt;Splatoon, &lt;/em&gt;which put a Nintendo spin on the team-based shooter genre with great results. I haven’t been able to try &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; myself yet, but I’m looking forward to giving it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRIDMd"&gt;The game will cost $19.99, and that flat fee will give you access to all of the game’s nine-week seasons. Velan Studios plans to offer a free trial of the full game when it launches, but it hasn’t announced how long that trial will last. There will also be a closed beta on PC on February 20th and 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8t2iHf"&gt;The game will also have crossplay and cross-progression between platforms, but you’ll have to buy &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; for each platform on which you want to play it. That might be a tough pill to swallow if you’re used to playing games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; on whatever device you happen to be using at the time without having to buy the game outright.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Splatoon 3 is coming to the Nintendo Switch in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Splatoon 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7iTEhFIjGMh2AFzhzjY0ZO3C2fs=/1x0:1357x904/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833372/splatoon3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Txkrtg"&gt;Nintendo ended its Direct live stream on Wednesday with a surprise announcement of &lt;em&gt;Splatoon 3&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoJrNa"&gt;Very little about the game was shown in the introduction trailer beyond customization options for a player’s inkling and what at first glance appears to be a more narrative-focused approach, showing the inkling traveling by train from a desert location to a large Tokyo-style city. Nintendo has this to say about the game in its YouTube trailer description: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZmywaH"&gt;Splatoon 3 arrives on Nintendo Switch in 2022! In the wake of chaos, enter the sun scorched Splatlands and the new city, Splatsville, inhabited by battle-hardened Inklings and Octolings. New weapons, moves, and more await, so be sure to keep an eye out for updates in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EjXW1L"&gt;It’s not clear what else &lt;em&gt;Splatoon 3 &lt;/em&gt;will offer, though the trailer did eventually show off what looked like the series’s signature multiplayer gameplay in which players are tasked with splattering as much colored ink across the environment as possible to overtake their opponents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErSCBP"&gt;Nintendo did confirm that &lt;em&gt;Splatoon 3&lt;/em&gt; will be coming to the Switch in 2022, so there’s plenty of time for the company to reveal more details about the game in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is getting an HD rerelease for the Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R6EeXnFkt24MCysASYAFrSwsoAo=/204x0:2268x1376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833352/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_5.53.48_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DVrGz8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt; is getting an HD rerelease on the Nintendo Switch, the company announced today during its Nintendo Direct event, set to release on July 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMehSw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword &lt;/em&gt;was originally released for the Nintendo Wii, and it relied heavily on that console’s motion controllers for gameplay. The HD Switch port will offer similar features using the Switch’s Joy-Con controllers — with the company promising even smoother combat thanks to the Switch’s faster processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnmopa"&gt;But Nintendo also is introducing a new button-based control scheme for Skyward Sword HD that relies on tilting the right thumbstick to control Link’s sword, allowing players using the Switch in handheld mode, a Switch Lite, or a Pro Controller to still enjoy the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZ6iLe"&gt;Nintendo is also releasing special edition Joy-Con controllers to celebrate &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt;’s Switch debut, themed after the Hylian Shield and Master Sword that Link wields. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/io2DZsiz6qMn9IJhwuTkCy6C7AQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22311008/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_5.45.22_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1GssQg"&gt;Unfortunately, Nintendo kicked off its announcement by noting that it didn’t have any news to share yet on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18661533/nintendo-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-sequel-e3-2019"&gt;upcoming sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which it announced in 2019. Development is said to be going well, though, and the company promises that it’ll have more to share on the upcoming title later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing: New Horizons adds Mario-themed items this month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Super Mario items in Animal Crossing: New Horizons" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/002hXZLoaiXXTd-UuJhc9SzgWKg=/0x0:1512x1008/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833222/animalcrossing32thanniversarymario.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AYCe3O"&gt;In celebration of Mario’s 35th anniversary, Nintendo is adding Mario-themed items to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21179238/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch-features"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. New content will be available on February 25th, the developer announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vatJv"&gt;Included in the update are Mario and Luigi’s signature costumes as well as items like Bowser flags and blocks to make islands feel a little more in tune with the mustachioed plumber. A trailer released alongside the news today features an impressive look at the possibilities, from classic dungeon-themed items to villagers hanging out in costume. The update will be available for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EmDL7R"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SDyY_N0eloQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="erMybG"&gt;Nintendo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250249/animal-crossing-new-horizon-nintendo-switch-festivale-update"&gt;teased the update&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, though it’s arriving a little earlier than expected. &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons &lt;/em&gt;continues to hold in-game events year-round to keep the game fresh. Earlier this week, players got carnival content. The game launched last  March, becoming a cultural phenomenon — in part due to its coincidental timing alongside pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22188452/animal-crossing-new-horizons-coronavirus-pandemic-year-2020"&gt;lockdowns&lt;/a&gt; across the world. &lt;/p&gt;

It’s also the first home console &lt;em&gt;Mario Golf &lt;/em&gt;since 2003, Nintendo confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Qsh5s"&gt;The game looks like it features your standard Mario sports-themed gameplay, with multiplayer and a variety of modes, including a speed golf mode. Nintendo also revealed a new story mode for &lt;em&gt;Super Rush &lt;/em&gt;and the ability to play as your own customizable Mii. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dbrand’s matte black PS5 side panels are now available for both models</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3a2DmMC2tyQTYt3imVLwjKi65Y4=/0x0:2061x1374/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833132/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_1.56.56_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Dbrand&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LTWTvA"&gt;Skin company Dbrand &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1362149455806537729"&gt;is now selling&lt;/a&gt; its blacked-out PlayStation 5 “Darkplates” for the digital edition of the console. The company released the panels for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279685/matte-black-ps5-faceplates-on-sale-dbrand-sue-us-sony"&gt;disk version of the console last week&lt;/a&gt;, but now they’re available for people who have said goodbye to physical media as well. At time of writing, Dbrand is estimating that the digital edition plates will ship in May, and they cost $60.95.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqXMV9"&gt;The “Darkplates” are designed to replace the PS5’s standard (and striking, but not necessarily in a good way) white side panels with matte black ones instead. The company is also sticking with its typically aggressive marketing style by replicating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture"&gt;Sony’s texture patterning&lt;/a&gt;, but with images of Dbrand’s logo instead. If you’re lucky enough to have the console, are looking to make it blend in a bit more, and don’t mind scrolling through some cringe (or cool, depending on your tastes) marketing, you can check out &lt;a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/ps5"&gt;the Darkplates store page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>RetroN Sq is a cube-shaped console for playing Game Boy titles on your TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9FSH0T5YGl-mSpw6q7vcJvag0wA=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833124/retron_square.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RetroN Sq comes in two colors: “black gold” and “hyper beach.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Hyperkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z3TvH5"&gt;Hyperkin is best known for making gaming peripherals, but it also creates clones of consoles that allow you to play retro games in modern resolutions. Now it is releasing a new retro console that will allow you to play Game Boy games on your TV. &lt;a href="https://hyperkinlab.com/retron-sq-hd-gaming-console-for-game-boy-game-boy-color-game-boy-advance-blackgold-hyperkin/"&gt;Hyperkin's RetroN Sq&lt;/a&gt; (Square) is a console that will allow you to play Game Boy, GBC, and GBA cartridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNrENT"&gt;The RetroN Square includes one wired USB “Scout” controller with a shape similar to a SNES controller. Instead of composite video hook-ups, the RetroN Sq connects to a TV via HDMI with games upscaled to 720p resolution; there’s also a switch that will allow you to switch the aspect ratio to either 4:3 or 16:9, depending on your preference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GztJal"&gt;The console will allow you to natively play Game Boy and GBC cartridges, while GBA games are listed as a “beta feature,” but it does not note which GBA games are compatible. The back of the console includes a memory card slot, allowing you to store firmware for the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7Zz8m"&gt;I know the official product name hints it is supposed to be a square-shaped console, yet the design looks more like a color, compact Nintendo GameCube that strictly plays Game Boy cartridges, but I’ll let you be the judge of that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gtI8Hk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10348071"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QMKbNo"&gt;Hyperkin’s RetroN Sq will release on March 25th for $75. But if you already know you want to buy one, you can preorder your unit at &lt;a href="https://hyperkinlab.com/retron-sq-hd-gaming-console-for-game-boy-game-boy-color-game-boy-advance-blackgold-hyperkin/"&gt;Hyperkin’s website&lt;/a&gt;. The gadget comes in two colors: “&lt;a href="https://hyperkinlab.com/retron-sq-hd-gaming-console-for-game-boy-game-boy-color-game-boy-advance-blackgold-hyperkin/"&gt;black gold&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://hyperkinlab.com/retron-sq-hd-gaming-console-for-game-boy-game-boy-color-game-boy-advance-hyper-beach-hyperkin/"&gt;hyper beach&lt;/a&gt;,” which to me looks more like a turquoise color. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fall Guys is coming to Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jdj7ujpHg7B5tScVqZwD_Babnx8=/185x0:2204x1346/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833094/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_5.08.06_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oBYdFr"&gt;Mediatonic’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;goofy&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;colorful hit from last year,&lt;em&gt; Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is launching for Nintendo Switch this summer. The news was announced today during a special Nintendo Direct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkQU9i"&gt;Fall Guys is a battle royale game in which players compete in massive elimination-style party games. Each match lasts only a matter of minutes, and players can choose to watch matches play out. The developer released season 2 last fall, which added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507721/fall-guys-season-2-available-now"&gt;medieval-themed&lt;/a&gt; games into the mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OFyhVw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aaIs_tQBMKc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="17nihZ"&gt;It was an immediate success following its August release, with more than 7 million downloads on Steam that month. It also became the most &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402473/fall-guys-sony-ps-plus-most-downloaded-game-all-time"&gt;downloaded PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt; title of all time. It failed to become the biggest game on Twitch that month, but it still clocked in as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452358/fall-guys-among-us-twitch-facebook-gaming"&gt;second most-watched&lt;/a&gt;, beating out &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlWrmw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; is currently available on PC and PlayStation 4. The game is also being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397170/fall-guys-mobile-china-game-developer"&gt;ported to mobile&lt;/a&gt;, but only in China. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola One 5G Ace, Moto G Power, and G Play now available on Google Fi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w-Z96kCQERTTvtOcgcmPWjup87Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833072/ajohnson_210126_4384_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Motorola One 5G Ace is now available for sale through Google’s MVNO. | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F0uwoo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-fi/more-phones-fi-more-choices-you/"&gt;Google Fi is adding&lt;/a&gt; three new Motorola phones: the One 5G Ace, Moto G Power (2021), and Moto G Play (2021). The devices are &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/moto"&gt;available for sale&lt;/a&gt; directly through the MVNO with the Ace priced at $279, the Moto G Power for $199, and the Moto G Play for $99. You’ll also find last year’s versions of the Power and Play for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C41Aek"&gt;The One 5G Ace has the highest specs of the three, offering a big 6.7-inch 1080p screen, 5,000mAh battery, a capable Snapdragon 750G chipset, and of course, 5G. Google Fi is selling the less expensive version with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="a1IRJX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Motorola One 5G Ace review: a weak hand","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22255202/motorola-one-5g-ace-review"},{"title":"Motorola Moto G Power (2021) review: power over perks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="tjojX5"&gt;The G Power model at Fi is the more expensive variant, and that’s a good thing: it includes 64GB of storage rather than the 32GB offered by the base model, which is just not enough for a modern phone. This year’s G Power includes a 5,000mAh battery that provides multiple days of use on a single charge. The G Play is the budget-friendliest option, but you’ll want to add a microSD card for additional storage, since 32GB is your only choice there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCNXE7"&gt;The One 5G Ace and G Power are two takes on a budget device: the Ace aims to do a little bit of everything, while the G Power goes all-in on battery life. We think the Ace is a fine device if you can live with some of its shortcomings, like a so-so camera. The G Power is tougher to recommend — if excellent battery life is a major priority, then it will get the job done, but ultimately it sacrifices a lot in the name of, well, power.&lt;/p&gt;
