    <title>Xiaomi overtakes Samsung to take top spot in European phone shipments in Q2 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GDnNl2"&gt;Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is continuing to post solid growth. After overtaking Apple as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22579771/worldwide-smartphone-market-share-ranking-q2-2022-canalys-xiaomi-apple-samsung"&gt;number two smartphone vendor in the world&lt;/a&gt; in the second quarter of 2021, it’s now become the top seller in Europe for the first time, according to &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210802005339/en/Strategy-Analytics-Xiaomi-Captures-Top-Position-in-European-Smartphone-Shipments-for-the-First-Time-in-Q2-2021-%C2%A0"&gt;new figures from Strategy Analytics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fn4FXW"&gt;Xiaomi overtook Samsung to take the top spot in Europe, with 12.7 million phones shipped in Q2, up 67.1 percent year-on-year. Samsung’s shipments fell 7 precent in that same period to 12 million units, though the Korean company remains the world’s biggest phone vendor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sGCRE1"&gt;Overall smartphone shipments in Europe increased in 2021 thanks to post-COVID recovery, say Strategy Analytics’ researchers, with Apple also showing decent growth. The iPhone maker was up 15.7 percent compared to 2021 thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596120/apple-q3-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;strong interest in the iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smartphone shipment figures for Europe in the second quarter of 2021. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMvtvW"&gt;Xiaomi’s focus on value, though, seems to have helped broaden its appeal in Europe. “Xiaomi has seen great success in Russia, Ukraine, Spain and Italy among others and found customers eager for its Mi and Redmi series of feature rich, value smartphones,” said Boris Metodiev, associate director at Strategy Analytics, in a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210802005339/en/Strategy-Analytics-Xiaomi-Captures-Top-Position-in-European-Smartphone-Shipments-for-the-First-Time-in-Q2-2021-%C2%A0"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlUdGv"&gt;Xiaomi’s growth has also been assisted by the demise of Huawei, which continues to vacate the European market after its phones lost access to Android and Google services in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qs7Yqd"&gt;In one of our recent reviews of Xiaomi’s hardware, looking at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;the company’s flagship Mi 11&lt;/a&gt;, we were impressed by the phone’s value. “It costs less than the $799 Galaxy S21 in markets where it’s sold, but in many ways, it has more in common with the $1,199 S21 Ultra,” noted  reviewer Sam Byford. “My biggest takeaway from the Mi 11 is that Samsung is lucky Xiaomi doesn’t sell phones in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLbsyh"&gt;Perhaps, buoyed by its success in Europe, Xiaomi will now be considering a US invasion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will give you a whole $10 for your palm print</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uhuU4G-YwxcEAtJ7TTX9iAnDyNc=/103x0:1218x743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69670735/amazon_one_palm_print.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon One identifies unique patterns in your palm to confirm payments in Amazon stores. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5X5L15"&gt;Amazon is offering $10 in credit if you enroll your biometric data in the company’s palm print recognition system, Amazon One. The promotion, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/amazon-credit-palm-biometrics/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;says people must connect their palm print to their Amazon account to claim the reward, though it’s not clear exactly where it’s available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZyqLB"&gt;Amazon launched Amazon One in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493094/amazon-one-palm-recognition-hand-payments-amazon-go-store"&gt;September last year&lt;/a&gt;, presenting it as an easy way to pay in the company’s stores, as well as a future identity service to be used by other venues and businesses. Users simply position their hand over the company’s scanners, which recognize their unique palm print based on its patterns of lines, ridges, and veins. This information can be used to verify payments in stores, but also in lieu of entrance tickets and the like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vq9n0v"&gt;Amazon One is currently available in 50 US locations, including Whole Food stores and Amazon Go shops. In &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-one-continues-expansion-now-available-as-a-contactless-payment-option-at-initial-whole-foods-market-store-in-seattle"&gt;April&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon said “thousands” of customers have enrolled in the service, though the company did not respond to a request for comment about this promotion. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xjockeZL5OqFY4W_pdVtSOfG4Z0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22757992/amazon_store_palm_prints_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/amazon-credit-palm-biometrics/" target="_blank"&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Amazon One promotion&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7xpg71"&gt;The retailing giant presents Amazon One as a “fast, convenient, contactless way for people to use their palm to enter, identify, and pay.” But critics say the technology is unnecessary, with similar benefits provided by contactless payment cards, and a potential security risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPtyUp"&gt;“The advantage [of your palm print] is that it’s on you all the time, this isn’t something you can lose, but that’s also a disadvantage because you can never change it,” security researcher and University of Oxford academic Reuben Binns &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496673/amazon-one-palm-reading-vein-recognition-payments-identity-verification"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;. “You can never change your palm like you change your password or other identification tokens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KC7QK"&gt;Many have expressed concerns about a company like Amazon in particular collecting such data. The firm has been criticized in the past for pushing new technology in uncomfortable ways: selling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287101/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-police-ban-one-year-ai-racial-bias"&gt;biased facial recognition algorithms&lt;/a&gt; and aggressively expanding its &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvg48d/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ring-amazons-surveillance-camera-company"&gt;network of police-connected home surveillance cameras&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KADp3N"&gt;It’s clear also that Amazon wants other businesses to use Amazon One as an identity service. This would potentially allow Amazon to track people around a greater variety of physical venues — not just shops, but office buildings, stadiums, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This $55 Amazon Smart Soap Dispenser is dumber than a box of rocks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kAJH5L_ZCedkb192KHOzicA_yJE=/7x0:1648x1094/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69670715/amazon_smart_soap.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xunZyB"&gt;Not &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; needs Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Case in point is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GWRT223?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s new Smart Soap Dispenser&lt;/a&gt;, the latest let’s-stick-a-chip-in-it replacement for ordinary objects. And because it’s made by Amazon, it’s design to be paired with an Echo speaker to run Alexa routines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0sWMC"&gt;Why? Well, according to Amazon, it’s to “automatically play songs, jokes, and more when you wash.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7HgBu"&gt;The 12oz liquid soap dispenser is fitted with 2.4GHz (only) 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi and features an LED timer around the top that reminds you to keep scrubbing until the CDC-recommended minimum wash time of 20 seconds has elapsed. The rechargeable battery is said to last three months on a single charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iRFdth"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A feature available on touchless soap dispensers that cost a lot less&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HOr7Kn"&gt;One useful feature is the variable rate dispenser that pumps out more soap the farther away from the nozzle you hold you hand. But that feature’s available on a variety of touchless soap dispensers that cost a lot less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7dHR0"&gt;If you do end up buying this device then please, by all means, install it in a bathroom alongside some type of occupancy sensor. Then alert the household whenever someone uses the toilet and fails to wash. Public shaming can be highly motivational to a fragile human psyche incapable of being alone for even 20 seconds at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bdbRN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgWBp6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates have officially divorced</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TENNIS: MAR 15 BNP Paribas Open" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mjhqjNnnP0Bs4OHKWyY5wpulfR0=/0x50:3000x2050/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69670679/1130788958.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0I0X1b"&gt;Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates filed for divorce on May 3rd after 27 years of marriage. Now, three months later, the separation of one of the world’s richest, most powerful couples has been finalized by a judge in King County, Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPN50M"&gt;Court records show that neither party will change their name or receive “spousal support,” report &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/02/tech/bill-melinda-gates-divorce-finalized"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-02/bill-gates-and-melinda-french-gates-divorce-becomes-official?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but exactly how the Gates’ immense fortune will be divided is unclear. Washington is a community property state, which means all assets accumulated during a marriage must be divided equally in the event of a divorce. But the Gates’ split is being carried out under the aegis of a separation contract, details of which are unknown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X4RTvO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bill Gates is currently the fourth richest man in the world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gf8msU"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Billionaires Index&lt;/a&gt;, Bill Gates is currently the fourth richest man in the world, worth $151 billion. The judge who finalized the divorce said only that the contract was “just and equitable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSHXH8"&gt;After the divorce was announced earlier this year, stories emerged of Gates’ inappropriate behavior in the workplace. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-directors-decided-bill-gates-needed-to-leave-board-due-to-prior-relationship-with-staffer-11621205803"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft’s board of directors thought Gates should step down after investigating an affair he pursued with an employee. Gates resigned from the board in 2020 before the investigation was completed, with a spokesperson claiming this had nothing to do with the investigation. “There was an affair almost 20 years ago which ended amicably,” the spokesperson told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAcVR1"&gt;Members of Microsoft’s board were also reportedly interested in Gates’ relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. As &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/16/business/bill-melinda-gates-divorce-epstein.html"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in May, Gates became friendly with Epstein in 2011, three years after the financier pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from children as young as 14. The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that “Ms. French Gates had expressed discomfort with her husband spending time with the sex offender, but Mr. Gates continued doing so.” A spokesperson for Gates told the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;that the paper’s “characterization of his meetings with Epstein and others about philanthropy is inaccurate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UdusKk"&gt;One of the big unknowns following the divorce is the future of the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which has just under $50 billion in assets, reportedly making it the second largest charitable foundation in the world. Currently, the foundation plans to pursue a &lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/gates-foundation-trustees-commitment"&gt;two-year trial period&lt;/a&gt; to see if the former couple can continue to work together constructively as co-chairs and trustees. If not, Melinda French Gates will resign from the foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFZgpU"&gt;“In such a case, Melinda would receive personal resources from Bill for her philanthropic work,” said the foundation’s CEO Mark Suzman last month. “These resources would be completely separate from the foundation’s endowment, which would not be affected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMP9vd"&gt;Following the announcement of their divorce, Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates committed an additional $15 billion to the foundation, which will bring its total endowment up to $65 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify is testing a less restrictive ad-supported tier costing $0.99 a month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_aM2-y-aYoWbYTAmN0jOB-eLSps=/1x0:1096x730/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69670663/lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Unlimited skips and on-demand listening’ for $0.99 a month.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ux6RY7"&gt;Spotify Plus is a new $0.99 subscription tier being piloted by the streaming service which combines elements of its existing free and premium tiers. The plan still features ads like Spotify’s free tier, but it doesn’t impose any limits on the number of tracks you can skip per hour. Users are also free to pick which specific songs they want to listen to, rather than mostly being limited to shuffling within albums and playlists. The new Spotify Plus tier is a tenth of the cost of Spotify’s unrestricted ad-free Premium tier, which currently costs $9.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9H3f2T"&gt;Spotify’s free tier has existed in its current form &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17274844/spotify-app-update-free-account-playlist"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t let users skip more than six tracks per hour, and only lets them pick and listen to specific tracks from 15 select playlists, ranging from editorial-selected playlists to algorithmically generated collections like “Discover Weekly” and “Daily Mix.” Outside of these playlists, free users can only listen to shuffled tracks. The new Spotify Plus tier is a relatively cheap way to reduce some of those restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FXpcCY0B-mltBur_nzjPlTu8LsA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22757967/G5zMUN1G7F.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Spotify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify Plus is ad-supported, but comes with a subscription cost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8LJeO5DkFUD6xZ8JzF6hvQtBRQs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22757966/Attachment.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Spotify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In-app ads for the tier have also been appearing for some users.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6pZlqS"&gt;News of the new test tier was initially shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;by a reader (&lt;em&gt;thanks, Gustovo!&lt;/em&gt;) and later confirmed by Spotify in a statement. “We’re always working to enhance the Spotify experience and we routinely conduct tests to inform our decisions,” a spokesperson said. “We’re currently conducting a test of an ad-supported subscription plan with a limited number of our users.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGmjoR"&gt;However, Spotify cautioned that there’s no guarantee that the new tier will launch in its current form. “Some tests end up paving the way for new offerings or enhancements while others may only provide learnings. We don’t have any additional information to share at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wc8D22"&gt;Spotify has a history of testing new features years before they actually launch, if they ever release at all. The best example of this is lossless audio streaming, which Spotify was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/5/15168340/lossless-audio-music-compression-test-spotify-hi-fi-tidal"&gt;testing as far back as 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Although the service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;officially announced its lossless “HiFi” tier&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, it’s still yet to become available. Other tests include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726183/spotify-stories-playlist-snapchat-instagram-christmas-hits"&gt;Snapchat-like stories for select playlists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21346490/spotify-visual-quote-michelle-obama-podcast"&gt;visual quote cards for podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, both of which no longer appear to be visible in the app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Air (late-2020).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including some equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;We’ll run through discounts currently available for the latest MacBook models as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — all of which will be compatible with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; upon its release in the fall — and we’ll also highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15- to 20-percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. For now, however, these are the best MacBook and Mac Mini deals you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;The best MacBook Air deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aqfkV0"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FJU3RG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and a 256G SSD. It typically sells for $999, however, it’s currently &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747531561997035408#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5M7S6K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604825-REG%2Fapple_mgn63ll_a_13_3_macbook_air_with.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; for $899. Both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747532219045612135#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; also have the 512GB configuration on sale in all three colorways for $1,100, a discount of $150.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="V1k8MX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;The best MacBook Pro deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; comes in more sizes and options than the Air, and it’s more geared toward demanding use cases. The base model is the 13-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-powered variant&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a brighter screen and longer battery life compared to the M1 Air. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1,299, but the base model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is on sale for $200 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738975458064148072#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afDps1"&gt;The upgraded version of the 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LH3F7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747532652589677821#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ue6Q0U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="44XxWs"&gt;Of course, you can also buy some older MacBook Pro models, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch mid-2020 model&lt;/a&gt;. The older device features four Thunderbolt ports, Ice Lake processors, a new keyboard, increased RAM, and various storage configurations. Right now, the 13-inch model is available in two configurations at Amazon: one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Pro-10th-Generation-Quad-Core/dp/B08DTPQ9XB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th Gen i7 Intel processor and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $1,999, and one with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB of storage and a 2.0GHz 10th Gen Intel Core i5 processor&lt;/a&gt; for $1,699.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hij1MQ"&gt;If you want a bigger laptop with more horsepower, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2019 MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; is the top-of-the-line model. Compared to its predecessor, it has a better keyboard, newer processors, and improved speakers. Amazon currently has an Intel Core i7 CPU and 512GB of storage configuration in space gray &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FZV45H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale for $2,285&lt;/a&gt;, a $114 discount. There are other configurations available with more storage and quicker processors — for instance, you can also get the 16-inch model with an Intel Core i9 CPU and 1TB of storage &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FTNGNC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $2,300 at Amaz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FV1Y57/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; — but deals are few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjWXtS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10469149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LYpjlZ"&gt;The best Mac mini deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac mini&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the mini features Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. We’ve seen the base model drop to as low as $600, however, the only sizable discounts available right now are at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604799-REG%2Fapple_mgnr3ll_a_mac_mini.html%2F%3Fap%3Dy%26ap%3Dy%26smp%3Dy%26smp%3Dy%26lsft%3DBI%253A514%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwieuGBhAsEiwA1Ly_ncXHhq-iWKpvrfYtFChI-bPVIWkyhdRKI-PNhmoD9yjMSRUfQWhABRoCntMQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, where you can purchase the 256GB Mac mini for $649 and $659, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CpqfyJ"&gt;As for the 512GB model, it’s currently available for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5P7TLW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604800-REG%2Fapple_mgnt3ll_a_mac_mini.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, matching its second-lowest price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RPnQwi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9712859"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>NLRB officer says Amazon violated US labor law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HVzZVwresZ17SjyuZPyEh_BzLHc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69669403/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PfOvie"&gt;An initial assessment from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has recommended workers at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama hold a new election to determine whether to unionize with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). The recommendation comes from the hearing officer assigned to the case and is only a preliminary ruling, but still hands the union a surprising win in a fight that many in the labor movement had considered lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsCO4R"&gt;In April, workers at Amazon’s fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama voted not to unionize &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377142/bessemer-amazon-labor-union-loss-warehouse-rwdsu"&gt;by a margin of more than 2-to-1&lt;/a&gt;. But in the aftermath of the result, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) alleged that Amazon had illegally influenced the drive and petitioned the NLRB to invalidate the result. In particular, the RWDSU raised questions around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22445940/amazon-union-nlrb-hearing-mailbox-bessemer"&gt;a USPS mailbox installed in the fulfillment center parking lot during the drive&lt;/a&gt;. The union alleged it gave some workers the impression that Amazon had improper access to mailed ballots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UH8Xs5"&gt;RWDSU’s defeat opened the door for other unions to announce plans to unionize Amazon workers. On June 24th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549019/teamsters-amazon-union-nationwide-campaign-resolution"&gt;the Teamsters announced a nationwide campaign&lt;/a&gt; to organize Amazon’s sprawling workforce. The teamsters committed to spending “all resources necessary” to make the campaign successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9QUpO"&gt;Now, it appears RWDSU is getting another chance. “Throughout the NLRB hearing, we heard compelling evidence how Amazon tried to illegally interfere with and intimidate workers as they sought to exercise their right to form a union,” said RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum in a statement. “We support the hearing officer’s recommendation that the NLRB set aside the election results and direct a new election...Amazon’s behavior throughout the election process was despicable. Amazon cheated, they got caught, and they are being held accountable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sOu9OG"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLgf6c"&gt;The hearing officer’s recommendation is only a preliminary assessment of the claim, and does not by itself have any legal force. A full ruling will only come when the acting regional director issues a decision for the case, which will likely not occur for serveral weeks. Parties to the case will still have the opportunity to file exceptions in the intervening time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhTvs4"&gt;As the case proceeds, Amazon’s labor issues have spread well beyond Bessemer. In June, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549019/teamsters-amazon-union-nationwide-campaign-resolution"&gt;voted to prioritize organizing efforts&lt;/a&gt; for Amazon delivery drivers, creating a special division to focus on the company’s operations over the next five years. “Amazon workers are calling for safer and better working conditions,” said the project’s director at the time, “and with today’s resolution, we are activating the full force of our union to support them.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There’s now a subscription service for college textbooks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A laptop on a white background. The screen displays a screenshot of Pearson Plus, reading “Welcome, Sarah” and a list of digital textbooks." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bbF-Vo0Z3vgntBZ1lQLfds4KsFU=/0x105:2508x1777/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69669401/Authhome_Air.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Pearson&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4RD0T8"&gt;Pearson, the &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2019-07-15/textbook-giant-pearson-makes-major-shift-away-from-print-to-digital"&gt;largest publisher of college textbooks in the US&lt;/a&gt;, has announced Pearson Plus, a new subscription service for digital textbooks. The Pearson Plus app, available in both mobile and desktop form, will be available on US college campuses this fall and is expected to roll out globally in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7isBIY"&gt;There are two subscription tiers. Enrolled students can pay $9.99 per month to access one textbook at a time or $14.99 per month for access to the company’s full library (a selection of over 1,500 e-books). The app provides various other study aids as well, including flashcards, annotations, and customizable fonts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rlRHpd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pearson Plus app will be available on US college campuses this fall &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WkJCZY"&gt;College textbooks are &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/3/6/18252322/college-textbooks-cost-expensive-pearson-cengage-mcgraw-hill"&gt;a big expense&lt;/a&gt;, and can saddle some students with hundreds of dollars of costs per semester. Pearson is pushing this service as a money-saving measure. The average cost of a digital textbook, Bird estimates, is “anywhere from $40 or $50 to over a couple hundred dollars,” which means students who need two or more Pearson textbooks per semester would feasibly save money by purchasing eight months of the more expensive subscription tier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MWdQKD"&gt;That’s with some caveats, of course. Students can save money on physical textbooks by buying them used, and can recoup some of their value by reselling — both benefits that aren’t available through a digital model. And subscription platforms can always raise their prices, as we’ve seen platforms from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540346/netflix-price-increase-united-states-standard-premium-content-product-features"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348169/disney-price-increase-united-states-bundle-date"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403813/spotify-price-increase-subscriptions-2021"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453776/philo-tv-streaming-service-price-increase"&gt;Philo&lt;/a&gt; do in the past year as their user bases grew. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6Qb1u"&gt;Students will need to make their own calculations based on their courseload, but it’s clear that the value of a Pearson Plus subscription rises with each Pearson textbook a student is assigned. It’s easy to see how the new model, while possibly saving students some cash, could conveniently exert some pressure on professors and departments to slot in more Pearson books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0i7DPy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re moving from transaction to relationship”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rf0GbY"&gt;That may be part of the reason Pearson appears to be targeting a loyal and long-term user base rather than a massive one. “Rather than a rental or purchase, being more transaction-focused, we’re moving from transaction to relationship,” Bird says. “We get insights into their habits over time, they get to use a lot more functionality within the application, and that will lead them and us together into a lifelong career.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ReEYa"&gt;Pearson isn’t the first publisher to try a product like this, and some competitors have hit hurdles. Cengage offers a similar platform, &lt;a href="https://www.cengage.com/unlimited/"&gt;Cengage Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;, priced at $69.99 for four months. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/77639-cengage-answers-lawsuit-over-new-subscription-service.html"&gt;faced lawsuits from authors&lt;/a&gt; claiming that the service altered their compensation structures and negatively impacted their royalties. Bird says that Pearson has worked this out in advance. “How we deal with royalties and compensation, that’s all been part of active discussion during the development of this app,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vizio’s free streaming service WatchFree Plus gets a new look and more channels</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vizio’s free streaming service WatchFree Plus.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Vizio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u5VrbI"&gt;Vizio has revamped its WatchFree streaming experience, given it a brand new look, and tacked a “plus” on the end of its service’s title. (Because if a streaming service doesn’t include the symbol, does it even really count?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFi11B"&gt;With the update &lt;a href="https://investors.vizio.com/news/news-details/2021/VIZIOs-WatchFree-Delivers-a-New-Look-New-Channels-and-More-Entertainment-for-Live-TV/default.aspx"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; today, the service formerly known as WatchFree is getting new navigation features to improve search and discovery of free content with recommendations that cater to a viewer’s individual interest. Plus, its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vizio.com%2Fen%2Fchannel-list-landing-page&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F2%2F22606634%2Fvizio-watchfree-plus-rebrand" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;live programming guide&lt;/a&gt; now offers hundreds of free channels across a surprisingly comprehensive number of genres — everything from comedy and sports to a lengthy list of entertainment channels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e75DJkFjys2smTQpvOrKnlpRZ2Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22757201/WF__3TVs.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vizio’s revamped WatchFree Plus service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Zvmune"&gt;In addition, Vizio’s WatchFree Plus program guide now includes a “featured” category for seasonal content, themed collections, so-called “pop-up” channels (or hubs for limited-time programming) as well as Vizio-exclusive, custom-curated channels (these include one called Fork &amp;amp; Flight for food content and Vizio Investigations, its crime channel). Users with Vizio’s voice-enabled remote can navigate the program guide that way, or the guide can be voice-navigated through the SmartCast Mobile for iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09NnG7"&gt;According to Vizio, its free and ad-supported streaming service is one of the top content sources on its SmartCast TVs. And data about viewing habits — which is &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/vizio-q1-earnings-inscape-013937337.html"&gt;core to its ad business&lt;/a&gt; — was “key” to the WatchFree Plus redesign, the company said. Users who wish to opt-out of Vizio’s data collection about watch habits or delete viewing data can do so from the “reset and admin” menu from their system settings. Detailed instructions on finding the setting can be &lt;a href="https://support.vizio.com/s/article/Smart-Interactivity-Broadcast-Interactivity-FAQ-How-to-turn-Smart-Interactivity-Broadcast-Interactivity-on-or-off?language=en_US"&gt;found right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KfFhiD"&gt;“WatchFree+ provides audiences with access to the channels and programming you expect with cable, but in a free streaming environment that makes it easy to personalize and customize the entertainment experience,” Katherine Pond, vice president of business development at Vizio, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0b7sTV"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model — and the highest end — is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and cellular connectivity, which starts at $399. If that seems too expensive, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which also launched in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, there’s the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZqOTAE"&gt;The highlights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bRFJnd"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3 (38mm, GPS): $169 at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;s&gt;$199&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lREHEL"&gt;Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS, white): $249 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XX59T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F555062032%3Fselected%3Dtrue%26irgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_xzpTrIW%253AoxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkBwh-RgExnTVM0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DxzpTrIW%253AoxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkBwh-RgExnTVM0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals060721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;s&gt;$279&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BR7xFN"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6 (40mm, GPS, red): $329 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-Sport-Band-Regular%2F478251261%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; ($&lt;s&gt;399&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="ParVAK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to install the watchOS 8 public beta","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22558944/watchos-beta-install-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent price. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and excellent build quality, especially if the SE and Series 6 seem out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $169 at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-38mm-Silver-Aluminium/dp/B07K37HKT8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in either white or black, which is $31 off its usual price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-38mm-Space-Aluminium/dp/B07K3HG6T9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have knocked the price down from $229 to $199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s flagship, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qq3ebV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ikPbUG"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped white version of the SE for $249 at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XX59T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F555062032%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Both retailers are also currently offering the same model in black for $269 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5W9QWZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Space-Gray-Aluminum-Case-with-Black-Sport-Band-Regular%2F585668092%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;), a $10 discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDCEnn"&gt;If you’re looking for the larger GPS model, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=38733&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-44mm%2Fprod25100056" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club has several configurations&lt;/a&gt; of the 44mm model available for $300, a slight discount exclusive to members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rUGNYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Apple Watch Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Right now, deals are relatively scarce on the Series 6. If you don’t mind a bit of vibrancy on your wrist, however, the 40mm, GPS-enabled red configuration is on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-Sport-Band-Regular%2F478251261%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $329. Other color configurations of the 40mm model are also available at both Walmart and Amazon for $349, though, availability is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8KuZ3"&gt;If you prefer the larger, 44mm model, it’s available in red at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $349, slightly more than its best-ever price. Other colorways, including both the &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F253347819%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F351352991%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white models&lt;/a&gt;, are also available for $379, an 11 percent discount.&lt;/p&gt;
