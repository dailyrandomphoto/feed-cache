    <title>Netflix trans employees and allies release a list of demands ahead of the walkout</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UK_wUCbkUiVNTS8NWzUf0W9UOP4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012262/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TYddrX"&gt;The trans employee resource group at Netflix has released a list of demands for the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723592/netflix-trans-employees-walkout-statements-ceo"&gt;ahead of Wednesday’s walkout&lt;/a&gt;. “We want the company to adopt measures in the areas of content investment, employee relations and safety, and harm reduction, all of which are necessary to avoid future instances of platforming transphobia and hate speech,” employees wrote in a press release, which has not yet been made public but was supplied to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QL7YQ1"&gt;The news comes after weeks of controversy due to Netflix executives continuing to support Dave Chappelle and his comedy special &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt;, which many LGBTQ people and allies have criticized as transphobic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dll4A6"&gt;Last week, Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728337/netflix-fires-organizer-trans-employee-walkout-dave-chappelle"&gt;fired a leader of the trans ERG&lt;/a&gt; who was helping to organize the walkout. The company said this worker had leaked confidential information. Internally, that reasoning has been disputed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBDkaE"&gt;While the conversation has become mired in a “culture wars” dispute over censorship and hate speech, none of the demands involve taking down the comedy special. Employees want Netflix to allow the trans ERG to take on a bigger role in internal conversations surrounding potentially harmful content, hire trans and nonbinary executives, and eliminate imagery of transphobic content in the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1aYqnW"&gt;Read the full letter from Netflix employees below:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 8 biggest announcements from Apple’s Unleashed event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OfDU8_9BVz4X7gZiilIOCbROSGc=/156x0:1320x776/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012195/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_10.02.24_AM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="txvrRb"&gt;Apple has just finished its October 2021 event, which was full of news and announcements from the company — including the long-awaited M1-equipped MacBook Pros. There was a whole lot of news, so if you want to get caught up on the biggest updates from the show, you can catch up with our roundup right here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QBf07U1f3SfXY1GBn0qf4vnlNZI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936637/1Rm4aV2YiD.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new MacBook Pros.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oDUSLU"&gt;Apple announced two MacBook Pros with an all-new design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6PJZD2"&gt;Apple revealed a brand-new set of MacBook Pros, available in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;14-inch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;16-inch&lt;/a&gt; models. The Touch Bar is gone, replaced with a full-size function row. Many ports are back; there’s an HDMI port, three Thunderbolt ports, an SD card slot, a headphone jack, and the return of the MagSafe charger. The 14-inch model starts at $1,999, while the 16-inch model starts at $2,499. They will be &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/2r5oMg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available to preorder Monday&lt;/a&gt; ahead of availability next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8EtEO"&gt;And you might notice one thing at the top of the new laptops...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BXCdp6RCX3z2eHAgNLW-3ti8wZ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936649/lcimg_dbbf28e3_568c_48d1_8c66_10.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look at that notch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sGfu6w"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"&gt;The new MacBook Pros have a notch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gWfZo4"&gt;Apple has brought over the notch design from the iPhone to the new MacBook Pros, though it houses an improved 1080p FaceTime camera. Let the notch debates begin anew. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple announced the M1 Pro chip on Monday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TInW4E"&gt;

&lt;p id="MipQsG"&gt;Apple announced its next two custom chips, dubbed the M1 Pro and M1 Max. They seem like they’ll be beefy chips, as Apple says the Pro has more than 33 billion transistors, while the Max has 57 billion transistors. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1HqOev_42l88bd058rnxYl2c8O0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936672/lcimg_c10580c7_99e5_4c68_aa75_9ad82322596e.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p id="KnVovk"&gt;Apple’s new MacBook Pros use the company’s adaptive refresh rate technology, ProMotion, topping out at up to 120Hz refresh rates. They’re also lit by Mini LEDs, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;2021 12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AGk2HI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733119/apple-new-macbook-pro-magsafe-back"&gt;MagSafe has returned to the new MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="D1H6yk"&gt;Apple’s beloved MagSafe magnetic charger is back with the new MacBook Pros. Apple is calling it MagSafe 3. The company says the new computers can charge up to 50 percent in 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HKCg1OBx1T-M1e7Xd8zlVn1F94g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936558/lcimg_7a256b51_4297_4b70_a2f6_c52dcd574ef5.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p id="bMB5j7"&gt;Apple launched a new version of its popular AirPods headphones. They look a lot like the AirPods Pro, but they don’t have interchangeable tips. The new headphones support spatial audio and are sweat- and water-resistant. You can &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/EaeLJe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder them Monday for $179&lt;/a&gt;, and they will be available next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="odGqjI"&gt;Apple is introducing new colors to the HomePod Mini — the smart speaker will now also be available in yellow, orange, and blue. They’ll retail for the same &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/kjMyZn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99 price starting in November&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>macOS Monterey is officially launching on October 25th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/orse-py0bHdXG97r9KiIu70nQRs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012089/akrales_20210515_4583_0105.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LjQqvB"&gt;Following several beta releases, Apple announced that the next version of its macOS software, macOS Monterey, is about to release. It’ll be rolling out as an update starting on Monday, October 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Dr8m8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;My colleague Monica Chin previewed the public beta software&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, highlighting Monterey’s improvements to Facetime. The software will bring other exciting features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;SharePlay and Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;, which will enable Mac and iPad users to move files seamlessly between devices, but perhaps not at launch. &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-unveils-game-changing-macbook-pro/"&gt;In its press release for the new, redesigned MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, Apple says that those features are coming “later this fall.” Additionally, Apple made significant tweaks to Safari, its own web browser, for Monterey, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686070/apple-macos-safari-tab-groups-redesign-change-back"&gt;it has since toned down some of the changes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new M1 MacBook Pros are the first with mini LED 120Hz refresh displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1MqkmUqKiGp2FPD73T754i2UGx4=/147x0:1761x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012080/lcimg_81296345_e747_40c4_9960_c33954de9718.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nv7fDm"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;has just announced&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;redesigned MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, powered by its newly revealed M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, and featuring a huge jump in display technology for the company’s laptops, with Mini LED displays that support Apple’s 120Hz ProMotion technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncpost-list-post-content-2857077"&gt;The larger 16-inch MacBook Pro has a 16.2-inch display with a 3456 x 2234 resolution, while the 14-inch model has a 14.2-inch panel at 3024 x 1964. Both sizes feature the same Mini LED technology that Apple debuted on the iPad Pro earlier this year, which offers local dimming on a level beyond traditional LED displays (although it’s still not quite on the level of OLED panels used by competitors like Samsung.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncpost-list-post-content-2857105"&gt;The new displays also feature Apple’s 120Hz “ProMotion” technology, which allows for faster refresh rates. Apple says that the computers will automatically adjust the refresh rate based on what you’re doing (for example, dropping the refresh rate when your screen is static). It’ll also offer the option for users to set locked in refresh rates, which is important for video editing or other use cases that rely on specific screen settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWbfsB"&gt;The new Mini LED screens are brighter, too, offering 1000 nits of sustained brightness with 1600 peak brightness and a 1 million to 1 contrast ratio, and the same Liquid Retina XDR that Apple uses for its Pro Display XDR monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dZtBLSYqGtW50E00yitrJXFp4o4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936684/lcimg_c10580c7_99e5_4c68_aa75_9ad82322596e.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQrEvE"&gt;The new displays also offer thinner bezels, although that comes at a cost: a iPhone-style &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"&gt;notch for the main camera&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple MacBook Pro ports with MagSafe 3&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dk4qTX"&gt;Other than their M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;14-inch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;16-inch&lt;/a&gt; computers ditch the much-hated Touch Bar in favor of physical keys and bring back the additional ports (HDMI, SDXC) power users love. A less familiar addition is the new notch atop those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733122/apple-macbook-pro-mini-led-display-120hz-promotion-refresh-rates"&gt;Mini LED-packed 120Hz displays&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2Nebi"&gt;But for the clumsy people with cable-strewn desks, the return of MagSafe — what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;we’ve seen on iPhones&lt;/a&gt; just isn’t the same — might be the most important feature. According to Apple, the new MacBook Pros can still charge via USB-C Thunderbolt, but the updated MagSafe 3 plug delivers more power than before. Without providing detailed specs, Apple says that with fast charging, the MacBook Pro can charge up to 50 percent in just 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2IP0P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foxconn reveals three ‘Foxtron’-branded electric vehicle prototypes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pIjHDjq0aADb-NnbCPzAtYmyunw=/0x0:3868x2579/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012028/foxconn_model_e.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Foxtron Model E sedan.&lt;/em&gt; | Images: Foxconn&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jifjLR"&gt;iPhone assembler Foxconn has &lt;a href="https://www.foxconn.com/en-us/press-center/press-releases/latest-news/694"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; three prototype electric vehicles as part of its effort to become a major player in the automotive industry. The Taiwanese conglomerate showed off an SUV it calls the Model C, a sedan it calls the Model E, and a bus dubbed the Model T, all under a new “Foxtron” branding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ssilst"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/article/20140609/OEM02/306099974/why-ford-just-said-no-when-musk-tried-to-put-the-e-in-sex"&gt;Ford may take issue with the naming convention&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn’t seem that Foxconn plans to make these specific vehicles itself. Rather, it wants them to be seen as reference designs, examples of the types of vehicles that can be built on the EV platform it’s been developing, and advertisements for the automotive components and software it plans to sell. In fact, Foxconn didn’t even build the prototypes — the were made by Taiwanese automaker Yulun Motor, which Foxconn announced as the first customer for its platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVHhqa"&gt;“Our biggest challenge is we don’t know how to make cars,” Foxconn chairman Young Liu &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/18/business/foxconn-unveils-prototypes-as-it-pushes-to-become-an-electric-car-maker.html"&gt;said at the event held Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yC6bzhpuxFmyPavZXGBT-3O6JIE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936591/foxconn_model_c_suv.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Model C SUV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Rhoa1"&gt;Still, Foxconn is making big claims about the capabilities of its platform. The company says the Model E can travel 750 kilometers (about 466 miles) on a single charge, and hit 100 kilometers an hour in under 3 seconds. The Model C tops out at 700km (435 miles) and is about a second slower to 100km. Foxconn says the bus has already gone through hundreds of thousands of kilometers’ worth of testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWItqG"&gt;Foxconn has spent more than a year talking about the great ambitions it has to become a player in the automotive world, part of a bid to diversify away from phones, laptops, and other consumer electronics. Liu has said he wants to have Foxconn’s tech inside five percent of all electric vehicles made by 2025. It’s entering an ever-crowding field, though, as traditional&lt;a href="https://www.magna.com/company/newsroom/releases/release/2018/03/02/news-release---first-ever-all-electric-jaguar-unveiled-at-magna"&gt; top-tier suppliers like Magna&lt;/a&gt; are already building electric vehicles for other automakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNS8pU"&gt;Alongside its own efforts, Foxconn has also struck up deals with (or made investments in) an array of other automakers, supply chain companies, and electric vehicle startups. Most recently, Foxconn announced a plan to buy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702322/lordstown-motors-foxconn-ohio-electric-vehicles"&gt;a former General Motors factory&lt;/a&gt; from struggling EV startup Lordstown Motors for $230 million. Foxconn has said it will mass produce Lordstown Motors’ electric pickup truck and also use some of the factory space to build other EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZoPsyKfOnpe59vFVMhwOUZsf9-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936592/foxconn_model_t_bus.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Model T bus.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="p0Vwmp"&gt;Foxconn has strategic deals with China’s largest private automaker, Geely, as well as Fisker Inc., another EV startup. Some of its bets have already fizzled out, though — Foxconn &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/Apple-supplier-Foxconn-s-EV-project-with-China-s-Byton-halted"&gt;recently stopped working with Byton&lt;/a&gt;, after throwing the troubled Chinese EV startup what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212994/byton-foxconn-electric-vehicles-china-shutdown-extended"&gt;appeared to be a lifeline in early 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7jYn9"&gt;Foxconn is one of the biggest tech companies in the world, but it has become infamous for failing to execute on some big international expansions. What was supposed to be a massive, multibillion-dollar LCD factory in Wisconsin, for instance, is still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;mostly just empty buildings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces 16-inch MacBook Pro with new M1 Pro and M1 Max processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q3n76A8lOcCeTxI7UKOuQ0M1CsQ=/147x0:1761x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012026/lcimg_982af7b3_d14a_4a82_8073_a94b6e73fdd5.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a2xXc9"&gt;Apple has introduced its new 16-inch MacBook Pro, promising an upgrade in both design and performance. Models &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/NK054v" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will be available&lt;/a&gt; in silver and space gray next week, with a starting price of $2,499.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvKeTJ"&gt;The new Pro is configurable with the M1 Pro and the M1 Max, Apple’s new 10-core processors with eight “high-performance” cores and two “high-efficiency” cores. The M1 Max has double the Pro’s GPU cores (32 to the Pro’s 16) and double the memory bandwidth, as well as 64GB of unified memory (the Pro has 32GB). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyW7Ra"&gt;The chassis has also received a modern redesign. The device is 4.7 pounds and 16.8mm thick, with a 16.2-inch display. The Touch Bar has been replaced by physical keys, and there’s an HDMI port on the right side in addition to a Thunderbolt 4 port and an SD slot, with a headphone jack and two Thunderbolt 4 ports on the left. It’s the most connectivity we’ve ever seen from a Mac notebook, according to Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AhRU2Y"&gt;The first MacBook Pro 16 debuted in November 2019. It had a very similar design to previous 15-inch MacBook Pros and was powered by Intel’s 9th Gen processors (which are now two generations old). Reviewers praised its outstanding keyboard and audio, in addition to its power, but moaned about the limited connectivity — there were only two Thunderbolt ports on each side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9PJKn7"&gt;There’s a new 1080p camera, which Apple says delivers twice the low-light performance of previous MacBook shooters. A new six-speaker sound system supports Spatial Audio, and a Liquid Retina XDR display delivers up to a claimed 1,600 nits of peak brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlngy4"&gt;The M1 Pro and M1 Max have big shoes to fill. The M1 chip that Apple announced last November (which now powers the MacBook Air, the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the Mac Mini, the iPad Pro, and the 2021 iMac) has blown competing offerings out of the water when it comes to processing power, efficiency, and integrated graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHtxSE"&gt;But customers have been waiting for Apple to release processor workstation machines, including the 16-inch MacBook Pro and a potential successor to the 27-inch iMac. It’s safe to say that many people are eagerly awaiting this MacBook Pro — not just to purchase for themselves but to see whether the M1 Max will take the laptop market by storm in the same way its predecessor did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kyaonQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new MacBook Pro has a notch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3CMwp32ZFRWfA8RZUAGz44A4bc=/25x0:1936x1274/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012024/Apple_MacBook_Pro_16_inch_Photoshop_10182021.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple is bringing the notch to its pro laptops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="koVG91"&gt;Apple is adding a notch on the display of its new MacBook Pro models. It’s a cut-out that will house the camera system, much like how Apple moved to a notch design for its iPhone X launch in 2017. The surprising addition of the notch comes in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;new 14-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;16-inch models&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are equipped with updated Apple M1 silicon inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPNtvK"&gt;Both the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are completely redesigned, and the bezels have been trimmed down thanks to this notch. The bezels at the side are 3.5mm — that’s 24 percent thinner than before — and up top, it’s 60 percent thinner. The macOS menu bar now wraps around the camera, and it seems to look a lot better with dark mode enabled so the notch isn’t as noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VclukdteJZcAKm5pKIUsCkFv9Co=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936661/lcimg_7b103112_618c_43ac_9065_3dc630fdc9f6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The webcam inside the MacBook Pro’s notch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q8nZA4"&gt;The camera inside this notch is now improved, too. It’s 1080p with a wider aperture and a larger image sensor that should provide better low-light performance. Apple is using computational video on this webcam, including noise reduction, machine learning-based face detection, local tone mapping, auto white balance, auto exposure, and smart HDR features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObG3rp"&gt;Yet despite all these improvements, it’s still just a regular webcam and Apple hasn’t added Face ID here. Apple justified its move to a notch on the iPhone X with the introduction of Face ID, but the notch here appears to be more about shrinking display bezels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULZIM9"&gt;The 14-inch is also 120Hz with HDR support, so you do get a big jump in fluidity for the notch. Apple is also adding an SD card slot, HDMI port, and more hardware improvements. You can read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;more about the new 14-inch MacBook Pro here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces new 14-inch MacBook Pro with a notch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W8Gu1yCl8X5f8qVymayXFLwwadY=/121x0:1414x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012007/1Rm4aV2YiD.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pzYFl7"&gt;Apple has announced a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-14-and-16/"&gt;redesigned MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which now includes a 14-inch screen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;Apple’s new M1 Pro and Max chips&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"&gt;a notch&lt;/a&gt;, and a wider selection of ports in addition to the standard Thunderbolt ones — it brings back the HDMI port and SD card reader and adds a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733119/apple-new-macbook-pro-magsafe-back"&gt;MagSafe 3 connector&lt;/a&gt; for charging (though you can also charge it with the Thunderbolt ports if your house is littered with USB-C power bricks). It starts at $1,999 and &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/2r5oMg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can be ordered “today.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDMM04"&gt;It has a 14.2” 120Hz ProMotion MiniLED display, which Apple is branding as “Liquid Retina Pro XDR.” It has slimmer bezels than the previous generation but also includes a notch, which houses a 1080p webcam but not Apple’s FaceID system. Resolution-wise, the 14-inch model runs at 3024 by 1964, and it can run at 1000 nits sustained brightness and 1600 nits peak brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Us2bE3UcOL_fZMs34b7JaofcLbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936646/lcimg_dbbf28e3_568c_48d1_8c66_10c4149e89fe.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jWI2Zn"&gt;You can configure the 14-inch MacBook Pro with Apple’s new M1 Pro or M1 Max chips. Both feature 10 CPU cores — the Pro can have a 14- or 16-core GPU, while the Max has 24- and 32-core GPU options. The new MacBook Pro comes with 16GB of RAM standard, and you can upgrade to 32GB with the M1 Pro, or 64 GB with the M1 Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAsG6B"&gt;In addition to all the new (well, returning) ports, the 14-inch MacBook Pro ads a third Thunderbolt port compared to its 13-inch counterpart. The Thunderbolt ports are now Thunderbolt 4, an upgrade from the Thunderbolt 3 ports on the previous models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McMzX0"&gt;The redesign is the first major one in Apple’s pro laptop lineup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13490774/apple-macbook-pro-review-2016-13-inch-laptop"&gt;since 2016&lt;/a&gt;, the year that brought ill-fated butterfly keyboards, the Touch Bar, and Thunderbolt 3 as the standard and only port type (with the exception of a headphone jack, of course). It also marks the return of the mid-size 14-inch screen, which Apple hasn’t put on a laptop since the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook#iBook_G4_(%22Snow%22)"&gt;2005 iBook G4&lt;/a&gt;.  Mainly, though, this laptop seems to be an about-face from Apple — the 2016 redesign ditched the ports, and now they’re back. Apple also added the Touch Bar in 2016, and that’s also been replaced by a set of function keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="beNUXV"&gt;It’s nice to see Apple more clearly differentiating the smaller MacBook Pros. The lineup has been a bit confusing for the past few years — the two-port MacBook Pro and four-port 13-inch computers were awkwardly lumped together but were pretty different computers with different processors and prices. Now, the screen size difference makes the distinction clear: people looking for portability can get the Air or 13-inch Pro, and the 14-inch Pro exists for those looking for more horsepower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMgpXS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22495680"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Pro event live blog &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s HomePod Mini gets three new color options</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j-UNdDcp-UybRFWpka5uG0XEIwY=/235x0:2766x1687/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011946/Apple_HomePod_mini_hero_5up_10182021.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s HomePod Mini ... now in color&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0FT5Ir"&gt;With Siri now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22720890/siri-voice-control-ecobee-smart-thermostats"&gt;socializing on other smart speakers&lt;/a&gt;, Apple took to the stage at its October event to announce a new look for its HomePod Mini smart speaker. In addition to white and black (space gray), you will soon be able to pick up a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;HomePod Mini&lt;/a&gt; in yellow, orange, and blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dctHY3"&gt;Apple is catching up with the competition here. Google’s Nest Mini smart speakers have blue and orange options, and there’s also a blue Amazon’s Echo Dot, plus some fun animal-themed colors offered on the Echo Dot Kids edition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ql281U"&gt;The new speakers will have color-matched details throughout, including the tinted touch surface, the fabric mesh, volume icons, and that (non-removable) power cable. They will cost the same as the original Minis, $99, and will &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/kjMyZn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;be available in November&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HomePod Minis will work with the new Apple Music Voice streaming service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CNJ104"&gt;The Mini will work with the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733053/apple-music-voice-plan-playlists-price-siri"&gt;Apple Music Voice&lt;/a&gt; subscription, which Apple also announced at the event. This is a cheaper tier of Apple’s music streaming service that you access just using your voice; it arrives later this year for $4.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
