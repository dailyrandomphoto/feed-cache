    <title>Twitter’s Super Follows could run into an App Store problem</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VAZkit"&gt;The launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651138/twitter-super-follow-launch-subscription-ios"&gt;Super Follows&lt;/a&gt; marked the beginning of the end for truly free content on Twitter, and the start of whatever Patreon-infused future lays ahead for the microblogging app. Supporting creators directly with monthly payments isn’t a bad thing, but as app researcher &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1433372120080261120?s=20"&gt;Jane Manchun Wong spotted on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, the way they currently work on iOS is a little weird — each Super Follow subscription is an individual App Store in-app purchase (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/02/each-twitter-super-follow-in-app-purchase/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUWukA"&gt;You can see for yourself by pulling up &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271"&gt;the App Store on an Apple device or the web&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter currently only lists 10 in-app subscriptions of various prices, each associated with Super Following an individual creator. Wong speculates only 10 are shown because the App Store isn’t designed to show as many in-app purchases as Twitter is currently offering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IvCY2nkG0JeTKAOQuHZsLp5hbCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823505/Screenshot_2021_09_02_12.23.35_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt;s Super Follow subscriptions listed as in-app purchases on the App Store.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lbsXOb"&gt;There seems to be some truth to that, and an additional problem: Apple only allows for &lt;a href="https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/devb57be10e7"&gt;“10,000 in-app purchase products” per developer account&lt;/a&gt;. Even with &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/super-follows-policy"&gt;Twitter’s eligibility requirements&lt;/a&gt; for Super Follows (among them, having 10,000 followers), it really seems like that might prove to be an issue as more people use the features, especially with the launch of other paid products like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644283/twitter-ticketed-spaces-live-audio-test"&gt;Ticketed Spaces&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22464291/twitter-blue-subscription-service-canada-australia-undo-reader-mode"&gt;Twitter Blue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPX6qV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitch-live-game-streaming/id460177396"&gt;Other apps like Twitch&lt;/a&gt; have found ways around the in-app purchase product limits by selling subscription tokens that can be repeatedly purchased and offered to creators. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has contacted Twitter to see if it plans to change how Super Follows are currently implemented. We will update when we learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ex0fdw"&gt;Whether or not Twitter’s current arrangement for Super Follows proves to be a problem depends entirely on how popular the feature ends up being. Twitter’s trying a lot of new features, but they don’t all have to necessarily stick (or make sense) to matter. Some, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;like Fleets&lt;/a&gt;— which Twitter killed off after less than a year— will effectively self-yeet due to lack of popularity anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FAA grounds Virgin Galactic’s core spaceship pending probe into Richard Branson’s flight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WUR5G4"&gt;Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo is grounded until the Federal Aviation Administration completes and signs off on an investigation into the company’s high-profile test flight carrying Richard Branson, the agency said Thursday. During that July flight, Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo veered out of its approved airspace on its descent toward land, the FAA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7Kl0o"&gt;The company “may not return the SpaceShipTwo vehicle to flight until the FAA approves the final mishap investigation report or determines the issues related to the mishap do not affect public safety,” an FAA spokesperson said on Thursday. SpaceShipTwo, a winged suborbital space tourism plane that launches to the edge of space from a carrier aircraft, landed its crew of Branson and three company employees safely. But it wasn’t until this week — nearly two months later — that the public learned the mission wasn’t as successful as the company made it out to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GRU8e"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-red-warning-light-on-richard-bransons-space-flight"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Yorker &lt;/em&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; published on Wednesday first revealed the FAA investigation and found that the two pilots for Unity 22, the formal name for the mission, had been alerted to yellow and red warning lights during the ship’s rocket-powered ascent to space. Those lights, &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; reported, indicated the spaceship wasn’t ascending vertically enough to be able to free-glide back with enough momentum to land after reaching space. As the spaceship was returning, it veered out of its Air Traffic Control airspace, prompting an FAA investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-TOURISM-BEZOS-BRANSON" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H0nzhC9CXhUwv0SiLItNdhjBXU8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823680/1233924079.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Branson and Virgin Galactic employees celebrate the Unity 22 mission after returning from space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gv5op2"&gt;Virgin Galactic, a publicly traded space tourism company that billionaire Richard Branson founded in 2004, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652887/faa-investigating-virgin-galactic-richard-branson"&gt;said late Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that the FAA probe “has no impact on future test flights,” even as the probe remains active. FAA investigations into unexpected in-flight events, like Virgin Galactic’s, keep future flights grounded until the agency’s inquiry is complete and any potential corrections are made by the company. Virgin Galactic didn’t respond to a request for clarification on how it concluded the incomplete probe wouldn’t impact its next test flight, Unity 23, which is slated for sometime in the next month. That flight will carry three members of the Italian Air Force as the company’s first revenue-generating mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgnL0s"&gt;“The FAA is responsible for protecting the public during commercial space transportation launch and reentry operations,” the agency’s statement added, clarifying its role in spaceflight safety as Virgin Galactic &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/virgingalactic/status/1433424970223276035?s=20"&gt;started advertising Unity 23&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8DKIw"&gt;The Unity 22 mission on July 11th was one of Virgin Galactic’s most publicized and celebrated flights. It was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/17/22573791/space-tourism-industry-bezos-branson-musk-billionaire-phase"&gt;key marketing event&lt;/a&gt; to prove the company’s core spaceship is safe for paying customers to fly, and a lavish spectacle as Branson, a 71-year-old daredevil entrepreneur, fulfilled his long-held goal to get a taste of space. Branson was poised to fly on a later mission but opted to fly on Unity 22 instead shortly after rival billionaire Jeff Bezos announced he’d fly his company Blue Origin’s rocket to space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPUKEo"&gt;The mission event was filled with theatrics, some of which were misleading: A video that made it look like Branson biked to Spaceport America on the morning of his spaceflight was actually pre-recorded a week prior. “We regret the error and any confusion it may have caused,” the company &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/virgin-galactic-acknowledges-bransons-pre-launch-bike-ride-never-happened-2021-07-13/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFXVsD"&gt;And amid all the pomp and circumstance, which included a live performance from Khalid and Branson popping a bottle of champagne on stage upon returning from space, there was no mention of the aircraft’s deviation from its approved airspace, or anything about the red light warnings seen by the pilots. According to the New Yorker story, the FAA didn’t immediately get notified of the mishap by Virgin Galactic either. The company acknowledged it didn’t “initially” tell the FAA of SpaceShipTwo’s airspace deviation, and said it’s working with the FAA to update how it alerts the agency to future mishaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPuCCN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch Series 7 may have new watchfaces to take advantage of bigger screens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A new Apple Watch watch face" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/myhnsQc4kRDXAiG6XP0LruvP6QE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69810488/vpavic_200929_4216_0171.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yD9iC1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s &lt;/em&gt;Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-02/apple-s-bigger-watch-will-jam-more-data-than-ever-on-your-wrist?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;shared more details Thursday&lt;/a&gt; about what to expect from the rumored &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;bigger screens&lt;/a&gt; coming to the next Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPk4uv"&gt;Gurman has &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-29/who-will-replace-tim-cook-as-the-next-ceo-of-apple-aapl-ksxiq29z"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the next watch, which he says will be called the Apple Watch Series 7, will be offered in 41mm and 45mm screen sizes. In his new article, he reiterated those sizes and added that the larger model’s screen will measure 1.9 inches diagonally, up from 1.78 inches on the bigger Series 6, and offer about 16 percent more pixels with a resolution of 396 x 484, up from 368 x 448. Both Series 7 watches will also have thinner borders around their screens, Gurman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mfR9IH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple is working on new watchfaces&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GLmiPO"&gt;Apple is also working on new watchfaces. One, called Modular Max, will apparently show the time, one small complication, and then have larger complications that “span the length of the screen stacked on top of each other below,” Gurman says. Another, which Gurman says goes by the name of Atlas and World Timer internally at Apple, “will let a user see all 24 time zones simultaneously.” One, called Continuum, will “change based on the flow of time and the current hour.” Apple is also working on new watchfaces for its Apple Watches made in partnership with Hermes and Nike. Some of these may ship with the Series 7, according to Gurman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="enV59t"&gt;As Gurman has said previously, he reiterated that the Series 7 will have a faster processor and a new case with flatter edges. However, production issues &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;reported Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; could mean the Series 7 is delayed or in short supply when it’s available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gBKZs"&gt;Apple plans to announce the new watches “as soon as this month,” Gurman says. That timeline would line up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21430844/apple-event-recap-biggest-announcements-watch-series-6-se-ipad-air"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20847477/new-apple-watch-series-5-2019-always-on-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Labor Day 2021 TV deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NhDrIiKtRgjE6OJmLVzuo_MMsyQ=/0x20:1440x980/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69810478/samsung_tv.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TajWIq"&gt;Labor Day in the US is a great opportunity to get deals on many types of tech products. Of course, we’re covering all of the best discounts across categories in our detailed guide to the best Labor Day sales, but we’ve made this post just to focus on the many 4K TV deals happening this weekend. There are deals on value-focused models that make it easy to get started right away with streaming TV and movie content, as well as TVs that have high-end features and a higher cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iv1ies"&gt;The best Labor Day deals on affordable 4K TVs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9AtFjV"&gt;TCL is usually known for TVs that come with Roku TV hardware built-in, but has started more recently to put out models that run on Android TV. Not to be confused with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22616941/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-price-specs"&gt;the even newer Google TV-equipped models&lt;/a&gt; that have a microphone built into the TV, you can get the 55-inch version of its mid-range 4-Series for $430 at Best Buy (normally $500). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vmprby"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10732342"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LYcP37"&gt;For an even bigger TV, Hisense’s A6G 4K model sells for a similar price to the TCL above, and also runs on Android TV software. This model has a 60Hz refresh rate display, but it features an auto low-latency mode for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mYBfFR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10265690"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YQEkOu"&gt;The best Labor Day deals on high-end 4K TVs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eIwSX6"&gt;Sony’s 55-inch Bravia XR LED 4K TV — which has full-array backlighting for more accurate lighting, particularly when handling darker scenes — is $1,200 at Best Buy, a cool $100 off its normal list price. This TV has a 120Hz refresh rate and one of its four HDMI ports is HDMI 2.1, supporting 4K resolution at up to 120 frames per second. And it ships with Google TV software built-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vo0aYj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10732366"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P2CHSa"&gt;For a TV that doesn’t actually look like a conventional display, check out Samsung’s Frame TV. It’s designed to look like, well, you’ve probably already guessed it. The Frame is a competent TV, though, with a 120Hz refresh rate, but its more noteworthy feature is that it can display art while in ambient mode to become more of a conversation piece than a conversation killer. Right now, the 55-inch model is available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749927639433300823#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for just shy of $1,300, its second-best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVVLmD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iLqhEk"&gt;If you want an OLED without an obscenely high price tag, a good place to start is with LG’s A1. The 55-inch version is $300 off its usual $1,600 price at Best Buy, and, unlike the pricier C1, the A1 has a 60Hz refresh rate display. That’s not a flaw if you primarily plan to watch movies or TV on your new TV, but gamers may want the 120Hz refresh rate screen in the C1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H2PdLO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10596459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0eBk5v"&gt;That said, if you have an extra $200 or so to spend, you should upgrade to the C1 for that 120Hz refresh rate. Normally $1,800, it’s currently $1,497 at Amazon and just a few dollars more at Best Buy. This is one of LG’s finest 2020 OLED models, complete with HDMI 2.1 ports that can display up to 4K resolution and 120 frames per second with some games and consoles. It’s also Nvidia G-Sync-ready, if you plan to connect it to a powerful gaming PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HCIfNh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10618444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="uG1JAH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t6nGv8"&gt;Amazon is planning to expand its in-house moderation team for Amazon Web Services, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-amazon-ceo-unveils-55000-tech-jobs-first-hiring-push-under-his-watch-2021-09-01/"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Citing two sources within the company, the report says Amazon is planning to develop a proactive threat monitoring capability within AWS, which will seek out prohibited content on AWS servers and remove it before it’s reported by users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBZerL"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gaRVWu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Companies need to proactively monitor what’s on their platforms”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pKLHRK"&gt;The company has long maintained &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aup/"&gt;an Acceptable Use Policy for AWS&lt;/a&gt;, which forbids using the service for computer intrusions, spam, or the promotion of violence or other crimes. But enforcement of those terms has been largely reactive, often relying on external user reports to identify prohibited content. While the policy itself will not change, the aggressive enforcement approach will put AWS in the same category as major platforms like Facebook and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uk25oz"&gt;Terrorism researchers have previously called for a more proactive approach from hosting platforms, with &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/02/20/amazon-links-terrorist-content-tech-firms-confront-online-threat-column/2907719002/"&gt;one editorial in 2019&lt;/a&gt; calling out Amazon specifically. “Companies need to proactively monitor what’s on their platforms to be sure they are not inadvertently hosting it,” the editorial reads, “not wait for outsiders to expose it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1GhIMm"&gt;The move comes on the heels of a similar shift from Apple, which recently announced a controversial system to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;proactively scan for child abuse imagery in iCloud photos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvYkdJ"&gt;The shift toward proactive moderation is likely to inflame conservative concerns about supposed censorship on AWS, launched when Amazon abruptly discontinued Parler’s hosting after the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;refused to remove a string of violent threats&lt;/a&gt;. Parler sued Amazon in the wake of the decision, although it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310873/parler-amazon-aws-lawsuit-antitrust-hosting-free-speech"&gt;found little success in court&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwWqmy"&gt;Some aspects of that shift already appear to be underway. &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes that Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/27/amazon-isis-app-cloud/"&gt;took down an ISIS-linked website&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, following the trail from an app operated by an offshoot group that was not hosted on the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dhPQF"&gt;It’s part of a broader hiring push by CEO Andy Jassy, who had previously been in charge of AWS. Jassy plans to hire &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-amazon-ceo-unveils-55000-tech-jobs-first-hiring-push-under-his-watch-2021-09-01/"&gt;as many as 55,000 new employees in tech and corporate roles&lt;/a&gt;, including a significant expansion of the company’s satellite internet ambitions under Project Kuiper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bVDJD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch viewership noticeably dropped when streamers took a day off in protest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wtPeQFEU_yQoX23QAbxxTdIktqM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69810276/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZtQHA8"&gt;Streamers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650578/twitch-streamers-walkout-protest-hate-raids"&gt;took a day off Twitch&lt;/a&gt; on September 1st to bring attention to the persistent hate raids that have plagued the platform in the past weeks. While skeptics panned the idea, suggesting that the walkout participants weren’t influential enough to effect significant traffic changes, according to data compiled by &lt;a href="https://gamesight.io/"&gt;Gamesight&lt;/a&gt;, a gaming analytics company, Twitch did see a drop in viewership.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S6U7hu5KeAaNwFbM3C9c3ZZ_Dbg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823468/Screen_Shot_2021_09_02_at_3.05.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gamesight.io&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lyGDrW"&gt;In this graph shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Gamesight measured the number of active channels (meaning the number of live channels) and hours watched every day for the last nine days at noon Pacific Time. According to Gamesight’s data, the number of active channels and viewer hours at 12PM PT on September 1st was at its lowest compared to the prior eight days. Here’s a breakdown of those numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UwGIyi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily Figures for Viewer Hours &amp;amp; Channels (Pacific Time)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;8/24 noon - Viewer Hours - 4,083,518 - Channels - 189,472&lt;br&gt;8/25 noon - Viewer Hours - 4,441,477 - Channels - 185,955&lt;br&gt;8/26 noon - Viewer Hours - 4,243,226 - Channels - 185,268&lt;br&gt;8/27 noon - Viewer Hours - 3,999,300 - Channels - 192,559&lt;br&gt;8/28 noon - Viewer Hours - 4,566,239 - Channels - 195,197&lt;br&gt;8/29 noon - Viewer Hours - 4,440,355 - Channels - 198,900&lt;br&gt;8/30 noon - Viewer Hours - 4,202,554 - Channels - 184,759&lt;br&gt;8/31 noon - Viewer Hours - 4,340,980 - Channels - 176,586&lt;br&gt;9/1 noon - Viewer Hours - 3,456,576 - Channels - 171,682&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4bQFKO"&gt;Looking at the raw numbers, it’s easy to see the dip. If you compare September 1st’s data with the Wednesday previous, that day had almost 1 million fewer hours watched and over 14,000 fewer live channels than just the week before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vQUfm"&gt;But there are additional factors that could have contributed to the dip. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22643215/drlupo-move-from-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusivity-deal"&gt;DrLupo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652368/timthetatman-streaming-twitch-switch-youtube-gaming"&gt;TimTheTatman&lt;/a&gt; — both popular streamers — announced they were leaving Twitch for exclusive streaming deals with YouTube Gaming. Schools in the US are back in session, and Gamescom likely inflated last week’s numbers. Another streamer data analytics team, &lt;a href="https://creatorhype.com/"&gt;CreatorHype&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://creatorhype.com/how-adayofftwitch-impacted-twitch/"&gt;took all of those parameters into account&lt;/a&gt; and still reported that Twitch’s viewership was down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwgijc"&gt;“Based on the data, #ADayOffTwitch impacted both the number of streamers and the viewership on the platform,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zachbussey"&gt;Zach Bussey&lt;/a&gt; of CreatorHype writes. “Depending on how you qualify that data, the impact might have been as low as 5 percent or potentially as high as 15 percent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2d50l"&gt;The hashtag &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23adayofftwitch&amp;amp;src=typed_query"&gt;#ADayOffTwitch&lt;/a&gt; was one of the top 10 trending hashtags for the day — a feat considering the news cycle consisted of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/09/02/nyregion/nyc-storm"&gt;Hurricane Ida battering New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/business/joe-rogan-covid-19.html"&gt;Joe Rogan’s COVID-19 diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/us/supreme-court-texas-abortion-law.html"&gt;Texas abortion battle&lt;/a&gt;. The event also garnered attention from big-time streamers like &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/hasanabi"&gt;Hasan Abi&lt;/a&gt; and press outlets like &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2021/09/01/with-a-day-off-twitch-marginalized-creators-highlight-the-plague-of-hate-raids/?sh=4ed0275d52cb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/gaming/2021/09/01/twitch-why-streamers-boycotting-platform/5680827001/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14RK85"&gt;Twitch is currently working on the hate raid problem, but there isn’t yet a timeline for when solutions will be available. In the meantime, streamers and third-party companies have created their own tools to fight back. Streamlabs, makers of some of the most popular stream management tools, used the day to &lt;a href="https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/introducing-safe-mode"&gt;announce it created Safe Mode&lt;/a&gt; — a free program that can essentially stop a hate raid in progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIKBdi"&gt;Data aside, the streamers responsible for creating and organizing the walkout feel good about what they’ve done. “To see how much this has made an impact is amazing to me,” says &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/shineypen"&gt;ShineyPen&lt;/a&gt;, the streamer who started #ADayOffTwitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ceyme"&gt;The walkout was designed to bring greater attention to the harassment disproportionately suffered by marginalized streamers and to agitate for proactive protections from Twitch. It seems, at least in part, that they’ve accomplished their goals.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fidQ3Y"&gt;“It was honestly just amazing to witness,” says &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rekitraven"&gt;RekitRaven&lt;/a&gt;, creator of the #TwitchDoBetter movement. “It felt like an awesome moment, especially when there were so many who doubted (and still doubt) what we’re trying to do in this space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ckKuiR"&gt;The organizers also know that one day of protest isn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qhGg0"&gt;“While we may not have hit Twitch in a significant way in terms of financial impact,” says &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/luciaeverblack"&gt;Lucia Everblack&lt;/a&gt;, another walkout organizer. “Our absence was absolutely felt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eX7APf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fcRFD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW’s Joytopia metaverse has Christoph Waltz and Coldplay wait come back </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PpHXbJpQj_OTO8QgvI0p-tu-_r0=/102x0:1593x994/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69810193/Screen_Shot_2021_09_02_at_2.16.05_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eS4740"&gt;I want to preface this post by saying I will never pretend to understand why corporations do some of the things they do. I was simply minding my own business, looking for information on BMW’s new &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0341092EN/bmw-motorrad-concept-ce-02"&gt;concept scooter&lt;/a&gt; on the German automaker’s press site, when... well, here, look: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="w68d0g"&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0341635EN/bmw-launches-new-streaming-platform-joytopia-narrated-by-academy-award-winning-actor-christoph-waltz-for-the-iaa-mobility-exclusive-concert-by-british-band-coldplay-pulls-back-the-curtain-on-a-new-virtual-world"&gt;BMW launches new streaming platform JOYTOPIA narrated by Academy Award winning actor Christoph Waltz for the IAA Mobility. Exclusive concert by British band Coldplay pulls back the curtain on a new virtual world&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rxWBz6"&gt;And right underneath that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="SbSv2Q"&gt;+++ BMW elevates brand communications to a new level +++ Exclusive concert by Coldplay celebrates the launch of the new JOYTOPIA virtual world +++ New brand channel will remain an integral element of corporate and brand communications beyond the IAA Mobility +++ With JOYTOPIA BMW has created its own metaverse +++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OEgWie"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biiiig exhale&lt;/em&gt;. Okay, a few things. First, what in the ever-loving hell? Second, IAA Mobility is the shorthand name for the International Motor Show that kicks off this weekend in Germany. Expect more... regular news from there. Third... a “streaming platform” but &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; a “metaverse”? Last but not least: “Joytopia,” eh? And in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruitopia"&gt;that font&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhF1QL"&gt;Listen, I’m sorry, but there’s just no way through this without making you read some excerpts of this press release with me. Down the rabbit hole we go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EK4geW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Munich.&lt;/strong&gt; Two days before the opening of the IAA Mobility international motor show taking place in Munich on 7 – 12 September 2021, BMW is unveiling its own, globally unique virtual world: JOYTOPIA. The highlight of the presentation on 5 September will be an exclusive performance by Coldplay. The British band will play a virtual concert on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MCcY3"&gt;JOYTOPIA will provide users with an unprecedented concert experience. As well as being live at the Coldplay performance, fans can also get actively involved in the event via avatars. They will be able to dance along with the music through their invented character, get close to the stage and see the band in action from every angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EilU0l"&gt;Okay, fine! Honestly, as far as big-ticket promotional brand exercises go, this isn’t so deeply outrageous. It’s like, one step removed from BMW doing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/1/22602826/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-concert-epic-gameshttps://www.theverge.com/2021/8/1/22602826/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-concert-epic-games"&gt;a concert in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9pYNkx"&gt;The concert will feature a set list of four Coldplay songs, including their hit “Higher Power” produced exclusively for the BMW Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="O3iySY"&gt;Oh... okay. They paid Coldplay to make a song? That’s already a “hit”? Seems kind of wild. Check this out, it was even used &lt;a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2021/06/11/video-bmw-ix-and-i4-commercial-features-coldplays-new-hit-higher-power/"&gt;in commercials&lt;/a&gt; for some of BMW’s upcoming electric vehicles. In fact, in a &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/middle-east/article/detail/T0335742EN/the-first-ever-bmw-ix-and-the-first-ever-bmw-i4:-joint-global-campaign-plays-to-the-rhythm-of-coldplay-s-new-hit?language=en"&gt;June press release&lt;/a&gt;, BMW said the song marks the beginning of a “long-term cooperation between BMW and the Warner Music mega-band with sustainability as the unifying element...” — actually, wait, sorry, I can’t jump into another absurd press release or we’ll be here all week. Back to Joytopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="tbRshq"&gt;On 5 September the concert can be enjoyed around the clock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JUeYRk"&gt;Is... is that a threat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="z47RBr"&gt;“With JOYTOPIA we have created our own metaverse. This sees us responding to the demand from our customers for individualised experiences in the digital space,” says Stefan Ponikva, Vice President Brand Communication and Brand Experience. “We want to open up a new dialogue with audiences that shifts the status quo from brand interpretation to user interpretation. JOYTOPIA is a quantum leap for the digital world. It enables us to take brand communications to a new level,” adds Ponikva. JOYTOPIA is a new marketing instrument for the digital world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="IZbPB2"&gt;“Metaverse,” if you’re not terminally online, is the hot new buzzword du jour, in part because of... &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;? Again, I &lt;em&gt;do not pretend to understand why corporations do these things&lt;/em&gt; or why they feel the need to claim that Coldplay doing a virtual concert inside a modern version of Habbo Hotel or whatever is “a quantum leap for the digital world.” I &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;know that it only gets weirder from here, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6mZ1UF"&gt;JOYTOPIA guests are welcomed to the platform – which boasts impressive visual quality – by a virtual fox and are guided through the surreal worlds. The voice of the fox is that of Hollywood actor Christoph Waltz. “The future is what happens next and it’s entirely up to us to make it enjoyable. This was my first encounter with a metaverse. It’s not called JOYTOPIA for nothing. The joy of… “ says the Academy Award Winner and alludes to the diversity of the virtual world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="AOxTvG"&gt;I beg you to take some time with each of those sentences. Really soak them up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atoi1E"&gt;The first sentence abruptly introduces the idea that visitors to the Joytopia metaverse will be guided by a virtual fox, but only after BMW apparently feels the need to assure potential visitors that it won’t look like crap? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRVXgJ"&gt;And then, hey, yeah, Christoph Waltz! Why not? (I mean, maybe there’s a reason if you consider one of his most famous roles &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2016/03/07/bmw-admits-regret-over-using-nazi-slave-labor-during-wwii/"&gt;alongside certain parts of the company’s history&lt;/a&gt;...) What does Christoph have to say about playing a virtual fox? Ah, it will be his experience with a metaverse? Samesies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="napxNp"&gt;What’s that, Christoph? You okay? You just... sort of trailed off there? Hey guys, did we really not get Christoph to finish his thought? Is he being paid by the word or something? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onatc1"&gt;Wait, Christoph — are you okay? Blink your fox eyes twice if you’re trapped in the BMW metaverse with Coldplay. Do we have to come save you? Is &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;what this is all about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="tITxIx"&gt;There’s no earthly way of knowing which direction we are going. There’s no knowing where we’re rowing, or which way the river’s flowing. Is it raining? Is it snowing? Is a hurricane a-blowing? Not a speck of light is showing so the danger must be growing. Are the fires of hell a-glowing? Is the grizzly reaper mowing? Yes! The danger must be growing so the rowers keep on rowing, and they’re certainly not showing any signs that they are slowing!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="lSi5gt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB401RfGMlM"&gt;Just making sure you’re still with me&lt;/a&gt;. Actually, Christoph Waltz would make a good Willy Wonka now that I think about it...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="fzwijV"&gt;JOYTOPIA users will have fun navigating their way independently through three unique worlds as an avatar, using a map and signposts for help. The avatars can run, hop or fly, and users can choose their form and colour. Similarly to other gaming consoles, JOYTOPIA allows users to interact with other avatars and wave at them, for example. At public events, users can also create their own spaces. Selfies are possible, too, and can be posted directly to social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZzuqKy"&gt;Something about the way “Selfies are possible, too” is thrown in there really bums me out, but I haven’t been able to crack why. But yeah, sure, again, kinda just sounds a lot like a concert in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;when you strip away all the gauzy language, doesn’t it? I get that BMW apparently paid some firm to create this bespoke metaverse, but we can’t really say how different Joytopia will be until the site... sorry, &lt;em&gt;metaverse&lt;/em&gt;... or was it streaming platform?... launches. Until then, goodness gracious, look at what’s there now: &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2ogO1X"&gt;Indeed. Why &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;we here? I guess we’ll find out when Coldplay takes the stage. See you in Joytopia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="GmTOIg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/50-million/"&gt;Google has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it has 50 million users subscribed to or trying YouTube Music and YouTube Premium, which is a marked increase from the 30 million &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/29/google-earnings-antitrust-scrutiny/"&gt;subscribers it reported in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;. This seems to mark a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21121207/youtube-google-alphabet-earnings-revenue-first-time-reveal-q4-2019"&gt;continued trend&lt;/a&gt; in people looking to make the jump from the free versions of YouTube and YouTube Music, even as more services are competing in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKGlus"&gt;Google doesn’t break down that 50 million number any further, so we don’t really know how many people are subscribed to YouTube Music or Premium and how many are using the services’ free one-month trial. However, &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/50-million/"&gt;its blog post&lt;/a&gt; spends a lot of time talking about music, hailing YouTube as the fastest-growing music-subscription service. &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;also &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/youtube-music-passes-50-million-subscribers-up-20-million-in-less-than-a-year-1235054559/"&gt;compared Google’s numbers&lt;/a&gt; with other streaming services. It reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22596155/spotify-earnings-q2-2021-podcasting-investments-acquisitions-subscribers"&gt;Spotify has around 165 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ae722400-561c-431a-85eb-e09e1f6b0bb2"&gt;quotes estimates&lt;/a&gt; of Apple Music having 78 million. (The last official word was in June 2019 when Apple said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761603/apple-music-60-million-subscribers-eddy-cue-spotify"&gt;its service had passed 60 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VYHZDp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google doesn’t really break down what that 50 million number means&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pb5Iww"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/musicpremium"&gt;YouTube Music Premium&lt;/a&gt; costs $9.99 a month and lets users listen to and download ad-free music. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium"&gt;YouTube Premium&lt;/a&gt; goes for $11.99 a month and gives subscribers access to all of the benefits of YouTube Music, with the ability to also download and watch regular videos ad-free. Premium subscribers can also have videos play in the background while they’re using another app or their phone is locked. For those who spend a lot of time watching non-music content on the platform, that’s a much better experience for not that much more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9H9q35"&gt;Google hasn’t commented on what caused the 20 million-subscriber increase, but it’s probably worth keeping in mind that last year’s count was reported right around the time when Google was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354136/google-play-music-shut-down-end-service-youtube-music-date"&gt;shutting down its Play Music service&lt;/a&gt;. It’s hard to tell how many people were subscribed to it — but both Google Play and YouTube Music &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537261/google-youtube-music-play-music-15-million-subscribers"&gt;reportedly had 15 million subscribers combined&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BsHjOZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s clear a growing number of people are at least interested in YouTube’s paid offerings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lz9bKq"&gt;Without knowing the breakdown, it’s hard to tell exactly what this means for Google. Were more people interested in letting videos play in the background without ads, or were they looking for an alternative or addition to Spotify and Apple Music? Taking a step back, it’s clear more people are at least interested in YouTube’s paid offerings. While there have been plenty of (admittedly justified) complaints about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/streaming-wars"&gt;glut of video&lt;/a&gt; and audio streaming services, it seems there’s still room to grow, if Google is any example.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is now denying its CEO saved an exec from being fired for discrimination</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Web Services Head Andrew Jassy Speaks At The AWS Summit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jndCQBTI1rx-Nb0ApToeCIldqx0=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805108/670451714.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7jEBWV"&gt;It hasn’t even been two months since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"&gt;Amazon CEO Andy Jassy&lt;/a&gt; took the reins from founder Jeff Bezos, but the company’s new chief executive is already facing a potential scandal. Two anonymous sources have accused Jassy of stepping in to overrule the company’s own HR department when it recommended that an executive be fired for discrimination — and Amazon didn’t initially deny it, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/aws-jassy-bell-discrimination"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is now suggesting to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s not true, a day after we first published this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9mr06"&gt;The story goes that in 2019, a Black female Amazon employee accused AWS Outposts general manager Joshua Burgin of discrimination, and HR issued a report recommending he be fired. But Jassy fielded a personal request from Burgin’s boss, Charlie Bell, and decided to let him stay. (At the time, Jassy was CEO of AWS, Bell was a star cloud executive who also reportedly served as a member of Amazon’s senior leadership team, and Burgin was Bell’s chief of staff. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/microsoft-hires-charlie-bell-former-amazon-cloud-exec.html"&gt;Bell recently moved to Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PZrIlP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We [...] took what we believe was the appropriate corrective action”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lpR5wH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; writes that when it presented Amazon with “a detailed account of the events,” the company didn’t dispute it: “In this instance, we conducted a thorough investigation and took what we believe was the appropriate corrective action,” the company wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWVbgc"&gt;Amazon initially told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;it didn’t have anything to share beyond that non-denial statement, but on Thursday it came out with a partial denial after all: “The suggestion that Andy overruled a recommendation provided to him in this case is not correct,” a company spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.  “As with any disciplinary decision, as more data was presented and discussions continued, opinions on the appropriate course of action evolved. The final recommendation was the one ultimately pursued.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoP7Xw"&gt;Amazon declined to provide a copy of that final recommendation for us to verify, and wouldn’t tell us whether Jassy might have been involved in crafting that final recommendation himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vlbgR"&gt;Amazon’s partial denial arrived a day after we originally published this story under the headline “Amazon isn’t denying its CEO saved an exec from being fired for discrimination.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7B76J"&gt;In July, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590134/amazon-harassment-discrimination-allegations-investigation"&gt;pledged to investigate&lt;/a&gt; allegations of discrimination and harassment inside its AWS unit after 550 Amazon workers signed a petition accusing the company of fostering an “underlying culture of systemic discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias against women and under-represented groups.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444635/amazon-five-discrimination-retaliation-lawsuits-warehouse"&gt;Five specific female Amazon employees also sued the company for discrimination&lt;/a&gt; in May, three of whom still worked for Amazon at the time. It’s not clear whether the worker who accused Burgin — and by association, Jassy — is one of those five, but &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; suggests she’s suing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Assr7C"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Meet Andy Jassy, Amazon’s next CEO","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ywPS1d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 2nd, 3:44PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Amazon’s denial, a day after Amazon declined to deny the story to both &lt;/em&gt;Protocol&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Horizon Forbidden West won’t have an upgrade path from PS4 to PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4724Ru9v51Jw3LDo8CC9CqRNDcs=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69809592/horizon_forbidden_west_screenshot_10_disclaimer_en_27may21.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e8dm6v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West,&lt;/em&gt; the sequel to the much-beloved &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;, is now available for preorder ahead of the game’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22602306/horizon-forbidden-west-playstation-delay-2022-february"&gt;newly announced February 18th, 2022, release date&lt;/a&gt; for both PS4 and PS5. But if you’re planning to play the game on PS4 and eventually try it on PS5, there’s no way to get a cross-gen upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TA04k"&gt;Instead, you’ll have to buy the &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/02/pre-order-horizon-forbidden-west-now-collectors-and-digital-deluxe-editions-detailed/"&gt;more expensive versions of the game&lt;/a&gt; that offer digital copies for both the PS4 and PS5 or start with PS4 and buy an entirely new PS5 copy of the game later at its full price. And you shouldn’t expect some kind of upgrade to be introduced down the line, as Sony says it has &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/games/horizon-forbidden-west-support/"&gt;“no plans”&lt;/a&gt; for that kind of offer, even though you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; transfer your save data from the PS4 to PS5 versions of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWjiOv"&gt;To get both the PS4 and PS5 digital versions of &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West &lt;/em&gt;in a single package, you have to buy the spendier &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-forbidden-west/"&gt;$79.99 Digital Deluxe Edition&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/games/game/horizon-forbidden-west-collectors-edition-ps4-ps5.3006185"&gt;$199.99 Collector’s Edition&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/games/game/horizon-forbidden-west-regalla-edition-ps4-ps5.3006217"&gt;$259.99 Regalla Edition&lt;/a&gt;. By contrast, the Standard Edition will cost $59.99 on PS4 and $69.99 on PS5. There’s also a &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/games/game/horizon-forbidden-west-special-edition-ps4.3006306?smcid=pdc:us-en:web-pdc-games-horizon-forbidden-west:buttonblock-pre-order-now"&gt;Special Edition for PS4 that costs $69.99&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a digital soundtrack, a “mini art book,” and comes in a steelcase box. (There’s a separate &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/games/game/horizon-forbidden-west-special-edition-ps5.3006308"&gt;PS5 version of that edition, too&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2yISzC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s no option for a cross-gen upgrade&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f4I8Yx"&gt;Sony has shown a willingness to offer upgrade paths with some of its other titles. The company allows players to pay to upgrade from the PS4 to the PS5 version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559264/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-sony-ps4-ps5-sucker-punch-iki-island"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and from the PS4 version of &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; to the PS5-exclusive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22569182/death-stranding-directors-cut-new-features-release-date-ps5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding: Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Sony has also released free patches optimizing PS4 games for PS5, like it did for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260829/god-of-war-2018-ps5-patch-free-update-playstation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and, just last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641595/horizon-zero-dawn-60fps-update-ps5-1-53"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But in the case of &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;, there’s no option for a cross-gen upgrade at all. Sony’s asking you to pay at least $20 extra upfront to be able to eventually play the game on a system you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;may not even have yet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZqV9D"&gt;And for fans of collecting physical copies of games, you should know that &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West’s&lt;/em&gt; Collector’s and Regalla Editions won’t come with game discs. Instead, they’ll have a download code that lets you play &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; on PS4 or PS5. Those more expensive editions of the game do offer a lot of other bonuses, though, including impressive statues of a big elephant-like machine. You can read all about &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/02/pre-order-horizon-forbidden-west-now-collectors-and-digital-deluxe-editions-detailed/"&gt;what’s available in each edition on Sony’s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqwDly"&gt;Sony showed off some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22455008/horizon-forbidden-west-gameplay-ps5-sony-state-of-play"&gt;impressive footage of &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; in May&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s possible we could see more of the game at the just-announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22653773/sony-playstation-showcase-date-ps5-future"&gt;PlayStation showcase for September 9th&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll be rounded up the biggest announcements, so check back then.&lt;/p&gt;
