    <title>How to fix Deathloop ‘stuttering’ on PC </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZSKgq9V7V_faIif-gORFVpgmnAE=/429x0:2589x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69885518/deathloop.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EojSD0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is the big triple-A game of the moment, and it’s an amazing experience — assuming you’re not fighting your gaming PC to get it to run smoothly. Bethesda is aware, and a patch seems to be on the way. But as &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;’s Alex Battaglia explains in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu_XHyO-6zY"&gt;this in-depth video&lt;/a&gt;, there may be a few things you can try right now to fix it, including one weird, counterintuitive trick that instantly made my seemingly stuttery performance smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flFyMD"&gt;Here’s the TL;DR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9x4UgO"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Obvious:&lt;/strong&gt; Reduce your quality settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lk2mRz"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Far less obvious: &lt;/strong&gt;Try the beta hotfix: “juliannashotme” in Steam &amp;gt; Deathloop &amp;gt; Properties &amp;gt; Betas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aCrtfP"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Counterintuitive: &lt;/strong&gt;Lock your framerate at 60 or 120fps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ydt9Pq"&gt;Let’s start with that last one, because it’s what worked for me — and it may be the only thing that works if you’ve got a fancy G-Sync / FreeSync monitor with variable refresh rate. Simply go to the game’s &lt;strong&gt;Video Settings &lt;/strong&gt;page, turn off &lt;strong&gt;V-Sync&lt;/strong&gt; entirely, and set your &lt;strong&gt;FPS Limiter&lt;/strong&gt; to 60 or — if your performance is high enough — 120 fps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0TTplP6vb5HA_GerONCujKTZhSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865395/deathloop_fps_limiter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scroll down the video settings menu and you’ll find V-Sync and FPS Limiter. You’ll have to turn off V-Sync first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MJjnuC"&gt;You might be asking: “Isn’t the whole point of V-Sync and my fancy VRR monitor to keep this sort of stutter from happening?” Yes, but as &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry &lt;/em&gt;explains, what you’re seeing has more to do with mouse movement than syncing your GPU’s frames to your monitor’s refresh rate. This isn’t the tearing you see when frames hit in the middle of a refresh, or the microstutter you might have experienced when frames are delayed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tm0oL8"&gt;In fact, Battaglia shows that &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; can deliver excellent frame times — there’s just a mismatch when you’re turning your digital character’s head at non-standard refresh rates, like the ones your variable refresh monitor is &lt;em&gt;designed &lt;/em&gt;to provide. With an RTX 3080, my GPU could easily send 80 fps to my G-Sync monitor in many scenes at near-4K resolution, but locking it to 60 counterintuitively made everything feel far smoother. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTiD7I"&gt;Another thing you might want to do (though you may also want to &lt;em&gt;undo&lt;/em&gt; it&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;after the next public patch: try the hotfix &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/deathloop/status/1438540739856715788"&gt;that Bethesda’s currently asking users to help test&lt;/a&gt;. Right click on &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; in your Steam library, select &lt;strong&gt;Properties &lt;/strong&gt;and then &lt;strong&gt;Beta&lt;/strong&gt;, type &lt;strong&gt;juliannashotme&lt;/strong&gt; into the access code field, hit &lt;strong&gt;Check Code&lt;/strong&gt;, then and &lt;strong&gt;Opt into&lt;/strong&gt; the public_beta branch that should appear. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zOoYdaCHIyqHA1h6wwX-flwdCvY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865439/Vqbx0fxvgO.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll have to hit Check Code and also Opt into before the beta hotfix will work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gYDNFo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;reports the beta seems to smooth over one of the mouse issues, though Battaglia still points out other problems in his full video, including one where you may need to quit out of a mission or start the next level before it resolves itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvb9Y2"&gt;Lastly, it’s possible you’re just picking graphical settings that are unnecessarily high for what’s quite a demanding game. &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; looks great at High levels of detail, often with little noticeable difference compared to Very High or Ultra, as you can see in the video atop this post. Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vh3sSu"&gt;

    <title>Now the SEC is investigating Activision Blizzard too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QB94muiygO1AS15egYLxz6xqgZk=/99x0:1101x668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69885343/Activision_Blizzard_Merge_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SKsdHJ"&gt;The list of government agencies investigating Activision Blizzard has grown to now include the SEC. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-is-investigating-activision-blizzard-over-workplace-practices-disclosures-11632165080"&gt;has subpoenaed the video game publishing giant&lt;/a&gt;, including CEO Bobby Kotick, for records pertaining to employment, separation agreements, and communications between senior executives. The Wall Street Journal report says that the SEC is investigating whether Activision Blizzard disclosed information about harassment and discrimination claims to investors in a timely fashion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddO2Uy"&gt;Two months ago, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing sued Activision Blizzard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;for facilitating a culture of abuse, harassment, and discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. The suit alleges that employees engaged in activities like a “cube crawl” in which men drank large amounts of alcohol while moving from workstation to workstation “groping” or otherwise harassing female employees. There was also an account of the infamous “Cosby suite” in which Blizzard employees set up a room at Blizzcon in 2013 where men attempted to ply women with alcohol in efforts to sleep with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22siyG"&gt;In the aftermath of the initial suit, Blizzard employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;staged a walkout&lt;/a&gt; and formed an employee activist group agitating for an end to forced arbitration and greater transparency regarding pay and diverse hiring practices. A number of Blizzard executives have either left the company or disappeared from the public eye. J. Allen Brack, CEO of Blizzard, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;stepped down on August 3rd&lt;/a&gt;. That same day, head of global human resources &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608320/blizard-jesse-meschuk-leave-company-hr-svp"&gt;Jesse Meschuk also left the company&lt;/a&gt;. Brack was named in the lawsuit as having known of and failing to address the abuse against female employees and Blizzard HR was also cited as complicit party accused of overlooking or under-investigating claims of harassment and other violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7kRxp"&gt;Frances Townsend — Activision Blizzard’s vice president of corporate affairs and former Homeland Security advisor — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22591611/activision-blizzard-brack-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-california"&gt;called the lawsuit “a distorted and untrue picture of our company.&lt;/a&gt;” After fierce social media backlash to her comments, CEO Bobby Kotick &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;issued a press release&lt;/a&gt; that called Blizzard’s response to the lawsuit “tone deaf” and promised action that included, among other things, employee listening sessions. According to a source at Blizzard, those listening sessions were little more than “propaganda sessions” and ended after employees complained of their quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObNtmi"&gt;This newest investigation is the latest in a string of cases brought against Activision Blizzard. Last week, Blizzard employee activist group A Better ABK, with help from the CODE-CWA — a digital workers labor organization — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674269/activision-blizzard-sued-nlrb-labor-violations"&gt;filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://cwa-union.org/sites/default/files/20210910-charge-activision-violation-of-section-7-rights.pdf"&gt;The complaint alleges&lt;/a&gt; Activision Blizzard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="I4hW2C"&gt;Threatened employees that they cannot talk about or communicate about wages, hours and working conditions; told employees they cannot communicate with or discuss ongoing investigations of wages, hours and working conditions; maintained an overly broad social media policy; enforced the social media policy against employees who have engaged in protected concerted activity; threatened or disciplined employees on account of protected concerted activity; engaged in surveillance of employees engaged in protected concerted activity and engaged in interrogation of employees about protected concerted activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="efW4WI"&gt;According to the Wall Street Journal, Activision Blizzard is cooperating with the investigation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GTfk7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LX4xRc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenSea has an app, but you can’t buy NFTs on it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iC7t2TBgRok7frJkRFb75byos-I=/0x0:1125x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69884718/new_ios_app.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OpenSea&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4A8Dxz"&gt;OpenSea, one of the most popular NFT marketplaces, has &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/introducing-the-opensea-mobile-app/"&gt;launched its first app&lt;/a&gt; for iOS and Android. The app allows OpenSea users to view the platform’s collection of digital items, but notably doesn’t allow for any kind of money to change hands, digital or otherwise (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/opensea-released-an-app-but-its-for-browsing-not-buying-and-selling/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybGWiw"&gt;The OpenSea app basically works as a kind of gallery. You can browse artwork, share listings you find, and lovingly ogle and manage your own NFTs. The app shares a lot of the same blue and white stylings of the OpenSea site, just missing the button that says “Buy Now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2MuHcc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QKt59kExL-o?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="470Qz0"&gt;There are a couple possible reasons why actual NFT purchases are missing. At the most obvious, highest level, OpenSea probably doesn’t want to share &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;a 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; of NFT transactions with the likes of Apple and Google. That doesn’t help the people selling the work, and it doesn’t help OpenSea. The other complicating factor is that OpenSea’s payments are frequently in Ethereum, which currently isn’t supported as an in-app payment method on either platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruErxz"&gt;On paper, the OpenSea app furthers the company’s goal of “making NFTs more available to all,” but without the key economic element — the one being sold to struggling artists and speculated upon by hungry investors — it’ll first and foremost be another way to look at nice JPEGs. The app is also launching at an awkward time for the company. OpenSea head of product Nate Chastain made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677793/opensea-product-chief-resign-nft-insider-trading-accusations"&gt;a high-profile exit from the company&lt;/a&gt; last week following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676075/opensea-insider-information-nft-trading-nate-chastain"&gt;accusations of insider NFT trading&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Surface hardware event: rumors, news, and announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E08s42Hw9b1y-XqXLab63Oq2YRY=/100x0:1179x719/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69884608/microsoft_surface_event_invite.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A variety of new hardware updates are expected from Microsoft.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The event kicks off at 11AM ET / 8AM PT on September 22nd&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="epbR7Z"&gt;September 22nd officially marks the first day of fall, and with it gadget season. Like in previous years, Microsoft is getting into the mix with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651859/microsoft-surface-event-date"&gt;forthcoming Surface event&lt;/a&gt;, where we anticipate the company will announce a slew of products during its livestream presentation on Wednesday at 11AM ET / 8AM PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1u7z3"&gt;Microsoft has been building up plenty of momentum recently with the impending launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600261/windows-11-beta-release-insider-microsoft-download-test"&gt;Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;. And with the new operating system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649940/windows-11-release-date-features-devices-free-upgrade"&gt;set to launch on October 5th&lt;/a&gt;, it’s only natural to showcase it with new devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdDxfF"&gt;The reports and leaks seem to indicate that we may see updates to Microsoft’s Surface Pro, Surface Book, Surface Go, and Surface Duo lines. Many details of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22682271/surface-pro-8-120hz-display-thunderbolt-support-leak-rumors"&gt;Surface Pro 8 have already leaked&lt;/a&gt;, including its new Intel 11th Gen processor, 120Hz display, and switch to Thunderbolt ports. While less early info has surfaced on the Book and Go refreshes, the former is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671271/microsoft-surface-event-pro-8-surface-book-4-rumors"&gt;slotted to have a significant design overhaul&lt;/a&gt; while the latter will most likely see its changes happen on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vvsf0"&gt;Beyond Windows 11 devices, Microsoft is expected to announce a successor to the dual-screen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593992/microsoft-surface-duo-2-triple-camera-leak-photos"&gt;leaks for the Duo 2 began earlier in the summer&lt;/a&gt;, promising an internal spec bump and a new triple-camera setup in addition to some smaller design tweaks. The big questions around the Duo 2 are in software and support, as the original Duo’s stagnation — it’s still stuck on Android 10 when Android 12 is around the corner — and slow sales have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/5/13/22433893/microsoft-surface-duo-hori-split-pad-pro-nintendo-switch-anker-sale-deal"&gt;landed it in the clearance sections of many retailers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoWh9B"&gt;Regardless of whether Microsoft actually proves its Android chops with the Duo 2 or launches any surprises with its new flagships for Windows 11, we’ll be watching live and keeping you updated here as new products are announced.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tom Hanks embraces two of man’s best friends in the trailer for Finch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qHMJOEAP4qvty3equDX9ELM86Jk=/0x0:6044x4029/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69884533/081221_Apple_Films_Tom_Hanks_Finch.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple TV Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NqkttC"&gt;Tom Hanks is set to return to Apple TV Plus in &lt;em&gt;Finch&lt;/em&gt;, a soon-to-debut feature film about a robotics engineer surviving a new post-apocalyptic world with his four-legged companion Goodyear (and a robot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hPM5hf"&gt;The heart of &lt;em&gt;Finch&lt;/em&gt;’s storyline centers on Hanks’ determination to find a caretaker for Goodyear after his death. The science-fiction drama takes place after a solar flare that devastated life on earth. Finch, the engineer, has been surviving a post-apocalyptic wasteland for a decade in an underground bunker, where he lives with his dog Goodyear — a very good boy and Finch’s only companion after the catastrophic event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6kFAl"&gt;In this underground workspace, Finch develops a robot, Jeff, with whom they’ll embark on a treacherous journey to beat a deadly storm to safety. Along the way, they’ll have to navigate extreme weather phenomena, merciless heat, UV radiation, and other unexpected challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wRXAVx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-0bYWnP3jH4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lMBUXX"&gt;The film arrives as Apple looks to ramp up its original film slate. Martin Scorsese’s &lt;em&gt;Killers of the Flower Moon&lt;/em&gt;, award-winning drama &lt;em&gt;Coda&lt;/em&gt;, Mahershala Ali-starring &lt;em&gt;Swan Song&lt;/em&gt;, and A24 joints &lt;em&gt;The Tragedy of Macbeth&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sharper&lt;/em&gt; are just a handful of titles soon set to debut on the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="liepBx"&gt;Apple has been laser-focused focused on developing award-winning titles over churning out content on a budget, and &lt;em&gt;Finch&lt;/em&gt; is the second Tom Hanks-starring feature film to debut on the service after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21264009/tom-hanks-greyhound-apple-tv-plus-streaming-sony-pictures-pandemic"&gt;acquired &lt;em&gt;Greyhound&lt;/em&gt; from Sony&lt;/a&gt; last year. But to date, Apple’s original films haven’t had quite the cultural impact enjoyed by its critical darling &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, which had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673907/apple-event-2021-apple-tv-plus-streaming-wars"&gt;record-breaking number&lt;/a&gt; of Emmy nominations this year for a first-season comedy and ultimately, including its Creative Arts Emmy Awards wins, claimed seven awards. Of its 35 total Emmy nominations this year, Apple on Sunday won &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F09%2Fapples-global-hit-comedy-series-ted-lasso-sweeps-the-2021-primetime-emmy-awards-scoring-history-making-win-for-outstanding-comedy-series%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F20%2F22684504%2Fapple-tv-plus-finch-trailer-dog-robot-tom-hanks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11 total Emmys&lt;/a&gt; across five titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nj1T2Z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greyhound&lt;/em&gt; was nominated for a bevy of awards, including an academy award for best sound. But &lt;em&gt;Finch&lt;/em&gt; will have much broader appeal than a World War II drama. Apple has proven it can win on warm-and-fuzzy mass appeal. Perhaps &lt;em&gt;Finch&lt;/em&gt; will finally help Apple TV Plus secure the feature film award wins it’s been gunning for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kqa5eQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finch&lt;/em&gt; will premiere ​​Friday, November 5th on Apple TV Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senate Democrats call on FTC to fix data privacy ‘crisis’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L1bnhrYq18fBDKa_uAVUzsW4eXA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69884484/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C5Xa7b"&gt;Senate Democrats are calling on the Federal Trade Commission to &lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2021.09.20%20-%20FTC%20-%20Privacy%20Rulemaking.pdf"&gt;write new rules&lt;/a&gt; to protect consumer data privacy in a new letter to the agency authored on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OcVkq"&gt;The letter, led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and signed by eight other Democratic senators, was sent to FTC Chair Lina Khan Monday, calling on the agency to “begin a rulemaking process” on privacy. Specifically, the senators are requesting that the FTC pen new rules addressing privacy, civil rights, and the collection of consumer data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aTyc5J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Consumer privacy has become a consumer crisis”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wcOGhr"&gt;“Consumer privacy has become a consumer crisis,” the lawmakers wrote. “Tech companies have routinely broken their promises to consumers and neglected their legal obligations, only to receive wrist-slap punishments after long delay, providing little relief to consumers, and with minimal deterrent effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R5B5r9"&gt;The FTC declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vM2Na5"&gt;The letter comes just days after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671880/biden-alvaro-bedoya-privacy-ftc-commissioner-facial-recognition"&gt;President Joe Biden nominated&lt;/a&gt; longtime privacy and facial recognition critic Alvaro Bedoya to become the third Democratic FTC commissioner. At Georgetown Law, Bedoya led research into the effects of technologies like facial recognition on minority groups and produced several surveys studying the tech’s potential for racial bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqdQgu"&gt;Bedoya is a professor at Georgetown Law’s Center for Privacy and Technology, and has previously served as chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law under Chairman Sen. Al Franken (D-MN). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jf5Apu"&gt;The Senate has yet to schedule a confirmation hearing for Bedoya, but he would likely help the FTC craft any future rulemakings related to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TA67xe"&gt;Congress has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444515/amy-klobuchar-data-privacy-protection-facebook-state-laws"&gt;tried and failed&lt;/a&gt; to craft its own data privacy legislation over the last few years, and an FTC rulemaking could be the government’s best chance at regulating the industry in light of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21153117/congress-tech-regulation-privacy-bill-coppa-ads-laws-legislators"&gt;tense partisan divides&lt;/a&gt;. In July, the FTC voted to update the agency’s rulemaking procedures in a way that would make it easier to issue comprehensive privacy rules on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hiVa7k"&gt;“Consumers deserve strong and enforceable privacy safeguards in the digital economy — opening a rulemaking would be a powerful step toward addressing this long overdue need,” the lawmakers wrote in their Monday letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1IlLk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6ikNA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coinbase cancels Lend program launch after SEC fight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lVOcvV_72rUFgTSZubJCcLhCCKw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69884297/acastro_170726_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uDZPwX"&gt;Crypto exchange Coinbase has discontinued its plans to launch a Lend feature designed to let customers earn interest on certain coins &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-20/coinbase-global-drops-plan-to-launch-crypto-lending-program"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The company announced the change by &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/sign-up-to-earn-4-apy-on-usd-coin-with-coinbase-cdad79e5f5eb"&gt;updating a blog post from late June&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it would also be discontinuing the waitlist that it had set up for the feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SI6SYT"&gt;The cancellation comes after Coinbase received &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662826/coinbase-sec-lend-regulation-crypto-lawsuit-exchange"&gt;legal warnings about the feature&lt;/a&gt; from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009"&gt;Coinbase said&lt;/a&gt; that it would be delaying the now-canceled feature “until at least October.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFPh1Q"&gt;Coinbase promised that the Lend feature would offer users a 4 percent APY return if they let the company make loans to “verified borrowers” with it. The company planned to the stablecoin USDC to power the feature, but &lt;a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/"&gt;its price hasn’t been significantly affected&lt;/a&gt; by this news as its value is tied to the US dollar. The webpage with information about the program, as well as a signup page for the waitlist, now redirects to Coinbase’s homepage (but it can be &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210909081423/https://www.coinbase.com/lend"&gt;viewed on the Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eea5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Coinbase said it’s still looking for “regulatory clarity for the crypto industry”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TGU5Ob"&gt;According to Coinbase, the SEC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662826/coinbase-sec-lend-regulation-crypto-lawsuit-exchange"&gt;threatened the company with a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; if it launched the Lend feature. The regulatory body argued that Lend would deal with securities, and would therefore be regulated as an investment product. Earlier in September, Coinbase’s CEO posted a thread on Twitter, saying that the SEC hadn’t been clear with it about why the feature would be considered a security, or what Coinbase could do to fix it. Still, the Lend feature does seem similar to an interest-bearing bond, which would typically be regulated as securities as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SEC_Investor_Ed/status/1435606347807006728"&gt;an apparent subtweet&lt;/a&gt; from the SEC pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRyf1u"&gt;Coinbase said in its cancellation update it’s still looking for “regulatory clarity for the crypto industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgHS8M"&gt;According to Coinbase, the &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009"&gt;SEC asked for the names and contact info&lt;/a&gt; of everyone on the aforementioned waitlist as part of its investigation. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment about what will happen to the data of those who signed up to the waitlist now that it’s been discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM says defect-free Bolt batteries are in production</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_YZmsQVpc9u2veeePP51-eUi77U=/0x0:5700x3800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69884253/2022_Chevrolet_BoltEV_008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Chevy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qG0w2o"&gt;General Motors said Monday that it will start swapping new batteries into Chevy Bolt EVs in October in response to at least a dozen fires that triggered a massive recall. GM did not say when it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22648922/gm-chevy-bolt-ev-production-halt-recall-fire-risk"&gt;restart production of brand new versions&lt;/a&gt; of the electric car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLWBIq"&gt;The news comes as LG is once again making batteries for the Bolt after stopping in August. GM says it worked closely with the South Korean conglomerate to make sure the new cells are free of defects that have led to at lest a dozen fires in the automaker’s electric vehicle and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634721/gm-recall-chevrolet-bolt-battery-fire-fix-problems"&gt;a massive recall&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JmNs8"&gt;Owners of older Bolts (model years 2017 to 2019) will have all the modules in their battery packs swapped for new ones. Owners of newer models may only get individual modules changed out, GM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="diiOua"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery swaps will start in October&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cw98E0"&gt;GM said Monday that it will also have dealers start installing new diagnostic software on Bolts in the next 60 days. The software will continually scan the battery packs for signs of defects. If none are found, the software will eventually allow owners to once again charge their vehicles to 100 percent, and abandon some of the other safety guidelines GM has put in place while it worked out the recall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3805Z0"&gt;The initial fix for the recall, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417634/chevy-bolt-recall-fire-fix-software-update"&gt;announced in May&lt;/a&gt;, involved an earlier version of this diagnostic software, though at least two vehicles that received it still caught fire. GM did not go into much detail Monday about how this new software differs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imzpIW"&gt;In the meantime, Bolt owners are supposed to continue adhering to that guidance. GM says owners should park outside and away from their homes after charging, and that they should not charge their vehicles indoors overnight. Owners should not charge their Bolts beyond 90 percent, and avoid depleting the battery below 70 miles of remaining range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdsESZ"&gt;GM made one minor tweak to its guidance, though. As long as they follow the above guidelines, GM says owners need only leave “ample space” between their Bolt and other vehicles, instead 50 feet as it recently advised. It did not define “ample,” though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="UVfd7A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Owners should leave “ample space” when parking&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="szFokd"&gt;GM first issued a recall for the the earlier models of the Bolt &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; after a handful of fires. But it wasn’t until July of this year that it announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590210/chevy-bolt-new-recall-battery-defect-fire-risk-fix"&gt;what the problem was&lt;/a&gt;. In rare cases, some cells that LG made had two different defects — a torn anode and a folded separator — that, when combined, made it possible for a Bolt’s battery pack to catch fire while charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TIQtsW"&gt;LG shut down production of the cells in August, around when GM decided to recall all model years of the Bolt. GM said Monday that production resumed at two locations it runs with LG in Michigan, but that factories in South Korea were still not back online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwQGAo"&gt;The recall has already cost GM some $2 billion. The automaker has said it intends to recoup some or most of that amount from LG — though the two companies are working together on GM’s next-generation Ultium batteries, and will operate multiple new battery factories in the US. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes is on trial for fraud over her time at Theranos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fortune Global Forum - Day 1" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jd7qe4CVeHAD45_aBIbsj-fSPVI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69884166/495430212.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Kimberly White/Getty Images for Fortune&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;12 charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="3MKqmk"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes, the founder and CEO of disgraced blood testing company Theranos, is being tried for 12 charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The trial is expected to last through December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZleF9Y"&gt;Theranos was valued as high as $9 billion, and Holmes was a darling of Silicon Valley, sporting black turtlenecks that prompted comparisons to Steve Jobs. That is, until &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;John Carreyrou’s exposé&lt;/a&gt; was published in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal. &lt;/em&gt;In that article, Carreyrou wrote that Theranos was using its own device for only a handful of tests and that other employees were concerned that the device wasn’t accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1l27X"&gt;Then it came out that &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/problems-found-at-theranos-lab-1453684743"&gt;Theranos’ labs weren’t up to par&lt;/a&gt; and its partnerships with &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/safeway-theranos-split-after-350-million-deal-fizzles-1447205796"&gt;Safeway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11919874/walgreens-ends-theranos-blood-testing-partnership"&gt;Walgreens&lt;/a&gt; fell apart. Also, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-voids-two-years-of-edison-blood-test-results-1463616976"&gt;Theranos junked two years’ worth&lt;/a&gt; of test results. Eventually, Holmes was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulator-bans-theranos-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-from-operating-labs-for-two-years-1467956064"&gt;banned from operating labs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/health/theranos-shutting-down.html"&gt;Theranos dissolved in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the question is whether Holmes deliberately misled patients and investors.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s big fall hardware event is set for September 28th </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wpd5LQ0HgRt9pZDeNl4ZWm-7nJU=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69883981/dseifert_201025_4263_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4SIKuA"&gt;Amazon has officially announced the date for its big fall hardware event: it’ll take place on Tuesday, September 28th at 12PM ET / 9AM PT. As always, Amazon isn’t giving any details on what to expect — the invite sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; only says that they’ll be “news about our latest Amazon devices, features, and services.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5zrSj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21450413/amazon-echo-alexa-ring-luna-event-recap-biggest-announcements"&gt;In previous years&lt;/a&gt;, though, Amazon has announced new Echo speakers, updates to Alexa’s software, new Eero routers, updated Ring cameras, and more. Amazon also tends to announce its more unique and experimental products at its fall event: previous years have send the announcement of the Echo Loop ring, the Echo Frames glasses, and the Ring drone (which has yet to make a re-appearance since its initial debut last year.) We may have gotten an early look at Ring’s dash cam as well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22540298/amazon-ring-car-dash-cam-image-support-article"&gt;when images leaked out this June&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orIxel"&gt;The event is invite only, so don’t expect a public livestream, but &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all the news as soon as it happens on September 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
