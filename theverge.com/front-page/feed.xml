    <title>The pandemic is over in Pokémon Go for players from New Zealand and the US</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kLGOas"&gt;Niantic &lt;a href="https://niantic.helpshift.com/a/pokemon-go/?s=top-articles&amp;amp;f=covid-19-event-feature-updates&amp;amp;p=web"&gt;reverted some of the pandemic-era changes&lt;/a&gt; made to &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; in the US and New Zealand on Sunday, including reducing the distance you need to be from the physical real-world locations of Pokéstops and Gyms to interact with them. The company &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go/22544263/pokemon-go-gameplay-changes-pandemic-covid-19-niantic"&gt;announced the changes in June&lt;/a&gt; and has decided to move forward with its plans, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22549386/pokemon-go-gym-pokestop-distance-changes-niantic-statement"&gt;despite backlash&lt;/a&gt; over the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtOTTg"&gt;The distance you’ll need to be from real-world locations is effectively halved as part of the new update, going from a maximum of 80 meters (around 262 feet) to interact with a Pokéstop, to the game’s original 40 meters (around 131 feet), &lt;a href="https://dotesports.com/news/pokestop-interaction-distance-reduction-other-changes-go-live-in-pokemon-go"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Dot Esports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There were multiple reasons for Niantic to double the distance originally, from reducing crowding during a pandemic, to just making it a bit easier to collect items without theoretically having to leave your house. The change didn’t reinvent the game but players viewed increasing the interaction distance as a valuable accessibility improvement that’s now gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4XbUQg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Pokémon Go’ is going back to its old self&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVRbwX"&gt;Niantic also changed the effectiveness of Incense and the number of gifts you can receive in-game from your Buddy Pokémon. As part of its changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Niantic made the pokémon-attracting Incense item more effective across the board, but now it’ll only be while you’re moving. Gifts from Buddy Pokémon were similarly boosted to up to five gifts at a time at up to three times per day as part of Niantic’s changes, but now the company says “the frequency of these gifts from Buddy Pokémon will be reduced” after the latest update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98cebo"&gt;Tweaks like these begin to bring &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; back to its pre-pandemic self, even if Niantic plans to keep some other changes in the process, like an increased inventory size. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221659/pokemon-go-remote-raid-passes-coronavirus"&gt;Remote Raids&lt;/a&gt;, the ability to participate in big battles with legendary pokémon without having to be there physically, are also sticking around. However, Niantic does plan to change the $0.99 a pop feature slightly: according to Niantic, “in the future, Trainers joining the Raid remotely will do less damage than Trainers joining in-person.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73bKHL"&gt;Collectively, it seems the changes are meant to push players back out into the world and play more in person, which makes sense given &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/the-creators-of-pokemon-go-mapped-the-world-now-theyre-1838974714"&gt;Niantic’s bread and butter &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; collecting location data&lt;/a&gt;. The timing is just a bit unfortunate. &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/22576904/us-new-covid-cases-rising-again-delta-variant"&gt;COVID-19 cases are on the rise again in the US&lt;/a&gt; due to the delta variant, and finding reasons to gather in large groups to collect pocket monsters probably shouldn’t be high on anyone’s list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqHlXf"&gt;You can see the full list of changes for &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://niantic.helpshift.com/a/pokemon-go/?s=top-articles&amp;amp;f=covid-19-event-feature-updates&amp;amp;p=web"&gt;on Niantic’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch’s new ads are way less disruptive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TQPH_BQE7wt0YlVWjVPE4Mas810=/2x0:1132x753/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69668308/000002339_02.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One type of the new Twitch ads looks like a banner ad.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bbECH6"&gt;Twitch is experimenting with &lt;a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/stream-display-ads?language=en_US"&gt;a new type of ad format for streamers&lt;/a&gt; that appears to be much less disruptive than the pre- and mid-roll ads that take over an entire stream. The new ads, called Stream Display Ads, instead show up under or around somebody’s stream but don’t stop you from seeing or hearing what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgCAbK"&gt;You can get an idea of how one style, which is a banner ad, looks &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitchSupport/status/1422255927483318277"&gt;in this tweet from Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wRW5Ai"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  We are experimenting with a new ad format: Stream Display Ads!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;These are less disruptive ads that allow viewers to see and hear Creators while being displayed. Creators will receive ad revenue for each SDA shown. This is an optional feature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/DzYp6yIT5a"&gt;https://t.co/DzYp6yIT5a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/a9qo7Dam6n"&gt;pic.twitter.com/a9qo7Dam6n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch Support (@TwitchSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitchSupport/status/1422255927483318277?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HvUR1E"&gt;The ads can also take over more of the screen, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VRFNnmDHTv6TqH7YECTTExUPyss=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22756686/000002339_03.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitch&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Twitch ads can also occupy more screen real estate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CE2FoD"&gt;The ads will last for 10 seconds, and you won’t be able to close or minimize them while they’re showing, &lt;a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/stream-display-ads?language=en_US"&gt;according to an FAQ from Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitchSupport/status/1422265837336006667"&gt;They’ll show up automatically&lt;/a&gt;, and Twitch promises that there &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitchSupport/status/1422257928900419587"&gt;won’t be more than eight in an hour&lt;/a&gt;. That amount “may fluctuate as demand changes,” the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNevy9"&gt;I’m finding it hard to believe that I’m excited by an ad format, but I feel like I’ll like these new ads more than the current pre- and mid-roll video ads, which prevent me from seeing the actual stream itself. I’m sure I’ll get annoyed by these new ads at some point, too, but since they’ll let me keep watching a stream without too much interruption, I think I’m going to mind them a lot less.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter adds third-party signup with Apple or Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NBK0aQJiIups6AXXZzr4olipHFQ=/0x1155:1125x1905/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69668303/IMG_2175.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AujELN"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1422229834089082882"&gt;has introduced third-party login support&lt;/a&gt;, letting users create accounts and log in to the social network with their Apple or Google accounts (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/02/twitter-for-ios-officially-gains-support-for-sign-in-with-apple/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Currently, there doesn’t appear to be a way to link your Apple or Google account to an existing Twitter account, so third-party login is (at least for the moment) limited to accounts created using the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVWZLQ"&gt;The feature reportedly &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/19/twitter-beta-now-lets-you-log-in-with-your-google-account/"&gt;showed up in the Twitter beta last month&lt;/a&gt;, but now it appears to be more widely available. I was able to set up a Twitter account using my Apple account, and the process was like a more streamlined version of the regular signup process — there were no emails or passwords to deal with, and when signing in with Google, it even brought over the profile picture I use for my Google account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7FfeXa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sign on with ease and start scrolling your timeline. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, when you log in or sign up to join the conversation on Twitter, you have the option to use:&lt;br&gt;▪️ Your Google Account on the app and on web&lt;br&gt;▪️ Or your Apple ID on iOS, and soon on web &lt;a href="https://t.co/Nf56H1ghmY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Nf56H1ghmY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1422229834089082882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5ceRO"&gt;At the moment, the sign-in experience isn’t universal. Signing in with Google is possible on iOS, Android, and Web, but doing so with Apple is currently iOS-only (though web support is coming soon, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1422229834089082882"&gt;according to Twitter Support&lt;/a&gt;). The current version of the Twitter for Mac desktop app doesn’t seem to support either login method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dxj6a1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At the moment, the sign-in experience isn’t universal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fuCDld"&gt;On Android, signing into an account created with Apple doesn’t appear to be possible — the Continue with Apple button isn’t there, and using the traditional Twitter sign-on with my Apple ID password didn’t seem to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yjo2J5"&gt;What’s more, you don’t seem to be able to change your password after you’ve created your account with an Apple login, as the page asks for your current password. &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/create-twitter-account"&gt;A Twitter support page&lt;/a&gt; does mention the ability to disconnect your Apple or Google account, but it’s web-only, which Apple users can’t log into yet. (Google users can perform a password reset after disconnecting their accounts.) We’ve reached out to Twitter to clarify whether this process should work, if it’s done by other means, or if it’s currently not possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmWWGz"&gt;It’s likely no accident that Sign in with Google and Sign in with Apple are launching at the same time — Apple’s App Store guidelines &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#sign-in-with-apple"&gt;require apps to include Apple as an option&lt;/a&gt; if the app allows any other third-party logins. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Lord of the Rings series will premiere in September 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1jGKWyJHPjffOn8suX_kH48Xeug=/600x0:7080x4320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69668070/AmazonStudios_210802A.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first image from Amazon’s yet-untitled Lord of the Rings series.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Ry8Rm"&gt;One of Amazon’s most anticipated originals to date, a yet-unnamed &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; original series, will officially debut on Prime Video on Friday, September 2nd, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJMgRy"&gt;Along with a premiere date, Amazon Studios released an official first image from the forthcoming series, which will be set in Middle-earth’s Second Age. The series will take place thousands of years before the events chronicled in J. R. R. Tolkien’s &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; books, and it will follow characters “both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZ3zjJ"&gt;The image release is tied to the series’s production wrap after filming in New Zealand. Fans &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LOTR_on_Prime/comments/owk0au/on_september_2_2022_a_new_journey_begins/"&gt;quickly speculated&lt;/a&gt; that the series will be set in Valinor, as the image depicts what appear to be the Two Trees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FszXoK"&gt;The untitled project is a huge investment by Amazon in its Prime Video streaming service. The series’s first season alone reportedly &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/lord-of-the-rings-amazon-cost-1234953345/"&gt;cost around $465 million&lt;/a&gt; to produce. For context about what a massive creative undertaking this series has been for Amazon Studios, the final season of &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; was reported to have cost as much as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/arts/television/game-of-thrones-television.html"&gt;$15 million per episode&lt;/a&gt; (though its budget was originally around $5 million per episode).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NmlSut"&gt;The headlining cast of the series includes Cynthia Addai-Robinson, Robert Aramayo, Owain Arthur, Maxim Baldry, Nazanin Boniadi, Morfydd Clark, Ismael Cruz Córdova, Charles Edwards, Trystan Gravelle, Sir Lenny Henry, Ema Horvath, Markella Kavenagh, Joseph Mawle, Tyroe Muhafidin, Sophia Nomvete, Lloyd Owen, Megan Richards, Dylan Smith, Charlie Vickers, Leon Wadham, Benjamin Walker, Daniel Weyman, and Sara Zwangobani. Showrunners J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay are executive producing the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgU9YO"&gt;“As Bilbo says, ‘Now I think I am quite ready to go on another journey,’” Payne and McKay said in a joint statement. “Living and breathing Middle-earth these many months has been the adventure of a lifetime. We cannot wait for fans to have the chance to do so as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PvznX"&gt;The series will premiere in more than 240 territories and countries when it arrives on Prime Video next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The shadow of the chip shortage is looming over tech’s big quarter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1HV96fsmouPZtk6sNhXcn6z5ZC0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69667632/acastro_210430_1777_semiCon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U3ad3o"&gt;Tech earnings this quarter were, to the surprise of no one, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602434/earnings-apple-intel-nothing-earbuds-vergecast-podcast-460"&gt;high&lt;/a&gt;. But amid the record-settling revenues, the looming specter of the global semiconductor shortage was the fly in the ointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAnOmF"&gt;While virtually none of the major tech companies sounded too concerned on their calls, component shortages were called out by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596120/apple-q3-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596578/microsoft-q4-2021-earnings-revenue-xbox-cloud-services-surface-gaming"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22599306/samsung-q2-2021-earnings-component-shortage-foldables"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/07/27/amd-ceo-processor-shipments-will-grow-despite-chip-shortage-and-improve-more-in-2022/"&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-warns-of-consumer-chip-shortages-for-q3"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; as potential problems for either their previous or upcoming quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="p9Ww2m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The chip shortage will likely get worse before it gets better ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XeM2VH"&gt;Apple had already warned that part shortages could impact its iPad and Mac businesses at its Q2 earnings to the tune of $3 billion to $4 billion. CFO Luca Maestri &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-tesla-to-take-hit-from-chip-shortage-a-sign-of-problems-intensity-11627474416"&gt;said on last week’s Q3 earnings call&lt;/a&gt; that it was able to keep those losses mainly limited to iPads and under $3 billion, in what was definitely a win for Apple. But it came at the same time as a warning from CEO Tim Cook that supply constraints could impact the iPhone — the most important and lucrative part of Apple’s product lineup — in the coming quarter, which could be a far more concerning factor for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ioemva"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596578/microsoft-q4-2021-earnings-revenue-xbox-cloud-services-surface-gaming"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, too, called out a decline in Windows OEM revenue (a drop of 3 percent) as being directly caused by supply chain constraints, even as its cloud revenue continued to soar. And of course, while Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox Series X and Series S consoles continue to sell every unit Microsoft can make, there’s just simply not enough supply to go around yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AGu7VE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Earnings are up, but parts are still in short supply&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="64lF7e"&gt;It was a similar story at Samsung, which posted increased revenue and operating profit year over year, carried by massive demand from its semiconductor business (which accounts for over a third of its revenue and more than half its profit). But Samsung was also weighed down by less overall demand and revenue for its mobile phone business, which declined compared to last quarter due to a combination of supply shortages and the seasonal buying cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ig9ZtT"&gt;Other companies, like Tesla, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;have taken more drastic steps&lt;/a&gt; to face the shortage: the company had to develop new firmware for whatever chips it could get its hands on, but CEO Elon Musk was blunt about the fact that semiconductors would be a big concern for the company. “The global chip shortage situation remains quite serious,” he said, highlighting difficulties Tesla experienced getting chips that power essential parts of its cars — specifically the airbags and seatbelt modules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InprxV"&gt;And of course, the chipmakers themselves are calling out concerns. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-intc-2q-earnings-report-2021-11626899296?mod=article_inline"&gt;Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger noted&lt;/a&gt; on an earnings call that the shortage could last through 2023 across the industry, noting that he expects that “it will take another one to two years before the industry is able to completely catch up with demand.” The company also called out “persistent industry-wide component in substrate shortages” — meaning that Intel doesn’t expect to be able to get enough of the raw materials it needs to make chips — despite high demand for its processors. That may lead to “particularly acute” shortages for Intel’s consumer chips in the upcoming third quarter — which would be right when PC sales tend to kick up for back-to-school students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZxWS2G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hard-to-find gadgets will likely only grow harder to find&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lrjwvz"&gt;AMD CEO Lisa Su took a more optimistic note, explaining in &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amd-ceo-chip-shortage-things-135346104.html"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;Yahoo Finance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that while supply may still be “tight” for the rest of 2021, things have been getting better throughout the year. “As we go through the end of this year and certainly into next year, I think things will improve,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEoatK"&gt;Taken as a whole, there are two trends to see here: the first is that big tech companies aren’t letting supply issues stand in the way of posting record revenues. But it’s also clear that the impact of the shortages is very much one that’s still in progress, and until capacity starts to increase or demand starts to die down, concerns over shortages, product delays, and hard-to-find gadgets will likely only grow as we head toward the busy holiday shopping season. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Let’s all finally post a fleet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXumwIQ8WNFO-QzruQrlPZ4kIJk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69667141/acastro_180827_1777_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EZO4ov"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;Twitter is yeeting Fleets&lt;/a&gt;, its Stories-like ephemeral posts, on August 3rd, meaning that depending on when you read this, you may have mere hours to unleash that fleet you’ve been thinking about for months unto the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJfTmC"&gt;And I ask — no, beg: please, post the fleets. I need some entertainment to kick off my month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3n2yFW"&gt;Look, I know that there are already a lot of different places where you can share expiring posts. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/3/4791934/snapchats-next-big-thing-stories-that-dont-just-disappear"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12348354/instagram-stories-announced-snapchat-kevin-systrom-interview"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/28/15081398/facebook-stories-snapchat-camera-direct"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/119760/linkedin-stories-overview?lang=en"&gt;Even LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. And that huge number of choices is probably part of why Fleets never really took off. Why share expiring posts on Twitter when many other apps have offered better tools to do so for years? Even on my iPhone 12 Mini, my Fleets bar was rarely filled up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJALgI"&gt;But let’s change that just for one day to send Fleets out in a blaze of glory. I’ve contributed to the cause, posting my final (and first ever) fleet. It’s a bad fleet, so please don’t leave me on an island — help me out by posting better fleets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6EOoTK"&gt;Disappointingly, that annoying bar at the top of the Twitter app won’t be disappearing entirely once Fleets go to the great social media graveyard. Instead, it will show active Spaces, its social audio rooms (another feature that’s appearing in some shape or form in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586845/clubhouse-open-beta-invite-access-android-ios"&gt;zillion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22431438/discord-stage-channel-discovery-social-audio-threads-logo-clyde"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391875/reddit-talk-clubhouse-social-audio"&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;including LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;). But until Spaces take over, let’s finally fill up that Fleets bar with the best (or cringiest) stuff that you’ve got. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A man violated a restraining order by renaming his estranged wife’s Napster playlists</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Napster" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t2V72xSJPMzPUyQHl-c7BFPExmc=/0x0:3364x2243/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69667088/1083228848.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="svRuxX"&gt;An Ohio man harassed his estranged wife through a shared Napster account, evading a no-contact order by changing the titles of playlists. Ohio’s Eighth District Court of Appeals &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/8/2021/2021-Ohio-2590.pdf"&gt;outlined the case&lt;/a&gt; in a July 29th ruling, which was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericgoldman/status/1421629682013806596"&gt;flagged on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; by writer and attorney Eric Goldman. It’s an example of how metadata can become a vector for harassment outside major social platforms — echoing long-standing problems on other services like Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0f0fpo"&gt;According to the court ruling, defendant Jacob Dunn admitted to reaching out to his wife through a Napster account that both of them could access. A court had issued a temporary protection order (TPO) against Dunn in 2018, prohibiting him from contacting his wife through any means. But Dunn violated the order by renaming music playlists — one was changed to “I want us to work. Do you? I’ll do anything,” another to “I love you more than ever ... do you still love me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SVX3I0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;He’d agreed not to contact his wife through any medium&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bdJ1Mn"&gt;Dunn pled no contest to aggravated menacing and violating the order, although he later unsuccessfully attempted to withdraw and appeal his plea. At his sentencing hearing he claimed he hadn’t understood the rules of the TPO, despite explicitly agreeing to them beforehand — “I figured out the hard way, unfortunately,” he said. Court records indicate he was sentenced to probation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDzsgl"&gt;Napster — a streaming service previously called Rhapsody, distinct from the defunct file-sharing service — is one of many usually innocuous services that stalkers and harassers can exploit. As &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2021/06/03/spotify-accused-of-letting-stalkers-hound-their-victims/?sh=4a297142253f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes &lt;/em&gt;contributor Barry Collins has reported&lt;/a&gt;, Spotify users have complained about being followed by stalkers who can view targets’ listening sessions and &lt;a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Your-Library/Stalker-using-Spotify-to-intimidate-and-harass-me/td-p/5030326"&gt;share playlists&lt;/a&gt; with abusive names. They’ve criticized Spotify for dragging its feet on privacy and blocking tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4qC04"&gt;This case involves a more unusual problem that most anti-harassment measures wouldn’t mitigate, since it involves two people who had agreed to share an account. (It’s not clear whether they agreed to keep sharing it after separating or if Dunn’s wife simply hadn’t considered revoking his access.) It’s a clearer demonstration of how digital entanglements can have unexpected downsides — even with something as simple as a music playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter verifies fake Cormac McCarthy account (again) </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kHVwF2E-g6tat-cavq2WZaqoHEU=/8x0:1223x810/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69667008/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_4.44.08_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cormac McCarthy at the premiere of the film adaptation of his novel&lt;/em&gt; The Road&lt;em&gt; in 2009&lt;/em&gt;.  | Photo by Jim Spellman/WireImage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DLCzSa"&gt;Twitter’s verification process is notoriously slapdash, but you’d expect the company not to fall for the exact same fake twice, right? Wrong! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kr5Y8d"&gt;In 2012, Twitter verified an account supposedly belonging to illustrious author Cormac McCarthy, which was in reality started by an &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/unpublished-novelists-week-fake-cormac-mccarthy/332435/"&gt;unpublished novelist&lt;/a&gt;. Now, in 2021, it’s done the same thing again, briefly verifying a &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; McCarthy fake under the handle @CormacMcCrthy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPtL4b"&gt;The account has now been un-verified, but a representative for McCarthy’s agent at ICM Partners confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was fake. “I can confirm that this is definitely not a genuine Cormac McCarthy account,” they said. “Twitter is aware of this situation and we hope to have the issue resolved shortly.” Twitter has yet to respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BO6QTs"&gt;It is certainly hard to believe that the 88-year-old McCarthy — best known for the unrelenting darkness and violence of his many novels, including &lt;em&gt;The Road&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Blood Meridian&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;No Country for Old Men —&lt;/em&gt; would ever tweet anything quite as twee as the following:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/owWm-jeRHvVN3U4CF24eB3enHy0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22756183/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_5.02.06_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A tweet from the Cormac McCarthy account when it was verified earlier today&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2qPxBb"&gt;But apparently Twitter HQ was none the wiser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6rnBoE"&gt;The @CormacMcCrthy account has been tweeting infrequently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CormacMcCrthy/status/1052301984865214464"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt; but was verified after a pair of its tweets went viral, racking up tens of thousands of likes and retweets. Many Twitter users were instantly skeptical about the authenticity of the account. “We have so normalised the idea of geniuses demeaning themselves on social media that people can actually believe Cormac McCarthy would tweet in the cadence of a John Oliver monologue,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NedBeauman/status/1421948813644865539"&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt; British novelist Ned Beauman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3N6P7"&gt;But the lure of Doing Numbers apparently was too much for some to stay away. Another verified author, Stephen King, had a bit of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/1421859855489449989"&gt;back and forth&lt;/a&gt; with the fake McCarthy, though whether King was actually fooled by the account isn’t clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gbbyx7"&gt;Twitter’s verification process is frequently criticized for being slow, unfair, or just simply wrong. It relaunched the verification process earlier this year, using the criteria that accounts should be “&lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts"&gt;authentic, notable, and active&lt;/a&gt;” to be verified &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458914/twitter-verification-pause-applications-relaunch"&gt;only to “pause” the program a week later&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers have noted that the company’s checks seem so haphazard that it frequently verifies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575025/twitter-verified-fake-accounts-botnet-researcher"&gt;spam and bot accounts&lt;/a&gt;. But still, they really should have noticed that something was up here. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This is the Pixel 6</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google’s new Pixel 6 phones, regular and Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Da2gdZDEVuvf3zGD1efSQjCb4mw=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69666896/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google’s new Pixel 6 phones, regular and Pro | Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Google’s new Tensor SoC is the heart of its next phone&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZtbQzN"&gt;Google is announcing the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro today, though it might be &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-tensor-debuts-new-pixel-6-fall/"&gt;better to call it a preview or a tease&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than releasing all the details on its new Android phones, Google is instead putting the focus on the new system on a chip (SoC) that will be inside the new Pixels. It’s called the Tensor SoC, named after the Tensor Processing Units (TPU) Google uses in its data centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBPbOE"&gt;Tensor is an SoC, not a single processor. And so while it’s fair to call it Google-designed, it’s also still unclear which components are Google-made and which are licensed from others. Two things are definitely coming from Google: a mobile TPU for AI operations and a new Titan M2 chip for security. The rest, including the CPU, GPU, and 5G modem, are all still a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OeH2zJ"&gt;Less mysterious: the phones themselves. I spent about an hour at Google’s Mountain View campus last week looking at the phone hardware and talking with Google’s hardware chief Rick Osterloh about Tensor. After all that, my main takeaway about the new Pixel 6 phones is simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpRydn"&gt;Google is actually, finally trying to make a competitive flagship phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qYkC6nm2kiiK0khVjc2DFmxtpp8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755114/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Lm1UgR"&gt;This fall, Google will release two slightly different Pixel phones: the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro. If the final versions are anything like the prototypes I saw last week, they will be the first Pixel phones that don’t feel like they’re sandbagging when it comes to build quality. “We knew we didn’t have what it took to be in the ultra high end [in the past],” Osterloh admits. “And this is the first time where we feel like we really have it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWmy8w"&gt;Both versions of the Pixel were glass sandwiches with fit-and-finish that are finally in the same league as what Samsung, Huawei, and Apple have to offer. “We’ve definitively not been in the flagship tier for the past couple years, this will be different,” says Osterloh. He also admits that “it will certainly be a premium-priced product,” which I take to mean north of $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UU_zDtDmN0Whd2AQ5rBPEMEVMD8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755092/Google_Pixel_6_Pro.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 has a hole-punch camera and thin bezels" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jI9FMVxxrJ1KCJAKXTee1WUPXks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22756252/screen.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Google Pixel 6 has a hole-punch camera and thin bezels&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5xkLUu"&gt;Google is only sharing a few of the key specs for each phone, leaving the details for later — likely October. (And no, there was no mention of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;folding phone&lt;/a&gt; nor a &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-watch"&gt;watch&lt;/a&gt;.) Google also wouldn’t allow us to take photos or video of the devices during our meeting. In any case, here is what we do know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0ruPW"&gt;The Pixel 6 Pro will have a 6.7-inch QHD+ display with a 120Hz refresh rate. That screen is very slightly curved at the edges, blending into shiny, polished aluminum rails on the side. It has three cameras on the back: a new wide-angle main sensor, an ultrawide, and a 4X optical-zoom folded telephoto lens. Google isn’t sharing specs on the camera beyond saying the main wide-angle sensor takes in 150 percent more light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFYPpa"&gt;The regular Pixel 6 has a 6.4-inch FHD+ screen with a 90Hz refresh rate. Its screen is perfectly flat, with matte-finished rails. It also loses the telephoto camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wl2uW"&gt;Although there will be memory differences between the phones, both will have the new Tensor SoC, a Titan M2 security chip, and in-display fingerprint sensor. There will be slightly different color options for the two types of phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrHB6l"&gt;As is often the case with polarizing designs, the look of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro make a little more sense in person than in leaked images. There is a huge “camera bar” that runs the full width of the phones, with a barely raised metal rail to protect the glass from scratches. There are only so many ways to handle massive camera bumps on big phones and Google’s solution is to “celebrate and highlight” them, in Osterloh’s words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google’s promo image for the Tensor SoC" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5sBcy2wSUE3dFWs1qKA34dsLrjY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755094/Google_Tensor__Info_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s promo image for the Tensor SoC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="vDdD7X"&gt;If all Google were doing was rescuing the Pixel line from the doldrums of the midrange, that would be significant but not worth a months-early pre-announcement. The most important part of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro is that Google is using that new Tensor SoC inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="nYzXVf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It took us a few years, but we’ve finally built a technology platform that we think is really important.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="Vu8EX0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So excited to share our new custom Google Tensor chip, which has been 4 yrs in the making (  for scale)! Tensor builds off of our 2 decades of computing experience and it’s our biggest innovation in Pixel to date. Will be on Pixel 6 + Pixel 6 Pro in fall. &lt;a href="https://t.co/N95X6gFxLf"&gt;https://t.co/N95X6gFxLf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/wHiEJRHJwy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wHiEJRHJwy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1422228336533676035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hiP4hI"&gt;Qualcomm has a virtual monopoly on processors in Android devices in the US. Worldwide, there is a little bit more competition as Samsung, MediaTek, and Huawei all have chips in Android phones. But on the whole, processing power on Android phones is rightfully thought of as woefully behind what Apple has done with its own in-house silicon on its A-Series line of chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iD9pjC"&gt;Because of that situation, there’s a lot of interest to see if Google could potentially make a more competitive chip that could differentiate its products. But don’t let that interest trick you into thinking that Tensor is exactly equivalent to Apple’s A-Series chips. Tensor is the system on a chip, with a mix of components that Google itself has designed and others that it has licensed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wG72wj"&gt;Google’s not sharing who designed the CPU and GPU, nor is it sharing benchmarks on their performance — though Osterloh says that it should be “market leading.” (Current rumors suggest that it might be &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/09/everything-we-know-google-whitechapel-gs101-pixel-6/"&gt;Samsung providing those more standard component designs&lt;/a&gt;.) He adds, “The standard stuff people look at will be very competitive and the AI stuff will be totally differentiated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5qky4"&gt;Instead, this week’s announcement is an attempt to reframe the narrative away from gigahertz and toward artificial intelligence and machine learning in phones — areas where Google, of course, has a big advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbxM0h"&gt;Typically when you think about a phone’s specs, you think of the core three: CPU, GPU, and RAM. Those pieces of the SoC are what impact your day-to-day experience the most — how fast the phone feels, how long it lasts on battery, how well it connects to a cellular network, and so on. After that, there are generally some co-processors off to the side that handle discrete tasks like image processing or security. Google itself has already made some of those — the Titan M chip and Pixel Visual Core have appeared on previous phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7acPqk"&gt;“It’s definitely very different than just another co-processor,” Osterloh says. “Like with any SoC, we license a lot of technology into it, but this is our design and it was designed specifically with the purpose of driving our ML and AI forward.” Google’s argument is that the new chips in Tensor are an essential part of many of the things the new Pixel phones can do — not unlike Apple’s Neural Core in its A-Series processors.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 Pro comes in three staid color options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Pixel 6 has two more fun color choices" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tt0ROElXG4wQo6XFI8EBRn2SZXo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755096/Pixel_6_Group_Image__Transparent_.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 has two more fun color choices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0EqsGm"&gt;“The computers of the future are becoming much more heterogenous than they have in the past,” Osterloh argues. He has for years been signaling that the end of Moore’s law will mean that computers — and phones — will need to be built differently. “There’ll be a lot more specialized sub-elements to the design to be able to do things in specific ways. This is a consequence of raw computing power running out of headroom or growing more slowly than the kinds of processing we want to do with AI,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWIrUK"&gt;The most important of those chips is a mobile version of a Tensor Processing Unit. Google has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/5/19/11716818/google-alphago-hardware-asic-chip-tensor-processor-unit-machine-learning"&gt;making TPUs for its server farms for over five years now&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated to more efficiently performing AI and ML tasks. It offered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/26/17616140/google-edge-tpu-on-device-ai-machine-learning-devkit"&gt;an “edge” version of its TPU for enterprise solutions&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago, but the Pixel 6 marks the first time Google has put a mobile TPU in a phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sBRVH"&gt;So what can the new TPU inside Tensor actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;? Google had a small handful of demos. The first two were, unsurprisingly, related to photography. Using ML to make better photos has historically been a huge advantage for Pixel phones, but in recent years progress has stagnated and competitors have caught and surpassed the Pixel — and far surpassed it when it comes to video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekejP9"&gt;Google clearly wants to take back the crown and thinks the TPU is the way to do it. The first demo Google showed was a blurry photo of a toddler — the kid was moving because that is what kids do. A second version of the photo was the same but run through Tensor’s TPU, and the kid’s face was sharper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="Umsfbk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This problem is a very difficult smartphone camera physics problem. We’re trying to turn those kinds of problems into data problems, where we can solve them with Tensor.”  &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 (top) and Pixel 6 Pro (bottom)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wtGJVbpSxRQ-1mZX2Td8DvmiXtI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755093/Google_Pixel_6_Pro_Google_Pixel_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 6 (top) and Pixel 6 Pro (bottom).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The regular Google Pixel 6 has a matte rail." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vTVVJxkcFa-nfkz1Kyx9ZPf-pOw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755110/Google_Pixel_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The regular Google Pixel 6 has a matte rail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VMfZs2"&gt;It wasn’t a deepfake. What the Pixel 6 does is run the process of snapping a bunch of photos from the main sensor and combine them into a single, HDR image. But now the Pixel 6 also has the ultrawide grab a fast, sharper image to capture that detail. Then the TPU recognizes that there’s a face, and then combines the ultrawide’s image with the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mSnOL"&gt;But impressive image demos are a dime a dozen these days. Google itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15654476/google-photos-object-removal-feature-demo"&gt;famously promised&lt;/a&gt; to remove chain link fences from photos in 2017 but never delivered. The promise of Tensor is to deliver better results more quickly, since the SoC is designed to more efficiently run data through the TPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWqimK"&gt;It’s right to be skeptical until we get a chance to test the camera ourselves. It’s &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; to be skeptical of the Pixel 6’s video abilities given the Pixel line’s history of mediocre video — but Google’s second demo didn’t make skepticism easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHlccE"&gt;It was a simple pan across a beach, with the setting sun fully in frame for much of the shot. As an HDR video, it was challenging. Google set up a rig with the Pixel 6, Pixel 5, and iPhone 12 Pro Max and shot the same pan with all three. As you might expect in a demo provided by Google, video from Google’s new phone looked the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5X1s6"&gt;Specifically, it didn’t artificially brighten shadows too much like the iPhone 12 Pro Max and also maintained a more natural white balance throughout. Compared to the Pixel 5, it was no contest. Last year’s Pixel over-sharpened everything into abstract art while the Pixel 6 looked much more natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZDoGR"&gt;The main reason the Pixel 6’s video was better, according to Osterloh, is that putting the TPU in line with the whole image processing stand means that the same HDRNet process that Google applies to still images can now be applied to every single frame in video. The demo I saw was in 4K at 30fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWNvSE"&gt;The other demos were a bit more subtle and were related to translating speech to text, which Tensor handled locally without needing an internet connection. In one, the Pixel’s on-device auto-caption feature appeared to be a little faster and more accurate — and was even able to translate from French to English in real time from a playing video. “We’re now able to run data-center quality models on our device,” says Osterloh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fqNSB"&gt;In another demo, Osterloh showed that speaking to type was nearly instantaneous and that he could use the keyboard to edit words inline at the same time he was speaking — both input methods were active at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cCzEr"&gt;In addition to the TPU, the Pixel 6 will also have a new version of Google’s Titan M security chip. In the blog post announcing the Pixel 6, Google is going so far as to say that “with Tensor’s new security core and Titan M2, Pixel 6 will have the most layers of hardware security in any phone,” with a footnote that the claim is “based on a count of independent hardware security subsystems and components.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vujKKs"&gt;Finally, Osterloh says there will be an “always-on computer” that will handle low-level, low-power processes like the ambient display. The battery life target for the Pixel 6 is still only “all day,” however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5lEcuap0y9W88cjxHw_0a_-k5V4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755100/Google_Pixel_6_Pro__Alt_Angle_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 6 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="vDq0Xi"&gt;The thing about AI and ML is that it might make search more accurate and photos better, but it’s not necessarily going to improve everything that happens on your phone. Osterloh suggests that as the TPU takes up more AI cycles, that could free up the other chips for more performance. That may be, but it’s still hard to make AI a selling point for a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48JZZ9"&gt;So Google has its work cut out for it. Doubly so, actually, since the Google Pixel line has languished in the low single digits of market share in the US ever since it was announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6HZlJ"&gt;With the Google Pixel 6, Osterloh says that’s going to change. He’s ready to start grabbing market share wherever he can get it — whether that be from Apple or Samsung. “The product is really, now, The Google Phone,” Osterloh says. “So we are ready to invest a lot in marketing and we want to grow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BAkOHu"&gt;In last week’s earnings call, Google CFO Ruth Porat warned investors to keep a look out for higher than usual marketing costs: “In addition, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year in part to support product launches in the holiday season.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NgOcWh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s the first time Google has truly pulled out all the stops for a Pixel phone, but will that be enough?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XqhROr"&gt;It has been five years since Google started making Pixel phones and in nearly every single one of those years I’ve asked some variation of the same question: is Google really serious about hardware? Does it intend to be a real competitor and make real money or is the entire effort just a rehashing of the old Nexus strategy? Or, to use a more recent reference, is the Pixel line just in a kind of “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/21/technology/sundar-pichai-google.html?referringSource=articleShare"&gt;Pantry Mode&lt;/a&gt;,” kept alive just in case it’s ever needed for real?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mo0jKv"&gt;Osterloh says that work on this new Tensor silicon began four years ago. Perhaps not coincidentally, it was about four years ago when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16340108/google-htc-smartphone-team-acquisition-announced"&gt;Google announced it intended to buy HTC’s phone hardware division&lt;/a&gt;. That must have been the year Google got serious about the Pixel line — and it’s only now that we’re beginning to see the fruits of that effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1I6ga"&gt;Will it be enough? Will the Pixel 6 seriously vie for the enthusiast crowd that wants the very best phone and also grab measurable market share at the same time? We are very far from being able to answer those questions right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sv73Ck"&gt;I am not going to tell you to get hyped up for the Pixel 6. It’s too early and there’s too much we don’t know. But I do think it’s very interesting that &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt; wants to start building up hype. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmhrjB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CsuCuO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senate negotiators release bipartisan infrastructure bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="U.S. Lawmakers Narrow Infrastructure Gaps Without Reaching Deal" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bc9ApbSa5l1C2Qd13dJ1lEW_R-U=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69666829/1234273799.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qQZv2E"&gt;On Sunday, a bipartisan group of senators released their over $1 trillion infrastructure package after weeks of negotiations. As written, the bill authorizes over $500 billion in new spending to strengthen roads, bridges, and other physical infrastructure like high-speed broadband and electric vehicle adoption. The result is the largest domestic spending bill in more than 10 years, touching on nearly every aspect of the US economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhmCC7"&gt;Last week, negotiators reached a deal to bolster the nation’s broadband networks with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598636/white-house-infrastructure-broadband-package-bipartisan"&gt;an additional $65 billion&lt;/a&gt;, but left it unclear exactly how that funding would be spent or how much of it would go toward increasing affordability and adoption.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But the text released yesterday contained language to make the FCC’s Emergency Broadband Benefit program permanent, renaming it the Affordably Connectivity Fund. The permanent version of the program would offer lower monthly subsidies — $30 rather than the previous $50 — but would also provide $100 for equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RIui6c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Senate can quickly process relevant amendments and pass this bill in a matter of days”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IjTsCq"&gt;More than 4 million households have enrolled in the Emergency Broadband Benefit program since it was established during the pandemic, according to the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYiGjd"&gt;The bipartisan package also includes billions to build half a million electric vehicle (EV) chargers across the country, in an effort to increase EV sales in the US. The bill would also expand government involvement in cryptocurrency, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/new-infrastructure-bill-looks-to-raise-30b-through-crypto-taxes"&gt;raising $28 billion&lt;/a&gt; from a new tax on cryptocurrency brokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AzMQ3"&gt;It’s unclear when the bill is expected to receive a vote on the Senate floor, but Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said that it could be approved later this week. “Given how bipartisan the bill is and how much work has already been put in to get the details right, I believe the Senate can quickly process relevant amendments and pass this bill in a matter of days,” Schumer said on Sunday. The text of the bill could still change as a result of amendments accepted on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYUDX0"&gt;Still, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has pledged not to bring the bipartisan package to the floor until the Senate votes on a second $3.5 trillion spending package through the reconciliation process, likely to proceed on party lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5KZQg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PwO07G"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
