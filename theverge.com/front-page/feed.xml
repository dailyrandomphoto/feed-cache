    <title>Apple doesn’t make a MagSafe car charger — here are your options</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2YypLOutr2SHxGrv2FW75FTcd5Y=/337x0:1537x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68675287/belkin_wic002_magnetic_vent_cable_management_product_page_v01_r01_1680x600_us.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Belkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XkfDkH"&gt;Getting a MagSafe car charger for your iPhone seems like a simple process, but the current landscape is one of trade-offs: there are no all-in-one solutions that will wirelessly hold and charge your phone &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; are MagSafe certified to provide up to 15W of power. However, manufactures have been finding workarounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agS2QL"&gt;First, there’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2FP-WIC002%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F15%2F22231718%2Fmagsafe-car-chargers-apple-iphone-certification-process#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Belkin’s Car Vent Mount Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only MagSafe Certified car mount, and it sells for $39.99. Being certified doesn’t mean it provides power, though. You’ll have to plug your phone in with a Lightning cable (which you’d have to do anyway for wired CarPlay compatibility). This does technically let you charge your phone faster than regular wireless charging, but it leaves you messing around with a cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8tH9D"&gt;Then there’s &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/14/scosche-magsafe-magicmount-series-brings-magsafe-charging-to-your-car"&gt;the Scosche MagicMount&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a 20W car adapter but nothing to plug into it. You have to provide your own MagSafe puck, which adds $39 to the MagicMount’s $29.99 to $39.99 price tag (which varies by model). While it does technically get you MagSafe-certified mounting and charging, that’s only because you’re using Apple’s own puck. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1A3jkGPVnNX0cQqFQinjlAXv-6c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22238391/Screen_Shot_2021_01_15_at_10.16.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re fine with just using an official MagSafe puck, you will be spoiled for choice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CfxoE7"&gt;Just providing the plastic to put around Apple’s charger is a common approach. Amazon is full of the BYOP (bring your own puck) car mounts, and we’ve &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3300477/elago-w3-macintosh-apple-watch-charging-stand-sale-on-amazon.html"&gt;also seen it with Apple Watch charger accessories&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a quick and easy way to get users the fully certified experience without having to wait for certification (and without Apple’s Made For iPhone program fees). The downside is that users have to buy two different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eh2PCV"&gt;Finally, there’s &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/26/review-esr-halolock-is-everything-a-magsafe-car-charger-should-be"&gt;the ESR HaloLock&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to have it all. It’s one piece, magnetically holds your iPhone, and provides wireless charging. The only thing missing is MagSafe certification, meaning Apple will only let your phone charge at 7.5W. You’ll again see a lot of similar products on Amazon, where the manufacturer has copied MagSafe’s magnets but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215639/anker-magsafe-qi-charger-apple-alternative-giant-usb-c-plug-explained"&gt;used a standard Qi charger for power&lt;/a&gt;. Like the puck holders, you’ll get most of the functionality without actually having to be certified, and the product will be fine for people who aren’t worried about fast charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cV4d0"&gt;This isn’t to say that third-party, fully certified MagSafe car mounts won’t show up at some point, just that it may take a little while. And given the other routes get you pretty close to the real deal, you can expect to see a lot of those in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WarnerMedia extends its 20 percent discount on HBO Max subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vaxg3vCzbZGKNaPQgOXHkOpl2cw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68674938/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VVLkDb"&gt;A discount on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21272223/hbo-max-app-how-to-watch-download-price-subscription-stream-shows"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; that was supposed to end today, January 15th, has been extended until March 1st, 2021. The fine print of the offer hasn’t changed: you can get six months of HBO Max for 20 percent off the normal total cost, which is usually $90 before tax. &lt;a href="https://www.hbomax.com/"&gt;You’ll pay $70 with this deal&lt;/a&gt; (it’s like paying just under $12 per month instead of $15), but the catch is that you have to prepay in full and it’s nonrefundable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOq3Hq"&gt;This discount is open to both new and returning HBO Max subscribers, but it can’t be stacked with a free trial or any other promotion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhmXqS"&gt;WarnerMedia kicked off this deal in early December 2020 on the heels of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;Warner Bros. announcing that its 2021 slate of films would debut on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; alongside the theatrical releases and remain available to stream for 30 days. &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; was the first of its films to launch, and you have a few more weeks to catch that one before it’s a theater-exclusive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWTeW3"&gt;It has several more movies expected to launch throughout the year, including &lt;em&gt;The Little Things, Judas and the Black Messiah, Tom &amp;amp; Jerry, Godzilla vs. Kong, Mortal Kombat, Those Who Wish Me Dead, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, In The Heights, Space Jam: A New Legacy, The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21377415/suicide-squad-2-james-gunn-fandome-characters-introduction-dc-comics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Reminiscence, Malignant, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168881/denis-villeneuve-christopher-nolan-anger-hbo-max-streaming-att"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, The Many Saints of Newark, King Richard, Cry Macho, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/21/20826649/matrix-sequel-m4trix-keanu-reeves-carrie-anne-moss-lana-wachowski-fan-wishes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matrix 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is again extending TV Plus trials to July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/me2uysfcLPyuog6TRPxQGfc2-eM=/128x0:1505x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68674914/Apple_introduces_apple_tv_plus_03252019_big.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oOgrkB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/15/apple-again-extends-apple-tv-free-trials-subscribers-now-get-free-access-until-july-2021/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+9To5Mac-MacAllDay+%289+to+5+Mac+-+Apple+Intelligence%29"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Apple will be extending its free year-long trials of its TV Plus service to customers until July 2021. The trials were originally included with the purchase of any Apple device (e.g., an iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV) and were initially set to last until November 1st, 2020. This is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508148/apple-tv-plus-free-period-extended-february-2021-streaming"&gt;the second extension&lt;/a&gt;, with the first extending from November 2020 to February 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWCt0Q"&gt;Subscribers who had free subscriptions that were set to expire any time from February 2021 to June 2021 will also get an extension until July. The extension comes in the wake of production delays. Only one of the shows the service launched with (&lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt;) has had its second season premiere, while others — like &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; — are still waiting for their second seasons to come out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zB2ZgV"&gt;Show productions being delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic is no surprise, and extending the trial is a nice gesture. Viewers probably would like to start watching the second seasons of their favorite shows before they decide whether the service is worth $4.99 a month, and the extension is giving them the ability to do so. After all, there’s not a ton of use in a TV subscription service if some shows only have 12 episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp to delay new privacy policy amid mass confusion about Facebook data sharing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H4Ou6zEiXz4l_m0CuKUCG1iVlvg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68674807/akrales_180215_2310_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0ItYbS"&gt;WhatsApp on Friday announced a three-month delay of a new privacy policy originally slated to go into effect on February 8th following widespread confusion over whether the new policy would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218989/signal-new-signups-whatsapp-facebook-privacy-controversy-elon-musk"&gt;mandate data sharing with Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2zqvq"&gt;The update does not in fact affect data sharing with Facebook with regard to user chats or other profile information; WhatsApp has repeatedly clarified that its update addresses business chats in the event a user converses with a company’s customer service platform through WhatsApp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nfZOsh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;WhatsApp is trying to clear up confusion about its privacy practices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q26Fj9"&gt;“We’ve heard from so many people how much confusion there is around our recent update. There’s been a lot of misinformation causing concern and we want to help everyone understand our principles and the facts,” the company wrote in a &lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/giving-more-time-for-our-recent-update"&gt;new blog post published today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Kxcse"&gt;Since 2016, WhatsApp has shared certain information with Facebook, including your phone number, unless you were one of the select few users who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/26/12655518/how-to-stop-whatsapp-sharing-phone-number-facebook"&gt;chose to opt out of data sharing while the option was still available that year&lt;/a&gt;. WhatsApp does not, however, look at people’s chat messages or listen to their phone calls, and WhatsApp conversations are end-to-end encrypted to protect against those abuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yb3iqi"&gt;Despite this, a pop-up informing users of the new change included mention of how WhatsApp partners with Facebook, and it also included an ultimatum instructing users to delete their account if they chose not to agree to the new terms. That gave people the idea they were being railroaded into new, more invasive terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9falaM"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;released a separate blog post this week&lt;/a&gt; trying to clear up the confusion, and it included a chart that specifies what information is protected and not shared when someone uses WhatsApp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Gos4A"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We want to address some rumors and be 100% clear we continue to protect your private messages with end-to-end encryption. &lt;a href="https://t.co/6qDnzQ98MP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6qDnzQ98MP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WhatsApp (@WhatsApp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp/status/1348839600333049857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dQXH4t"&gt;But numerous media reports highlighting the addition of new, broad language in the privacy policy (language WhatsApp says has been misconstrued to imply mandated data sharing) and misinformation on social media have coalesced into a full-blown WhatsApp privacy backlash. The result has been a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;surge in sign-ups for messaging competitors&lt;/a&gt; like Signal and Telegram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWvOnh"&gt;Facebook executives, including Instagram chief Adam Mosseri and WhatsApp head Will Cathcart, used Twitter to try to clear up the confusion, it seems with little success. Facebook’s poor privacy track record, and the fact that WhatsApp has over time turned its sights on monetizing the platform for its large international user base, has eroded trust in the chat app, which, in turn, has had the effect of turning a relatively mundane update into a worldwide controversy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1ezUd"&gt;WhatsApp says it’s now going to use this three-month delay to better communicate both the changes in its new policy and its long-standing privacy practices around personal chats, location sharing, and other sensitive data. “We’re now moving back the date on which people will be asked to review and accept the terms,” the blog post reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="RfvTGW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jbl556"&gt;WhatsApp says no one will be losing access to the app if they didn’t agree to the new terms of service agreement that communicated the changes earlier this month. “We’re also going to do a lot more to clear up the misinformation around how privacy and security works on WhatsApp. We’ll then go to people gradually to review the policy at their own pace before new business options are available on May 15,” the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbF9Ht"&gt;WhatsApp tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the policy won’t be changing when it does come out. The intent of the update is communicating to users that messages with businesses on WhatsApp may be stored on Facebook servers, which necessitates data sharing between the two companies (that data, WhatsApp says, can be used for businesses for the purpose of advertising, but Facebook does not share it across its apps automatically). WhatsApp still intends to release the update on May 15th to coincide with new business chat features it &lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/shopping-payments-and-customer-service-on-whatsapp"&gt;began previewing back in October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjSmTD"&gt;But the company hopes the extra time will help it get a handle on the controversy and better improve its messaging around what’s actually changing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Zz9V6"&gt;“The update includes new options people will have to message a business on WhatsApp, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data. While not everyone shops with a business on WhatsApp today, we think that more people will choose to do so in the future and it’s important people are aware of these services,” the blog post reads. “This update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JzodJm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 3:26PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified how WhatsApp’s new privacy policy will treat data collected during chats with businesses as part of the upcoming privacy policy change, now going into effect on May 15th. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will address Pixel 4A 5G touchscreen woes in February update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="You probably don’t need 5G yet, but the Google Pixel 4A 5G has other strong benefits." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WA4VgG46-A0OT6SNdczAkoyuvQA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68665252/akrales_201013_4137_0289.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Pixel 4a 5G’s 6.2-inch touchscreen has been acting up for some users. | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TUco78"&gt;Google says it’s aware of a problem with Pixel 4A 5G touchscreens and will address the issue in its February security update. Some devices are failing to respond consistently to taps on the lower part of the screen, which is particularly impacting folks who have opted for three-button navigation rather than swipes. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/12/pixel-4a-5g-touchscreen-issue-can-make-navigation-buttons-hard-to-use/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; spotted complaints&lt;/a&gt; from 4A 5G owners experiencing the issue, which seems to have cropped up after the December security patch was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrWHuU"&gt;Google’s response comes courtesy of &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/87628791?hl=en"&gt;a Pixel support forum post&lt;/a&gt;, which was recently updated with the February patch timing. In the meantime, Google advises users to work around the issue with some specific instructions on tapping navigation controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="TqJzoJ"&gt;1. When tapping icons on the edge of the screen, tap the center of the button or the side of the button/icon furthest away from the edge of the display.&lt;br&gt;2. When tapping icons, including the navigation buttons on the bottom of your screen, use the tip of your finger or thumb instead. This will help improve touch recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SjP3BP"&gt;It’s not an easy task to try and consciously change the way you do something like tap a button on your phone screen, so hopefully Pixel 4A 5G users will only have to attempt these awkward workarounds for a little while longer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly planning big iMac redesign and half-sized Mac Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2020 27-inch iMac" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4NLbopL1lUnciLfhthZSqzZUmWg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68674516/DSC01539.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZlSMVl"&gt;In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;revamped MacBook Pros that ditch the Touch Bar and resurrect MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;, Apple is also said to be planning to announce its long-awaited iMac redesign this year — and a pair of Mac Pro refreshes are on the roadmap, too. This is all according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-plans-redesigned-imac-new-mac-pro-smaller-mac-pro-cheaper-monitor?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, who says the iMac will undergo its most significant overhaul since 2012: Apple will reportedly ditch the chin beneath the screen, cut down on display bezels, and move to a flat-back design. The overall appearance will likely resemble the Pro Display XDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rT5Uv7"&gt;The new iMac will replace the Intel-powered 27-inch and 21.5-inch versions currently available and move the all-in-one desktop to Apple silicon. It’ll be one of the most significant visual makeovers of any Apple product this year, according to the report. The existing iMac packs top-tier specs and a beautiful screen into a design that has felt particularly outdated these last couple of years, so this change will be welcome. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356416/apple-imac-27-2020-review-price-specs-features"&gt;The last revision&lt;/a&gt; focused on increased speed, an improved webcam, and also added an option for a matte / nano-texture display coating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hFnZ6"&gt;As for the Mac Pro, Apple seems to have a two-prong plan: it’ll refresh the current upgradeable tower design — Gurman says the company is considering sticking with Intel processors for this machine. But that doesn’t mean Apple is stalling on a Mac Pro that runs on its own chips. The company is also apparently at work on a completely new form factor that Gurman says is less than half the total size of the current Mac Pro. “The design will feature a mostly aluminum exterior and could invoke nostalgia for the Power Mac G4 Cube,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqzZRq"&gt;All of these will feature the next generation of Apple’s own Mac processors, which first debuted in last year’s M1 MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini. Last, Apple is reportedly planning to release a new external monitor that gives up some of the professional-grade display specifications of the Pro Display XDR to reach a wider audience of customers. The Pro Display XDR starts at $5,000, and Apple currently sells third-party monitors from LG as a  more affordable step-down option. But it sounds like a spiritual successor to the Thunderbolt Display could be on the way in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hitman 3 players on Google Stadia will be able to share custom scenarios with just a URL</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/stk0llDicdxBhVJdsZlFxfVliFo=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68674390/47_Dartmoor_1024x576.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from Hitman 3.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: IO Interactive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3xOVb6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;World of Assassination&lt;/em&gt; trilogy launch on January 20th, and at launch, Google Stadia players will be able to share access to distinct points within a game thanks to Stadia’s State Share feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRK7aF"&gt;With State Share in &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll be able to share a link alongside an image or video from your game. Then, others can click on it to try the scenario you were playing for themselves. There are multiple “states” of missions you can share to customize the experience, including a mission’s starting location, the objectives, Agent 47’s loadout, and difficulty level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvzieK"&gt;The feature works with any campaign or custom mission, and you’ll even be able to use weapons or items that you haven’t unlocked yet if a game state is ahead of your own progression, Stadia product manager Catherine Hsiao said &lt;a href="https://community.stadia.com/t5/Stadia-Community-Blog/Capture-and-share-playable-scenarios-with-State-Share-coming/ba-p/50835"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cC-IpRM7iLuGpQY5BxFxv8Y3bes=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22238279/_UPDATED__04_state_share_link_screen.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The sharing screen for State Share in &lt;/em&gt;Hitman&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9e5Snc"&gt;The feature opens up a lot of exciting possibilities for the &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt; games. Players could send custom scenarios back and forth to each other, for example, or live-streamers could challenge their viewers to try out a particularly difficult mission or specific assassination style they just broadcast live. It’s a feature that’s unique to Stadia, despite the game also launching on consoles and PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lR8FKp"&gt;State Share isn’t the only boundary-pushing technology coming to &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;World of Assassination&lt;/em&gt; trilogy. On PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, you’ll also be able to play through every location from all three &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt; games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218554/hitman-3-trailer-virtual-reality-vr-psvr-ps4-ps5-trailer"&gt;in virtual reality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Normally $200, Sam’s Club members can buy a pair of these wireless headphones for only $80. Even at $200, the Opus is well worth that retail price, but at $80, it’s an incredible deal that you rarely see for these headphones. The biggest barrier to getting these is you will need to pay for a Sam’s Club membership if you do not already have one. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GitHub still won’t explain if it fired someone for saying ‘Nazi,’ and employees are pissed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Congress Holds Joint Session To Ratify 2020 Presidential Election" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9cmV9LpTbBwkMkZWQX028h98om0=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68674135/1294949440.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Win McNamee / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ypChQx"&gt;GitHub employees are protesting the firing of a Jewish colleague who was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227487/github-microsoft-fired-jewish-employee-warned-nazis-us-capitol-breach"&gt;let go two days after he warned co-workers&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, DC to stay safe from Nazis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKoDEy"&gt;The employee was chastised for using divisive language, according to &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-github-backlash-jewish-employee-termination-2021-1"&gt;news first reported by &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Now, GitHub workers are saying “Nazi” repeatedly in Slack, in regards to the US Capitol rioters, to protest what is being perceived as unfair treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxuW3U"&gt;“Others have already said so, but I just want to say it explicitly myself - I think that nazis were present at some protests on Jan 6, and that it’s very scary to see those ideas on display,” wrote one senior engineer in a 390-person Slack channel called #inclusion-belonging. “100% Nazis were there, and 1000000000% Nazis are scary as fuck and do not belong anywhere. PARTICULARLY AT GitHub!” replied another. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/574vYEN2mYVcwBY1IH6XKr2PvN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22238246/screen_shot_005_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gDKx35"&gt;Another GitHub employee documented roughly 50 times the word “Nazi” was used in Slack prior to the events on January 6th. Employees often talk about politics, and some engineers have made Nazi jokes in the past. In a Slack message from 2014, one staffer wrote that “nazis gave the jews free healthcare.” He still works at GitHub today. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1zrnN9uPhLJoJjwUc0ecVQemoqk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22238189/screen_shot_002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6JaPzu"&gt;The current conflict began the day of the riots in Washington, DC when a Jewish employee told co-workers: “stay safe homies, nazis are about.” Some colleagues took offense to the language, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/09/us/capitol-hill-insurrection-extremist-flags-soh/index.html"&gt;although neo-Nazi organizations were, in fact, present at the riots&lt;/a&gt;. One engineer responded: “This is untasteful conduct for workplace [in my opinion], people have the right to protest period.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFi9fwIwTPmCKNgJI_C-4fJZgj0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22238195/screen_shot_001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mNeVwz"&gt;The conversation escalated, with colleagues jumping in to defend both sides, until the VP of engineering shut it down. “Ok, this is enough...This is not an appropriate conversation and we don’t need to be treating each other this way,” the VP said. “Y’all can agree to disagree but we don’t need to cause more division.” The VP then asked the Jewish employee to “chat.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9CbzrhT6FHQJYLphaoP2F4C5CsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22238196/screen_shot_004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="94GK6d"&gt;Two days later, he was fired. The company reportedly cited vague “patterns of behavior” as the reason for his termination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8XJ3B"&gt;After the firing was reported publicly, GitHub attempted to handle the controversy internally. Earlier this week, the company hosted an “empathy circle” to “build understanding with members of the team on things that affect us.” It did not go over well with employees. “um.. this empathy circle sounds like the state propoganda i grew up with,” one employee said, with an emoji of the Chinese flag. “Im outta here.” Another employee responded, “I’m having a hard time focusing on this language haha.” The first employee added, “The poc channel is liit...apparently the circle sounds akin to nazi apologists and ‘all lives matter’ type of bs.. glad i left early.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XB65o6"&gt;Roughly 200 of GitHub’s 1,700 employees (which GitHub calls “hubbers”) have signed an open letter asking for clarity around the Jewish worker’s termination. “The clear insinuation is that a Jewish Hubber was fired for calling a group of people (that included Neo-Nazi white supremacists) ‘Nazis,’” they wrote. “Because of this, Hubbers no longer feel they can speak up against racism or hatred against protected characteristics like their religion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlUEfx"&gt;GitHub CEO Nat Friedman responded, saying he was appalled at the violence in Washington, DC and would be investigating the termination of the Jewish employee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1CtIv"&gt;The company has not yet told employees why the Jewish worker was fired. GitHub COO Erica Brescia responded to his original Slack thread saying: “This has been a tough week. We are listening and understand people are concerned. Many across the leadership team have spent time today with Hubbers who have had questions and concerns about this separation. Separating with an employee isn’t easy for anyone. When we do separate we want to protect and employee’s privacy so we do not provide details regarding separations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2AzpE"&gt;To employees, the comment fell flat. “This is a deeply unsatisfying response,” one wrote. “And it makes me feel sick to my stomach. It seems that GitHub chose to fire a Jewish employee for either accurately labeling the (literal, verifiable) Nazis at the Capitol as Nazis; or that they were fired for expressing a religious sentiment. I don’t see how either of those comport with GitHub’s values. I respect the privacy of departed employees, but there simply must be something else that can be said as to why this isn’t as bad as it looks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Og1Vca"&gt;Apparently, there was not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNpHvf"&gt;In response to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a GitHub spokesperson said: “We take all complaints of this nature very seriously. We are actively investigating the situation.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In its third season, American Gods is the most fascinating disaster on TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OrMb1JvfiBnA9GjXCC5U9m-DkNE=/139x87:1302x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68674101/Screen_Shot_2021_01_15_at_11.57.33_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g0jxPD"&gt;One of the miracles of any good television show is that it even works at all. First consider the countless people working across departments and disciplines needed to make a single episode happen; and then consider that they all have to do it anywhere between eight and 20-ish times a year, and that the result has to make sense to millions of people who cannot &lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt; to be unimpressed. There are a lot of places to mess up! And yet we hear about so few mistakes. Which is why it’s a pretty big story when something as large as &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt; goes awry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYalMf"&gt;The Starz drama was a special kind of disaster: it premiered to considerable acclaim only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/10/18258816/american-gods-review-season-2-ian-macshane-gillian-anderson-kristin-chenoweth-starz"&gt;to fall to pieces&lt;/a&gt; in between its first and second seasons, losing its high-profile showrunners and several cast members. Between the second season finale and the premiere of the latest season, the show’s new management fired Orlando Jones, whose fiery portrayal of the trickster god Anansi was beloved and one of the show’s brightest stars. (&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/orlando-jones-fired-american-gods-interview-mr-nancy-1203436890/"&gt;Allegations surrounding Jones’ dismissal&lt;/a&gt; are troubling.) This makes the third season more surprising: after all that chaos, it’s turned out totally fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TgBvRy"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJ76r-iKCcM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ibr8EN"&gt;Season 3 also doesn’t resemble what drew many to &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt; in the first place. The radical experimentation is gone. There are no fiery monologues, mind-bending sex scenes, or powerful vignettes that evoke the immigrant experience and humanity’s relationship with faith. &lt;em&gt;American Gods &lt;/em&gt;is no longer interested in that sort of thing. Instead, it’s concerned with rebuilding itself and doing the fascinating work of making a season that’s equal parts a total do-over and a straightforward continuation of the story that started in episode one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nPo60"&gt;And so we are reintroduced to Shadow Moon (Ricky Whittle), a man living under an alias after a falling out with his employer, Mr. Wednesday (Ian McShane). Quickly, we’re reminded why: Mr. Wednesday is not just some impossible boss. He’s Odin, the Norse All-Father — and also Shadow’s IRL dad. Until recently, Shadow was driving Wednesday across America to recruit the country’s forgotten gods, soliciting their aid in a coming war between them and the nation’s new ones. (I should probably note here that in the world of &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt;, worship is what makes them godlike, so the forgotten old gods are mostly normal people with a few mythic tricks.) These new gods represent our modern obsessions: new media, technology, and so on. But Shadow is done with that. He makes a home for himself in Lakeside, Wisconsin, an idyllic small town where gods new and old will hopefully leave him the hell alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUB7D1"&gt;Naturally, they do not, because Shadow has a part to play. So does his dead wife Laura (Emily Browning), who has been wandering Earth as an undead revenant with the leprechaun Mad Sweeney (Pablo Schreiber, sadly missing this season outside of some flashbacks), along with an eclectic cast of gods and those who know them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5u0w1"&gt;All of this is rather perfunctory. The third season of &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt; is an attempt to restore lost momentum from the second season, taking advantage of a grace note in the novel it’s slowly adapting — its protagonist’s sojourn in a small town — to rebuild itself. The show can’t introduce many new pieces because it’s too busy trying to account for the old ones, and its tools are limited because it has committed to a relatively faithful adaptation of the novel on which it is based. Its destination is &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; set, which means that in the meantime, the show has to get a little creative in how it gets there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySDKSs"&gt;The result is something that’s underwhelming to watch but fascinating to think about. In our modern, tightly managed, IP-driven entertainment environment, it’s rare to see an ongoing production implode in such a catastrophic manner and then somehow manage to right itself. In this, it’s a pretty good reminder that television is a uniquely malleable and chaotic medium. (This despite the recent popularity of the prestige format, which often has shorter runs and planned endings that make it easy to forget that having a strict narrative plan is often a recipe for disaster in TV.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rftvSQ"&gt;Actors depart, new showrunners are brought in, and the collaborative nature of the medium makes for stories that veer far away from what was originally intended. Consider &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt;, which initially &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqnoJ10HqP0"&gt;planned to kill fan-favorite&lt;/a&gt; character Jesse Pinkman, and began its acclaimed final season &lt;a href="https://uproxx.com/sepinwall/breaking-bad-10th-anniversary-vince-gilligan/"&gt;with a shot that the writers did not know how they would justify&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1MEYW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt;’ third season effort to right itself has undoubtedly left us with a lesser show — call it the underwhelming cable adaptation as opposed to the exciting premium project it started as. But its chaotic journey is also a worthwhile reminder: despite all the promise of peak TV’s bold new frontier where just about any kind of show can be made, this is still the old gods’ domain.&lt;/p&gt;
