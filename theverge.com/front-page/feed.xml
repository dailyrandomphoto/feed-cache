    <title>Google Meet’s free ‘unlimited’ calls will continue until June</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ln-lzMw5941MNSsCjaPpTIduOg4=/352x469:3849x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69052780/ExvvZezWUAQGw_G.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Meet.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p9TSLm"&gt;Google will not introduce a 60 minute call limit on free Google Meet users at the end of March, the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleWorkspace/status/1376957338733674499"&gt;announced in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it will now be begin on June 30th. Until then, anyone using the service’s free version will be able to host calls up to 24 hours in length, which Google refers to as “unlimited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVZlQj"&gt;This is the second time Google has pushed back the introduction of call limits since opening up the service to free users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21240509/google-meet-video-conferencing-free-gmail"&gt;last April&lt;/a&gt;. A 60 minute limit had originally been due to come into effect at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/26/21457293/google-meet-limit-meeting-free-plans-september-zoom"&gt;end of September&lt;/a&gt;, but that deadline was later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494189/google-meet-limit-calls-minutes-march-2021"&gt;pushed back to March&lt;/a&gt; when it became clear that many of us wouldn’t be able to celebrate the holidays in person with our loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kGoZas"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re continuing unlimited &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoogleMeet?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GoogleMeet&lt;/a&gt; calls (up to 24 hours) in the free version through June 2021 for Gmail accounts → &lt;a href="https://t.co/fqBTmoNPBW"&gt;https://t.co/fqBTmoNPBW&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ax0fmbRvqr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ax0fmbRvqr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google Workspace (@GoogleWorkspace) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleWorkspace/status/1376957338733674499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kyv3Yi"&gt;Google hasn’t explicitly said why it’s extending its deadline this time, but the continued pandemic restrictions in place around the world probably have something to do with it. I think I speak for everyone when I say I hope Google won’t have a reason to extend its deadline again come June. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Even LinkedIn is making a Clubhouse clone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Linkedin Launches 24 Hours Stories" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B6Sjz_CFn2qTvGQNzKO9mVPHZik=/3x0:2912x1939/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051839/1229184687.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zLdmBl"&gt;It feels like just about every big tech company is working on a Clubhouse-like social audio feature — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323767/twitter-spaces-april-release-date-plan"&gt;Twitter’s Spaces feature is rolling out now&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276645/facebook-clubhouse-social-audio-app-develop"&gt;Facebook is reportedly building one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;Spotify is making one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315866/mark-cuban-fireside-app-podcast-platform-clubhouse"&gt;Mark Cuban has one&lt;/a&gt;, even &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/"&gt;Slack is getting in the game&lt;/a&gt;. But now, the idea of the shared audio space, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21325678/venture-capitalists-vc-media-silicon-valley-clubhouse-tech-journalists"&gt;started on Clubhouse largely as an exclusive club&lt;/a&gt; for tech venture capitalists and elites, has come full circle. Professional social network LinkedIn is working on an audio networking feature of its own, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/"&gt;the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oL61Uk"&gt;“We’re doing some early tests to create a unique audio experience connected to your professional identity,” LinkedIn said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. “And, we’re looking at how we can bring audio to other parts of LinkedIn such as events and groups, to give our members even more ways to connect to their community.” LinkedIn shared the same statement with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; after we first published this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEi6hf"&gt;LinkedIn said the feature will begin beta testing soon. Below is a mockup of what the feature might look like, which LinkedIn shared with &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch. &lt;/em&gt;Like Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces, it features a stage of speakers front and center and a list of people in the audience lower down the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GvsKbeXQWIsDNv9am8X_ST_HeW0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22409358/Concept_Mock.LinkedIn.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WLlCnL"&gt;LinkedIn has already been working to make itself a destination for creators with tools like a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/linkedin-adds-creator-mode-to-help-more-of-its-users-turn-influencers-11617129192"&gt;new Creator mode&lt;/a&gt; that denote you as a LinkedIn content creator on your profile. A Clubhouse-like feature actually seems like a natural fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pnTH8B"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Anti-Asian hate is spilling over to LinkedIn","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358649/anti-asian-hate-violence-linkedin-content-moderation-atlanta-shooting"},{"title":"LinkedIn is testing Snapchat-like stories because that’s the world we live in now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21156247/linkedin-testing-instagram-stories-feature-social-network-resumes-why"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ETn1AW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 30th, 10:05PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added that LinkedIn shared a statement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple supplier Foxconn warns that component shortages will last until 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A woman wearing a face mask seen working on her computer on..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3iY0SHa8z7gXjmOsROawNkE0A9M=/0x0:3250x2167/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051722/1230428833.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WM8czH"&gt;The ongoing global shortage for electronic components continues, and Foxconn — which handles manufacturing for Apple, among other major tech heavyweights — has announced that it’s starting to see the impact of shortages. According to Young Liu, Foxconn’s CEO, the company won’t be able to fulfill some of its orders due to those shortages, which he expects will last until &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; the second quarter of next year, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-supplier-Foxconn-says-chip-shortage-will-curb-shipments"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8UU8a"&gt;“The [supply in the] first two months of this quarter was still ok, as our clients are all very big, but we started to see changes happening this month,” Liu reportedly told investors during the company’s latest earnings call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sbl2tS"&gt;The impact of the shortages isn’t expected to be large, at least for now: Liu expects that the company will only miss around 10 percent of its orders due to part shortages, citing the large order volumes of its customers. But it’s still a notable miss for Foxconn — and by extension, its customers like Apple — who may be forced to contend with delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8Zz4z8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;10 percent &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NA0e8c"&gt;Foxconn also saw slowdowns in manufacturing last spring at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, following mandatory government shutdowns and quarantined factory workers. Those delays trickled down across the supply chain, leading to a later-than-usual November launch for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21238081/apple-iphone-12-mass-production-delay-rumors-coronavirus-impact#:~:text=Apple%20is%20reportedly%20delaying%20mass,iPhone%2012%20mass%20production%20plans."&gt;Apple’s iPhone 12 lineup&lt;/a&gt;. The current slowdown, by comparison, seems less drastic, but if parts continue to be hard to get, delays could mount later in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yg2Ybt"&gt;Foxconn is the latest company to call out the ongoing chip and component shortage that has slowing down production of everything from next-generation consoles to cars. Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335502/galaxy-note-2021-delay-canceled-samsung"&gt;Samsung warned its investors&lt;/a&gt; of a “serious imbalance” in the semiconductor industry as it prepares to deal with the ongoing global chip shortage. Car companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-china-production/chip-shortages-could-slow-automotive-production-vw-and-suppliers-say-idUSKBN28E1IN"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2021/02/03/nissan-truck-production-reduced-canton-plant-due-chip-shortage/4369759001/"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-09/toyota-says-chip-shortage-impacting-output-of-texas-made-trucks"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; have have had to slow truck and car production due to a surfeit of silicon. Both Sony and Microsoft have both cited part shortages as major factors in the near-impossible-to-buy status of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297039/playstation-ceo-ps5-supply-2021-stock-consoles-jim-ryan"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260564/microsoft-xbox-series-x-stock-june-supply-constraints"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. And the aftermarket value of PC graphics cards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;has doubled, even tripled&lt;/a&gt;, due to a combination of unprecedented shortages and demand.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat’s Spectacles might become true AR glasses this time — and there’s a drone  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="snap spectacles" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IV9E0rbmQyDYoOE4UbPjyILFxQc=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051718/Specs4.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first generation Snap Spectacles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wn1zJP"&gt;Snap, the company behind Snapchat, is planning to continue its push into hardware devices with a new pair of augmented-reality glasses and a drone, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/snap-plans-hardware-push-with-ar-spectacles-drone"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The Spectacles will reportedly include displays so the wearer can see the AR effects without having to use their phone — a feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20951783/snap-spectacles-3-review-snapchat-glasses-price-specs-features"&gt;was notably missing&lt;/a&gt; from the all the Spectacles that came before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F88tko"&gt;One of &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s sources says that the new Spectacles will be meant for developers and creators, rather than consumers — though you could probably argue that, at $380, the Spectacles 3 are already mostly limited to that market as well. As the article points out, though, the intention is likely to have the developers make lenses and experiences that consumers will use at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sEhL8X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Snap may not be backing down from its hardware dreams&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5R0XN"&gt;If the new Spectacles act as an AR headset, it could be the culmination of what the company has been working towards with the first three versions of the product. Currently, the Spectacles are mainly capture devices, acting as head-mounted cameras with the bulk of the processing being done on the user’s phone. This hasn’t necessarily been a recipe for success: the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/7/16620718/snapchat-spectacles-40-million-lost-failure-unsold-inventory"&gt;lost $40 million&lt;/a&gt; when it was stuck with unsold inventory of the original pair, and the company’s hardware head &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17607834/head-snapchat-spectactles-augmented-reality-mark-randall"&gt;left shortly after the second-generation glasses came out&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5w28Bk"&gt;If the reports about the new Spectacles are true, it could indicate that Snap isn’t backing down from its hardware dreams — &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-future-of-snapchat-looks-a-lot-like-magic-leap/"&gt;the company’s CEO has said&lt;/a&gt; that AR hardware will be part of what defines Snap by the end of this decade. If it wants to continue pushing its AR glasses, it seems like it will have to contend with competition from the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/announcing-project-aria-a-research-project-on-the-future-of-wearable-ar/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;— both companies seem to be developing their own face-mounted wearables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSqVIC"&gt;As for the drone, there’s precious little information about it. There have been rumors about Snap working on a drone &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/technology/snapchat-drone.html"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;, and back in 2017 it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/27/15704906/snap-ctrl-me-robotics-acquired-drone-cameras"&gt;acquired a drone company&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Snap invested $20 million into a Chinese drone company as well. There’s no information on when the drone will ship, but the report’s sources say that it’s recently been made the priority of Snap Lab, a hardware group at Snap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2r3c9"&gt;In other AR headset news,&lt;em&gt; The Information&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ti-reality-check-a-tease-of-ars-future-and-a-look-at-vrs-past"&gt;also reported today&lt;/a&gt; that the headset &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/niantic-ar-headset-teaser-225310953.html"&gt;teased by Pokémon Go creator Niantic&lt;/a&gt; is actually a reference design made by Qualcomm — the two companies announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997493/niantic-qualcomm-xr2-ar-glasses"&gt;that they were partnering back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Niantic is also reportedly looking to go the developer-first route as well. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gocycle’s folding G4 e-bikes promise more power and less noise</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nst8va1QLqnXjGkNBjiC_Uszqa8=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051524/Gocycle_Generation_Four_Location___7_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gocycle e-bikes are small but still great for long commutes.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Gocycle&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hMzws9"&gt;Gocycle, the maker of some of the most eye-catching and adaptable electric bikes on the planet, is back with its fourth-generation e-bike. The G4 series brings a new motor, better tires, lighter carbon-fiber components, and more to improve upon what’s already one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21211827/gocycle-gxi-review-price-foldable-electric-bike"&gt;favorite e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;. But before you get too excited, know that the G4 range &lt;em&gt;starts&lt;/em&gt; at a suggested retail price of $3,999. The G4, G4i, and G4i Plus models are all available for &lt;a href="https://gocycle.com"&gt;preorder now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyyKZu"&gt;For the money, Gocycle makes a very premium e-bike that we’ve found to be equally suited to long commutes and multimodal travel due to its compact quick-fold design with wide high-volume tires. That tradition continues with the G4 models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v39RJk"&gt;The new motor is probably my favorite change and the feature I’m most excited to test. To start, the custom-built G4drive is now billed as “quiet,” bringing it in line with most modern e-bike motors above, say, $1,300. It’s also tuned to power starts from a standstill. Previously, Gocycle relied on thigh power to get you off the line in order to keep the front-hub motor and removable battery as small and lightweight as possible. The G4drive promises more torque and power from what Gocycle still calls a “class-leading compact package.” We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SOjX1pmU9ikSYI-XkrdeQkNVdgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407497/Carbon_Fibre_Mid_Frame.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gocycle&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New carbon fiber mid-frame and other improvements help lower the weight on all models by 1kg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New G4drive front-hub motor is quiet, torquier, and able to provide power from a standstill, while the tires have improved grip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MAZdAs"&gt;Even with that stronger motor, other changes like a switch to carbon fiber for the mid-frame and single-sided fork help reduce the weight by 1kg across the series, while treaded tires with an infused silica compound promise better grip. The generation four e-bikes also improve connectivity with an integrated 1 amp USB charging port on the handlebar and Bluetooth LE as well as improved folding and stopping power, according to Gocycle. Three and a half-hour fast charging is now standard across the entire range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFLGa7"&gt;“G4 has been in development for many years and represents the most significant product update for Gocycle since our G1 to G2 engineering programme,” said Gocycle designer and founder Richard Thorpe in a press release. “Our generation four models have been developed through a combination of listening to our customers and our continued mission to develop the best urban electric bikes on the planet. G4 will not only set a new standard for Gocycle, but a new standard for performance for all of our competitors in the portable electric bike segment.” &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PTeKj4"&gt;The G4 (£3,399 / €3,699 / $3,999) is the entry-level model with mechanical twist-shift gears and range up to 40 miles (65 km). The G4i (£3,999 / €4,499 / $4,999) steps things up with predictive electronic shifting, integrated daytime running lights, a more detailed LED dash display, and improved range to 50 miles (80 km). The top-of-the-line G4i Plus (£4,999 / €5,499 / $5,999) model improves things further with lightweight carbon wheels. It will be available in limited numbers in either a bespoke red or gloss black. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube has removed Steven Crowder from its Partner Program indefinitely</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GyFxfeZ2NIrOkeCWFoOrlI80dXY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051444/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_4.38.41_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Steven Crowder’s YouTube channel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2G4rWQ"&gt;Two weeks ago, after YouTube revealed its definition of hate speech was so narrow &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22339030/youtube-racist-steven-crowder-video-does-not-violate-hate-speech-policies"&gt;that it couldn’t remove a wildly racist tirade&lt;/a&gt; for being wildly racist, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22339030/youtube-racist-steven-crowder-video-does-not-violate-hate-speech-policies"&gt;we wondered out loud&lt;/a&gt; what it would take for YouTube to stop promoting conservative commentator Steven Crowder as an official YouTube Partner and allowing him to profit from those tirades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5pfv9P"&gt;Today, we have a partial answer: YouTube has officially suspended Steven Crowder’s main channel from the YouTube Partner Program indefinitely, which includes removing his ability to run ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1p4gpN"&gt;It’s also banning him from uploading videos for a full week after his latest infraction: a now-removed video that reportedly challenged the legitimacy of the vote in Nevada. YouTube has a policy against false claims that the election was stolen. Crowder &lt;a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/steven-crowder/after-being-suspended-youtube-steven-crowder-announces-his-plan-evade-it-his-other"&gt;has already announced his intent&lt;/a&gt; to upload videos to his other Crowder Bits channel, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzpvzm"&gt;Here’s YouTube’s statement (including links):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="bac7lX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In order to monetize on YouTube, channels must comply with the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392?hl=en"&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube Partner Program policies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, which include our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/about/policies/#community-guidelines"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Community Guidelines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182?ctx=checklist"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google AdSense program policies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advertiser-Friendly Guidelines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Channels that repeatedly violate our policies are suspended from the partner program. In addition, we removed a video from Steven Crowder’s channel for violating our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801973?hl=en"&gt;&lt;em&gt;presidential election integrity policy &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;and applied a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032?hl=en"&gt;&lt;em&gt;strike&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, meaning uploads are suspended for one week. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oBnnom"&gt;While YouTube isn’t telling us which straw broke the camel’s back when it comes to the YouTube Partner Program (and his ability to run ads), the company did point us towards two specific guidelines around &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=9153642#Controversial_sensitive"&gt;controversial issues and sensitive events&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=9153642#Harmful_dangerous"&gt;harmful and dangerous acts&lt;/a&gt;. I would have guessed that awful, racist tirades would have already broken the YouTube Partner Program’s &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=9153642#Hateful"&gt;hateful and derogatory content&lt;/a&gt; policy, but I guess I shouldn’t read too much into that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzc9ck"&gt;It’s not the first time Crowder’s been removed from the YouTube Partner Program. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18654196/steven-crowder-demonetized-carlos-maza-youtube-homophobic-language-ads"&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt;,  it took him &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365601/youtube-steven-crowder-monetization-reinstated-harassment-carlos-maza"&gt;just over a year to come back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is experimenting with hiding dislikes to protect creators’ well-being</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7s4RirOX9iMkRcEc-0mNwnWO-Hc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051226/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CyXNup"&gt;YouTube &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube/status/1376942486594150405?s=20"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; it’s experimenting with hiding dislikes to discourage “dislike mobs” from deliberately downvoting videos from creators and channels. The experiment is a different implementation than the solutions the company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18207189/youtube-dislike-attack-mob-review-bomb-creator-insider"&gt;previously discussed&lt;/a&gt;, but it is similar to other attempts platforms like Instagram have taken to nip targeted attacks in the bud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuDtVC"&gt;In the current setup, stats for both likes and dislikes are viewable in a creator’s individual &lt;a href="http://studio.youtube.com"&gt;YouTube Studio&lt;/a&gt; page, but only likes will be displayed publicly on a video. In &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/104325801?hl=en"&gt;a support article&lt;/a&gt; explaining the test, YouTube says that dislikes can negatively impact a creator’s well-being and “may motivate a targeted campaign of dislikes on a creator’s video.” Basically, the idea is that seeing a dislike number and watching it go up could be enough motivation to join in and make the number larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ngXt4J"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;   In response to creator feedback around well-being and targeted dislike campaigns, we're testing a few new designs that don't show the public dislike count. If you're part of this small experiment, you might spot one of these designs in the coming weeks (example below!). &lt;a href="https://t.co/aemrIcnrbx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aemrIcnrbx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— YouTube (@YouTube) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube/status/1376942486594150405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="shLUNG"&gt;Creators rely on likes and dislikes as a form of feedback to guide their creative output, but much like purposefully giving a game a bad review on Steam, it’s easy to turn what could be a useful feature into another surface for abuse. When YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEdlaJo5YV8"&gt;first announced&lt;/a&gt; it was looking into addressing problems with dislikes, it was considering three ideas: hiding the numbers for both likes and dislikes, adding more friction to disliking something through requiring extra interaction, or removing likes and dislikes entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUsbYC"&gt;This test does half of what the first option promised, and it makes a certain amount of sense. If dislike numbers are the problem, why not just hide them and see what happens? Instagram experimented with a similar kind of test when it decided &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20956091/instagram-testing-hiding-likes-us-bullying-mosseri"&gt;to hide likes on posts&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously, likes are inherently positive, but chasing a high like count can have its own negative impact on creators whose livelihoods depend on closely monitoring interactions with their posts and appearing well-liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmd8t8"&gt;YouTube isn’t testing hiding dislikes on all creators’ videos, but if you notice them on your page or you have an opinion as a viewer, &lt;a href="http://yt.be/help/feedback"&gt;YouTube is collecting feedback&lt;/a&gt; on its site.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FTC is letting Qualcomm off the hook with a tortured statement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="ftc-flickr" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZBCyrlNcxR26iLASgfvpMg70YdU=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051125/ftc.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PSmf5E"&gt;Four years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/17/14302932/qualcomm-ftc-lawsuit-anticompetitive-practices-modems"&gt;accusing Qualcomm of abusing monopoly power&lt;/a&gt; to charge phone makers additional licensing fees for its modems — and seven months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363629/qualcomm-win-appeal-antitrust-ftc-lawsuit-frand-patents-chips"&gt;seemingly losing that battle&lt;/a&gt; in a federal circuit court — the Federal Trade Commission has decided to throw in the towel. It’s no longer planning to appeal to the Supreme Court, which means the case is done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05c00M"&gt;If that were all, I probably wouldn’t be writing it up for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; since things are exactly where we left off in August.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;But then I saw &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/03/statement-acting-chairwoman-rebecca-kelly-slaughter-agencys"&gt;the FTC’s explanation&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it’s dropping the case, and... well, just read it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aPzGcv"&gt;Given the significant headwinds facing the Commission in this matter, the FTC will not petition the Supreme Court to review the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in &lt;em&gt;FTC v. Qualcomm&lt;/em&gt;. The FTC’s staff did an exceptional job presenting the case, and I continue to believe that the district court’s conclusion that Qualcomm violated the antitrust laws was entirely correct and that the court of appeals erred in concluding otherwise. Now more than ever, the FTC and other law enforcement agencies need to boldly enforce the antitrust laws to guard against abusive behavior by dominant firms, including in high-technology markets and those that involve intellectual property. I am particularly concerned about the potential for anticompetitive or unfair behavior in the context of standard setting and the FTC will closely monitor conduct in this arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yeNDk4"&gt;Let me get this straight: the FTC believes it was right about this case, believes it was important, believes that “now more than ever” it needs to “boldly enforce the antitrust laws” and is “particularly concerned” about cases like this... and yet, it’s not even taking the step of seeing whether the Supreme Court will agree to hear the case because of “significant headwinds”? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqlS7U"&gt;Perhaps the FTC has bigger fish to fry right now, or perhaps it’s afraid it will simply lose again. It’s not cheap to petition the Supreme Court, after all; in 2013, a lawyer who’s done it repeatedly &lt;a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2013/03/25/how-much-does-big-supreme-court-case-gay-marriage-cost/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Marketplace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that a petition can easily cost a quarter of a million dollars. Or perhaps the FTC’s acting chair simply doesn’t think a vote to petition the Supreme Court would pass, given the current staffing split between two Republican and two Democratic FTC commissioners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ATVieZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The weak FTC might be getting stronger, though&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zOmlHW"&gt;But the FTC’s tortured public statement doesn’t say those things. It feels a little more like a cry for help from America’s antitrust enforcer, an enforcer &lt;a href="https://bigtechnology.substack.com/p/its-ridiculous-underfunded-us-regulators"&gt;with a budget that’s admittedly less than $350 million a year&lt;/a&gt; and an enforcer that’s repeatedly let big tech companies go with a slap on the wrist — such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/9/5/20850287/youtube-ftc-settlement-google-antitrust-investigation"&gt;fining Google roughly 37 hours worth of profit&lt;/a&gt; for violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) with YouTube or issuing a record-breaking $5 billion fine to Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20692524/facebook-five-billion-ftc-fine-embarrassing-joke"&gt;that was so weak, Facebook’s stock price actually went up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYKF4u"&gt;There are signs the FTC might possibly change in meaningful ways, and my colleague Makena Kelly has written about them at length, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346828/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-biden-nomination-facebook-google-doj-garland"&gt;Congress potentially modifying the law&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier to bring lawsuits against Big Tech, and the strong possibility that influential antitrust scholar Lina Khan may soon help run the FTC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22321092/lina-khan-ftc-tech-antitrust-law-regulation-amazon"&gt;with President Biden’s nomination&lt;/a&gt;. In the meanwhile, the agency that believes Qualcomm has a monopoly — the agency we expect to bust such a monopoly if so — is just going to let this one go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volkswagen of America lied about rebranding to ‘Voltswagen’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VMZw1oqsursZ1FT2ZyxUpONW9c4=/0x120:716x597/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69048185/Large_13212_VoltswagenAnewnameforaneweraofe_Mobility.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Volkswagen of America&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TmfqQn"&gt;Volkswagen of America lied about rebranding to “Voltswagen” in an effort to draw attention to the lone electric vehicle it’s currently selling in the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-name/volkswagen-will-not-change-name-of-u-s-operations-sources-idUSKBN2BM2YJ?il=0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/messaging-says-vw-usa-to-rebrand-itself-voltswagenheadquarters-says-not-so-fast-11617120111?mod=hp_lead_pos10"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have reported. It was a marketing stunt done ahead of April Fools’ Day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7ysfi"&gt;This all started when Volkswagen of America “accidentally” published a draft version of a press release announcing the change on Monday, which was &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/vw-accidentally-leaks-new-name-for-its-us-operations-voltswagen.html"&gt;first reported by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. The company had declined to comment on the report, and spokesperson Mark Gillies repeatedly declined to say whether the name change was a marketing stunt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LxBGN"&gt;The automaker, which pleaded guilty to &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/volkswagen-ag-agrees-plead-guilty-and-pay-43-billion-criminal-and-civil-penalties-six"&gt;deceiving regulators about the true pollution levels of hundreds of thousands of diesel vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, then published a press release on Tuesday morning saying the change was a “public declaration of the company’s future-forward investment in e-mobility.” The company said the “Voltswagen” branding would be on all of its EVs going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BO32eV"&gt;Volkswagen of America is now expected to reveal on Wednesday that the name change was a stunt, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. The larger Volkswagen Group declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NnCSU"&gt;“We have said, from the beginning of our shift to an electric future, that we will build EVs for the millions, not just millionaires,” CEO of Volkswagen of America Scott Keogh proudly boasted in the press release, which, at publication time, &lt;a href="https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/1499"&gt;remained on the company’s website&lt;/a&gt;. “This name change signifies a nod to our past as the peoples’ car and our firm belief that our future is in being the peoples’ electric car.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AE6fDQLltVgeB9ClhH0fxLt5B5A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408979/Screen_Shot_2021_03_30_at_3.53.57_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="reM8p8"&gt;Volkswagen’s various social media accounts also promoted the lie on Tuesday. The @VW account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VW/status/1376868756782219266"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; an image of the fake “Voltswagen” logo and wrote “66 is an unusual age to change your name.” That’s a nod to the age of the American subsidiary — not the larger Volkswagen Group, which was founded in the 1930s before it became part of the Nazi war machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6xeuM"&gt;Volkswagen of America so straightforwardly represented the name change as real that it was reported by &lt;em&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;, the BBC, and dozens of other outlets, including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Even Wall Street firm Wedbush &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thestreet.com%2Finvesting%2Fvolkswagen-closer-to-apple-partnership-wedbush-says&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F30%2F22357166%2Fvolkswagen-name-change-voltswagen-us-division" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;published a note about the change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySYCqQ"&gt;Volkswagen is at the beginning of an $86 billion push into electric vehicles because it wants to be known as &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; leader in the space — a strategic shift that, again, was inspired by the fact that the company was caught installing software on its vehicles that was meant to fool regulators into allowing dirty cars on the road. It did not seem completely out of the question that the company would be willing to make such a ridiculous choice; after all, Volkswagen Group CEO Herbert Diess has spent the last few months &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/20/22240725/volkswagen-herbert-diess-twitter-elon-musk-vw-tesla"&gt;emulating&lt;/a&gt; Tesla CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;, who makes erratic decisions like most people drink water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3ATmi"&gt;But now we know the rebrand was nothing more than another lie from a company that’s become known for something else: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352646/volkswagen-dieselgate-investigation-damages-winterkorn-audi"&gt;lying&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DnQlaz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 30th, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This post was originally written about Volkswagen’s announcement that it was rebranding in the US to “Voltswagen.” The company has since confirmed that this was a lie in service of a marketing stunt. The post and headline have been updated to reflect this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube denies employee request to remove rap song with anti-Chinese lyrics</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mfs8IO"&gt;YouTube is facing employee calls to remove a rap song that allegedly encourages violence against Asians, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-30/youtube-refuses-to-remove-anti-asian-song-drawing-staff-ire?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcEwIU"&gt;Rapper YG’s “Meet the Flockers” is a detailed description of a burglary — a relatively common trope in rap music — but it opens with a specific reference to Chinese communities: “find a Chinese neighborhood, cause they don’t believe in bank accounts.” In light of the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22274325/asians-racism-coronavirus-oakland-san-francisco"&gt;recent rise in street violence against Asians&lt;/a&gt;, a group of YouTube employees argued that message was straightforwardly dangerous, ultimately asking the Trust &amp;amp; Safety team to remove the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBEA0v"&gt;But YouTube ultimately declined to remove the song, citing &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/look-how-we-treat-educational-documentary-scientific-and-artistic-content-youtube/"&gt;the platform’s exception&lt;/a&gt; for “educational, documentary, scientific, and artistic” (or EDSA) content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGerpX"&gt;“While EDSA is not a free pass for any content, there are likely thousands of music videos that would otherwise violate policies... were it not for these sorts of EDSA exceptions,” executives wrote in an open letter to employees. “Removing this video would have far-reaching implications for other musical content containing similarly violent or offensive lyrics, in genres ranging from rap to rock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqbIY1"&gt;It’s not the first time “Meet the Flockers” has generated controversy. Largely ignored on its release in 2014, the song became &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/yg-meet-the-flockers-controversy"&gt;a point of controversy for Chinese communities two years later&lt;/a&gt; after circulating in social media channels, with &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/yg-meet-the-flockers-knock-burglaries/1958131/"&gt;some police departments&lt;/a&gt; even blaming the song and a subsequent unauthorized music video for specific home burglaries. Concern became so heated that &lt;a href="http://sfist.com/2016/09/28/jane_kim_wants_youtube_to_remove_an.php"&gt;San Francisco supervisor Jane Kim&lt;/a&gt; called on YouTube to remove the video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oxa5wi"&gt;YouTube also declined to take action in response to the 2016 controversy, although the uploader later voluntarily removed the music video. The song remains on YouTube through the official YG account, played over a static album cover image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8gcMQ"&gt;Reached for comment, YouTube emphasized the importance of open disagreement within its workforce. “YouTube has an open culture and employees are encouraged to to share their views, even when they disagree with a decision,” a representative said. “We’ll continue this dialogue as part of our ongoing work to balance openness with protecting the YouTube community at large.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GcyPeq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
