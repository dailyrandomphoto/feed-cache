    <title>Exposure notification apps could be more effective if they’re better at assessing risk</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8aU2lo"&gt;Joanna Masel is quick to recognize that the contact tracing apps built to track cases of COVID-19 aren’t as good as they could be. The apps, built on a framework offered by Apple and Google, aren’t used by many people in the United States and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22168473/coronavirus-contact-tracing-apps-exposure-notification-covid-google-apple"&gt;didn’t seem&lt;/a&gt; to make a big difference in the spread of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zr783g"&gt;But Masel, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona and advisor to the team behind the Arizona exposure notification app, thinks there are ways to make the apps more useful. In &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/risa.13768"&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; published last week with colleagues, she outlined one possible improvement: adjust the apps so that they could better recognize situations where people who are exposed to the virus have a lower risk of catching COVID-19. Then, they may not need to quarantine for a full 14 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqEjxv"&gt;“The possibility of this technology is way better than the best implementation so far,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUKS6Q"&gt;Most of the apps used in the US alert someone to a potential COVID-19 exposure if they were in the same area as someone who was potentially infectious for greater than 15 minutes. It’s a crude metric for figuring out how risky that interaction was, and recommendations from the app tend to be similarly broad: they instruct people to isolate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R5UzIq"&gt;It’s possible to add more nuance to that process. Masel’s paper outlined a method for including information on where someone was in relation to a sick person, which could be a proxy for how much virus they may have been exposed to. Someone closer or directly in front of a person with COVID-19 would inhale more virus than someone a few steps back and to the side. Combined with other information (like how long the sick person had shown symptoms before the interaction, or whether the exposed person develops symptoms), the app could make more specific recommendations for how long the exposed person should isolate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Q5rLe"&gt;“The idea is personalized public health,” Masel says. Rather than treat interactions as equally risky, it could help people understand how serious their risk of contracting COVID-19 from an interaction was. “Then you have the ability to simplify it down to very straightforward things like get tested on day x, and stay home on day y,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqe5tD"&gt;The way Google and Apple set up the framework for the exposure notification system makes that hard, but not impossible, Masel says. It can be done using the privacy-preserving framework. Developers would have to combine different elements of available data (like the Bluetooth readings and the amount of time someone was sick) to figure out which interactions were more likely to result in infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YD9EOp"&gt;Providing personalized risk assessments and recommendations is one thing that exposure notification apps might actually be better suited to than traditional, manual contact tracing. “It’s too hard for content tracers over the phone to apply extraordinarily complex algorithms,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ5gcQ"&gt;Boosting the app’s ability to figure out the risk of an interaction could also make it more effective at slowing the spread of COVID-19. In the United Kingdom, where around a quarter of the population used an exposure notification app, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03606-z#Sec2"&gt;one analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that the program prevented hundreds of thousands of cases of the disease. Most of the benefits were concentrated in the few months after the app got an upgrade to its risk assessment function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKdM6B"&gt;Masel thinks the exposure notification technology, with modifications, could be useful even after the pandemic. COVID-19 isn’t going to disappear, and people will still get sick with it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22445906/social-end-pandemic-covid-adjustment-death-vibes"&gt;after the pandemic phase&lt;/a&gt; of the outbreak. Outside of an active pandemic, the apps may not ask people exposed to a virus to isolate — maybe they’d just encourage people to get tested or point them toward treatments, Masel says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qG0bsp"&gt;But the decision to keep the tech in place isn’t a public health call. Google and Apple said last year that they plan to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21234457/apple-google-coronavirus-contact-tracing-tracker-exposure-notification-shut-down"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; the exposure notification program after the pandemic ends, cutting off the resource for public health officials. Masel says that shouldn’t be their call. “Why is that decision Apple’s?” she says. “Apple and Google should not be making public health decisions. I’m not saying the decisions are lazy or that my views are the only views, but I don’t think that should be the decision-making process.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZ43pb"&gt;Instead, she says, experts should figure out ways to make the system better. Even the team behind the United Kingdom app doesn’t consider itself to have done the best possible job because it was created in a rush, Masel says. “We should have learned lessons on how to increase the uptake, and do better risk assessment, and designing user interfaces — we can improve on every front.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfvmvC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GitHub and OpenAI launch a new AI tool that generates its own code</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iFJizpoKHMw5A4ub9ZyVeK0Nr1M=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69519597/GitHub___Day_1_Keynote_NatFriedman_1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: GitHub&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jbociH"&gt;GitHub and OpenAI have launched a technical preview of a new AI tool &lt;a href="https://copilot.github.com/"&gt;called Copilot&lt;/a&gt;, which lives inside the Visual Studio Code editor and autocompletes code snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ysVT8"&gt;Copilot does more than just parrot back code it’s seen before, according to GitHub. It instead analyzes the code you’ve already written and generates new matching code, including specific functions that were previously called. Examples on the project’s website include automatically writing the code to import tweets, draw a scatterplot, or grab a Goodreads rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VoIFNX"&gt;It works best with Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, and Go, according to a &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2021-06-29-introducing-github-copilot-ai-pair-programmer/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OmrBtU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A descendant of GPT-3&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bLDmqr"&gt;GitHub sees this as an evolution of pair programming, where two coders will work on the same project to catch each others’ mistakes and speed up the development process. With Copilot, one of those coders is virtual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ziYOan"&gt;This project is the first major result of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20703578/microsoft-openai-investment-partnership-1-billion-azure-artificial-general-intelligence-agi"&gt;Microsoft’s $1 billion investment&lt;/a&gt; into OpenAI, the research firm now led by Y Combinator president Sam Altman. Since Altman took the reins, OpenAI has pivoted from a nonprofit status to a &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/openai-shifts-from-nonprofit-to-capped-profit-to-attract-capital/"&gt;“capped-profit” model&lt;/a&gt;, took on the Microsoft investment, and started licensing its GPT-3 text-generation algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUHTGk"&gt;Copilot is built on a new algorithm called OpenAI Codex, which OpenAI CTO Greg Brockman &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/29/microsoft-github-copilot-ai-offers-coding-suggestions.html"&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt; as a descendant of GPT-3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uAJOS"&gt;GPT-3 is OpenAI’s flagship language-generating algorithm, which can generate text sometimes indistinguishable to human writing. It’s able to write so convincingly because of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential"&gt;sheer size of 175 billion parameters&lt;/a&gt;, or adjustable knobs that allow the algorithm to connect relationships between letters, words, phrases, and sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntJt31"&gt;While GPT-3 generates English, OpenAI Codex generates code. OpenAI plans to release a version of Codex through its API later this summer so developers can built their own apps with the tech, a representative for OpenAI told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMCXzb"&gt;Codex was trained on terabytes of openly available code pulled from GitHub, as well as English language examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wlz8Ze"&gt;While testimonials on the site rave about the productivity gains Copilot provides, GitHub implies that not all the code utilized was vetted for bugs, insecure practices, or personal data. The company writes they have put a few filters in place to prevent Copilot from generating offensive language, but it might not be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bROgTg"&gt;“Due to the pre-release nature of the underlying technology, GitHub Copilot may sometimes produce undesired outputs, including biased, discriminatory, abusive, or offensive outputs,” Copilot’s website says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ju7dkI"&gt;Given criticisms of GPT-3’s &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/for-some-reason-im-covered-in-blood-gpt-3-contains-disturbing-bias-against-muslims-693d275552bf"&gt;bias&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922"&gt;abusive language patterns&lt;/a&gt;, it seems that OpenAI hasn’t found a way to prevent algorithms from inheriting its training data’s worst elements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqhxIm"&gt;The company also warns that the model could suggest email addresses, API keys, or phone numbers, but that this is rare and the data has been found to be synthetic or pseudo-randomly generated by the algorithm. However, the code generated by Copilot is largely original. A &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/early-access/github/copilot/research-recitation"&gt;test performed by GitHub&lt;/a&gt; found that only 0.1 percent of generated code could be found verbatim in the training set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AngWSM"&gt;This isn’t the first project to try to automatically generate code to help toiling programmers. The startup &lt;a href="https://www.kite.com/"&gt;Kite&lt;/a&gt; pitches a very similar functionality, with availability on more than 16 code editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWVJ5g"&gt;Right now, Copilot is in a restricted technical preview, but you can &lt;a href="https://copilot.github.com/"&gt;sign up on the project’s website&lt;/a&gt; for a chance to access it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With xCloud on PC and iOS, cloud gaming’s next big moment has arrived</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UaS3q7ASTCeYSQ4IXEB8MbRSDCM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69519067/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="epFErZ"&gt;On Monday, Microsoft finally delivered two &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554267/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-pass-ios-iphone-ipad-pc"&gt;long-in-the-works updates for its Xbox Cloud Gaming Service&lt;/a&gt; (xCloud) that could mark a sea change for the future of cloud gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cdylrP"&gt;One is that xCloud games are now powered by custom Xbox Series X hardware, a major upgrade from the Xbox One S consoles that have powered the service since its launch in September. This means xCloud now has faster load times, less latency, and higher-resolution 1080p streaming. But perhaps more importantly, xCloud is expanding from Android to iOS and PC via the web for anyone in 22 countries with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXhtli"&gt;Taken together, the two updates mean that nearly anyone who has access to the service can play some of the biggest games on Xbox, including next-generation Xbox Series X games, right inside a browser across phones, tablets, laptops, PCs — and all for just $15 bucks a month, no $500 console required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dH4tDH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lHDrZRd7cBc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2PPlUk"&gt;I’ve spent some more time with xCloud since the custom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546139/xbox-xcloud-series-x-hardware-games-servers-datacenters"&gt;Xbox Series X server hardware&lt;/a&gt; started rolling out last week, and I’ve been impressed with the changes. Many games load quickly and look great on my MacBook Air or my iPhone 12 Mini. There is a small amount of latency, but it often isn’t too detrimental, especially if I’m playing something that doesn’t require fast reflexes or twitch aiming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Mfltz"&gt;I should warn you that xCloud doesn’t exactly replicate the experience of playing a game on a Series X. There’s only a tiny amount of latency when I’m playing on my console, and for a close race in &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 4&lt;/em&gt; or a multiplayer match in &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, I want as little latency as possible. xCloud peaks at 1080p resolution, and while that’s as high as my main gaming monitor goes (yes, I am in the market for a Real TV), if you want to play in 4K, you can’t do that with xCloud just yet. xCloud’s selection of more than 100 games, while a lot, doesn’t offer everything I might want to play. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407849/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-epic-games-block"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; isn’t on the service&lt;/a&gt; and neither is Microsoft’s own massive hit &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApyZmB"&gt;While xCloud’s technology still can’t beat the responsiveness of playing on a console, what’s been more impressive to me is the way everything syncs from my Xbox Series X to xCloud because it’s all tied to my Xbox account. &lt;em&gt;Ori and the Blind Forest&lt;/em&gt; loads right where I left off near the end of the game. I can hop into &lt;em&gt;Nier: Automata&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;overworld just to hear the game’s excellent music. If I want to play &lt;em&gt;Psychonauts&lt;/em&gt; to bounce around the legendary (and unsettling) milkman level just for the heck of it, I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9xTGxl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With xCloud, it’s easy to sample games quickly&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lw4I7Y"&gt;I don’t have any of those games installed on my Series X right now, but with xCloud I can sample them all in the span of a few minutes right from my laptop or phone. And I could easily see myself testing something I’m interested in on xCloud before going through the process of installing a game onto my Series X for a full playthrough later. Browsing xCloud reminds me of cruising the vast amount of experiences in &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; in that it’s easy to jump into anything that piques my interest, and if I don’t like it, I can quickly move on to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rh0NqM"&gt;This ability to dip in and out of games from the cloud isn’t particularly novel. It’s also easy to move from game to game on the collections of titles available on Amazon Luna’s channels or Google’s Stadia Pro subscription. But those platforms want you to invest in &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; playing via the cloud, which I don’t always want to do. (And after a certain amount of time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;I’d probably hit a data cap&lt;/a&gt;.) xCloud, on the other hand, is more of an add-on to Xbox Game Pass that lets me play games that I already own or ones that are included as part of the subscription, and if I don’t want to play them streamed from the cloud, I can boot up my Series X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8snJoN"&gt;I’d also argue that xCloud has a major leg up on Amazon and Google by offering a far more impressive selection of titles. And with big Xbox games like &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; and Bethesda’s &lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;, which will both presumably be available on xCloud, the service will only become a better value. Stadia’s roadmap is more bleak, especially since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;Google shut down its in-house development studios in February&lt;/a&gt;. I’m not aware of any exclusive games in the works for Luna, and Amazon already has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/17/22389533/amazon-canceled-lord-of-the-rings-game-tencent"&gt;rather&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21510190/amazon-crucible-canceled-game-studios-closed-beta"&gt;dismal&lt;/a&gt; track record with video games so far.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nRzyYK"&gt;I won’t be moving full time to xCloud gaming quite yet. The latency is enough of an issue that I think I’ll usually want to play Xbox games directly on my Series X. But after the upgrades to xCloud announced Monday, the service is an excellent perk to the already great Xbox Game Pass subscription that makes it easier to play Xbox games over the cloud &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547334/cloud-gaming-xbox-xcloud-microsoft-streaming-google-stadia-amazon"&gt;without having to think about it&lt;/a&gt;. The updates could be a big step toward bringing cloud gaming to more people after years of unfulfilled promise.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Good Omens is returning for a second season on Amazon Prime Video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E6F-0rjtcLmGOQGTLZergPU5p1w=/203x602:1298x1332/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69519026/E42nuvMUYAEDB5w.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hBMZaX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good Omens&lt;/em&gt; is returning for a second season on Amazon Prime Video, the company announced today, with stars Michael Sheen and David Tennant returning to reprise their roles as the odd-couple angel Aziraphale and demon Crowley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4feIsK"&gt;Also back for season 2 is Neil Gaiman, who co-wrote the original novel together with Terry Pratchett and will be returning as showrunner alongside Douglas Mackinnon (who directed the first season). Gaiman will also be writing the second season together with John Finnemore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTC9SV"&gt;The six-episode first season was originally conceived as a standalone miniseries, and already covered the entirety of Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s original novel. So much so that both Gaiman and Rhianna Pratchett, Terry’s daughter, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rhipratchett/status/1024705805386432512"&gt;shot down any continuations&lt;/a&gt; beyond the scope of the book in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZzzrC"&gt;But it’s a well known fact that Terry Pratchett and Gaiman &lt;a href="https://www.tor.com/2020/07/21/neil-gaiman-says-the-odds-of-making-more-good-omens-are-pretty-good/"&gt;had been planning a sequel&lt;/a&gt; to the first book, although the two didn’t manage to actually publish it before Pratchett’s death in 2015. “I got to use bits of the sequel in &lt;em&gt;Good Omens&lt;/em&gt; - that’s where our angels came from,” Gaiman explained in a statement &lt;a href="https://ew.com/tv/good-omens-season-2-david-tennant-michael-sheen/"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Terry’s not here any longer, but when he was, we had talked about what we wanted to do with &lt;em&gt;Good Omens&lt;/em&gt;, and where the story went next. And now, thanks to BBC Studios and Amazon, I get to take it there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajkTgx"&gt;Gaiman had also &lt;a href="https://neil-gaiman.tumblr.com/post/187820251316/hello-mr-gaiman-i-have-two-questions-to-ask-of"&gt;previously hinted on his Tumblr in 2019&lt;/a&gt; that “there is entire novel plot that nobody knows about, and Terry was absolutely in favour of that story being told” — presumably the planned sequel that season 2 will be adapting.  “We are back in Soho, and all through time and space, solving a mystery, which starts with an angel wandering through Soho, with no memory,” Gaiman teased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTGDH7"&gt;Of course, &lt;em&gt;Good Omens&lt;/em&gt; (the TV show) was also a big hit for Amazon Prime Video with an enthusiastic online fan base, so it’s not hard to see why everyone involved wanted to put together a second season. There’s no release date for the upcoming six-episode season, but filming is set to begin later in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Natasha Romanoff finally gets her standalone film&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Jg4UgS"&gt;By the standards of the current Marvel Cinematic Universe, &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; feels a little dated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JHa66"&gt;We’re now at a time when superhero exploits are filled with powerful cosmic gods, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315094/wandavision-finale-marvel-mcu-scarlet-witch-doctor-strange-captain"&gt;bizarre sitcom worlds&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523186/loki-review-episode-1-2-disney-plus"&gt;space lizards that control the flow of time&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to that, a globe-trotting story about secret agents doesn’t sound too exciting. There isn’t a single alien or witch. So though &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;technically kicks off the fourth phase of the MCU — which also includes the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451091/eternals-marvel-trailer-chloe-zhao"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391726/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings-marvel-trailer-simu-liu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — it plays out more like an earlier, more straightforward Marvel movie. Really, it almost doesn’t feel like a superhero film at all. Think of it more like the MCU’s take on &lt;em&gt;James Bond&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLMTsO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; starts out rather peacefully, with a stereotypical nuclear family in a small suburban town. It looks idyllic — but it’s also fake. The family is part of a front for Russian super soldier Alexei Shostakov, aka the Red Guardian (David Harbour) and Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz), a spy who doubles as a scientist. Very quickly their covers are blown and the family is forced to escape, and along with their “daughters” — Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) — they make a daring escape to Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIJ2Jf"&gt;The story then fast forwards 21 years. (Chronologically, it takes place right after &lt;em&gt;Captain America: Civil War&lt;/em&gt;.) Romanoff is on the run, hunted by the head of a mysterious organization known as the Red Room, which also happens to be the group behind the Black Widow program. Eventually, she partners with her estranged sister, now also a trained Black Widow herself, to take them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1K5PJqARxDPWWD7lV1dQu13uDYc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688541/fbr1480_trlcomp_v030_fa2d9b2f.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zAo0o2"&gt;The movie has a lot of the hallmarks of a classic spy movie. There’s a shady evil group (the Red Room utilizes mind control for nefarious means, including keeping the Black Widow agents in line), jet-setting jaunts to a handful of countries across the globe (that includes the likes of Cuba, Morocco, and Norway), a technological MacGuffin that everyone is after (a secret serum that negates the effects of mind control), and lots of daring escapes where virtually everything explodes (in the first hour alone there are two scenes that involve near-death escapes via plane or helicopter). Romanoff even has a sketchy friend who can get her whatever she needs, whether it’s a trailer to hide out in or a helicopter to fly to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4D0Gcj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It works surprisingly well as a standalone story&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zkHkk6"&gt;As an action movie it’s solid, with lots of fun set pieces to gawk at and a particularly menacing villain in Taskmaster, who stalks Romanoff like a &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; monster crossed with Winter Soldier. It also works surprisingly well as a standalone story. While there are a handful of references to other movies, and fans will likely enjoy delving deeper into Romanoff’s backstory, you can mostly ignore all that if you want, and you’re still left with an entertaining spy thriller. (The most Marvel-y thing about &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; is its post-credits scene.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXEj4d"&gt;If that’s all &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; was, it would be a fine, if forgettable, romp. What makes it work is the surprising amount of humor and how it elevates the rest of the story. Romanoff is as dour as ever, but here it feels deliberate; the movie does a great job of humanizing a character that’s far too often been relegated to a supporting role. And her more serious tone is balanced out nicely by comic relief from Harbour and Pugh, who see her as family rather than an Avenger. Harbour absolutely hams it up as a walking definition of toxic masculinity, a former superhero past his prime who is slowly realizing he may not have been all that heroic to begin with. You really get a sense of his character as he sits in a Russian jail, easily beating a lineup of inmates at arm wrestling, all while getting a tattoo and making bold, if impossible claims, about his long-term beef with Captain America. He has so much fun, even struggling to squeeze into an old costume from his glory days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HVx581UHpfbx2O5nbuhhl5VWM3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688547/9b242b6fdd726ace32e612d5a40e6028_4096x2727_1c974df6.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rKuhhZ"&gt;Pugh, meanwhile, deals with a life full of hardship — as we learn in the movie, only one in 20 Black Widow agents actually survive the training — with full-on sarcasm. She’s constantly making quips to lighten the mood, is irreverent in her glee for death, and takes a lot of joy from making fun of the most serious Avenger. You never knew the Black Widow needed a little sister mocking every instance in an &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; film where she does something meant to be sexy, aloof, and cool, until Pugh is doing contortions on the floor of a gas station asking why Natasha always poses like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LDy28"&gt;The highlight of the movie is the strange, uncomfortable, and yet familiar dynamic that arises when the four get back together two decades after pretending to be a family. They settle into their old rhythms despite the years, and violence, that separate them. When the sisters rescue the Red Guardian from a secluded, maximum security Russian prison, he can’t help but lean into his fatherly instincts in his own unique way, gleefully boasting about their murderous careers. It’s the same misfit energy that binds the &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; movies. Maybe it feels like a family because they’re the only ones who can stand each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="NH8gG4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; still doesn’t reach the heights of the best Marvel has to offer. But at the very least it manages to carve out its own space in the ever-crowded MCU. Instead of pushing things forward, it offers up blockbuster action that’s almost comforting in its familiarity: laughs, explosions, and characters you can’t help but root for, no matter how bad they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FvfwfB"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Black Widow &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;premieres in theaters and on&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1096468/9358?subId1=VergeBlackWidowJamesBond062921&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fmovies%2Fblack-widow%2F3VfTap90rwZC" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; Disney Plus Premier Access &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;on July 9th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 will leave millions of PCs behind, and Microsoft is struggling to explain why</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yNR-iwBpHWK38HBtpcsSF3jVDhU=/0x0:1650x1100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518916/windows11main.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s big security push is complicated&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="MrzMpS"&gt;Microsoft has had six years to prepare for the launch of Windows 11, but the company is still struggling to explain its new hardware requirements. Windows 11 will officially support Intel 8th Gen Coffee Lake or Zen 2 CPUs and up, leaving behind millions of PCs that were sold during the launch of Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MezbI3"&gt;It’s an unusual surprise if you purchased a new PC for Windows 10, or perhaps you have a perfectly capable machine that’s even older. Windows 11 will require Intel 8th Gen Coffee Lake or Zen 2 CPUs and up, TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) support, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XtDmWK"&gt;Microsoft doesn’t typically enforce such specific processor requirements with Windows — with both Windows 8 and Windows 10 only requiring a 1GHz processor, 1GB of RAM (2GB for 64-bit), and 16GB of storage (20GB for 64-bit). Power users of Windows, and IT admins alike, have built up an expectation of being able to upgrade to the latest OS, regardless of what hardware they’re running. It looks like that’s about to end with Windows 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E_t7NGbjuCOdRvxnw7cIZLKIJ4I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20012545/wjoel_200601_1777_windows10_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft doesn’t typically enforce strict CPU requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2eYhPQ"&gt;After much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22549725/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-tpm-hardware-requirements"&gt;confusion last week&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft attempted to explain its hardware requirements again yesterday, and it sounds like the main driver behind these changes is security. Coupled with Microsoft’s hardware requirements is a push to enable a more modern BIOS (UEFI) that supports features like Secure Boot and TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="op55XP"&gt;When you combine TPM with some of the virtualization technologies that Microsoft uses in Windows, there’s an understandable security benefit that we’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;discussed in detail previously&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft claims that a combination of Windows Hello, Device Encryption, virtualization-based security, hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI), and Secure Boot “has been shown to reduce malware by 60 percent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFnUJO"&gt;You obviously need modern hardware to enable all these protections, and Microsoft has been building toward this moment for years. TPM support has been a requirement for OEMs to gain Windows certification since around the release of Windows 10, but Microsoft hasn’t forced businesses or consumers to enable it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qnjH8"&gt;Microsoft’s decision to force Windows 11 users into TPM, Secure Boot, and more comes at a pivotal moment for Windows. It’s Microsoft’s operating system that’s always caught up in ransomware and malware attacks, and things are only going to get worse if the level of Windows hardware security doesn’t go up a notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 4" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYCIhumt3PrlURb79MhujdGogyY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4182758/microsoft-surface-pro-4-9312.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 won’t be supported for Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cC9xCo"&gt;That delicate balance of security and the typical openness of Windows is something that Microsoft will struggle with over the next decade, as it wrestles with modernizing Windows and the understandable backlash. While Microsoft is waiving its new hardware requirements during the preview phase of Windows 11, we still don’t know exactly what devices will be supported when it launches later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxoDyd"&gt;Microsoft tried to offer some more clarity around this yesterday, but it wasn’t the level of detail we were hoping for. “As we release to Windows Insiders and partner with our OEMs, we will test to identify devices running on Intel 7th generation and AMD Zen 1 that may meet our principles,” says a blog post from the Windows team. That could be good news for the Surface Studio 2, a $3,499 device that Microsoft still sells with a 7th Gen chip that’s not on the Windows 11 list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="db3AIv"&gt;This same blog post also revealed that 7th Gen is probably as far back as Microsoft is willing to concede. “We also know that devices running on Intel 6th generation and AMD pre-Zen will not” meet Microsoft’s minimum system requirements, said the blog post before it was edited to remove this line. It’s not clear why Intel’s 6th Gen chips are definitely off the list, but part of this decision could be related to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16850516/intel-meltdown-spectre-bug-patch-cpu-security-flaw-news"&gt;Spectre and Meltdown&lt;/a&gt; — two major computer processor security bugs that affected nearly every device made for 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhNGk8"&gt;“Microsoft’s CPU selections for Windows 11 don’t appear much at all to do with performance but look like security mitigations for side-channel attacks,” says Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. “It also helps chipmakers focus driver work on the future, not the past.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgmY0R"&gt;Side-channel attacks like Spectre and Meltdown were revealed just before Intel implemented hardware mitigations to protect against some speculative execution attacks in some 8th Gen chips in 2018. Not all of Intel’s 8th Gen chips include these hardware mitigations, though, but Microsoft has set a specific cutoff of 8th Gen and beyond. Microsoft hasn’t fully explained that decision, and the company is now telling people to wait and see if it’s able to include more older machines during its testing. Either way, there’s going to be a CPU cutoff that will affect millions of PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/anc9X2_QuWv2aD1x530kfUdQHrQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10082341/acastro_180109_1777_0001_v1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spectre and Meltdown could be related to Windows 11’s CPU changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lkecod"&gt;Critics of Microsoft’s approach note that this move will generate unnecessary e-waste as consumers move to upgrade PCs that are more than capable of running Windows 11. The complexities of TPM and UEFI are also being debated by IT admins, particularly if devices aren’t set up to use these technologies yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xr0bjd"&gt;Security expert Kevin Beaumont, who spent nearly a year working at Microsoft during the pandemic, has criticized the company over its Windows 11 hardware requirements. “In the middle of a pandemic when orgs are hurting, with a global chip shortage, Microsoft [is] trying to get people to replace things for security reasons that are questionable,” said Beaumont on Twitter. “Buy a Surface? No. Make a better OS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lwVx0P"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In the middle of a pandemic when orgs are hurting, with a global chip shortage, MS are trying to get people to replace things for security reasons that are questionable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buy a Surface? No. Make a better OS.&lt;/p&gt;— Kevin Beaumont (@GossiTheDog) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1409606411248623617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T95eym"&gt;Microsoft’s hardware changes also arrive just weeks after Apple announced macOS Monterey, with support for Mac Pros sold in late 2013 and beyond, and Mac Minis sold from late 2014 onward. Apple obviously doesn’t have to support a massive range of hardware configurations like Microsoft does, but the latest version of macOS will still run on systems that are eight years old. Microsoft’s changes mean that some PCs that are only three years old will be excluded from the Windows 11 upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAM9d0"&gt;There will be some exceptions to Microsoft’s new rules, though. “Windows 11 does not apply the hardware-compliance check for virtualized instances either during setup or upgrade,” notes a Microsoft document (&lt;a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/8/8/788bf5ab-0751-4928-a22c-dffdc23c27f2/Minimum%20Hardware%20Requirements%20for%20Windows%2011.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) on minimum hardware requirements for Windows 11. That means if you run Windows 11 as a virtual machine, you can ignore the CPU and security requirements. That flies in the face of Microsoft’s big security push here, but the reality is that most consumers and commercial customers won’t be running Windows 11 in a VM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u71sMS"&gt;Microsoft still has a few months left to test Windows 11, and feedback from the preview will inform “any adjustments [Microsoft] should make to our minimum system requirements in the future.” The software maker has also removed its PC Health Check app that led to a lot of confusion around Windows 11 upgrades. “We acknowledge that it was not fully prepared to share the level of detail or accuracy you expected from us on why a Windows 10 PC doesn’t meet upgrade requirements,” says the Windows team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxjmvm"&gt;That gives Microsoft some breathing room between now and launch, and enough time for testers to play with Windows 11 free from these new restrictions. But if you’re testing Windows 11 right now on an older CPU that’s not on the official list, the chances are you’ll need to reinstall Windows 10 at the end of the preview period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="67mnxt"&gt;Microsoft is allowing testers to access Windows 11 on a wide range of hardware during the preview, but it’s planning to apply these new restrictions at launch. I would be surprised if there is a major change to these hardware requirements later this year, other than Microsoft stepping down to some 7th Gen chips. So enjoy testing Windows 11 while you still can.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Car companies will have to report automated vehicle crashes under new rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qSNBOvg77lP8GUyz7C9HZXmoH6U=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518914/EzRSmWwVUAQVVNj.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Matt Doughtery / KPRC2 Houston&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7T3aW5"&gt;Car companies will be required to report crashes involving advanced driver assistance systems under &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2021-06/Standing_General_Order_2021_01-digital-06292021.pdf"&gt;new rules proposed&lt;/a&gt; by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvXs1B"&gt;The general order will apply to manufacturers of vehicles equipped with Level 2 driver assist systems through fully autonomous Level 5 systems, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ taxonomy for autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bk0h6T"&gt;At Level 2, the vehicle can control both steering and acceleration and deceleration, but it falls short of self-driving because a human sits in the driver’s seat and can take control of the car at any time. Level 5 refers to a fully autonomous vehicle that can travel anywhere, under any conditions. Notably, there are not Level 5 vehicles in existence today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8BPh1p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“gathering data will help instill public confidence”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RBPYvx"&gt;“NHTSA’s core mission is safety. By mandating crash reporting, the agency will have access to critical data that will help quickly identify safety issues that could emerge in these automated systems,” said Steven Cliff, NHTSA’s acting administrator, in a statement. “In fact, gathering data will help instill public confidence that the federal government is closely overseeing the safety of automated vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKFT9w"&gt;The decision is a stark departure from recent administrations, which have generally taken a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21292014/dot-nhtsa-self-driving-car-test-data-voluntary"&gt;hands-off approach&lt;/a&gt; to the nascent autonomous vehicle industry. Companies are typically inclined to share as little as possible in the interest of keeping costs low, protecting proprietary information, and controlling their narratives by preventing the release of embarrassing information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQvoBt"&gt;And for a while, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/5/17080824/dot-autonomous-vehicle-listening-session-washington"&gt;the federal government tended to agree&lt;/a&gt;, believing that requiring any data disclosure would be too onerous for the AV industry and possibly stymie research that hypothetically could lead to a reduction in fatal vehicle crashes. This laissez-faire attitude started during the Obama administration and continued under Donald Trump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDPqgO"&gt;But the Biden administration is taking a different tactic. The Department of Transportation, under Secretary Pete Buttigieg, appears to be less allergic to the idea of automakers and tech companies being required to do the bare minimum and gather data related to the operation of partially and fully autonomous vehicles on public roads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3vGo5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412233/pete-buttigieg-transportation-secretary-interview"&gt;In a recent interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Buttigieg called autonomous vehicles “a moving target” with huge safety implications for everyone on the road, adding, “We need to lean in further, using our existing authorities, but also updating them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bJFSsy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We need to lean in further, using our existing authorities”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hpiifR"&gt;Currently, when a vehicle equipped with a partially autonomous system crashes, the onus is on local authorities to investigate and release information to the public. Occasionally, NHTSA and the National Transportation Safety Board will send investigators to the crash site as well. But the car company may not disclose anything publicly on the crash, depending on the level of interest. There is currently no standardized way to gather information about crashes involving Level 2 systems and above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mthQsU"&gt;There are also no federal rules requiring AV companies to submit information about their testing activities to the government. Instead, a patchwork of state-by-state regulations governs what is and isn’t disclosed. California has the most stringent rules, requiring companies to obtain a license for different types of testing, disclose vehicle crashes, and list the number of miles driven and the frequency at which human safety drivers were forced to take control of their autonomous vehicles (also known as a “disengagement”). Unsurprisingly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21142685/california-dmv-self-driving-car-disengagement-report-data"&gt;AV companies tend to hate California’s requirements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxR0Jd"&gt;The automakers and tech companies are sure to weigh in eventually on this new rule, but NHTSA said the goal is to “identify potential safety issues and impacts resulting from the operation of advanced technologies on public roads and increase transparency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vEG61h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are also no federal rules requiring AV companies to submit information&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kRVvuG"&gt;Since Tesla introduced Autopilot in 2015, there have been at least &lt;a href="https://www.tesladeaths.com/"&gt;11 deaths in nine crashes&lt;/a&gt; in the US that involved the driver assistance system. Internationally, there have been at least another nine deaths in seven additional crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nplr8G"&gt;Some companies have proactively released data regarding crashes involving their automated vehicles. Last year, Waymo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21538999/waymo-self-driving-car-data-miles-crashes-phoenix-google"&gt;published 6.1 million miles of driving data&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 and 2020, including 18 crashes and 29 near-miss collisions. Other AV companies have expressed interest in doing the same but have yet to follow through. Tesla publishes a quarterly “safety report” about Autopilot but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17937504/tesla-autopilot-safety-consumer-report"&gt;omits key details&lt;/a&gt; that would help identify patterns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dr1VCJ"&gt;We don’t know yet whether this will be a harbinger of things to come, but it seems likely that the free ride enjoyed by automakers and tech companies with regard to autonomous vehicle testing and deployment could be coming to an end. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ZenFone 8 review: an Android iPhone mini</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The ZenFone 8 delivers flagship-level build quality and performance in a small package&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4C38dH"&gt;After a couple of generations making phones with flip-out cameras and increasingly large displays, Asus has taken the ZenFone 8 in a totally different direction: small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSrT9H"&gt;The flipping camera concept lives on in the also-new ZenFone 8 Flip, but it’s no longer a standard feature across this year’s ZenFone lineup. Instead, starting at $629 for 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, the ZenFone 8 lands in the upper-midrange class with a conventional rear camera bump and a much smaller 5.9-inch display. An 8GB RAM / 256GB storage configuration is also available for $699.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwwRdC"&gt;Rather than an attention-grabbing camera feature, the focus of this design has been to create a smaller phone that’s comfortable to use in one hand, which Asus has done without skimping on processing power or higher-end features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1hmwn"&gt;It’s an Android iPhone mini, and it’s fantastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u3cT9V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10494874"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Go0J86tAcMmzjPPXSpyPncCJlc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499353/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus designed the ZenFone 8 with one-handed operation in mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FW7hIJ"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 screen and design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="IhH9SM"&gt;The ZenFone 8 may be small, but that hasn’t kept it from offering the latest flagship processor: a Snapdragon 888 chipset, coupled with 6, 8, or 16GB of RAM (my review unit has 16GB). I can’t find fault with this phone’s performance. It feels responsive, animations and interactions are smooth, and it keeps up with demanding use and rapid app switching. This is performance fitting of a flagship device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cElERS"&gt;The display is a 5.9-inch 1080p OLED panel with a fast 120Hz refresh rate that makes routine interactions with the phone — swiping, scrolling, animations — look much more smooth and polished than a standard 60Hz screen or even a 90Hz panel. By default, the phone will automatically switch between 120 / 90 / 60Hz depending on the application to save battery life, but you can manually select any of those three refresh rates if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EFkcZ"&gt;The display’s 20:9 aspect ratio was carefully considered by Asus. The company says it settled on this slightly narrower format so the phone would fit more easily into a pocket, and it does. I can’t get it &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way into a back jeans pocket, but it mostly fits. More importantly, it fits well inside a jacket pocket and doesn’t feel like it’s going to flop out if I sit down on the floor to tie my shoes. The ZenFone 8 is rated IP68 for dust protection and some water submersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2grdcK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I can’t get it &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way into a back jeans pocket, but it mostly fits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o69ULu"&gt;The front panel is protected by Gorilla Glass Victus and houses an in-display fingerprint sensor, while the back uses Gorilla Glass 3 with a frosted finish that’s on the matte side of the matte / glossy spectrum. The front panel is flat, but the rear features a slight curve on the long edges for an easier fit in the hand. At 169 grams (5.9 ounces), it’s heavy for its size, and it feels surprisingly dense when you first pick it up. The phone’s frame is aluminum, giving the whole package a high-end look and feel. There’s even a headphone jack on the top edge as a treat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8XM4b"&gt;The power button (an exciting shade of blue!) is well-positioned so my right thumb falls on it naturally with the phone in my hand. Same for the in-screen fingerprint sensor: the target appears to be positioned higher on the screen than usual, but that actually puts it within a comfortable reach of my thumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3w8VC5"&gt;I’ll admit up front that I have a personal bias toward smaller phones, but the ZenFone 8 just feels great in my hand. I’ve spent a lot of time using big devices over the last six months, and I’ve gotten used to it. But the ZenFone 8 is the first device that feels like it was adapted to &lt;em&gt;me,&lt;/em&gt; not something I’ve had to adapt to using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0UuUZnwxRe3j921AYa4ifsE1k5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499355/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A smaller phone means a smaller battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kpaymP"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 battery and software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8mbHH8"&gt;The phone’s small size makes a smaller battery a necessity — 4,000mAh in this case, much smaller than the ZenFone 6 and 7’s 5,000mAh. I felt the difference in using this phone versus a battery-for-days budget or midrange phone, but I had no problem getting through a full day of moderate use. I even left Strava running for 20 hours by accident, and the battery still had some life in it the next morning. The ZenFone 8 supports 30W wired charging with the included power adapter, which takes an empty battery to 100 percent in a bit more than an hour. Wireless charging isn’t supported, which makes the ZenFone 8 a bit of an outlier in the flagship class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPNxId"&gt;Asus offers a ton of options to help stretch day-to-day battery life as well as the overall lifespan of your battery. There are no fewer than five battery modes to optimize phone performance or battery longevity on a daily basis, and different charging modes let you set a custom charging limit or stagger charging overnight so it reaches 100 percent around the time of your alarm for better battery health. You won’t find class-leading battery capacity here, but rest assured if you need to stretch the ZenFone 8’s battery, there are plenty of options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kj8abO"&gt;The ZenFone 8 ships with Android 11, and Asus says it will provide “at least” two major OS with security updates for the same timeframe. That’s on the low side of what we’d expect for a flagship phone, especially compared to Apple’s typical four- or five-year support schedule. An important note for US shoppers is that the ZenFone 8 will only work with AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile’s LTE and Sub-6GHz 5G networks; you can’t use this phone on Verizon, and there’s no support for the fast, but extremely limited, millimeter-wave 5G networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ctgUaWF69tS9vSVEdPG5w8MwvQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22507533/DSC00661_rear.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenFone 8 offers standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8l2mPu"&gt;Asus ZenFone 8 camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MbIlch"&gt;There are just two cameras on the ZenFone 8’s rear camera bump, and they are both worth your time. Rather than cram in a depth sensor, macro, or some monochrome nonsense, Asus just went with a 64-megapixel main camera with OIS and a 12-megapixel ultrawide. They’re borrowed from last year’s model, minus a telephoto camera and the flipping mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5utE4G"&gt;As in the ZenFone 7 Pro, the 8’s main camera produces 16-megapixel images with vibrant color and plenty of detail in good light. Images can lean a little too far into unnatural-looking territory, and some high-contrast scenes look a little too HDR-y for my liking. But overall, this camera does fine: it handles moderately low-light conditions like a dim store interior well, and Night Mode does an okay job in very low light, provided you can hold the phone still for a few seconds and your subject isn’t moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bFBXWG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10494947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xx4klZ"&gt;A skin-smoothing beauty mode is on by default when you use portrait mode, and it is not good. Skin looks over-smoothed, unnaturally flat, and brightened, like your subject is wearing a couple of layers of stage makeup. Turning this off improves things significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBkFNw"&gt;The ultrawide camera also turns in good performance. Asus calls it a “flagship” grade sensor, and while that might have been true in 2018, it’s at least a step up from the smaller, cheaper sensors often found in ultrawide cameras. Likewise, the front-facing 12-megapixel camera does fine. Beauty mode is turned off by default when you switch to the selfie camera, and thank goodness for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maIBzp"&gt;There’s no telephoto camera here, just digital zoom. On the camera shooting screen, there’s an icon to jump to a 2x 16-megapixel “lossless” digital zoom to crop in quickly, which works okay, but it isn’t much reach, and it just makes the limitations of the small sensor and lens more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wAwwx"&gt;On the whole, the camera system is good but not great. The lack of true optical zoom or a telephoto camera is a disappointment, but you can’t have everything on such a small device, and I’d personally take an ultrawide before a telephoto any day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2yyJwz2m9mIkB8t4cUpzDgDLbuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499354/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenFone 8 doesn’t sacrifice a flagship experience to achieve its small form factor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZDiMQY"&gt;The ZenFone 8 fills a void in the Android market for a full-specced, small-sized device. The Google Pixel 4A is around the same size, but it’s decidedly a budget device with a step-down processor, plastic chassis, and fewer niceties like an IP rating or a fast-refresh screen. Aside from battery life, which is manageable, you give up very little in the way of flagship features to get the ZenFone 8’s small form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzbIbh"&gt;You have to look to iOS for this phone’s most direct competition: the iPhone 12 mini, which it matches almost spec-for-spec from the IP rating down to the camera configuration. The 12 mini is actually a little smaller than the ZenFone 8, and when you factor in storage capacity, it’s the more expensive choice at $829 for 256GB. However, when you consider that the 12 mini will probably get a couple more years of OS and security support, it may be the better buy in the long run, if you’re flexible in your choice of operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jc0CEI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Flagship-level build quality and performance quite literally in the palm of your hand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rEL2JQ"&gt;I like the ZenFone 8 a lot, but I’m not sure it’ll find a big audience, at least in the US. Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;having trouble selling the iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;, and if there’s one thing Apple is good at, it’s selling phones to US customers. As much as I hate to entertain the idea, maybe we’ve gotten used to giant phones. I love how the ZenFone 8 feels in my hand and in my pocket, but I do notice how much smaller the screen and everything on it seems compared to the bigger phones I’ve used recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Etfrj"&gt;There are also a few important considerations, like the lack of compatibility with Verizon and the comparatively short support lifespan of the phone. If you need the absolute best in battery life the ZenFone 8 can’t offer that, and if you want a class-leading camera, you’ll need to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="OIO7v3"&gt;All that said, the ZenFone 8 will be the right fit for a specific type of person, and I can heartily recommend it to my fellow small phone fans. You’ll get flagship-level build quality and performance quite literally in the palm of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s $70 G335 is a colorful wired gaming headset</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logitech G335 headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TL_kj5UIyDbwhDgn41E1igH_zbw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518822/g335.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MLyvc3"&gt;Logitech announced its new G335 wired gaming headset &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fgaming-audio%2Fg335-gaming-headset.981-001023.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F29%2F22555522%2Flogitech-wired-g335-gaming-headset-features-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that’s available for preorder now at $69.99&lt;/a&gt;. It’s expected to ship in July. The G335 borrows several design elements from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21378026/logitech-g733-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-headset-accessories-g203-g305-g915-colors"&gt;$129.99 G733 wireless model released in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, including its expressive color options (as well as a new mint colorway), the comfortable bungee headband, breathable ear pads, a volume dial built into the right ear cup, and a flip-to-mute microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yUjz1"&gt;This more affordable model is compatible with the G733’s replaceable headband straps and mic covers sold through Logitech’s site, but it does away with most of that headset’s fancier features, like USB-C charging and the strip of RGB lighting on the front side of the ear cups. Logitech says this wired model has a slimmer design for “a smaller fit and increased comfort.” It weighs 240 grams, which is about 40 grams less than the wireless model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sCHjGL"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ErvB8vEDoo0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="APWMqC"&gt;The G335 comes with a 3.5mm cable attached, which ensures support with many devices that have an audio jack, be it a PS5 or Xbox Series X console controller, a PC, tablet, a laptop, or something else. Logitech includes a PC splitter to accommodate computers that have separate microphone and audio inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQO9h7"&gt;It’s best not to expect too much from a $70 wired headset, but I loved the design and fit of the G733. And if the audio performance is anything like the pricier wireless model, the G335 could be easy to recommend at its price point. We’ll be testing this one out soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mario Golf: Super Rush isn’t weird enough</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RYIs7JsV6lwPcCOBcMZFZ127G8I=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518778/Mario_Golf_Super_Rush_Special_Shot_bmp_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pGSanC"&gt;At their best, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; sports titles move beyond the game they’re trying to mimic. You don’t have to care about cars or racing to enjoy &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;, just as you don’t need to know who Pep Guardiola is to have fun with &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Strikers&lt;/em&gt;. The sport is just a starting point. From there, Nintendo’s designers expand on it with all kinds of interesting and new ideas. &lt;em&gt;Mario Golf: Super Rush&lt;/em&gt;, which is out now on the Nintendo Switch, does &lt;em&gt;some &lt;/em&gt;of this. There are familiar characters with superpowers, courses with strange obstacles, and a new mode that’s supposed to emphasize speed over all else. Ultimately, though, &lt;em&gt;Super Rush &lt;/em&gt;ends up feeling a little too much like, well, golf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYypz5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Rush&lt;/em&gt; at least gets the basics right. Swinging a club feels good, and that’s true whether you’re using a standard controller or &lt;em&gt;Wii Sports&lt;/em&gt;-style motion controls. It manages to walk the line Nintendo games so often do, where it’s easy to pick up but also offers a good amount of depth once you start learning how different clubs work and how to add spin to your shot. The act of playing golf works well enough, and it’s augmented by some very Mario features, like outlandish obstacles (you can use tornadoes to give your ball a boost into the air) and character-specific powers (there are special shots that freeze the ground on impact or generate an annoying lightning storm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONzyh1"&gt;That’s all fine if you just want to play a few rounds with friends. But many of the modes get in the way of the fun, and &lt;em&gt;Super Rush&lt;/em&gt; is particularly grueling if you’re looking to play solo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="32rr2O"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-5cViCVKOZQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lRzn2w"&gt;First, there’s the “speed rush,” the game’s titular innovation, a mode that’s geared more around speed than precision. The idea is that after you take your shot you run after the ball to take the next as quickly as possible. The faster you are, the better your score. In practice, though, running around on golf courses is tedious and actually slows things down; it takes me longer to run 160 yards than it would for the game to just zap me there. This might be forgiven if the act of running was enjoyable, but instead you’re saddled with a rapidly depleting stamina gauge and a limited range of actions (including a mostly useless jump) that turn the whole process into a chore. (To make matters worse, if you finish a hole quickly, you still have to sit and watch your opponents play, even in the single-player modes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDDiGR"&gt;There’s also an “adventure” mode, which plays out sort of like a simple golf RPG. You play as a Mii character going through the process of becoming a Mushroom Kingdom pro. You’ll travel to different courses, talk to characters, earn skill points to upgrade your Mii, and take on bosses. It’s a nice idea, but it never rises to the level of past games in the series, like &lt;em&gt;Mario Golf: Advance Tour&lt;/em&gt;, which leaned much heavier on the roleplaying elements and had a surprisingly entertaining narrative. Instead, it’s a largely flat story that had me skipping through the dialogue in order to get to the next tournament. (Which, usually, meant playing more speed golf.)&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NzhoxBppX3NdSb6_tybtJZRtUbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688594/Switch_MarioGolfSuperRush_ND_SCRN_05.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DDfhWm"&gt;The highlight of the package is “battle golf,” easily the fastest mode in the game. It’s a nine-hole course that takes place in a giant stadium where the goal is to sink three shots first, while navigating things like Thwomps and bombs. It’s basically the &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt; ethos but for golf, and it’s a lot of fun. Even better, matches are over very quickly, making it an almost ideal party experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEZ5jM"&gt;I couldn’t help but wish that more of the game had the same zany, Nintendo-like feel of battle golf. I wanted more oddball courses and modes, more chances to get into weird situations. Instead, the solid mechanics and colorful world are dragged down by a story mode with a bland story, and a sped-up version of golf that’s actually pretty slow. There’s still fun to be had, particularly with two people hitting balls on the same Switch. But while &lt;em&gt;Super Rush&lt;/em&gt; gets the golf part right, it’s lacking what makes &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; games special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yscprx"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mario Golf: Super Rush &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is available now on the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
