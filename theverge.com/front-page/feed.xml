    <title>Amazon is making in-garage delivery an option for all grocery delivery orders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/43Psy3h-dn9gSdsSQ71Sj8mKkTI=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69191196/Key_In_Garage_Grocery_Delivery_4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fzIIdf"&gt;Amazon is expanding its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18167425/amazon-key-garage-business-home-deliveries-prime-ces-2019"&gt;in-garage delivery option&lt;/a&gt; today to every city where it offers grocery deliveries. According to the company, that’s now over 5,000 US cities where Key by Amazon Garage Grocery Delivery can be used to have Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods orders left directly in your garage. You can check to see if the service is available near you by &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=21480997011"&gt;entering your ZIP code on Amazon’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnFk1c"&gt;Garage Grocery Delivery was initially only available in Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle, and Los Angeles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562447/amazon-in-garage-delivery-service-available-areas-key"&gt;in November 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but this expansion should reach even more Amazon customers. Along with living in a supported city, you’ll also need a MyQ-enabled garage door opener or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GD3D9YJ/ref=s9_acss_bw_cg_GroLP2_2b1_w?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-7&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=R6201ZG6TQTNRQE263Z0&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=8d864092-7fb4-4ad6-8df3-78177d2cd1e9&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=21480997011&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a MyQ Smart Garage Hub&lt;/a&gt; to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGnNKp"&gt;With all of those boxes checked, you can select “Key Delivery” at checkout and have the groceries sent straight to your garage without having to get up and answer the door. If you’re not at home, you can watch deliveries happen live with a smart home camera from Ring or LiftMaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3duTE"&gt;Since getting into the grocery business in a serious way in 2017 with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/16/15816174/amazon-whole-foods-acquisition-supermarket-stores"&gt;$13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s main focus has seemed to be making it as easy to spend money on groceries as it is to purchase something for delivery. Allowing someone to physically bring food into your home is an obvious end point for that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUBZaS"&gt;As of late, Amazon has also been trying to streamline the in-store experience: the company has opened several &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22324948/amazon-fresh-grocery-stores-chain-usa-dash-carts"&gt;Amazon Fresh stores over the last year&lt;/a&gt; that use its high-tech &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21323421/amazon-dash-cart-smart-grocery-shopping-woodland-hills-store-cashierless"&gt;Dash shopping cart&lt;/a&gt;, and it has announced plans to introduce a way &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395441/amazon-one-palm-scanning-payments-whole-foods-seattle"&gt;to pay with your palm&lt;/a&gt; in Whole Foods stores.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla claims someone was in the driver’s seat in deadly Texas crash</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3XCqjqfjimJ0w2o-rNFCdicASf8=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69189993/fatal_crash_tesla.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/KPRC2/status/1383787158297726985?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;KPRC2 Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R3LmG2"&gt;A Tesla Model S that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22390612/two-people-killed-fiery-tesla-crash-no-driver"&gt;crashed and caught fire&lt;/a&gt; recently in Texas, killing two men, may have had someone in the driver’s seat, according to Tesla’s top executives. Their comments in an earnings call Monday contradict statements made by local law enforcement in the immediate aftermath of the crash, and could complicate the efforts by federal crash investigators who are also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391890/tesla-driverless-crash-texas-nhtsa-investigation"&gt;examining the incident&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8LKZb8"&gt;Lars Moravy, Tesla’s vice president of vehicle engineering, said that company representatives were able to inspect the crash, along with local law enforcement and investigators from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Moravy said the company was able to determine that the steering wheel was “deformed,” leading them to conclude there was someone in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bEAqe0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All seatbelts post-crash were found to be unbuckled”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e3H3CD"&gt;“All seatbelts post-crash were found to be unbuckled,” Moravy added. Tesla’s advanced driver assist system, Autopilot, can only operate when the seatbelts are buckled. (&lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; recently was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397546/tesla-autopilot-consumer-report-test-no-driver"&gt;able to prove&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla’s vehicles can easily “tricked” into thinking a person is in the driver’s seat.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6QYIt9"&gt;If the government is upset with Tesla’s disclosures, it isn’t saying so. A spokesperson for the NHTSA declined to comment, while a representative for the NTSB did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JeN50h"&gt;Moravy said that Tesla was unable to recover the SD card from the vehicle, but that local law enforcement was working on getting that to the company. “We continue to hold safety in a high regard and look to improve our products in the future, through this kind of data and other information from the field,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pj9pZf"&gt;The crash took place on Saturday, April 17th, in Spring, Texas. &lt;a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/tesla-spring-crash-fire/285-c28a4993-5b5f-43f4-a924-e39638390647"&gt;According to KHOU&lt;/a&gt; in Houston, investigators at the scene were “100 percent certain” that no one was in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash. Minutes before the crash, the wives of the men were said to overhear them talking about the Autopilot feature of the vehicle, which was a 2019 Tesla Model S, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/18/business/tesla-fatal-crash-texas.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The two victims were identified as Everette Talbot, 69, and William Varner, 59, a prominent local anesthesiologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dMwnmk"&gt;In the aftermath of the crash, Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed that “data logs recovered so far” indicate that Autopilot was not engaged, nor had the vehicle owner purchased the company’s “Full Self-Driving” option that may have allowed the use of Autopilot on local roads. Today, the company took its comments a step further, directly contradicting law enforcement’s initial assessment of the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X29rNm"&gt;It is not, however, the first time that Tesla has made public statements about a crash under investigation by the federal government. Musk has also been highly critical of media coverage about incidents involving Tesla vehicles, saying journalists are unfairly focusing on his company for sensationalist reasons and questioning why the numerous standard road deaths that occur every day are not covered as vigorously. (For a good counter argument, please read &lt;em&gt;Jalopnik &lt;/em&gt;journalist &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/why-we-write-about-tesla-crashes-1846715628"&gt;Jason Torchinsky’s explanation&lt;/a&gt; about why Tesla crashes are newsworthy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNWNem"&gt;In the call on Monday, Musk reiterated his critique of “deceptive media practices,” claiming that Autopilot was not in use at the time of the Texas crash, and slamming journalists for saying otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HnHQHm"&gt;“Those journalists should be ashamed with themselves,” Musk said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says Tesla made ‘significant mistakes’ with solar roof project</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IzvNfREJxlwPuvtRoWLK19hljDw=/550x655:3351x2522/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69189983/0x0_Solar_Roof_05.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4bAO4j"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Monday that his company made “significant mistakes” in its solar roof tile project that have led to further cost overruns and delays. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/28/13463236/tesla-solar-roof-battery-new-elon-musk"&gt;product was originally revealed back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2BZOe"&gt;Tesla is currently still trying to meet significant demand for the solar roof, but has yet to widely roll out the product, Musk said in a conference call with investors following the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404198/tesla-q1-results-earnings-profit-model-s-x-y-3-bitcoin-delay"&gt;Tesla’s financial results for the first quarter of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla reported $494 million in sales of its energy generation and storage products in the first quarter, but the overall division is still not profitable. Musk’s comments come as irate customers have told &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380057/tesla-solar-roof-price-increase-contract-amount"&gt;outlets like &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/29/tesla-drastically-increases-price-solar-roof/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla is increasing the price of the solar tiles when it comes time for installation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddMKQa"&gt;Musk said Tesla has run into trouble “assessing the difficulty of certain roofs,” and said that the “complexity of roofs varies dramatically.” If an existing roof has protuberances, or problems with the underlying structure, or is not strong enough to hold Tesla’s solar tiles, then the cost can be two or three times higher than Tesla’s initial estimates, Musk said. Tesla is refunding customers’ deposits if they don’t want to pay the price increase, Musk said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4EUUdW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The solar roof was revealed nearly five years ago&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sHBRs7"&gt;Musk unveiled the Tesla solar roof in 2016 on the set of &lt;em&gt;Desperate Housewives. &lt;/em&gt;At the time,  he was trying to acquire Solar City, a solar energy company formed by his cousins. Musk was also chairman of Solar City at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XSPmQ"&gt;The roofs he showed off at the event weren’t fully working, &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40422084/inside-steel-pulse-the-mysterious-project-that-became-elon-musks-solar-roof"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; later reported, and Musk allegedly had said prototypes of the tiles were a “piece of shit.” Still, the vision for the solar roof — replacing regular roof shingles with photovoltaic tiles that could collectively capture even more of the sun’s energy than traditional solar panels, and storing that energy in Tesla’s Powerwall home battery — was crucial to the merger, he wrote in his second “master plan” for Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhfTDe"&gt;“We can’t do this well if Tesla and SolarCity are different companies, which is why we need to combine and break down the barriers inherent to being separate companies,” he wrote. “That they are separate at all, despite similar origins and pursuit of the same overarching goal of sustainable energy, is largely an accident of history. Now that Tesla is ready to scale Powerwall and SolarCity is ready to provide highly differentiated solar, the time has come to bring them together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ve47se"&gt;The merger eventually went through, though it’s still the focus of a shareholder lawsuit in Delaware. Since that 2016 event, the solar roof has gone through multiple revisions but has yet to be widely rolled out. Musk even once said that 2019 would be the “&lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/elon-musk-this-is-the-year-of-the-solar-roof-and-powerwall"&gt;year of the solar roof&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5v8eTH"&gt;Musk now says Tesla will expand solar roof installations this year, and on Monday he talked up the company’s recent decision to more bundle Tesla’s home battery with its solar products. “This is the long term solution to a sustainable energy future,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how the Internet Archive digitizes 78rpm records</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Close up of a record player stylus sitting on a record. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ie3RA-pE5qWHfw9YJn0pITVpPMg=/3x0:2037x1356/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69189828/DSC02082.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2pmjRp"&gt;The Internet Archive, in partnership with George Blood LP, has been working since 2016 to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/12/16126346/50000-digitized-vinyl-internet-archive-great-78-project"&gt;digitize thousands of 78rpm records&lt;/a&gt;, some of which were made in the early 1900s. Over 250,000 records have been preserved, and the archive posted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/internetarchive/status/1386423512810721284"&gt;a Twitter thread &lt;/a&gt;yesterday detailing how each record is cleaned and filed away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N6oabJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;At the Internet Archive, this is how we digitize #78 rpm records. &lt;br&gt;Our partner &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/georgeblood_lp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@georgeblood_lp&lt;/a&gt; has perfected this technique, digitizing with 4 different styli at once. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We put as much effort into capturing the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/metadata?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#metadata&lt;/a&gt; as we do digitizing the music. &lt;a href="https://t.co/dn4EjXTS9z"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dn4EjXTS9z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Internet Archive (@internetarchive) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/internetarchive/status/1386423512810721284?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wn0bFx"&gt;Each record is cleaned on a machine that sprays distilled water onto its surface. A little vacuum arm then sucks up the water, along with whatever dirt and nastiness has built up in the record’s grooves over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XNpqY"&gt;The discs are then photographed, and the photos are referenced to pull info from the discs’ labels and add it to the archive’s database by hand. While most of the records are from the biggest record labels like Columbia, RCA Victor, and Capitol, the archive has found 1,700 other labels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xvy2Om"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;4/ ...but along the way, we've uncovered 1700 other music labels + some pretty beautiful picture discs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From 1898-1950, this was THE way music was recorded &amp;amp; shared. Shouldn't we preserve this part of our musical history?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To learn more or get involved:&lt;a href="https://t.co/n741BM382p"&gt;https://t.co/n741BM382p&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/OdpsP5NQFR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OdpsP5NQFR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Internet Archive (@internetarchive) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/internetarchive/status/1386428088049836034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OMISv4"&gt;Some of the 78s are a treat to look at, including &lt;a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22picture+disc%22"&gt;picture discs&lt;/a&gt; that have an image printed across the entire surface of the record. I recommend “&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/VemVemTheCubanKissingGame"&gt;Vem Vem (The Cuban Kissing Game)&lt;/a&gt;” from 1947 and “&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/NightHerdingSong"&gt;Night Herding Song&lt;/a&gt;” from 1949.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBEMBC"&gt;78s don’t have standardized groove sizes, so recordings taken with various stylus tips will each sound slightly different. Here, you get four: the records are digitized with custom-built turntables that have four arms, each with a different stylus. Each version is available to download separately, with the file name showing “3.3_CT” for a recording from a 3.3 mil truncated conical stylus and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUmB8X"&gt;Four styli might make you nervous when we’re talking about preserving fragile records, some of which are over a hundred years old. But most of these 78s are made of hard shellac, which makes them prone to shattering if mishandled, but is also tough enough that the grooves won’t be damaged by a stylus. Modern equipment with diamond tip styli also exert much less force than old players with steel needles, George Blood LP &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/internetarchive/status/1386453127881117700"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LG5QND"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/georgeblood"&gt;whole collection&lt;/a&gt; is a little overwhelming to dig through, but you can narrow your browsing by year, genre, and artist. If you’d prefer to be surprised, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/great78project"&gt;@great78project&lt;/a&gt; Twitter account posts a new record from the collection every hour.&lt;/p&gt;

(If you watched Apple’s April 20th event, you may have spotted &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/JdBYVNuky1M?t=2697"&gt;a brief look at the update&lt;/a&gt; ahead of today’s release.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7C22qp"&gt;You can get an idea of what this will look like in action with this GIF taken from Apple’s demo video. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QOP8L0"&gt;Apple says that the AR Spaces effects should work with the other effects built in to Clips, such as the animated stickers and emoji, if you want to add even more to your videos. The update to the app can be downloaded now from the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XK2MkR"&gt;The Clips update is Apple’s latest experiment with AR, in which the company has a keen interest. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22278780/apple-augmented-reality-ar-app-for-all-mankind-tv-plus"&gt;released an AR experience tie-in&lt;/a&gt; for its show &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind &lt;/em&gt;in February, and CEO Tim Cook discussed some of his thoughts about AR tech in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview"&gt;an interview earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. There are also rumors that Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;working on a full-fledged AR / VR headset&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California will be able to set its own tailpipe standards again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SFChronicleVirusTraffic" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JuFCSiEB-QqJKXfppadObyUmu08=/0x1:5043x3363/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69189535/1312394406.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lKXzOt"&gt;California is on track to regain its power to set tougher vehicle emissions standards than the rest of the US. The Environmental Protection Agency announced today that it’s reconsidering a Donald &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20872304/trump-california-emissions-pollution-rollback-waiver-clean-air-act"&gt;Trump-era edict&lt;/a&gt; that sought to strip California of that ability. The EPA plans to rescind the Trump decision altogether after a public comment period ends on July 6th, the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2021-04-26/epa-california-emissions-waiver-reversing-trump?utm_id=28019&amp;amp;sfmc_id=765815"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Last week, the Department of Transportation &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/cafe_preemption_nprm_04222021_1.pdf"&gt;moved&lt;/a&gt; to repeal a related Trump-era rule that barred individual states from setting their own tailpipe standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="5mN4kb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;California has essentially set the tone for the country&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HEzeDu"&gt;California has been able to set its own tailpipe standards since it was granted a waiver under the 1970 Clean Air Act. At the time, the Golden State was grappling with an air quality crisis that it sought to solve, in part, with tougher standards for tailpipe pollution. Since then, California has essentially set the tone for the country. In order to sell in California, the nation’s biggest auto market, automakers have had to adhere to the state’s stricter standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TB5ux"&gt;“I am a firm believer in California’s long-standing statutory authority to lead. The 2019 decision to revoke the state’s waiver to enforce its greenhouse gas pollution standards for cars and trucks was legally dubious and an attack on the public’s health and wellbeing,”  EPA Administrator Michael Regan &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-reconsiders-previous-administrations-withdrawal-californias-waiver-enforce"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a statement today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdmZjs"&gt;Former President Trump sought to take away California’s Clean Air Act waiver and weaken fuel efficiency and emissions standards. While the Obama administration sought to increase average fuel efficiency by 5 percent each year between 2021 and 2026, the Trump administration lowered that standard to a 1.5 percent annual increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qZTrOT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford, Volkswagen, Honda, and BMW all struck a deal with California&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MBhTTI"&gt;But Trump faced opposition &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272179/attorneys-general-sue-trump-administration-fuel-efficiency-standard-rollback"&gt;in court&lt;/a&gt; and, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611607/gm-trump-california-car-emission-pollution-biden-fuel-efficiency-standards"&gt;increasingly&lt;/a&gt;, from automakers. Ford, Volkswagen, Honda, and BMW all struck a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20727261/trump-emissions-rollback-ford-volkswagon-honda-bmw-california-deal"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; with California in 2019 to increase fuel efficiency and cut emissions regardless of whatever weaker&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;federal standards the Trump administration set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ntFsw"&gt;So California never fully lost its outsize influence over the auto industry. But with its legal authority to set separate standards fully restored, the state will have an even bigger voice as the Biden administration considers new federal standards &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/04/22/transportation-climate-change/"&gt;expected in July&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmD1Om"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New White House task force will look for ways to boost union organizing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks On Gun Violence Prevention From White House Rose Garden" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S0DF0NXbrAB-ZIRkdupXko0qIfk=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69189523/1311488967.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alex Wong / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OupgVV"&gt;President Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/04/26/executive-order-on-worker-organizing-and-empowerment/"&gt;issued an executive order today&lt;/a&gt; to create a new labor task force in support of worker organizing in the United States. The effort will be led by Vice President Kamala Harris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8vxII"&gt;“Despite the importance of unions to our economy and democracy, and nearly 60 million workers today saying they would join a union if given the chance, American workers have faced increasing barriers to organizing and bargaining collectively with their employers,” the order reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sFfBXH"&gt;The task force, which includes a long list of cabinet members and policy advisers, will make recommendations on how the federal government can help workers organize and join unions. This could include helping contractors in industries that have been difficult to organize, such as the so-called gig economy, &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/26/fact-sheet-executive-order-establishing-the-white-house-task-force-on-worker-organizing-and-empowerment/"&gt;according to a White House fact sheet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cI4cVn"&gt;The move comes after decades of declining union membership. In 2020, just 10.8 percent of the US workforce was unionized, down from more than 30 percent in the 1950s, according to the White House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHkiEh"&gt;In the executive order, Biden wrote that this decline has led to a “host of negative consequences for American workers and the economy, including weakening and shrinking America’s middle class.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmePON"&gt;The task force can’t create new policies or pass laws, so the immediate effect of the executive order will be minimal. But the new group could help to spur President Biden to take stronger action in support of collective bargaining. Already, the White House has voiced its support for the Protecting the Rights to Organize Act, which would strengthen organizing protections. The bill is currently awaiting a vote in the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66D5z3"&gt;The task force now has 180 days to come up with policy recommendations to increase union membership in the public and private sectors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DaKnxQ"&gt;President Biden has been a vocal supporter of the labor movement, a break from previous Democratic presidents who were more measured in their support. In February, the President publicly voiced support for Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama, who were in the middle of a closely watched union drive. Workers eventually voted against unionizing, though the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377142/bessemer-amazon-labor-union-loss-warehouse-rwdsu"&gt;is contesting the result&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin protests NASA’s $2.9 billion Moon contract with SpaceX</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos gives an update on their progress and share their vision of going to space to benefit Earth." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V8Qa4okClzgbjrP9CpX28dR_Tyk=/0x0:4966x3311/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69189436/1183345648.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xR9hpq"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin is fighting NASA’s decision to award SpaceX $2.9 billion to land astronauts on the Moon by 2024. NASA’s Human Landing System program, which funded the development of three rival lunar lander prototypes (including Blue Origin’s), was expected to pick two of those landers in April. But NASA opted for just one — SpaceX’s Starship — because of short funding from Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHup6y"&gt;Blue Origin’s 175-page protest, filed with the Government Accountability Office less than two weeks after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;SpaceX won the contract&lt;/a&gt;, accuses NASA of misjudging several parts of its proposal for Blue Moon, the lunar lander it’s developing with a “National Team” of established space and defense contractors: Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, and Draper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHsVuY"&gt;NASA announced its decision to pick SpaceX’s Starship rocket system on April 16th, citing the spacecraft’s proposed cost and cargo capacity as key reasons for beating both Blue Origin and Dynetics, the third company bidding for the contract. Under the contract, NASA said, Starship will fly two demonstration missions — one uncrewed test mission to the lunar surface, and another mission carrying humans around 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bphH86"&gt;“NASA has executed a flawed acquisition for the Human Landing System program and moved the goalposts at the last minute,” Blue Origin said in a statement released on Monday, calling NASA’s decision “high risk.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8USkxg"&gt;“Their decision eliminates opportunities for competition, significantly narrows the supply base, and not only delays, but also endangers America’s return to the Moon. Because of that, we’ve filed a protest with the GAO,” the statement read. NASA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mxi3qk"&gt;SpaceX CEO Elon Musk responded to the protest with a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1386825367948644352?s=20"&gt;crude tweet&lt;/a&gt;: “Can’t get it up (to orbit) lol,” he said, apparently referring to the fact that Blue Origin hasn’t launched anything into orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCYzJs"&gt;The lunar lander contract is the centerpiece of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/18/18629403/nasa-artemis-moon-program-funds-hardware-apollo-11-anniversary"&gt;NASA’s Artemis program&lt;/a&gt;, the agency’s effort to put the first astronauts since Apollo back on the Moon and use the lunar surface as a springboard for future missions to Mars. Last year, Congress gave NASA $850 million of the $3.3 billion it requested to procure the lunar landers. NASA cited that funding shortfall as a reason that it only picked SpaceX’s Starship, instead of picking two companies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22258815/nasa-moon-lander-awards-biden-spacex-blue-origin-moonshot"&gt;as was expected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xSF02k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Such an evaluation is unreasonable and prejudiced Blue Origin”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H45rnh"&gt;In its filing, Blue Origin claims NASA didn’t provide the company an opportunity to revise their proposal after learning about the short funding from Congress. The company also claimed NASA unfairly favored SpaceX and ignored technical challenges related to Starship, including the rocket system’s unproven technique to refuel itself in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEDsQU"&gt;“The Agency unreasonably favored SpaceX’s evaluation by minimizing significant risks in SpaceX’s design and schedule, while maximizing the same or similar risks in Blue Origin’s proposal. Such an evaluation is unreasonable and prejudiced Blue Origin,” the filing read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPmRGh"&gt;The GAO can act as a court for procurement disputes between companies and federal agencies. Reviewing protests like Blue Origin’s, the watchdog agency will choose to either reject or sustain them. If Blue Origin’s protest is sustained — which is rare — the GAO would issue a set of recommendations for NASA. It’s extremely rare for agencies to defy GAO recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCe08x"&gt;In its protest, Blue Origin asked the GAO to recommend that NASA rescind its award to SpaceX, reissue the competition with a new statement that reflects the funding shortfall, and convene discussions with all bidders on the new process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIF1tK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/13/20803613/blue-origin-bid-protest-air-force-launch-procurement-national-security-missions"&gt;This isn’t Blue Origin’s first bid protest&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, the company challenged the Air Force’s strategy to pick two of four bidding companies to launch the Pentagon’s satellites into space for the next several years. The GAO sustained part of that protest, but it didn’t hand Blue Origin the win it sought.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Capcom will now give you a week to play Resident Evil Village’s final demo instead of just a day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wmknH1ILtqXexISULKMoIs-LMAA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69189352/EsRryLBXIAAE_Yd.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Capcom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rWoiFf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242218/resident-evil-8-village-release-date-trailer-ps5-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is nearly here, and Capcom is giving you more time to play a piece of it ahead of launch. The studio originally announced that players on Xbox, Playstation, and PC would have access to a 60-minute demo this weekend for just 24 hours, but after &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evils-time-limited-demos-are-the-dumbest-shit-1846716385"&gt;fan criticism&lt;/a&gt;, Capcom has extended the demo’s availability to a full week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HA3TDo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt;’s final demo will still unlock on May 1st at 8PM ET in North America, but availability will now end on May 9th at 8PM ET, a two-day overlap with the game’s full release on May 7th. Capcom announced the change along with extended time frames for both the United Kingdom and Europe &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1386697010686930951?s=20"&gt;on the game’s Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;. Playtime for the demo will still be limited to an hour, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NO34SB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We've heard your feedback and are extending the availability period for the final 60-minute multi-platform &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/REVillage?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#REVillage&lt;/a&gt; demo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The original 24-hour window starting 5PM PDT May 1 (1AM BST May 2) has been increased by a week, and now ends at the same times on May 9 PDT (May 10 BST). &lt;a href="https://t.co/8VKEU8bMnu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8VKEU8bMnu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Resident Evil (@RE_Games) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1386697010686930951?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tATZzf"&gt;The final demo will let you play two sections of the game: the eponymous village and Castle Dimitrescu, home of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261405/resident-evil-village-tall-lady-dimitrescu-height"&gt;the tall vampire lady&lt;/a&gt; everyone knows and loves. PlayStation owners had just a few hours to check out the village and then the castle sections in 30-minute chunks over the past two weekends, but on May 1st, players on PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Stadia will all have a week to play through both sections of the game, as long as they do so within 60 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TV6QDD"&gt;This demo follows the first from January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243367/resident-evil-village-maiden-demo-available-now-ps5-playstation-5"&gt;titled “Maiden,”&lt;/a&gt; which featured an unnamed protagonist rather than &lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt;’s main character, Ethan Winters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QiYYJm"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FH0eL_I_l0g?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=26&amp;amp;start=26" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lsli4r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; launches on Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC, and Stadia on May 7th.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="PjlVaj"&gt;Lyft is selling its autonomous vehicle division to a subsidiary of Toyota — the latest in a series of acquisitions that is seeing the world of self-driving cars grow increasingly smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tNnE8V"&gt;Woven Planet Holdings, a subsidiary of Toyota, will acquire Lyft’s self-driving division, Level 5, for $550 million in cash — $200 million of which was provided to Lyft up front. The rest of the money, $350 million, will be paid out to Lyft over five years. The ride-hailing company says it will see an annual savings of $100 million of non-GAAP expenses, which it claims will better position it to ultimately earn a profit. Toyota has also agreed to use Lyft’s fleet data and platform for any commercial service it eventually launches under its Woven Planet subsidiary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5osbv"&gt;The deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021, brings to an end Lyft’s four-year journey toward developing and deploying its own self-driving cars. The company follows its rival Uber in off-loading its costly autonomous vehicle division in a bid to stop losing so much money. Last year, Uber sold its AV project to Aurora, a startup founded by the former head of Google’s self-driving project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sibzqE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The deal brings to an end Lyft’s four-year journey toward developing and deploying its own self-driving cars&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="adTXI6"&gt;Of course, Lyft did not experience the tragedy of overseeing a self-driving car killing a pedestrian as Uber did in 2018. Rather, Lyft’s project was small-scale but productive. It mostly consisted of a pilot project in Las Vegas with Aptiv using self-driving cars with safety drivers to conduct tens of thousands of taxi trips. That project is now being overseen by Motional, Aptiv’s joint venture with Hyundai, and Lyft is involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iujZj4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/21/16005636/lyft-self-driving-car-technology-hardware-software"&gt;Lyft launched its Level 5 division in 2017&lt;/a&gt; with the bold claim that by 2021, “a majority” of its rides would take place in autonomous vehicles. The company hired hundreds of engineers to staff a 50,000-square-foot facility in Palo Alto, California. A year later, Lyft acquired the UK-based augmented reality startup Blue Vision Labs for a reported $72 million in the hopes of accelerating its efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PL4dTH"&gt;But the prediction that most of Lyft’s rides would take place in AVs never came to pass. In fact, despite some technical successes, autonomous vehicles remain very far away from any kind of mass adoption. Most AVs on the road today are still test vehicles, with most of the major players refusing to commit to a timeline for commercialization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V5qnvD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota, meanwhile, has largely kept its self-driving car tinkering quiet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t2uUE8"&gt;Toyota, meanwhile, has largely kept its self-driving car tinkering quiet. The Japanese company, which is the largest automaker in the world, has released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166854/toyota-self-driving-car-test-vehicle-ces-2019"&gt;some information about its test vehicles&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16849422/toyota-self-driving-car-platform-3-lexus-lidar"&gt;types of sensors&lt;/a&gt; it’s using, but we’ve seen very little of the cars in operation. Toyota was planning to offer a limited ride-hailing pilot in downtown Tokyo during the 2020 Summer Olympics, but that was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The automaker also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152817/toyota-pony-ai-self-driving-car-investment-valuation-china-silicon-valley"&gt;recently invested $400 million in Pony.ai&lt;/a&gt;, a self-driving startup based in the US and China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nk44VQ"&gt;Toyota has developed a self-driving software called “Chauffeur,” which ironically was also the codename for Google’s self-driving project under Chris Urmson, now the CEO of Aurora. Toyota has a second product called “Guardian,” which is essentially an advanced driver-assist system akin to Tesla’s Autopilot. Neither is being offered in any production car today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UZj2d"&gt;Toyota Research Institute, the automaker’s Silicon Valley-based division, has been conducting tests at its Ottawa Lake, Michigan, closed-course facility for a number of years. In 2018, Toyota agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17787878/toyota-uber-investment-self-driving-car-research"&gt;invest $500 million in a joint self-driving project with Uber&lt;/a&gt;, but that investment is now moot as Aurora owns what’s left of Uber’s AV division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZC9Ogg"&gt;Last year, Toyota broke ground on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21052324/toyota-woven-city-japan-bjarke-ingels-ces-2020"&gt;“Woven City,”&lt;/a&gt; the 175-acre site of a former car factory in Japan. The automaker hopes to transform it into a “prototype city of the future” where it can test autonomous vehicles, innovative street design, smart home technology, robotics, and new mobility products on a population of real people who would live there full time.&lt;/p&gt;
