    <title>Amazon lifts mask mandates for vaccinated warehouse employees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DorCkQZ_w0aKiUmS-MTbCZvLBl4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70076244/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zYHYlj"&gt;Amazon is lifting its mask mandate for fully vaccinated warehouse workers in the US (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/amazon-lifts-mask-mandate-for-fully-vaccinated-warehouse-workers.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company reportedly sent out a notice to operations employees, stating that vaccinated workers are no longer required to wear masks starting November 2nd. Masks will still be required if state or local laws mandate them, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ifiLFn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon will continue to evaluate its COVID-19 safety measures&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HkMh1d"&gt;“Vaccines are universally available across the US, and vaccination rates continue to rise, which enables the ability to return to our previous mask policy,” the notice reads (via &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;). An Amazon spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the company will be lifting its mask mandates for vaccinated employees and emphasized that Amazon will continue to evaluate its COVID-19 safety measures, adjusting its guidelines with advice from public health officials and medical experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8COEp"&gt;In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613542/amazon-warehouse-mask-mandate"&gt;Amazon reinstated its mask mandate policy&lt;/a&gt; for both vaccinated and unvaccinated employees in response to an uptick in COVID-19 cases. This came shortly after &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/19/amazon-says-vaccinated-workers-can-ditch-masks-starting-next-week.html"&gt;Amazon stopped requiring facial coverings for vaccinated workers&lt;/a&gt; in May. It appears that Amazon is slowly relaxing its safety guidelines for workers as vaccines become available to nearly everyone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22734765/fda-covid-vaccine-5-11-year-old-approve"&gt;including children&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22584386/amazon-end-onsite-covid-19-testing-us-warehouses"&gt;discontinued its onsite COVID-19 testing&lt;/a&gt; in July, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611439/amazon-office-employees-postpone-back-to-work-january-2022"&gt;corporate workers will return to the office in early 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US Treasury says stablecoins should be regulated like banks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ay8YmDoA_-IsHt6ZgilHHS2IHCk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70076240/acastro_170726_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RbMeje"&gt;The US Treasury Department is urging Congress to pass legislation that would require stablecoins to be issued by banks subject to federal banking laws in a &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; (.pdf) from the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, a panel headed by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6K485l"&gt;The report recommends legislation that would guard against stablecoin runs, address concerns about payment system risk, and address additional concerns about systemic risk and economic concentration of power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xlSy3"&gt;A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency typically backed by a fiat currency like the US dollar or the Euro, though it may also be backed by a basket of investments; the “stable” part comes from how the coin is pegged to its backing. Stablecoins are used mainly as payment vehicles and don’t fluctuate wildly in value — or at least, they’re not supposed to. The new report says the market cap for the most popular stablecoins has grown by more than 500 percent over the past year, to $127 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00DImh"&gt;“The rapid growth of stablecoins increases the urgency of this work,” the Treasury Department said in &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0456"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lCacdd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Tether controversy, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vUKi9U"&gt;In the report, the working group lays out some of the risks that it says stablecoins could present to the economy or to individual crypto investors. A number of scenarios could lead to a “run” on stablecoins, where holders tried to redeem them en masse because they’re worried about the currency’s viability. For instance, If a stablecoin issuer didn’t honor a request to redeem it, or if users lost confidence in the stablecoin issuer’s ability to redeem them, this could lead to a run. “Runs could spread contagiously from one stablecoin to another, or to other types of financial institutions that are believed to have a similar risk profile,” the report states, and could pose risks to the broader financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LGfJi6"&gt;The solution? Only banks should issue stablecoins. Plus, anyone providing custodial cryptocurrency wallets should be “subject to appropriate federal oversight.” Failure to act would place a lot of people at risk, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUN2jx"&gt;If Congress doesn’t act, the working group recommended that the Treasury Department’s &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-markets-financial-institutions-and-fiscal-service/fsoc"&gt;Financial Stability Oversight Council&lt;/a&gt; take steps to designate some stablecoin activities as systemic risks, which could subject them to further federal scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XM767c"&gt;In October, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728253/tether-41-million-misleading-statements-fiat-currency-bitfinex-cftc"&gt;(CFTC) fined the issuer of the Tether stablecoin $41 million&lt;/a&gt; for making misleading statements between June 2016 and February 2019, falsely claiming its stablecoins were fully backed by fiat currencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqeZe1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch’s new Animals livestream category may give you that fuzzy feeling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CeLYm9iJNXl46lisRhykmdn2IDc=/0x0:2028x1352/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70076101/Screen_Shot_2021_11_01_at_12.57.18.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M6kbj6"&gt;Twitch is giving streamers who focus on furry friends a place to group their streams with its new &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Animals%2C%20Aquariums%2C%20and%20Zoos"&gt;Animals, Aquariums, and Zoos category&lt;/a&gt;, which may just end up being the greatest page on the internet. The &lt;a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/11/01/animal-week-is-very-good-yes-it-is/?utm_referrer=https://t.co/"&gt;company says&lt;/a&gt; that the category, launched as part of its Animal Week, is meant to bring together a bunch of streams from zoos, conservation projects, and animal owners that had been spread out over the site, making it easier for people to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHuI8X"&gt;If you’re looking for something relaxing, the category makes it pretty easy to find. As I write this, the category’s page features a &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/wolfconservationcenter"&gt;New York wolf conservancy’s den livestream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/marinemammalrescue"&gt;video from an otter enclosure&lt;/a&gt;, and a stream from the Monterey Bay Aquarium &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/montereyaq"&gt;that features a beautiful oceanside view&lt;/a&gt; (though at the moment it’s more ASMR than animal). There’s also a stream that promises to feature squirrels eating during the day and raccoons eating at night. What I’m saying is that if my browser locked onto this page and wouldn’t let me do anything else on the internet, I don’t think I’d mind one bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ye3JQP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Please internet: do not overfeed the ducks or overstimulate the turtles.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="muw7eK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/11/01/animal-week-is-very-good-yes-it-is/?utm_referrer=https://t.co/"&gt;In its announcement post&lt;/a&gt;, Twitch says that some creators even have interactive animal streams — a farm that livestreams its ducks will let you feed them if you donate bits (a Twitch virtual token), and a turtle streamer will let you change the lights, according to the company. Hopefully there’s some limit on how often the lights and music can be changed, or how much duck food will be given out over a certain period. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PBWkfFNgjPoBWf8hJquwyYL_b2U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977377/Screen_Shot_2021_11_01_at_13.05.52.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Livestream: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.twitch.tv/marinemammalrescue" target="_blank"&gt;MarineMammalRescue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, let me watch the water ferrets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3364Ax"&gt;Hopefully, having a dedicated category will help bring more attention to organizations working on conservation and to creators who are encouraging their audiences to donate to those causes (while rewarding them with endless Animal Content™). There’s been a lot of bad news around Twitch recently, between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712250/twitch-hack-leak-data-streamer-revenue-steam-competitor"&gt;a hack that leaked its source code&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650578/twitch-streamers-walkout-protest-hate-raids"&gt;hateful raids against marginalized streamers&lt;/a&gt;, but hopefully the platform will be able to keep this one corner of the internet a pleasant place — we could really use some more of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4fahAi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook verified a fan page posing as Elon Musk</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iRZmeqltur1Y8BtOyqPo3Pp8F8A=/35x0:875x560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70075819/Screen_Shot_2021_11_01_at_11.10.57_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the fan page verified as Elon Musk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aDcqSQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElonMuskoffici"&gt;A Facebook fan page for Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; with 153,000 followers has been verified as the official page representing the Tesla Technoking — in violation of Facebook’s own rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hs9FT9"&gt;To be clear, the page isn’t&lt;em&gt; pretending&lt;/em&gt; it’s Musk; it &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElonMuskoffici/about_details"&gt;openly states&lt;/a&gt; that it’s a fan page in its About section (emphasis ours):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="XdKsQi"&gt;Musk owns a Tesla Roadster car 0001 (the first one off the production line) from Tesla Motors, a company in which he is an early investor. The Roadster is a battery electric sportscar with a 220 mile range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vNS90"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a fanpage, uploading tweets etc from him&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BALMNiWjSt8SNj0UUxMzIjP5DTA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977005/Screen_Shot_2021_11_01_at_11.10.57_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here is the page’s description, which states it’s a fan page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5IxROW"&gt;There are only 10 posts on the page, with the earliest dating from October 21st. One is a photo of Musk, one is a notification that the page updated its profile picture to be one featuring Musk, and the others look to be reposts of recent tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QSBPB"&gt;The page didn’t start as a fan page for Elon Musk. The &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElonMuskoffici/about_profile_transparency"&gt;Page Transparency&lt;/a&gt; tab — which shows some history of the page, who it is managed by, and whether it runs ads — says the page was created on July 28th, 2019 to represent a “Kizito Gavin,” which is the reversed name of &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gavin+kizito&amp;amp;sxsrf=AOaemvLL_yUSow0dBngTpDo-xCxLByLbUQ:1635794566290&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=nws&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiN6LHQ8ffzAhUCIjQIHRKJDxMQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;amp;biw=1824&amp;amp;bih=860&amp;amp;dpr=1.58"&gt;soccer player Gavin Kizito&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67PMQq"&gt;The page has since changed its name six times, all in 2021, most recently changing to Elon Musk twice (somehow) on October 17th. The Page Transparency section also says that the people who manage the page are based in Egypt. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163805/elon-musk-texas-moved-california-tesla-spacex"&gt;Musk lives in Texas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sVtwWgPbGruz8ne3XvUQc-eb9Z4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977015/Screen_Shot_2021_11_01_at_11.36.04_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The page started as one for Kizito Gavin, but now apparently is the official one for Elon Musk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zrsxSh"&gt;Also maybe worth noting: the URL for the page cuts off the end of the word “official” — &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElonMuskoffici"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/ElonMuskoffici&lt;/a&gt; — which doesn’t seem very official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HoUEq5"&gt;It’s unclear when the page was verified. Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1288173394636262"&gt;verification rules&lt;/a&gt; state that the company has “confirmed that the Page or profile is the authentic presence of the public figure or brand it represents.” To be verified on Facebook, you have to fill out &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/295038365360854"&gt;a form&lt;/a&gt; that requires, among other things, that the submitter share official identification in the form of a driver’s license, passport, national identification card, tax filing, recent utility bill, or articles of incorporation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OupVAn"&gt;Verification is a challenge for big social media platforms. Twitter has also struggled with the problem. It paused its verification program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16628290/twitter-jason-kessler-charlottesville-verification"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt; and relaunched it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22435770/twitter-public-verification-program-launch-2021-pronouns-profile"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The relaunch has been somewhat bumpy, though, and the company admitted in July that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575025/twitter-verified-fake-accounts-botnet-researcher"&gt;it mistakenly verified&lt;/a&gt; a small number of fake accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYbQuG"&gt;Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 and Xbox Series X are now available at Walmart (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LIV5Tj6iVDIqYuSz-Hj4pHWRF4Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70075550/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WCirms"&gt;Walmart’s latest PS5 and Xbox Series X restocking event appears to be over. All of the three consoles link to dead pages, so we’ll take that as a good indicator that it’s wrapped up. We’ll be keeping a look out for other restocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAJ2nb"&gt;We originally thought that Walmart was going to just open up the floodgates and let people buy them, but shortly after the consoles went up, we noticed that Walmart has incorporated a new queueing system. If you load one of these pages, you’ll get a place in line, and you can keep browsing Walmart’s site as a timer runs down to let you purchase a console, assuming there’s still stock left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeYksO"&gt;This should remove the urgency from having to add or update your billing and shipping info in a flash, but you should do that as you wait. Anything you can do ahead of time to reduce the friction and decrease the times it takes at checkout is worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMUBuy"&gt;Starting first with the consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wp20Qz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="grcrxs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="gdCyAD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LH4Kwf"&gt;The consoles may be the main course, but don’t forget to order some extra sides for when you have company over. Here are a few accessories to consider for both consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lLE0CZ"&gt;For PlayStation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="kfhO60"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499071"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="l3UtFF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420564"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="GELg3N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T46xYf"&gt;For Xbox&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Google says Pixel 6 Pro ghostly display flickers will be fixed in December</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xxFlidycoFENd379h9rz9zME3aA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70075607/akrales_211020_4802_0600.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ypeo0W"&gt;Google says it’ll fix the ghostly screen flickering that &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pixel6/comments/qh05x5/display_flickering_when_pressing_start_button/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share"&gt;some users have reported seeing&lt;/a&gt; when pressing the Pixel 6 Pro’s power button while the phone is completely powered down (&lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6-screen-flickering-issues"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). From most reports, the flickers don’t happen when just the screen is off, like it would be if the phone was sleeping, though &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/qhc1hp/weird_display_issue_with_p6p_that_many_owners_are/hic1isl/"&gt;at least one person says&lt;/a&gt; that it’s happened while the phone was on and in use. Google describes the issue as occurring when the power button is pushed “with slight pressure but not enough to turn [the Pixel 6 Pro] on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9TbhN"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/133351387/pixel-6-pro-display-residual-light?hl=en"&gt;a support document for the issue&lt;/a&gt;, Google says the fix is coming in a December software update and that you can avoid it by not pressing the power button when the phone’s powered down. While that could be read as a bit of a “you’re holding it wrong” instruction, it’s a bit hard to imagine why you’d need to repeatedly press the power button while the phone’s off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dEvbsy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The fix will be done in software, according to Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2Ugdoj"&gt;Google specifically says in its support document that the issue doesn’t mean the phone has a hardware flaw. That’s good news because previous Google phones, like the Pixel 2 XL, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/18/16489756/google-pixel-2xl-awful-lg-oled-screen"&gt;had weird screen issues throughout their entire lives&lt;/a&gt; — that shouldn’t be the case with the 6 Pro if the issue is fixable in software. While it’s not likely that most owners would’ve run into the “transient display artifacts,” as Google puts it, it’s still nice to see that it’s getting fixed and should help those who use their phone’s buttons as fidget toys to have a less annoying experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tB8cRJ"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok’s Fire TV app is available in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JEF6YG0QAUmWpB4cmfLlivTKqLA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70075552/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iWrLII"&gt;TikTok is making its way to Fire TVs in the US and Canada, &lt;a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/tiktok-now-available-on-amazon-fire-tv-in-u-s-and-canada-afc62bf2977d"&gt;according to a blog post from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This comes just four months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573707/tiktok-fire-tv-app-uk-france-germany-smart-tv"&gt;TikTok launched a Fire TV app in the UK, France, and Germany&lt;/a&gt; — a TikTok representative confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the US version is the same. Once you download TikTok from the Amazon Appstore, you can open the app by simply saying, “Alexa, open TikTok.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hmw4pG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aIPRWeVufv4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gzKjiQ"&gt;Unlike the existing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357300/tiktok-amazon-fire-tv-app-launch-free-tv-mobile"&gt;More on TikTok Fire TV app&lt;/a&gt;, which limited viewing to a curated selection of videos, this newly launched app functions just like TikTok on mobile. You can sign in or create an account and begin exploring the For You, Following, and the Discover pages just as you normally would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2FaEU"&gt;The app has an AutoPlay feature that allows you to play a continuous stream of videos. You can even use your voice to control videos and use commands like “play” and “pause” with the Alexa Voice Remote. Amazon also notes that the TikTok app is “coming soon” to Echo Show devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fqwv2j"&gt;The Fire TV isn’t the only smart TV that you can watch TikTok on, but it’s the only one in the US — up until now, TikTok was only available as an app for smart TVs in Europe. Last December, TikTok rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174064/tiktok-tv-app-samsung-uk-fire-amazon"&gt;an app for Samsung smart TVs in Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264642/tiktok-android-tv-launch-not-working-google"&gt;later announced its rollout on Android TVs&lt;/a&gt; in the UK, France, and Germany. Just this October, TikTok said that it’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22716017/tiktok-lg-webos-smart-tv-app-2020-2021-2019"&gt;coming to LG’s newer smart TV models&lt;/a&gt; in the UK, France, and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Project Kuiper hopes to launch first two prototype satellites in late 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_5nFHBqyGRG2GLVVmosLJYr-UVk=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70075040/Kuiper_ABL_Wide_291021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of ABL Space System’ RS1 rocket with Amazon’s prototype satellites on board&lt;/em&gt; | Image: ABL Space Systems&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G1m4x9"&gt;Amazon’s ambitious satellite-internet project, Project Kuiper, aims to launch its first two prototype satellites in the fourth quarter of 2022, &lt;a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=285359&amp;amp;x="&gt;according to an experimental launch license&lt;/a&gt; the company filed with the Federal Communications Commission today. Called KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2, the two prototypes are supposed to launch on an experimental new rocket called the RS1, currently being developed by startup ABL Space Systems based in El Segundo, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onMjAC"&gt;Kuiper’s goal is to launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348768/fcc-amazon-kuiper-satellite-constellation-approval"&gt;a giant constellation of up to 3,236 satellites&lt;/a&gt; into low Earth orbit over the next decade in order to provide low-latency broadband internet coverage to the surface below. The plan is to serve rural communities and other areas where it’s difficult to provide infrastructure for traditional internet services. It’s a similar concept to that of Starlink, SpaceX’s broadband internet satellite constellation, which proposes sending nearly 12,000 into low orbit around Earth. But unlike Kuiper, Spacex has actually launched more than 1,700 of its satellites and even created a beta program for hundreds of users. Kuiper has yet to launch any satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BRLOff"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the Amazon subsidiary seems almost ready to get started&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="csVr14"&gt;Now, the Amazon subsidiary seems almost ready to get started. Last week, the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thesheetztweetz/status/1453061006293360651?s=20"&gt;showed off testing of the thrusters&lt;/a&gt; the satellites will use to maneuver through space. And Kuiper claims that these first prototypes will allow the company to test out the same “communication and networking technology” that will be included in the finalized satellites. The two prototypes will operate at 366 miles, or 590 kilometers, above Earth. KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2 will house plenty of the same technology needed for the final constellation, including antennas, modems, and power and propulsion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BBi4hyM7sZvmyo_fXeXRdflOBww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22975835/KuiperSat_Test_Sequence__1920x1080p.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Project Kuiper&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An infographic explaining how the testing will work when the satellites are in space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RiLr2D"&gt;While in space, the satellites will be used to test out their ability to connect with four of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178235/amazon-project-kuiper-user-terminal-antenna-internet-satellite-constellation"&gt;Kuiper’s user terminals&lt;/a&gt; and a ground station in McCulloch, Texas, designed to send and receive broadband signals from the spacecraft. The entire test sequence is set to last just 10 minutes as each satellite passes overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xVuahR"&gt;“There is no substitute for on-orbit testing, and we expect to learn a lot given the complexity and risk of operating in such a challenging environment,” Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology for Project Kuiper, said in a statement. “We can’t wait to get started.” So far, Kuiper says it has done some testing on the ground with its user terminals, claiming to get maximum throughput speeds of up to 400 Mbps. Starlink’s beta program touts download speeds up to 100 Mbps and 200 Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vrltPr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Kuiper’s choice to fly its first two prototypes on ABL’s RS1 rocket is an unexpected one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OBQHUy"&gt;Kuiper’s choice to fly its first two prototypes on ABL’s RS1 rocket is an unexpected one. In April, the company announced that it had purchased &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391508/amazon-ula-rocket-launches-internet-satellites-kuiper"&gt;nine flights of the United Launch Alliance’s workhorse Atlas V rocket&lt;/a&gt; in order to launch batches of Kuiper satellites. Meanwhile, ABL has yet to actually launch one of its rockets. The company says it’s aiming to conduct its &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/abl-space-systems-raises-200-million/"&gt;first test launch with the RS1 before the end of the year out of Alaska&lt;/a&gt;. Kuiper says it’s been “impressed by ABL’s unique capabilities, rapid development progress, and dedication to customers,” &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/project-kuiper-announces-plans-and-launch-provider-for-prototype-satellites"&gt;according to a blog post published today&lt;/a&gt;. ABL’s RS1 rocket will have the capability to launch &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/rocket-builder-abl-space-raises-200-million-at-2point4-billion-valuation.html"&gt;roughly 1.5 tons of payload to low Earth orbit at approximately $12 million per flight&lt;/a&gt;, which Kuiper claims is the “right capacity and cost-efficiency to support our mission profile.” An Amazon spokesperson confirmed that the smaller RS1 is more appropriate for the launch of two satellites, while Kuiper plans to use the Atlas V rockets to deploy the full constellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MuBLiB"&gt;Along with today’s news, Kuiper is also trying to reassure the space community that the company will attempt to mitigate any harmful effects of its satellites. One big criticism of proposed mega-constellations like Kuiper and Starlink is that they will lead to a much more crowded environment in low Earth orbit, increasing the likelihood of in-space collisions and making it more difficult to launch satellites in the future. Kuiper says it will take its prototype satellites out of orbit when it’s done testing them by plunging them into Earth’s atmosphere, where they’ll burn up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NOf52W"&gt;Kuiper also says it’s been “working with astronomers and others in the industry to reduce the visibility of Kuiper System satellites.” Astronomers have raised concerns about the rise of satellite mega-constellations, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21190273/spacex-starlink-satellite-internet-constellation-astronomy-coating"&gt;as the influx of bright satellites will lead to more disruption of observations of the night sky&lt;/a&gt;. To help dampen the brightness of its satellites, Kuiper is including a sunshade on one of the two prototypes to lessen its ability to reflect light from the Sun. “We will collect data to compare reflectivity between the two spacecraft and share any learnings with the astronomy community following the mission,” Kuiper wrote in its blog post. SpaceX has also launched &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/foust-forward-the-sky-isnt-falling-yet/"&gt;more than 1,000 of its satellites with sunshades&lt;/a&gt;, or visors, to dampen their brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZp4mh"&gt;This latest announcement from Kuiper comes a week after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22745637/amazon-kuiper-satellite-constellation-verizon-partnership-5g-cellular-backhaul"&gt;announced a partnership with Verizon&lt;/a&gt; to expand the carrier’s 4G / LTE and 5G coverage to more underserved areas. Such a deal relies on Kuiper launching its satellites first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2uFyWj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat’s deal with NBCUniversal brings audio from The Office, SNL, Shrek, and more to your snaps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Snapchat NBCUniversal sounds" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nL48rfnGotXLbKDc0hrVJu9mLlc=/301x0:3540x2159/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70074592/Snapchat_Sounds_x_NBCU.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NfThNe"&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/nbcuniversal-sounds"&gt;Snapchat’s newly signed deal with NBCUniversal&lt;/a&gt; will bring audio from &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bridesmaids&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parks and Recreation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;, and more to the platform (via &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/snapchat-nbcuniversal-audio-snl-1235039596/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Users can add the audio clips to their snaps — just like TikTok — and then send them to their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y16p5l"&gt;Anyone who receives a clip with audio from an NBC title can swipe up to view more information about the content. Tapping the Play This Sound button will show users which streaming services they can use to watch the show or movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2VzER"&gt;Ben Schwerin, Snapchat’s senior vice president of content and partnerships, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;: “NBCUniversal has an iconic catalog and we know Snapchatters will love adding quotes from their favorite movies and series to their Snaps to help perfectly express the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LYAsM"&gt;In October of last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21516348/snapchat-snap-sounds-music-ios-update"&gt;Snapchat signed deals with Warner Music Group&lt;/a&gt;, Universal Music Publishing Group, Warner Chappell Music, and more, allowing users to add music to their snaps. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;The platform also rolled out a TikTok-like feature called Spotlight&lt;/a&gt;, which lets users view a vertical stream of short videos. In addition to paying users for creating the most popular Spotlight clips, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711632/snapchat-spotlight-challenges-announced-cash-prizes-tiktok"&gt;Snapchat also entices creators by adding “challenges” that reward users&lt;/a&gt; who apply select Lenses, participate in certain activities, and use specific sounds in their Spotlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFfH8L"&gt;Snapchat’s move to expand its audio offerings is likely in response to TikTok’s growing popularity — as of 2021, TikTok has &lt;a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tik-tok-statistics/"&gt;1 billion users&lt;/a&gt;, compared to Snapchat’s user base of just &lt;a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/snapchat-statistics/"&gt;293 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YF9Noi"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is also an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla is letting non-Tesla EVs use its Supercharger network for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FiMXAILIt9krzaqDM4XH8AllXPs=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70074590/akrales_160419_1019_A_0257.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TedA5q"&gt;Tesla launched a pilot project in the Netherlands this week in which non-Tesla electric vehicles will be allowed to use its Supercharger network, representing the first time that the automaker is opening up its proprietary charging stations to EVs from other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BOuMtv"&gt;Tesla’s Supercharger network is often held up as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419150/ev-charging-us-joe-biden-infrastructure-plan"&gt;best possible example of an EV charging network&lt;/a&gt;: fast, reliable, and plentiful. But Tesla’s network is also exclusive to Tesla owners, meaning someone driving a Volkswagen or Ford EV wouldn’t be able to use it. But that’s now starting to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDaUVr"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk has, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/21/elon-musk-tesla-superchargers-being-used-low-key-other-automakers/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/21/elon-musk-tesla-superchargers-being-used-low-key-other-automakers/"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;, talked about opening up his company’s vast Supercharger network to other electric vehicles. And over this past summer, he started revealing key details about how it would actually work. Now the company is ready to start the process &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/non-tesla-supercharging"&gt;by announcing its first pilot project&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="07ViCR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Tesla will open up its Superchargers to other EVs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22596337/tesla-supercharger-elon-musk-open-network-charging-stations"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BM4ItG"&gt;Initially, only 10 Supercharger stations in the Netherlands will be available to non-Tesla EVs. Vehicle owners will need to download the most recent version of Tesla’s smartphone app (version 4.2.3 or higher) in order to access the stations. After downloading the app, customers will be prompted to select “Charge Your Non-Tesla” in order to find the closest participating Supercharger site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hWmk87"&gt;Tesla owners can still use the stations just as normal. “We will be closely monitoring each site for congestion and listening to customers about their experiences,” the company said in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gw5rEW"&gt;The selection of the Netherlands as the pilot project’s starting location isn’t surprising. Tesla CEO Elon Musk previously indicated the experiment would likely start in Europe, where standardized charging cable connectors are mandatory. Other European countries will likely follow before the company opens up its Superchargers in the US. (Tesla has already committed to &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/24/tesla-confirms-plan-open-supercharger-network-other-automakers-next-year/"&gt;opening up the network in Norway&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qZbyNz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The selection of the Netherlands as the pilot project’s starting location isn’t surprising&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LIftvv"&gt;Tesla uses a proprietary connector in North America, so non-Tesla vehicles here will need an adapter in order to access the company’s Superchargers, of which there are over 6,400 plugs in the US, &lt;a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC&amp;amp;ev_connectors=TESLA"&gt;according to the Department of Energy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPKycg"&gt;“It’s always been our ambition to open the Supercharger network to Non-Tesla EVs and, by doing so, encourage more drivers to go electric,” the company said. “This move directly supports our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KlnIzw"&gt;There’s still a lot of pieces that need to fall into place before Superchargers across the globe become available to non-Tesla owners, especially with regard to how much other automakers are willing to spend on adapters for their customers. But the pilot in the Netherlands is an indication that the ball is finally rolling on a key piece in Musk’s stated plans to spur a revolution in EV adoption. &lt;/p&gt;
