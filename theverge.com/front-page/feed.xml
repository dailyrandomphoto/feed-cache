    <title>Twitter wants to settle with angry investors for $809 million</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SB52Kl"&gt;Twitter said Monday it is proposing an $809.5 million settlement for a 2016 securities class action lawsuit that alleged the company misled investors about its user engagement figures. The complaint alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/twitter-announces-proposed-settlement-of-consolidated-class-action-lawsuit-301380355.html"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter said it expects to use cash on hand to pay the settlement amount likely in its fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0WzvZ"&gt;The lawsuit alleged that Twitter provided misleading information to investors about growth metrics to make the company appear financially healthier than it was. The complaint points to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2014/11/12/why-twitters-stock-soared-75-on-analyst-day.html"&gt;2014 event Twitter held&lt;/a&gt; with financial analysts where the company provided “unrealistic” growth projections that called for its monthly active users (MAU) “to double to over 550 million users and for revenue to grow by $4.6 billion by 2018.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ET6h2t"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864148/frankel_twittershareholderclassaction__complaint.pdf"&gt;The complaint alleges&lt;/a&gt; Twitter embarked on a “shell game” where it tried to conceal its user engagement from investors; as user engagement was considered a key driver of MAU growth. “[H]ad Defendants provided investors with complete and accurate information regarding user engagement, investors would have learned that Twitter’s MAU growth— and with it, the Company’s ability to increase revenue — had also stalled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQ6VLy"&gt;Twitter stopped reporting its primary user engagement metric— timeline views— in 2014 according to the suit, a practice that made it harder for analysts and investors to track the company’s growth. Timeline views were tallied each time a user visited Twitter and refreshed their timeline to view more tweets, or to conduct a search. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-shares-fall-day-after-report-revives-questions-about-user-base-1438213551"&gt;Twitter said at the time&lt;/a&gt; that the metric had become irrelevant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSxYOj"&gt;Instead, it began including what the complaint called “low-quality growth” metrics, including sending automated messages to dormant users to encourage them to log in, so Twitter could include them as an “active” user. This practice was outlined by reporter Nick Bilton in a 2016 &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/twitter-is-betting-everything-on-jack-dorsey"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; article, where he said Twitter had done what many startups did when they needed to “goose” numbers: “they kind of faked it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NWBM8"&gt;It also caught the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which asked Twitter in April 2015 —after the company made its annual securities filing— if it planned to provide “alternative metrics” to try to “explain trends in user engagement and advertising services.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvmZev"&gt;According to a report from the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-DGB-43153"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the time, Twitter told the SEC it had started to disclose how often users took an action in response to an ad, and how much its advertisers paid for that information. The SEC dropped its inquiry after this reply, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhPUXs"&gt;Under the terms of Monday’s proposed settlement, Twitter denies any wrongdoing or other improper action. The final agreement is subject to court approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vA4N6W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Extreme heat prompts new rules to protect US workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="California’s Summer Of Heat, Power And Fire Woes Arrives Early" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OjSvUhXxhlC4-p5-3xvw2yHG5HY=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882980/1233521611.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6QHHYu"&gt;Extreme heat is becoming such a big threat to workers in the US that the federal government plans to craft a new federal standard for workplaces, the Biden administration announced today. It’s part of a broader initiative to protect workers and people living in the places most vulnerable to heat-related illness and death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jtr6dt"&gt;“Over the past few weeks, I have traveled across the country to see firsthand the devastating human and economic toll of extreme weather &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;exacerbated by climate change&lt;/a&gt;,” Joe Biden said in a statement today. “And while we have all seen the graphic and heart-wrenching images of super-storms, wildfires, and floods in recent weeks, another climate disaster is lurking just below the radar: extreme heat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3OdPwJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Another climate disaster is lurking just below the radar: extreme heat.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IpYcSi"&gt;The Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) will start the rulemaking process today to create a new federal heat standard. There aren’t many details yet on what the rule might look like, but the Biden administration’s announcement hints at a few things it could cover: thresholds for heat stress, heat exposure monitoring, and planning for acclimating to heat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoOGbg"&gt;OSHA also plans to beef up enforcement of existing labor standards when it comes to heat-related hazards. When the heat index — a measure that includes humidity and temperature — rises above 80 degrees Fahrenheit, the agency says it will “prioritize” heat-related issues when it comes to workplace inspections and interventions. It also plans to pay closer attention to industries it deems as having a higher risk of heat stress, including agriculture, construction, delivery workers, and warehouses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmYHOC"&gt;Protecting workers from dangerously hot environments is just one piece of a broader effort &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597823/extreme-heat-democrat-infrastructure-budget-reconciliation"&gt;among Democrats&lt;/a&gt; to tackle an insidious threat that’s only growing worse. Heat kills an average of 702 people every year &lt;a href="https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/Applications/heatTracker/"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, making it the deadliest weather-related disaster in the nation over the &lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/hazstat/"&gt;past three decades&lt;/a&gt;.  Outside of the workplace, children and the elderly, who have a harder time regulating their body temperatures, are especially vulnerable. Black Americans are also 40 to 59 percent more likely to live in the places likely to see the biggest jump in extreme heat related-deaths in the future, a recent &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-report-shows-disproportionate-impacts-climate-change-socially-vulnerable"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by the Environmental Protection Agency found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtFD7d"&gt;Heatwaves are becoming even more intense as climate change pushes up global average temperatures. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22559961/heat-roads-washington-oregon-climate-infrastructure"&gt;road-buckling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602208/june-heatwave-most-extreme-summer-record-north-america"&gt;heatwave&lt;/a&gt; in the Pacific Northwest this year would have been “virtually impossible” without climate change, &lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; found. The country just had its hottest summer on record, &lt;a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/national-climate-202108"&gt;tying a record&lt;/a&gt; set during the infamous 1936 dust bowl. Globally, July was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623843/july-2021-hottest-month-recorded"&gt;hottest mont&lt;/a&gt;h humans have ever recorded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IawErS"&gt;The Biden Administration also announced efforts to turn more schools across the nation into cooling centers, places where nearby residents can find some reprieve during heatwaves. And a program designed to help low-income Americans pay their energy bills will expand to help more people get air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 will give doctors a window into Apple Health app data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Saxony Struggles With Covid-19 Infection Rates That Are Germany’s Highest" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/luP1bOpS4PD_QA1cqpQYRrS4ko0=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882756/1296121438.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ViFomt"&gt;With the iOS 15 launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;today&lt;/a&gt;, some iPhone users will have the option to share data from their Health app directly with their doctors through their electronic medical records. Six health record companies are participating in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526024/apple-health-app-data-medical-record-iphone-doctor-access"&gt;initial launch&lt;/a&gt;, and some of those companies say that doctors and medical practices on their systems are eager to start using the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvrvPU"&gt;People who use the option can use the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-personal-health-by-introducing-secure-sharing-and-new-insights/"&gt;new sharing function on the Health app&lt;/a&gt; to let their doctor see data like their heart rate and time spent exercising, as collected through the Health app. It could help physicians keep a closer eye on metrics that might be relevant to a patient’s health without the patient having to take an extra step to manually share the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyBDmD"&gt;Electronic health records company Cerner, which controls around &lt;a href="https://www.ehrinpractice.com/largest-ehr-vendors.html"&gt;a quarter&lt;/a&gt; of the records market, is one of the companies in the launch. Right now, any healthcare organizations that use Cerner’s records have to balance time spent implementing new tools against time spent managing COVID-19 surges, Sam Lambson, vice president of interoperability at the company, said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. But they’re interested in the feature, he says. “Once our client organizations have seen a demo and understand it, the questions are mostly around how quickly they can get it implemented,” Lambson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4Hsbg"&gt;A small number of healthcare groups that use electronic health records through Allscripts, which is also part of the launch, have already been using the feature as part of a test phase, says Tina Joros, the company’s general manager and vice president. They’re able to use it with a select few patients. “They’ve got all of the technology in place, and when it’s available for patients, they can start promoting it out to their patient population,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1K61S"&gt;One of those test groups is especially excited about the new ability to see patient data from an at-home blood pressure monitor, Joros says. The physicians at that medical practice typically recommend a particular brand of blood pressure cuff to patients who they want to monitor between visits. That cuff already syncs with the Health app. So if patients chose to share the data, the doctors are able to directly track those blood pressure readings instead of relying on patients to share it more manually. “It really helps the data come full circle,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iy9AEG"&gt;Daniel Kivatinos, co-founder and chief operating officer of health records company DrChrono, says he’s heard similar feedback from health providers about the Health app feature. “One of our customers, the provider is excited that they’re going to be able to do remote patient monitoring,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IM28VC"&gt;While the data provided by wearable devices and other health apps can be useful, doctors often say they’re worried about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496813/apple-watch-heart-monitor-ekg-false-positive"&gt;information overload&lt;/a&gt;. Joros at Allscripts says the layout of the dashboard within Apple’s health record might help make the flood of information less overwhelming. The default is to give a general overview of the trends in a patient’s Health app. Doctors have the option to see more detail but don’t have to. “We had a good reaction both from our client testers and from our internal physician staff,” she says. “Both liked the way that those dashboards were laid out to help reduce that burden.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tTNShW"&gt;DrChrono plans to roll the Health app feature to a first set of initial users before expanding gradually to its full customer base, which includes around 4,000 medical practices. The company can track how often the feature is used, and Kivatinos says it plans to collect data on how many patients end up sharing their Health app information into the health record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVhV7h"&gt;Allscripts plans to collect similar data as well. The company will be able to see exactly how many patients use the feature, Joros says. She’s expecting the usage to gradually ramp up in the same way as the other Apple health records program, which launched in 2018 and lets patients pull data from their health records onto their iPhones. “We have seen the usage consistently go up,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Midnight Mass is more slow-burning horror from the creator of Hill House</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SwUUA0lKv3HbIwufVDHKgZhOJZw=/467x0:3134x1778/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882657/mm_103_sdr_co3_00180401R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSwqbc"&gt;Throughout the &lt;em&gt;Haunting&lt;/em&gt; anthology, creator Mike Flanagan has carved out a very particular brand of horror. Both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17911720/haunting-of-hill-house-review-netflix-shirley-jackson-mike-flanagan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hill House&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21508362/haunting-of-bly-manor-review-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bly Manor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are slow and methodical, with intricate stories that carefully weave together ghostly scares with family drama. Their small scope keeps them focused. Flanagan’s latest, &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt;, isn’t part of that anthology, though in many ways it feels like it is. It has the same patient build-up, the intense focus on family dynamics, and even some of the same cast. But &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; also increases the scope — and the scares. Instead of a single family home, its story encompasses a small fishing village, and instead of ghosts it’s more about monsters. It takes a bit to get going, but by the end it descends into pure and gruesome horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKslxy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; takes place on Crockett Island, colloquially known as Crock Pot, an isolated island with a population of just over a hundred residents. There are two important things to know about the island. First, it’s going through a steady decline years after an oil spill decimated the local fishing industry. Second, it’s a very religious place, with St. Patrick’s Church serving as the de facto center of town. At the outset of the show, the big island drama has to do with the aging local priest, who went on a pilgrimage and returned sick, and is now resting in a hospital on the mainland. A mysterious, young Father Paul (Hamish Linklater) arrives to temporarily take his place. Paul reinvigorates the island’s community, turning the church into the bustling, vibrant place it once was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9uweCs"&gt;Around the time he arrives, weird things start happening. One day, dozens of dead cats wash up on a beach. Later, a resident swears he saw the old priest going for a walk in the middle of a deadly storm. Stranger still are the miracles: aging residents start to regain their youth, and a young girl stands up from her wheelchair and walks in order to receive communion. All of these seemingly disparate developments are connected to the show’s big twist, which reveals itself about halfway through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SKxZUz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y-XIRcjf3l4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HbT4PN"&gt;Like most small town mysteries, &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; is an ensemble. The story starts out with Riley Flynn (Zach Gilford), a former altar boy who left the island, only to return after a stint in jail for a deadly DUI that continues to haunt him. He’s joined by childhood friend Erin Greene (Kate Siegel), who is similarly back on Crockett after a lifetime away from the island, now pregnant and living in her mother’s old house, while working her old job at the local school. There’s also the town sheriff Hassan (Rahul Kohli), a former NYPD officer and seemingly the only non-Christian on the island; Bev (Samantha Sloyan), the archetypal judgy religious type who helps run the church and guilts people into attending; town doctor Sarah (Annabeth Gish) who is struggling to explain what’s happening to her patients; and Riley’s parents (Henry Thomas and Kristin Lehman) who are just trying to keep it together as they take in their troubled adult son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bk4Fmh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Haunting of Bly Manor is a puzzle box disguised as a ghost story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21508362/haunting-of-bly-manor-review-netflix"},{"title":"Haunting of Hill House is like This Is Us wrapped in a gothic ghost story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17911720/haunting-of-hill-house-review-netflix-shirley-jackson-mike-flanagan"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zc4UPD"&gt;Even though there’s a lot to keep track of, you’ll get to know these characters intimately over the show’s seven episodes, because if there’s one thing the residents of Crockett love more than anything, it’s talking. A huge portion of &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt;’ run-time is dedicated to dialogue. You’ll hear long sermons from the new priest, intense and revelatory AA meetings, and too many childhood stories to count. Everyone seems to preface their thoughts with a monologue of some kind. The show is almost like a nesting doll of stories. It can border on overload at times, though it helps that the performances are uniformly great. As much as I wanted to see what happened next, I couldn’t help but get pulled into long, drawn-out speeches about death and the meaning of life. These moments also help set the tone. So much of the show is quiet and thoughtful, which makes the dark moments hit really hard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="midnight mass" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RYAgRZ7pEdZOa_8Vl4jyv1WP9Ec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863904/MMASS_101_Unit_04123RC.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Eike Schroter / Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BViZwf"&gt;And there are some &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; dark moments. In its first few episodes, &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; feels a lot like the &lt;em&gt;Haunting&lt;/em&gt; shows. There aren’t really jump scares or bloody kills. It’s the kind of horror that you watch through your fingers anticipating something terrible happening … only it rarely does. Eventually the show lets loose in a big, bloody way. It’s gradual — a few deaths here, some horrifying revelations there — but by the end &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; descends into full-blown horror. Like, we’re-on-the-run-because-we’re-all-gonna-die kind of horror. Gruesome-killfest-that-will-keep-you-up-at-night kind of horror. And it’s all the more horrifying because of how the show slowly ramps up, and how connected you feel to the main characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kk2knT"&gt;Perhaps the most remarkable thing about &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; is how it manages to balance those more contemplative elements of the &lt;em&gt;Haunting&lt;/em&gt; series — serious reflections on grief and guilt, faith and family — with more traditional horror elements. It doesn’t lose what made Flanagan’s past work so successful. Instead it twists it into something larger, more unsettling, and a whole lot scarier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwoW8F"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Midnight Mass &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;starts streaming on Netflix on September 24th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic’s high-fashion collaboration with Balenciaga in Fortnite includes a hoodie for a walking dog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZCO1qp6RpakOtM7Sc3qGQ_aPfL8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882491/18BR_Textile_UGC_Social_Store_front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s Doggo in a hoodie.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BYX8go"&gt;Epic Games is partnering with fashion house Balenciaga to bring the first-ever high-fashion &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skins into the game. But the two companies aren’t just working on virtual clothes. They’re also partnering on an in-game Balenciaga-themed hub and a real-world clothing line that you’ll be able to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEgp5H"&gt;There will be four new skins, which you can see in the below photo, and each will have alternate styles. Epic is also planning to sell other Balenciaga-themed accessories, including &lt;a href="https://www.balenciaga.com/en-us/men/shoes/speed"&gt;a pickaxe based on the Speed Sneaker&lt;/a&gt; and Balenciaga backpack back blings. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jtVxy7fjhqRGYAhhdsScQ1zA50k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858219/feed_FB_1920x1080.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The new Balenciaga-themed skins coming to &lt;/em&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TD1hPo"&gt;The new gear will be available both in in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; usual in-game storefront and in the Balenciaga-themed “Strange Times” Creative hub, which includes a virtual Balenciaga store where you can buy the cosmetics. Below is a preview of what that area looks like — there’s even an in-game animated billboard above the virtual store featuring the walking dog Doggo in the hoodie. That billboard will show up in the real world, too, in Tokyo, London, Seoul, and New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f7t15ZPyxr-2q0KUn1gDXcUjRvY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858262/body_img_FB_8__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Strange Times hub with a virtual Balenciaga store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ph5oY"&gt;And if you love the hoodie Doggo is wearing, you’ll be able to buy it and a number of other items, including crew neck shirts, T-shirts, and hats, as part of the real-world &lt;em&gt;Fortnite-&lt;/em&gt;themed Balenciaga collection. Those clothes will go on sale on Monday or Tuesday, depending on your location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1MVXUs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10762775"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zQShfR"&gt;Epic isn’t the first video game to collaborate with a fashion house. Gucci partnered with Roblox on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440134/gucci-garden-roblox-experience-metaverse-date"&gt;surreal virtual garden&lt;/a&gt; in May, for example, while Louis Vuitton made skins for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937187/league-of-legends-true-damage-hip-hop-group-kda-louis-vuitton"&gt;characters in Riot Games’ &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Balenciaga itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/26/21721371/balenciaga-afterworld-the-age-of-tomorrow-fashion-launch-video-game"&gt;made a video game&lt;/a&gt; to debut its Fall 2021 collection that was made in Unreal Engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYWvkl"&gt;But the pairing of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and high fashion is an obvious one given how important virtual outfits are to the culture of the game. “&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is fashion,” Adam Sussman, president of Epic Games, said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The entire experience of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is centered around self expression, player agency, and the ability to live out a fantasy of portraying characters and outfits that people want to wear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YYy5lo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Fortnite is fashion.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CZ3XBu"&gt;He has a point; when I play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, I’m constantly shuffling through different outfits and accessories to fit my mood or to create fun mashups. (Such as, say, having Master Chief wield Kratos’ Leviathan Axe while &lt;em&gt;The Madalorian’s&lt;/em&gt; Grogu floats behind him.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P756pC"&gt;The partnership between Epic and Balenciaga also could be a preview of how Unreal Engine is used to create virtual and real-world experiences in the future. That animated Doggo billboard that will appear in-game and in actual cities, for example, was made in Unreal Engine and reused assets created as part of Epic and Balenciaga’s collaboration. It seems likely that we’ll see Epic doing similar transmedia pushes for other &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; partnerships down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cO4YWE"&gt;Epic didn’t commit to if or when we might see other fashion collaborations, but it sounds like it’s definitely a possibility. “I think this is just the start,” said Emily Levy, who works on partnerships at Epic. “I think what’s really special about what we can do with our technology and with our community is create new ways for players to self-express [and] also new ways for players to experience fashion. I think you’re going to continue to see us explore what those two opportunities can look like for our community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCOH43"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hA1Uf7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UEHKoO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gq5gY6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DoorDash expands alcohol delivery to 20 states, Canada and Australia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/htIpR5tZtJ5GuCT34Kd5V4snmYM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882358/acastro_190724_1777_doordash_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;DoorDash is expanding its alcohol deliveries | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ovN7Np"&gt;Food delivery platform DoorDash said Monday it’s expanding its &lt;a href="https://get.doordash.com/en-us/business/alcohol"&gt;alcohol delivery&lt;/a&gt; service to 20 new states and the District of Columbia, Canada, and Australia, which it says will reach 100 million adults worldwide. Before the pandemic the company was only delivering in California and started expanding within the last six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hyAGkI"&gt;“Customers in select markets, where legally permissible, can toggle to the Alcohol tab of the DoorDash app to browse and safely order from a wide selection of drinks from restaurants, grocery stores, local retailers, and convenience stores,” the company said in a press release. DoorDash cited a&lt;a href="https://restaurant.org/downloads/pdfs/research/soi/2020-state-of-the-industry-factbook.pdf"&gt; 2020 study&lt;/a&gt; from the National Restaurant Association that found 56 percent of customers over 21 would order alcoholic beverages if offered as part of food delivery from a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ber9re"&gt;The feature is only available to customers 21 and older and requires ID verification: once at checkout, and again by the delivery driver at the door. DoorDash says it will blur out identifying information on users’ IDs except for the photo and date of birth, according to its &lt;a href="https://help.doordash.com/consumers/s/article/How-is-my-age-verified-for-alcohol-orders?language=en_US"&gt;customer support&lt;/a&gt; page. This means that customers won’t be able to have a totally contactless delivery if they order alcohol, and DoorDash encourages customers to wear masks when interacting with its drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObUHMM"&gt;During the height of the pandemic last year as many restaurants closed to in-person dining, some states, including New York, temporarily relaxed rules around alcohol delivery, providing many eateries with a needed revenue source. When then-Gov. Cuomo lifted the state of emergency in June of this year, the &lt;a href="https://ny.eater.com/2021/6/23/22547565/new-york-takeout-cocktail-program-ends-june-24"&gt;delivery of alcoholic beverages was also ended&lt;/a&gt;, to the chagrin of many restaurants.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQQeOX"&gt;But delivery services, even as they tangle with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666455/doordash-grubhub-uber-eats-sue-new-york-city-restaurant-fee-caps-lawsuit"&gt;state and local laws&lt;/a&gt; requiring them to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675517/doordash-sues-new-york-city-law-delivery-share-customer-data-restaurants"&gt;share information&lt;/a&gt; with restaurants and generally treat them more fairly, see alcohol delivery as a lucrative revenue stream. In February, DoorDash competitor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262155/uber-drizly-alcohol-delivery-service-eats-postmates"&gt;Uber Eats acquired alcohol delivery service Drizly&lt;/a&gt; in a deal worth $1.1 billion. That &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620267/uber-gopuff-ftc-investigation-drizly-delivery"&gt;deal has drawn scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; from the US Federal Trade Commission, however, which is apparently concerned the acquisition could hamper competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1WyNI"&gt;Also on Monday, DoorDash also announced partnerships with &lt;a href="http://Responsibility.org"&gt;Responsibility.org&lt;/a&gt;, a non-profit focused on eliminating drunk driving and underage drinking, and Students Against Drunk Driving (SADD), which is focused on the same issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="q6Ay2m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"DoorDash sues New York City over law that requires it to share customer data with restaurants","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675517/doordash-sues-new-york-city-law-delivery-share-customer-data-restaurants"},{"title":"DoorDash, Grubhub, and Uber Eats sue New York City over restaurant fee caps","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666455/doordash-grubhub-uber-eats-sue-new-york-city-restaurant-fee-caps-lawsuit"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="avx56Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 20th 9:51AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adds detail that contactless delivery isn’t available for alcohol orders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest Apple TV 4K is $30 off through Apple’s refurbished store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y7O1ofJuyglKiYYTycs426sVjZ4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882338/DSCF3875_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IKgChC"&gt;If you’ve been waiting on a deal for the latest Apple TV, which has a faster processor and includes the new Siri remote, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/694936/7613?subId1=VergeDeals092021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FFXH02LL%2FA%2Frefurbished-apple-tv-4k-64gb-2nd-generation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can save $30 on it by buying refurbished&lt;/a&gt; through Apple itself via &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15288430-apple-tv-4k-current-model-149-apple-certified-refurbished?src=frontpage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The 32GB model costs $149 (was $179) and the 64GB model is $169 (was $199), but supplies are likely limited. While buying refurbished usually comes with a few words of caution, Apple’s refurbished program ensures that products are in brand-new condition, with a full one-year manufacturer warranty. It even supports AppleCare, so you can extend the warranty if you’d like. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22454960/apple-tv-4k-2021-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SfISDS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10762987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="QmY4C3"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Galaxy Buds Pro Review: semi-pro|100099" data-volume-uuid="15b8c43b5" data-volume-id="100099" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-152" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LMlZAR"&gt;Another great deal comes from Woot, where you can find the best price yet for Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro wireless earbuds. These debuted earlier this year for $200, &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13142092?sid=VergeDeals&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds-pro-wireless-earbuds-10%3Fref%3Dw_gw_dd_2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but you can get them for $135 right now in silver or black&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike some other Woot deals on Samsung earbuds, these come with a one-year warranty. According to Chris Welch, who reviewed them, these are Samsung’s best earbuds yet in terms of sound quality. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SbQPnk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="90YhyS"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 smart display, with an eight-inch display and a built-in camera, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfCCOFsOFfW" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is just $64 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This deal loops in the first-gen model. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The newer $130 second-gen model that was released this summer&lt;/a&gt; has it beat when it comes to camera quality and overall performance, though it has a similar design, with no noticeable changes to the display or the speaker quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MW9buo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cdPqxa"&gt;Samsung’s speedy X5 portable SSD with 1TB of storage and Thunderbolt 3 support is cheaper than ever at Amazon. According to pricing data from CamelCamelCamel, this is the first time it has fallen below its usual $350 price. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GBWZJFG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can pick it up now for $300&lt;/a&gt;. When I tested it out in our “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/13/18518127/portable-ssd-external-thunderbolt-3-usb-c-samsung-x5-t5-specs-test-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;how to choose an external SSD&lt;/a&gt;” post in mid-2019, it sold for $450. If you connect it to a laptop that has a Thunderbolt port, you can expect very fast read and write speeds. In my testing, this drive achieved an average 2,410MB/s read speed and 1,708MB/s write speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h2fAzi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10763013"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2KATE4"&gt;Atlus is celebrating the 25th anniversary of the &lt;em&gt;Persona &lt;/em&gt;franchise this month, and perhaps it’s no coincidence that Walmart is selling the latest game in that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;franchise, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPersona-5-Royal-Sega-PlayStation-4-Physical-Edition%2F298470678&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Royal&lt;/em&gt;, for $25&lt;/a&gt;. It’s usually $60 and packs in a ton of content. This game works on PS4, and can be played on PS5 consoles that have a disc drive. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21199604/persona-5-royal-review-ps4-atlus-rpg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku’s latest update is making free live TV even easier to stream</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KB-bDcGSguqV9P1n8IqW53A2aok=/234x0:966x488/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882220/Roku_OS_10.5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roku’s live TV app displayed on the home screen in Roku OS 10.5.&lt;/em&gt; | Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GM8kE5"&gt;Roku is making finding stuff to watch more of a breeze by expanding voice command support and making it easier to watch free live TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRGcd6"&gt;With the Roku OS 10.5 update, Roku users will be able to access the live TV guide — which now boasts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628020/roku-live-tv-guide-17-new-channels"&gt;more than 200 channels&lt;/a&gt; to stream for free — faster by pinning it to their home screens alongside their other apps and channels. After updating, users just need to search for “Live TV on The Roku Channel” and will be able to install it as they would any other app or streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o57DUV"&gt;Additionally, for those who navigate the Roku experience using voice commands, Roku says its voice command support extends to “nearly any channel” in search. That includes Spotify and Netflix as well, two previously notable exceptions that are now supported. Plus, a new music and podcast row in search should make navigation a little easier as well. With the update, Roku is partnering with Spotify for the launch of the new search integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f99jzA"&gt;And lastly, Roku users may have noticed its mobile app recently got a bit of a facelift. In mid-August, the company began rolling out new save list and home tab features. Users will find the latter to the left of the Roku Channel tab on the bottom panel. The save list, meanwhile, can be found from both the home and remote tabs on mobile, and Roku users can bookmark anything they might be interested in watching in the future by clicking on the title and selecting “add to save list.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8EgZM"&gt;Roku OS 10.5 will begin arriving on Roku devices in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="X8oQ0L"&gt;Nvidia is releasing a new display driver today that adds DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) support to 28 games, and is now certified for both Windows 10 and Windows 11. The 28 additional DLSS games brings the total of games to more than 100, an important milestone for Nvidia’s AI-based temporal upscaling. DLSS upscale games from a lower resolution to provide smoother frame rates without a noticeable compromise in image quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="efjuJU"&gt;Most of the new DLSS additions come courtesy of the Unreal Engine 4 DLSS plugin that’s making it easier for developers to integrate DLSS into their games. &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake Remast&lt;/em&gt;ered will ship with DLSS support next month, and Nvidia is promising an up to 2X performance boost at 4K. Every GeForce RTX GPU can get over 60fps at max settings in 4K with DLSS enabled, and it means cards like the RTX 2080 Ti jump from an average of 70fps to 120fps, according to Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alan Wake gets some big performance boosts with DLSS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gRcAgX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Industria, &lt;/em&gt;releasing on September 30th, will also include DLSS support, alongside support for a new Nvidia DLAA (Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing) AI-based anti-aliasing mode on &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls Online &lt;/em&gt;test servers. DLAA is designed “for users who have spare GPU headroom and want higher levels of image quality,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fwindows-11-game-ready-driver%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F20%2F22683585%2Fnvidia-windows-11-driver-dlss-support-games-features-alan-wake" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to Nvidia&lt;/a&gt;. It works similarly to DLSS, but instead of boosting performance it boosts image quality instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ujmPq3"&gt;Today’s Nvidia driver also includes Windows 11 support, with optimizations for &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake Remastered, Deathloop, Diablo II: Resurrected, Far Cry 6, Hot Wheels Unleashed, Industria, New World, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; World War Z: Aftermath.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ul0XOP"&gt;You can download Nvidia’s latest driver (472.12) for both Windows 10 and Windows 11 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fdrivers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F20%2F22683585%2Fnvidia-windows-11-driver-dlss-support-games-features-alan-wake" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;over at Nvidia’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hisense’s new promo will let you test drive some of its best TVs for 100 days</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0suhjr0Ma3sAysSiU1K_mScsYN8=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882267/Hisense_No_Regrets_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EsaY4o"&gt;Buying a TV can be a big decision, but Hisense’s latest promotion wants to help; starting today the company is offering what it calls its “100 Day Guarantee,” which will let you buy a Hisense TV, try it out for 100 days in the comfort of your own living room, and then, if you don’t like it, you can send it back for a full refund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uO0Pxv"&gt;A number of Hisense’s latest models are included in the offer, including the U6G, U7G, and U8G. But more surprisingly, even the 75-inch, U800GR 8K (which costs $2,699.99) and the company’s high-end 100-inch and 120-inch L9G laser TV projection setups (which cost $5,500 and $6,000, respectively) are eligible — meaning that if you’re willing to lay out the cost, you can test drive the fanciest TVs that Hisense sells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="levfbd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are, of course, some caveats&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CFKDp2"&gt;There are, of course, some caveats. You’ll have to purchase the TV from Hisense’s approved list (which includes Amazon, Best Buy, PC Richard, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=http%3A%2F%2FWalmart.com&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart.com&lt;/a&gt;) between September 9th through October 31st. You’ll have to pay the full price of the TV upfront, with the refund coming once Hisense has received the TV back. You’ll also have to register your TV on &lt;a href="https://hisense-promos.com"&gt;Hisense’s promotional website&lt;/a&gt; as part of the program within 14 days of getting it, or else you won’t be able to return it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0ivdT"&gt;Once you’ve done all that, if you want to go through with returning the TV (which Hisense presumably is hoping you won’t), you’ll have to go back to that same promotional website and submit a return request. As part of that request, you’ll have to send in your receipt for the TV, along with pictures that prove that you haven’t wrecked it during your 100-day trial period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fsXWs"&gt;Hisense’s terms and conditions states, “Undamaged and not permanently marked (subject to reasonable wear and tear to be expected from one-hundred (100) days use of the Qualifying Product for its intended purpose and where such wear and tear does not materially affect the resale value).” You’ll also need to send it back with its original accessories, although Hisense will send over a box to help make sending it back easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7a7YD"&gt;After you’ve done all that, Hisense will confirm your claim and send over a prepaid shipping label, at which point you’ll have 21 days to send it back. Once it gets the TV back, it’ll issue a refund through either prepaid Visa debit cards or a PayPal transfer. As for the returned TVs, Hisense promises that they’ll all be “either recycled or refurbished.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VTLwc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 20th, 11:20am: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hisense says that it’ll provide return shipping materials for TVs sent back through its 100 day promotion, so customers won’t need to hang on to the original box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
