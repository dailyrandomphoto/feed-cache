    <title>How the iPhone 13, Mini, Pro and Max compare to Android rivals — and vs. iPhone 12</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIE1fKsyU-4YGO8QCzzk9vf437c=/136x0:1525x926/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69858872/Screen_Shot_2021_09_14_at_1.41.05_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OwYW5M"&gt;Apple has announced its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;, which feature better cameras, 120Hz screens, new processors (which Apple claims are the fastest in a phone, period), better battery life, and smaller notches compared to their predecessors. But should you upgrade from the iPhone 12, and is Apple beating the Android competition? Here’s how Apple stacks up to Samsung, OnePlus, Google, and its own previous devices on paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEx3AS"&gt;One thing to keep in mind before we dive in is that specs don’t tell the whole story. There’s the obvious difficult comparisons (how does an Apple A15 chip stack up against a Snapdragon 888, and how do you compare traditional phones to folding ones), as well as the small details that don’t fit cleanly on a spec sheet. For instance, one of Apple’s pro features is the ability to shoot 4K ProRes on its higher-end phones — except for the models with 128GB of storage, which will be limited to 1080p ProRes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kLycRm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Missing from this comparison: Google’s upcoming flagships&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLNb0o"&gt;There’s also an obvious competitor missing: Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. Google didn’t give us their full specifications &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;in its partial announcement&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it hard to include them in a spec comparison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdkPRY"&gt;But let’s put all those caveats aside, because maybe you’re looking for a phone &lt;em&gt;right now. &lt;/em&gt;How do the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini stack up, spec-for-spec, against their Android competitors? Prices throughout this comparison, by the way, are for the unlocked iPhones, which are $30 more than the carrier versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CEaQyh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10752933"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U16Rcu"&gt;Anyways, let’s stop talking about saving a few bucks, and blow the budget a bit: how does the iPhone 13 Pro stack up against the Android flagships, in a battle of the $1,000 plus phones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Tbl3mx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10752940"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xtCxJu"&gt;As with past years, we see that Apple isn’t necessarily playing a spec-game, especially when it comes to cameras. Some of its higher-end Android competitors boast megapixel counts that are four or even almost 10 times as high as Apple’s cameras. Whether that’ll give them an edge or not will have to be seen when we test Apple’s “dramatically more powerful” cameras. Both Apple and Google have traditionally prioritized larger pixels for low-light performance rather than raw resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKBjqe"&gt;Finally, let’s take a look at how Apple did year-over-year when it comes to upgrading its specs. It’s worth noting that, while we’ve included the 12 Pro, you actually can’t buy that phone  from Apple anymore, making the comparison more useful for upgraders than cross-shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eKc9TA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10753324"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WUkaL0"&gt;One interesting point is that the phones haven’t changed when it comes to width, height, or screen size, but they have gotten a bit thicker, and a bit heavier. They are packing a fair amount of new tech though, so perhaps that’s understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HoaQL"&gt;What the specs don't show, though, is how unfavorably the iPhone 12 is priced — at first glance the it seems like a reasonable buy at $100 cheaper, but at that price you’re only getting half the storage. If you get a 128GB iPhone 12, you’ll only be saving $50 compared to the 128GB iPhone 13, which has all the upgrades to the screens, cameras, battery life, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;everything else Apple announced&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. Sure, it’s technically less expensive, but you’d be giving up a lot for very little savings. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s updated leather MagSafe wallet supports Find My location tracking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z5Hcb5ftQ2C0iPfl-S_1-wyLOr8=/0x33:1468x1012/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69858738/Screen_Shot_2021_09_14_at_1.46.39_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HfglLg"&gt;Apple introduced an updated version of its &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM0Q3ZM/A/iphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-golden-brown?fnode=39b68db69449c5a7ec6859579b5af320916609c170ab6488a4d76b5b025119f9e4646c0fcb99801d36758ddc3ecd4b1df121159a3759e017741796dbe5a58353744d6d28bbfdeeb02e47324b9e9820478c80412df67a05bd862cca30516def3b"&gt;MagSafe leather wallet&lt;/a&gt; today with new colors and support for an additional feature: tracking in the Find My app. Apple’s location tracking service recently expanded &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;with the addition of AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, and now the company is apparently working &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; version of the same functionality into its more low-tech accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykzFme"&gt;That might seem like the continuous tracking AirTags offers, but Apple’s description points to something simpler. The company writes that the wallet “supports Find My, so you can be notified of your wallet’s last known location if it gets separated from your phone.” That’s helpful, but possibly not useful if someone moves your wallet after it’s separated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sPE6m6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It seems like MagSafe is the key &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kNsRxF"&gt;Apple isn’t entirely clear why this is the case on its product page, but it’s possible what’s really happening is your iPhone is just noting when the MagSafe magnet is or isn’t attached to your phone. Your iPhone already plays a small animation when you attach a MagSafe product, it wouldn’t be too hard to imagine it marking a GPS location in Find My when a MagSafe accessory is disconnected. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UOweLsE59uRpvQ7chtkJ9-JPtNA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850831/Screen_Shot_2021_09_14_at_1.37.20_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eRG80f"&gt;There’s also an odd exception: in the fine print, Apple notes that the new Find My functionality isn’t supported on the Clear Case with MagSafe. The best guess here is that whatever unique ID your iPhone recognizes when you connect a MagSafe device might be blocked by a Clear Case. Why the Clear Case but not other MagSafe cases would keep Apple from knowing when a wallet is disconnected isn’t clear. That doesn’t make the new wallet less useful necessarily, but it does show it has limitations that a normal wallet with an AirTag or Tile shoved inside wouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRoYru"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Apple for an explanation of how the new Find My functionality works, and what exactly is happening with the Clear Case. We’ll update if we learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iv9hQc"&gt;The iPhone Leather Wallet with MagSafe is available now for $59.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch’s new sizes make shopping for bands more confusing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Watch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8X-OzuKkyLOFNcVAUs7mkLrCiDY=/0x0:1653x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69858714/applewatchsizes.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rOryBA"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt; was one of the many announcements made during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;Apple’s “California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the stage alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;13 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;iPad Mini with USB-C charging&lt;/a&gt;, and more. The watch comes in new 41mm and 45mm case sizing, moving away from the 40mm and 44mm sizing that has been the standard for the last few generations of Apple Watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8STKV"&gt;As expected, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAdlfb73UN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple updated its online inventory of Watch bands&lt;/a&gt; accordingly for the new sizes. But many of them no longer list options for the 38, 40, 42, and 44mm sizing options for all of the bands. While it might appear at first that Apple has unceremoniously eradicated support for all previous models, don’t worry, it didn’t do that. However, the company did make it slightly more confusing to quickly find the accessory made for your watch size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYva4N"&gt;This breakdown should make it easier to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjdNKJ"&gt;If you see a band you like that’s 41mm-sized, this implicitly indicates that they’ll work with 38mm and 40mm cases, too. The 45mm bands will work with Apple Watch models that have 42mm or 44mm cases. To make doubly sure that you’re getting a size that’s compatible with your watch, Apple’s site offers up compatibility details right beneath the sizing options, so be sure to click that if you’re skeptical. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple store" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yt9bdtms4NzwG8dbeVNBGGSNvTA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850741/bandcompatibility.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This window will appear if you click “See Compatibility Details” from Apple’s online store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OIsmNH"&gt;Shopping for solo loop bands is just a little more complicated, but nothing new there. In case you didn’t know, they’re compatible only with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt;, the Series 4, and newer models. For 40mm and 41mm-sized Apple Watch models, you can get solo loop bands in the size range of one through nine, whereas the 44mm and 45mm models work with band sizes four through 12. If that sizing reads like gibberish to you, the solo loop requires you to take a measurement of your wrist size to find the size that lines up with Apple’s sizing guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8cTGa"&gt;To reiterate, bands made for the smaller of the two new sizes work with the previous, smaller-sized Apple Watch models, and vice versa. Getting a bigger-sized Apple Watch band basically ensures it’ll work with previous wearables that were the biggest sizing option of their respective generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxqHE7"&gt;I hope this tip helps you find a watch band that fits your watch. While it might be confusing at first, it’s fairly easy to commit to memory once you know about it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple drops the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone XR from its lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone XR" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/coGpCvtffTjdXwxzdnAhlZv0YlY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69858647/akrales_181019_3014_0770.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;iPhone XR | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iXrc0F"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665413/apple-event-iphone-13-announcements-news-products"&gt;a slew of new iPhones come in&lt;/a&gt;, several models go out. This year, Apple pulled the plug on a couple of familiar standbys to make room for the iPhone 13, as &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/iphone-lineup-2021/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGD6xK"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; have disappeared from Apple’s online store outside of refurb models. This is customary for Pro models when the lineup is refreshed, even though they’ve been shipping for less than a year. If you absolutely must spend more than $1,000 on a brand-new iPhone that isn’t the iPhone 13 (or you love that dark blue colorway), your options today are carriers and third-party retail shops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BOGdkS"&gt;While the devices are likely to appear as cut-rate options at places like Woot from time to time, Apple’s retail option cuts out the option of buying last year's high-end model for a little less as opposed to choosing the latest and greatest — which, in the case of the iPhone 13 Pro, includes spec bumps all over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThhI9u"&gt;The other model that no longer makes the cut is the iPhone XR. Introduced in 2018 as a cheaper LCD-equipped alternative to the iPhone XS, it hung on as a midrange-priced device with the Neural Engine, second-gen Face ID, and plenty of colors to choose from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Tnec08"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPhone XR review: better than good enough ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18011306/apple-iphone-xr-review-camera-screen-battery-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="f82eKR"&gt;The iPhone XR’s arrival coincided with the disappearance of the last iPhones to feature headphone jacks. While this year’s transition isn’t nearly so dramatic, it includes a shift in the cheaper options in the lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iPhone pricing - Fall 2021" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gRqhYSUEVT4qFcyLceDuhQlDZrw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22851009/iphone_pricing.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple.com&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;iPhone pricing - Fall 2021&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4OQSfs"&gt;The iPhone XR was available for $499 unlocked, but the iPhone 11 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-11&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F14%2F22674308%2Fapple-iphone-xr-12-11-price-cut-discontinued" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;price has dropped by $100&lt;/a&gt; to cover the slot. At the iPhone 11 launch, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/11/20847304/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-comparison-best-specs-features-price-size-camera"&gt;said the newer device offered up to an hour of extra battery life over its predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, the U1 ultrawideband chip for finding things, and a newer A13 Bionic CPU. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fiphone-12%2Fkey-features%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F14%2F22674308%2Fapple-iphone-xr-12-11-price-cut-discontinued" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini&lt;/a&gt; also received $100 price cuts from Apple, making their starting prices $699 and $599, respectively. The iPhone SE remains $399.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuIrK9"&gt;As far as the new Pro devices go, they aren’t any cheaper, but once the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; start shipping on the 24th, they will offer high refresh rate displays, a new camera system, plus improvements to the CPU and GPU. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer made gamer thimbles</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="razer gaming finger sleeves" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OCUIcXWXkpRuV5e4SNYVT-XpS84=/0x0:1050x700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69858621/razergamingfingersleeves.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The most 2021 gaming apparel yet&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UcPezJ"&gt;What makes a gamer? I’ll tell you. It’s having the right attitude, the skills to dominate, and of course, the right tech. You won’t get ahead without the best, well, you name it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krI5MB"&gt;Razer has already produced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22524309/razer-raptor-27-gaming-monitor-vesa-freesync-features-2021-price-ports"&gt;gaming monitors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22566803/razer-barracuda-x-wireless-headset-ps5-nintendo-switch-android"&gt;headsets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22650400/razer-basilisk-v3-chroma-rgb-scroll-wheel-price-features"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22623320/razer-pbt-keycaps-coiled-cable-wrist-rest-abs-caps-mechanical-keyboard"&gt;keyboards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.razer.com%2Fbreadwinner&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F9%2F14%2F22674370%2Frazer-gaming-finger-sleeves-thumb-gaming-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;toasters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/27/15074616/razer-chroma-mug-holder-light-up-zsilver-store"&gt;Chroma-enabled mug holders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/10/21510427/razer-iskur-first-gaming-chair-secretlab-omega-titan-similarity"&gt;chairs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666452/razer-wolverine-v2-chroma-xbox-pc-wired-controller-price-features"&gt;controllers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgear-accessories%2Frazer-sneki-snek-plushie&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;plush animals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Flifestyle%2Fapparel&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;laptops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309439/razer-tomahawk-mini-gaming-pc-for-sale-shipping"&gt;desktops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22632338/razer-hammerhead-true-wireless-earbuds-2nd-gen-review"&gt;headphones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314474/razer-anzu-smart-glasses-announced-pricing-features-release-date"&gt;glasses that are also headphones&lt;/a&gt;, and truthfully, a lot more. If you’re still not getting the results you’ve worked for? Don’t worry, the company somehow still isn’t at a loss as to what to put out next to maximize your potential.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="razer gaming finger sleeves" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9gkYaZPcPZQq8mvFwZh8w-uwHF8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850907/https___hybrismediaprod.blob.core.windows.net_sys_master_phoenix_images_container_h4b_h34_9239168647198_14_Sep_gaming_finger_sleeve_1500x1000_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pros know that this is elite form&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rctCDY"&gt;The latest essential gamer gear &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgear-accessories%2Frazer-gaming-finger-sleeve&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;is hardcore thimbles that cost $9.99&lt;/a&gt;, with two included with each purchase. They’re called “Gaming Finger Sleeves” and Razer says they’re made of “smooth, high-sensitivity fabric.” Keep in mind that people may see you using these bad boys if you’re in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6h2nfL"&gt;As you might have hoped, they’re made to be lightweight and breathable. It’s a gamer’s nightmare to get hot fingers during intense gameplay, so it’s good that Razer thought of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WoA7G2"&gt;But why stop at fingers? If you’re a real gamer, you’ll cover your toes, too. Getting all of your digits covered in gaming sleeves will only cost you $50. And don’t worry, they’re washable.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s big event today stressed its major focus on streaming </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BPoJCdn6hSCUtwS6M0BejEbUAzU=/22x88:946x704/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69858459/download.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KdRyAk"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;big product event&lt;/a&gt; today was all about iPhones, iPads, and the latest generation of its smartwatch — but make no mistake, it also underscored Apple’s increasingly aggressive push to dominate streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYOaep"&gt;Apple wasted no time on Tuesday showcasing its quickly expanding and award-winning roster of originals on Apple TV Plus, with Apple boss Tim Cook kicking off the “California Streaming” event with a highlight reel of fall premieres and soon-to-debut titles. Cook gave a nod to the more than 130 wins and 500-plus award nominations for the service’s original films and series since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21262291/apple-tv-plus-morning-show-licensed-movies-netflix-disney-plus-quibi"&gt;launching in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, taking time to specifically herald the success of critical darling &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, which recently swooped up a record-breaking &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F07%2Fapple-scores-35-emmy-nominations-including-20-for-hit-series-ted-lasso%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F14%2F22673907%2Fapple-event-2021-apple-tv-plus-streaming-wars" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20 Emmy nominations&lt;/a&gt;. (Apple TV Plus had 35 total nominations for all of its titles, which is fairly impressive for a service that’s less than two years old.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hnWIsl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple kicked off its hardware event with an intro dedicated to Apple TV Plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GbQrHh"&gt;For a hardware event that didn’t have too much to share beyond what’s coming to Apple TV Plus in the near future, much of which has already been made public, Apple’s decision to spend a significant chunk of time highlighting its forthcoming roster of content proved once again that it’s serious about growing its streaming service. And Apple is reportedly prepared to swing even bigger as it continues to expand its franchises and originals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XqXN7W"&gt;Citing a source familiar with the matter, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-a-streaming-punchline-no-more"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported last week that the company “intends to significantly up its output of new TV shows and movies to at least one a week.” To promote its titles, Apple could spend more than $500 million on marketing the service, &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported, citing a separate source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e1r2K1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UL-rZg5yErE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zhnDFg"&gt;Apple’s not just expanding its library, either. The company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22559665/tvos-15-beta-apple-tv-how-to-install"&gt;launching new ways&lt;/a&gt; for its users to stream content from devices within its ecosystem, with SharePlay among the most exciting of these features coming to Apple devices with iOS 15 — though it won’t debut with the initial rollout but instead in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;a future update&lt;/a&gt;. Even still, SharePlay, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;watch party tool&lt;/a&gt; that allows Apple users to stream content from Apple as well as from other services together in real time, was teased throughout Tuesday’s product event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JsfeOH"&gt;And it looks like Apple’s been busy expanding this feature ahead of its official launch, too. When it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in June, under a dozen apps were said to have support for the tool, including Disney Plus, ESPN Plus, HBO Max, Hulu, MasterClass, Paramount Plus, Pluto TV, TikTok, and Twitch. That list had been expanded as of Tuesday’s launch, with Comedy Central, Showtime, Spotify, Starz, and more appearing in a slide about SharePlay partners for video and music streaming. Presumably, this list will continue to grow ahead of the feature’s official debut. Apple told &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in June that SharePlay is available to any streaming partner who wants to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8y61Kr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s launching features that make streaming more accessible than ever&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xm9Sun"&gt;Despite all of its award accolades, Apple still has several hurdles it’ll have to navigate if it hopes to take on streaming kings like Netflix and Disney. Its library needs to get bigger, and fast, if it hopes to hang on to subscribers once their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22544099/apple-tv-plus-one-year-free-ending-three-months"&gt;free trials&lt;/a&gt; have run out. It will also have to figure out a way to drum up more fanfare for its series to get viewers excited about them &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; they debut on the service (both things that it sounds like Apple is already working on). In many ways, the kind of hype we saw during today’s event is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; to propel the service forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Awtn1i"&gt;But if Cook’s enthusiastic praise of Apple’s to-date originals is any indication, Apple is only just getting started. And the company’s deep pockets and software integrations geared at making streaming accessible more than prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zHo1sR"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Lr5Eb3"&gt;Related:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="tQPCtY"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPhone 13 event in 15 minutes|103694" data-volume-uuid="15e5aff54" data-volume-id="103694" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-452" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard sued again, this time for labor violations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Blizzard Orc statue" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2beb5lraGig3aC_iyPNjRYwj0ks=/5x0:725x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69858347/ss12.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rw4yuI"&gt;The Campaign to Organize Digital Employees, known as CODE-CWA, has &lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/31-CA-282822"&gt;filed suit against Activision Blizzard for unfair labor practices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3utA0"&gt;As first &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/activision-blizzard-labor-law-charge"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this new suit, filed with the National Labor Relations Board, alleges Activision Blizzard engaged in intimidation and coercive tactics as employees fought to openly discuss pay discrepancy and their desire to end forced arbitration. CODE-CWA, a digital workers rights and labor organizer, filed the suit on behalf of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK"&gt;A Better ABK&lt;/a&gt; — a group of Activision Blizzard employees working toward improving working conditions at what is one of the largest video game publishers in the US.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUY0xO"&gt;In July, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;the state of California sued Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; for enabling a culture of “constant sexual harassment.” Shortly after news of the suit broke, Blizzard employees&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt; staged a walkout&lt;/a&gt; that drew national attention. A Better ABK was created around the time of the walkout but reflects the long-term and ongoing struggles of employees at the publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJHSPK"&gt;A Better ABK released &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1421307645613334531?s=20"&gt;a list of demands&lt;/a&gt; that asks for, among other things, “an end to mandatory arbitration clauses in all employee contracts, current and future.” This newest suit, filed on September 10th, accuses Activision Blizzard of engaging in “coercive” behavior disruptive to A Better ABK’s attempts to effect change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1YKvE"&gt;“If the NLRB rules in our favor, the ruling will be retroactive and we will set a precedent that no worker in the US can be intimidated out of talking about forced arbitration,” a Better ABK spokesperson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1437809134372491273"&gt;writes on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkiLUE"&gt;Activision Blizzard is undergoing a number of personnel changes since the lawsuit. J. Allen Brack, president of Blizzard Entertainment, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22598694/blizzard-president-resigns-j-allen-brack-activision-lawsuit"&gt;stepped down August 3rd&lt;/a&gt;. Jesse Meschuk, the company’s head of global human resources, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608320/blizard-jesse-meschuk-leave-company-hr-svp"&gt;also left the company that same day&lt;/a&gt;. Today, &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-hires-senior-executives-disney-and-delta"&gt;Activision Blizzard announced it has filled two upper management vacancies&lt;/a&gt;. Julie Hodges, a senior VP at Disney, will take over as chief people officer and Delta Airlines finance VP Sandeep Dube is Activision Blizzard’s new chief operating officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSEpbH"&gt;Activision Blizzard did not respond to a request for comment. CODE-CWA did not respond in time for publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="av0ZpK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6a9Ha3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rKF7xFC4hTYRm-7tz1b73WWCeWk=/0x0:1959x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857848/iphone13mini.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the colors of the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini.&lt;/em&gt; | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIBU9V"&gt;Apple announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;a fleet of new products at its “California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt;. Chief among them — you guessed it — was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22430843"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;. This one is coming in various sizes and colors, but with smaller notches, the new A15 Bionic chipset, and with redesigned and improved cameras located around the back. Going from smallest to largest, Apple will soon release the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22430843"&gt;iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and finally the iPhone 13 Pro Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;With the Pro and Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll be able to get the first iPhone to ship with 1TB of storage, along with 120Hz refresh rate displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1YGEt"&gt;If you’re looking forward to ordering any of the four iPhone 13 models, the good news is you won’t have to wait long to both preorder and receive your new phone. The preorder phase begins on Friday, September 17th, and they’ll release the following week on Friday, September 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIozlV"&gt;I’m going to tell you where you can preorder one of these new phones and how much it’ll cost, whether you’re purchasing one unlocked or through your carrier as an upgrade. We’ll be adding more carrier deals as the week goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h7zyyJ"&gt;How to preorder the iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7E96Ug"&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini is the 2021 iteration on the Mini phone form factor with a 5.4-inch OLED screen. Apple says that this newer version should get better battery life than the previous model. Battery life was one of the few disappointments in the iPhone 12 Mini, so it’s good that Apple seems to have made improvements here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytXyfk"&gt;Apple will offer the iPhone 13 Mini starting with &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbvWrJgUA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage for $729&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll be able to opt for more storage with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbvWrJgUA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbvWrJgUA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; versions for $829 or $1,029, respectively. If you purchase through a carrier via Apple’s site, the starting price of each configuration drops $30, starting at $699.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nPdN53"&gt;How to preorder the iPhone 13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DVnDHN"&gt;Apple’s new iPhone 13 has a 6.1-inch OLED display, the same size as last year’s model. Like other models this year, Apple upgraded the internal chipset to the A15 Bionic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NHlw2"&gt;Preorders will begin Friday, September 17th at Apple. Buying them unlocked will cost you $30 more than buying through a carrier, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbvWrJgUA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $829 for the 128GB version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbvWrJgUA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$929 for the 256GB version&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbvWrJgUA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,129 for the 512GB version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BaJlBq"&gt;How to preorder the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eBv8ru"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max are the biggest and most capable models coming out of Apple in 2021. The iPhone 13 Pro has a 6.1-inch OLED display with an A15 Bionic chipset, while the Pro Max has a bigger 6.7-inch OLED. Both support up to 120Hz refresh rate, which is an improvement that’s long been anticipated. However, you’ll also pay a lot more for this model than the base iPhone 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAUxcl"&gt;At Apple, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbt89CdOY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB version&lt;/a&gt; of the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max models start at $999 and $1,099, respectively. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbt89CdOY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; will run you $1,099, while the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbt89CdOY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; will cost $1,199. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbt89CdOY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB configuration&lt;/a&gt; of either model will also cost an extra $200, with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbt89CdOY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; retailing for $1,499 and the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAbt89CdOY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; retailing for $1,599. Unlike the iPhone 13 Mini and standard iPhone 13, there’s no $30 price difference if you choose to purchase the Pro line unlocked. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder Apple’s new iPad and iPad Mini</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MJh377rgCk0xrZL9VTIMCiq3dLo=/1x0:1960x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857722/Apple_iPad_mini_touch_id_09142021_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ztdXBm"&gt;As expected, Apple’s “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;California Streaming&lt;/a&gt;” was loaded with a flurry of announcements, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;. Apple also used its annual fall showcase to introduce its latest tablets, specifically the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;ninth-gen iPad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;all-new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which is a follow-up to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;2019 iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; that takes heavy design cues from last year’s iPad Air. The new models are set to launch on Friday, September 24th, starting at $329 and $499, respectively, with preorders beginning today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yMH3Z4"&gt;Where to buy the all-new iPad Mini&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="U3t2M7"&gt;Spec-wise, the new iPad Mini is a far cry from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/30/3576178/apple-ipad-mini-review"&gt;original iPad Mini model&lt;/a&gt; and one of the bigger revamps to come to Apple’s smallest tablet since it made its debut in 2012. The sixth-gen model features slimmer bezels, an A15 Bionic chip, and a larger, 8.3-inch display. Like the iPad Air, the forthcoming tablet also ditches the aging home button, adds USB-C support, and incorporates a Touch ID sensor within the top-mounted power button. It also supports 5G and Wi-Fi 6, works with the second-gen Apple Pencil, and features a 12MP ultrawide camera on the front, allowing for the same &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage feature&lt;/a&gt; Apple introduced with the iPad Pro last year. Additionally, like the ninth-gen iPad, it ships with iPadOS 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fECKGb"&gt;The latest iPad Mini comes in two different storage configurations, 64GB and 256GB, and in four colorways (purple, pink, starlight, and space gray). The 64GB configuration retails for $499 and the 256GB model for $649; both models are &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/WDN6YX" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for preorder&lt;/a&gt; beginning today at Apple, with shipments expected to arrive before the tablet’s launch on Friday, September 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0DybVI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jyQB1V"&gt;Like the Wi-Fi model, the iPad Mini with cellular connectivity is available in two sizes: 64GB and 256GB. Both come in an array of colors — purple, pink, starlight, and space gray — with prices starting at $649 and $799, respectively. Both configurations are also &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/WDN6YX" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for preorder&lt;/a&gt; starting today at Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Lsq6xQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743742"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CBe2E6"&gt;Where to buy the new entry-level iPad &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iZJ1f5"&gt;The entry-level iPad remains the most popular tablet in Apple’s lineup. The ninth-generation model keeps the same name the tablet has had since its introduction in 2010, but showcases several updates, including a new processor called the A13 Bionic, which is supposedly 20 percent faster than the outgoing model. Thanks to a 12MP camera on the front, the forthcoming device also supports Apple’s aforementioned Center Stage feature, however, the rest of the updates are more trivial. The new iPad still comes equipped with the same 10.2-inch display as before — this time with Apple’s True Tone technology — as well as a Lightning port, home button, and a single rear camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blvpwY"&gt;The new iPad comes in two different storage configurations, 64GB and 256GB, and in two colorways, silver and space gray. The 64GB configuration starts at $329 and the 256GB model for $479; both models are &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/ZdNxrk" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for preorder&lt;/a&gt; at Apple starting today, with shipments set to arrive before the tablet’s official launch on Friday, September 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XTmmmK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CQ8Eig"&gt;Like previous models, the ninth-gen iPad also comes in a cellular configuration, which is available in both 64GB and 256GB storage capacities in one of two colors (silver and space gray). Both storage configurations are &lt;a href="http://apple.sjv.io/ZdNxrk" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for preorder&lt;/a&gt; starting today at Apple, with the 64GB variant retailing for $459 and the 256GB model for $609.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MxvlFg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752888"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The 8 biggest announcements from Apple’s iPhone 13 event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nXzTcV5pqt24kY9iwdLAWo4U_fU=/1x0:1960x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857678/Apple_iphone13_colors_09142021.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 lineup.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dN7cX0"&gt;Apple just finished its “California Streaming” event, and it announced a whole lot of new products, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; lineup of smartphones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watches&lt;/a&gt; with bigger screens, and new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;iPads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tri6hY"&gt;If you’re looking for a quick recap of the biggest news from the show, we’ve got you covered right here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M_1hN-GQjX2bu-OJAD08S4aTkp8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850237/JIWI7ks.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UQW7u1"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;The iPhone 13 has a familiar design with a smaller notch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="09Enon"&gt;Apple’s new iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini look very similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt; but have a smaller notch and a diagonal camera array. They’re equipped with the new A15 Bionic chip and have an improved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673545/iphone-13-pro-camera-cinematic-mode-video-features-macro"&gt;dual-camera system&lt;/a&gt; on the back. Apple is also promising longer battery life than the iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnLMHB"&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini starts at $729, and the iPhone 13 starts at $829, though both are more affordable with carrier discounts. You can preorder them on September 17th ahead of availability on September 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/75c0asfqo09ttawxM97-OtDkiXM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850316/bHfOSj7.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EZ0rIC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro finally adds a high refresh rate screen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kWDpOZ"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max look similar to their predecessors, with a stainless steel band around the sides and a matte finish on the back. But the big upgrade is the screen: they support Apple’s ProMotion adaptive refresh rate technology that tops out at 120Hz. They also have a new camera system and an A15 Bionic chip. Like the iPhone 13, Apple is also promising improved battery life from the iPhone 12 series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqFux5"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro starts at $999 and the Pro Max starts at $1,099, and you can get both in a new 1TB storage option. The phones will be available to preorder on September 17th, and they’ll be out on September 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/83rCpkK0osrYZw06na0096n3ltY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850281/lcimg_4afb0057_7db7_40ab_b49a_068c00b55833.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A movie using Apple’s new Cinematic Mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wjwQpp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673545/iphone-13-pro-camera-cinematic-mode-video-features-macro"&gt;The new iPhones add a Cinematic Mode for video and photograph styles for pictures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1nvdFE"&gt;Two key new camera features coming to the iPhone 13 lineup are Cinematic Mode, which applies a portrait mode-style blur to the background, and something Apple calls photographic styles, which lets you select different styles before you take a photo to give it a certain look.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/obQ6w-PqTNCoq-8eoigadmQoot8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850153/7LBzI0E.png"&gt;

&lt;p id="WSxuKh"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 comes in two bigger screen sizes — 41mm and 45mm — with a slightly tweaked design. Some elements of the UI have been updated to better accommodate the bigger screen, including showing a full keyboard at times. The new model starts at $399, but you can’t get it just yet. Apple says it will be available later this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="3VJtuP"&gt;Apple announced some updates coming to Fitness Plus, its workout service. Apple is adding Pilates workouts, guided meditations, and workouts inspired by winter sports to the service later this month. Group workouts, coming later this fall, will let you work out with your friends. And the service is expanding to more countries, also later this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="NI4cSq"&gt;Apple’s new iPad Mini has an all-new design that resembles the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; that was released in 2020. The new Mini has an 8.3-inch screen, a Touch ID sensor on the power button, a USB-C port, a 12MP ultrawide front camera that supports Apple’s Center Stage technology, and the option of 5G connectivity. It also supports the second-generation Apple Pencil, which can connect magnetically to the side of the tablet. The new tablet starts at $499. It will be available to order Tuesday ahead of availability on September 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="6eMfYb"&gt;Apple announced a new ninth-generation iPad with an A13 Bionic chip. It also has a 12MP ultrawide front camera and that supports Center Stage. The new iPad starts at $329 with 64GB. You can order it today, and it will be available on September 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
