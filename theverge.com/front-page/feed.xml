Normally $200, Sam’s Club members can buy a pair of these wireless headphones for only $80. Even at $200, the Opus is well worth that retail price, but at $80, it’s an incredible deal that you rarely see for these headphones. The biggest barrier to getting these is you will need to pay for a Sam’s Club membership if you do not already have one. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GitHub still won’t explain if it fired someone for saying ‘Nazi,’ and employees are pissed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Congress Holds Joint Session To Ratify 2020 Presidential Election" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9cmV9LpTbBwkMkZWQX028h98om0=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68674135/1294949440.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Win McNamee / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ypChQx"&gt;GitHub employees are protesting the firing of a Jewish colleague who was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227487/github-microsoft-fired-jewish-employee-warned-nazis-us-capitol-breach"&gt;let go two days after he warned co-workers&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, DC to stay safe from Nazis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKoDEy"&gt;The employee was chastised for using divisive language, according to &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-github-backlash-jewish-employee-termination-2021-1"&gt;news first reported by &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Now, GitHub workers are saying “Nazi” repeatedly in Slack, in regards to the US Capitol rioters, to protest what is being perceived as unfair treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxuW3U"&gt;“Others have already said so, but I just want to say it explicitly myself - I think that nazis were present at some protests on Jan 6, and that it’s very scary to see those ideas on display,” wrote one senior engineer in a 390-person Slack channel called #inclusion-belonging. “100% Nazis were there, and 1000000000% Nazis are scary as fuck and do not belong anywhere. PARTICULARLY AT GitHub!” replied another. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/574vYEN2mYVcwBY1IH6XKr2PvN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22238246/screen_shot_005_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gDKx35"&gt;Another GitHub employee documented roughly 50 times the word “Nazi” was used in Slack prior to the events on January 6th. Employees often talk about politics, and some engineers have made Nazi jokes in the past. In a Slack message from 2014, one staffer wrote that “nazis gave the jews free healthcare.” He still works at GitHub today. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1zrnN9uPhLJoJjwUc0ecVQemoqk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22238189/screen_shot_002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6JaPzu"&gt;The current conflict began the day of the riots in Washington, DC when a Jewish employee told co-workers: “stay safe homies, nazis are about.” Some colleagues took offense to the language, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/09/us/capitol-hill-insurrection-extremist-flags-soh/index.html"&gt;although neo-Nazi organizations were, in fact, present at the riots&lt;/a&gt;. One engineer responded: “This is untasteful conduct for workplace [in my opinion], people have the right to protest period.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFi9fwIwTPmCKNgJI_C-4fJZgj0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22238195/screen_shot_001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mNeVwz"&gt;The conversation escalated, with colleagues jumping in to defend both sides, until the VP of engineering shut it down. “Ok, this is enough...This is not an appropriate conversation and we don’t need to be treating each other this way,” the VP said. “Y’all can agree to disagree but we don’t need to cause more division.” The VP then asked the Jewish employee to “chat.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9CbzrhT6FHQJYLphaoP2F4C5CsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22238196/screen_shot_004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="94GK6d"&gt;Two days later, he was fired. The company reportedly cited vague “patterns of behavior” as the reason for his termination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8XJ3B"&gt;After the firing was reported publicly, GitHub attempted to handle the controversy internally. Earlier this week, the company hosted an “empathy circle” to “build understanding with members of the team on things that affect us.” It did not go over well with employees. “um.. this empathy circle sounds like the state propoganda i grew up with,” one employee said, with an emoji of the Chinese flag. “Im outta here.” Another employee responded, “I’m having a hard time focusing on this language haha.” The first employee added, “The poc channel is liit...apparently the circle sounds akin to nazi apologists and ‘all lives matter’ type of bs.. glad i left early.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XB65o6"&gt;Roughly 200 of GitHub’s 1,700 employees (which GitHub calls “hubbers”) have signed an open letter asking for clarity around the Jewish worker’s termination. “The clear insinuation is that a Jewish Hubber was fired for calling a group of people (that included Neo-Nazi white supremacists) ‘Nazis,’” they wrote. “Because of this, Hubbers no longer feel they can speak up against racism or hatred against protected characteristics like their religion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlUEfx"&gt;GitHub CEO Nat Friedman responded, saying he was appalled at the violence in Washington, DC and would be investigating the termination of the Jewish employee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1CtIv"&gt;The company has not yet told employees why the Jewish worker was fired. GitHub COO Erica Brescia responded to his original Slack thread saying: “This has been a tough week. We are listening and understand people are concerned. Many across the leadership team have spent time today with Hubbers who have had questions and concerns about this separation. Separating with an employee isn’t easy for anyone. When we do separate we want to protect and employee’s privacy so we do not provide details regarding separations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2AzpE"&gt;To employees, the comment fell flat. “This is a deeply unsatisfying response,” one wrote. “And it makes me feel sick to my stomach. It seems that GitHub chose to fire a Jewish employee for either accurately labeling the (literal, verifiable) Nazis at the Capitol as Nazis; or that they were fired for expressing a religious sentiment. I don’t see how either of those comport with GitHub’s values. I respect the privacy of departed employees, but there simply must be something else that can be said as to why this isn’t as bad as it looks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Og1Vca"&gt;Apparently, there was not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNpHvf"&gt;In response to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a GitHub spokesperson said: “We take all complaints of this nature very seriously. We are actively investigating the situation.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In its third season, American Gods is the most fascinating disaster on TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OrMb1JvfiBnA9GjXCC5U9m-DkNE=/139x87:1302x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68674101/Screen_Shot_2021_01_15_at_11.57.33_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g0jxPD"&gt;One of the miracles of any good television show is that it even works at all. First consider the countless people working across departments and disciplines needed to make a single episode happen; and then consider that they all have to do it anywhere between eight and 20-ish times a year, and that the result has to make sense to millions of people who cannot &lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt; to be unimpressed. There are a lot of places to mess up! And yet we hear about so few mistakes. Which is why it’s a pretty big story when something as large as &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt; goes awry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYalMf"&gt;The Starz drama was a special kind of disaster: it premiered to considerable acclaim only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/10/18258816/american-gods-review-season-2-ian-macshane-gillian-anderson-kristin-chenoweth-starz"&gt;to fall to pieces&lt;/a&gt; in between its first and second seasons, losing its high-profile showrunners and several cast members. Between the second season finale and the premiere of the latest season, the show’s new management fired Orlando Jones, whose fiery portrayal of the trickster god Anansi was beloved and one of the show’s brightest stars. (&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/orlando-jones-fired-american-gods-interview-mr-nancy-1203436890/"&gt;Allegations surrounding Jones’ dismissal&lt;/a&gt; are troubling.) This makes the third season more surprising: after all that chaos, it’s turned out totally fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TgBvRy"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJ76r-iKCcM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ibr8EN"&gt;Season 3 also doesn’t resemble what drew many to &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt; in the first place. The radical experimentation is gone. There are no fiery monologues, mind-bending sex scenes, or powerful vignettes that evoke the immigrant experience and humanity’s relationship with faith. &lt;em&gt;American Gods &lt;/em&gt;is no longer interested in that sort of thing. Instead, it’s concerned with rebuilding itself and doing the fascinating work of making a season that’s equal parts a total do-over and a straightforward continuation of the story that started in episode one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nPo60"&gt;And so we are reintroduced to Shadow Moon (Ricky Whittle), a man living under an alias after a falling out with his employer, Mr. Wednesday (Ian McShane). Quickly, we’re reminded why: Mr. Wednesday is not just some impossible boss. He’s Odin, the Norse All-Father — and also Shadow’s IRL dad. Until recently, Shadow was driving Wednesday across America to recruit the country’s forgotten gods, soliciting their aid in a coming war between them and the nation’s new ones. (I should probably note here that in the world of &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt;, worship is what makes them godlike, so the forgotten old gods are mostly normal people with a few mythic tricks.) These new gods represent our modern obsessions: new media, technology, and so on. But Shadow is done with that. He makes a home for himself in Lakeside, Wisconsin, an idyllic small town where gods new and old will hopefully leave him the hell alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUB7D1"&gt;Naturally, they do not, because Shadow has a part to play. So does his dead wife Laura (Emily Browning), who has been wandering Earth as an undead revenant with the leprechaun Mad Sweeney (Pablo Schreiber, sadly missing this season outside of some flashbacks), along with an eclectic cast of gods and those who know them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5u0w1"&gt;All of this is rather perfunctory. The third season of &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt; is an attempt to restore lost momentum from the second season, taking advantage of a grace note in the novel it’s slowly adapting — its protagonist’s sojourn in a small town — to rebuild itself. The show can’t introduce many new pieces because it’s too busy trying to account for the old ones, and its tools are limited because it has committed to a relatively faithful adaptation of the novel on which it is based. Its destination is &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; set, which means that in the meantime, the show has to get a little creative in how it gets there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySDKSs"&gt;The result is something that’s underwhelming to watch but fascinating to think about. In our modern, tightly managed, IP-driven entertainment environment, it’s rare to see an ongoing production implode in such a catastrophic manner and then somehow manage to right itself. In this, it’s a pretty good reminder that television is a uniquely malleable and chaotic medium. (This despite the recent popularity of the prestige format, which often has shorter runs and planned endings that make it easy to forget that having a strict narrative plan is often a recipe for disaster in TV.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rftvSQ"&gt;Actors depart, new showrunners are brought in, and the collaborative nature of the medium makes for stories that veer far away from what was originally intended. Consider &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt;, which initially &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqnoJ10HqP0"&gt;planned to kill fan-favorite&lt;/a&gt; character Jesse Pinkman, and began its acclaimed final season &lt;a href="https://uproxx.com/sepinwall/breaking-bad-10th-anniversary-vince-gilligan/"&gt;with a shot that the writers did not know how they would justify&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1MEYW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt;’ third season effort to right itself has undoubtedly left us with a lesser show — call it the underwhelming cable adaptation as opposed to the exciting premium project it started as. But its chaotic journey is also a worthwhile reminder: despite all the promise of peak TV’s bold new frontier where just about any kind of show can be made, this is still the old gods’ domain.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US consumers spent record amounts on video games in 2020, NPD reports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AGXhDGAQbqSr2bpyHIVx6hd0IU0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68674024/jbareham_1492_170228_0097.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Lcq20r"&gt;Spending on video games set a new record of $56.9 billion in 2020 in the US, according to a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1350078857970270209"&gt;new NPD Group report&lt;/a&gt;, a 27 percent increase compared to 2019. Spending on hardware hit its highest level since 2011 at $5.3 billion, a 35 percent increase compared to 2019. NPD classifies video game spending as money spent at retail and digital storefronts on “video game hardware, content, and accessories.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t92QEi"&gt;Although last year saw the release of the PS5 and new Xbox consoles, it was Nintendo’s Switch that took the crown as the bestselling platform over the course of the year. It was number one in terms of both dollar sales and units sold. The PS5 was the second bestselling console in terms of dollar sales, while the PS4 was in second place in terms of units sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fP1MI7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Dec 2020 US NPD THREAD - December 2020 consumer spending across video game hardware, content and accessories reached a December record $7.7B, 25% higher when compared to a year ago. Full year spending also set a new record, totaling $56.9B, 27% higher than 2019. &lt;a href="https://t.co/JFTL7eOEat"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JFTL7eOEat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mat Piscatella (@MatPiscatella) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1350078857970270209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k55Sdv"&gt;Nintendo was similarly dominant in software, publishing 10 out of the 20 bestselling games of the year. However, the top two bestselling games were both &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, with &lt;em&gt;Black Ops: Cold War&lt;/em&gt; in first place and 2019’s &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare&lt;/em&gt; in second place. NPD’s Mat Piscatella notes that the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; franchise has now been the bestselling gaming franchise in the US for a record 12 years straight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pUQPaE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="de" dir="ltr"&gt;US NPD SW - 2020 Top 20 Sellers &lt;a href="https://t.co/7B0sreCkLV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7B0sreCkLV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mat Piscatella (@MatPiscatella) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1350079277941755905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WNY5ym"&gt;It shouldn’t be surprising that people spent a lot of money on a primarily in-home form of entertainment in the same year as a global pandemic, especially when it coincided with new consoles launching. The surge in video game spending was apparent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328298/us-video-game-spending-high-npd-group-amount"&gt;as early as July&lt;/a&gt;, when NPD Group reported that US video game spending hit a 10-year high in June. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Signal outage is keeping messages from sending</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Signal for iOS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UKSTRNusoIgGlCgE5uD5KdiEPCc=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68673848/signal-003.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vCUInC"&gt;If you’re having trouble sending messages in the secure messaging app Signal, it may be due to technical difficulties the company says are affecting the app on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTatZu"&gt;Signal allows for secure and encrypted video, voice, and text communication, but users were greeted this morning with messages that failed to send. Signal confirmed the issue on its official Twitter account with the promise that it would “restore service as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yWfO9h"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Signal is experiencing technical difficulties. We are working hard to restore service as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;— Signal (@signalapp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1350118809860886528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zDoBrj"&gt;In the last week, Signal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218989/signal-new-signups-whatsapp-facebook-privacy-controversy-elon-musk"&gt;reported a surge of new users&lt;/a&gt; to its app following a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347165127036977153?s=20"&gt;recommendation from Tesla CEO Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; and a new WhatsApp privacy policy that may have driven users away from the Facebook-owned messaging service and into the arms of more secure options like Signal and competitor Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p9k9Ll"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;How it started vs how it's going   &lt;a href="https://t.co/ERiFpZUz6c"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ERiFpZUz6c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Signal (@signalapp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1349577579091566592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Z7tMb"&gt;There may not be a direct connection between the mass influx of new users and the outage, but it does guarantee that more people are going to be affected. We’ll keep an eye on the problem and update when Signal has more to share.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California man faces prison time after hitting police helicopter with a drone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="mavic drone remote" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xKve6XuQ9o3KoROdbCGqe8LZ7KA=/0x0:2200x1467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68673770/Mavic_Pro_remote.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M1DVcL"&gt;A California man is facing jail time for hitting a police helicopter with his drone. Andrew Hernandez &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/hollywood-man-pleads-guilty-federal-charge-he-recklessly-operated-drone-collided-and"&gt;pleaded guilty&lt;/a&gt; yesterday to unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft, a charge that carries up to one year in federal prison and a potential fine of up to $250,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVb9rn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/18716110/21/united-states-v-hernandez/"&gt;According to a plea agreement&lt;/a&gt;, Hernandez launched a small drone to see a crime scene near his Hollywood home in September. The drone flew into the path of a police helicopter that was responding to a burglary, hitting its fuselage and forcing an emergency landing. While the officers weren’t harmed, &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/18649200/1/united-states-v-hernandez/"&gt;an affidavit said&lt;/a&gt; that this was a lucky outcome — Hernandez’s drone could have accidentally struck the aircraft’s rotor and brought it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoOevh"&gt;Hernandez was &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/hollywood-man-arrested-federal-charge-alleging-he-recklessly-operated-drone-crashed-and"&gt;charged in November&lt;/a&gt; after police identified him via the drone’s memory card. He will be sentenced on April 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slMUfg"&gt;Flying a personal drone requires observing a patchwork of shifting rules about autonomous aircraft as well as following the bounds of good sense. And if Hernandez is imprisoned for reckless flying — which isn’t necessarily going to happen — he won’t be the first. A Washington man was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/27/14755116/jail-sentence-drone-crash-30-days-seattle"&gt;sentenced to 30 days in jail&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 after his drone knocked a woman unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro review: the right balance</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;They don’t win at any one thing, but they strike a great mix in terms of sound quality, ANC, and comfort&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="AsECWH"&gt;Let’s just get to it: Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro are the best true wireless earbuds that the company has made yet. For their $200 asking price, you get a comfortable fit, effective active noise cancellation, and good, punchy sound quality. These earbuds improve on Samsung’s prior efforts with clever features like a speech detection mode that automatically lowers your music and lets you hear the outside world as soon as you start talking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKEbln"&gt;But they also inch Samsung closer to a siloed-off world, not unlike Apple, where the best experience is reserved for people who stick to Samsung-branded devices. A few features like 3D audio and automatic device switching — sound familiar? — only work if you’re using these earbuds with a Samsung phone or tablet. Most people aren’t going to be cross-shopping the Galaxy Buds Pro and AirPods Pro since they’re designed for different mobile operating systems, but Samsung has never leaned into its own ecosystem with earbuds quite like this. Thankfully, there’s enough good for everyone else that the Galaxy Buds Pro still come out a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PhUVPZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10285664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="13x0D7"&gt;The Buds Pro are an amalgam of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; — they have an in-ear design with silicone tips — and the open-air &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt;, from which they borrow some style cues. The outer casing is a tasteful mix of glossy and matte finishes and has been redesigned to protrude less from your ear. Samsung says this revamped shell also “reduces the contact area between your ear and the bud, improving comfort and minimizing any clogged-up feeling.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URPBTW"&gt;The wing tips from the Galaxy Buds Plus are gone; Samsung got the message that some customers experienced discomfort from those over time. Instead, you get the usual three sizes of silicone ear tips, which are a bit shorter than before to help with the low-profile design. Samsung tells me it has considered including foam tips but has so far held off. You’ll also notice a section of mesh on the outside. This covers one of the three built-in microphones and is there to act as a wind shield for voice calls. (More on that later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3YM-r4tDPLQ584Vl5aHVf9vvqpQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236517/bfarsace_210114_4372_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ScRFM0"&gt;I really like how these earbuds fit. They feel stable and twist into place for a good seal in my ear canal, without making my ears feel too plugged up. The air vent and reduced contact area really do seem to make a difference there, and I appreciate that the Buds Pro don’t noticeably jut out from my ears like some competitors. If I have one critique, it’s an old one: more than a few times, I accidentally activated the touch-sensitive controls when trying to adjust the fit of an earbud. Such is life with tap gestures, I suppose. The controls can be turned off if this proves a problem for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgtG0M"&gt;According to Samsung, the Galaxy Buds Plus are rated IPX7 for water and sweat resistance, which means they can survive a half-hour swim in fresh water — so even your sweatiest runs and workouts shouldn’t present any problem. That’s the highest rating among any of Samsung’s earbuds and beats out the AirPods Pro, Jabra Elite 85t, and Bose Sport Earbuds, which are all IPX4. Either earbud can be used independently with mono audio if you prefer that option for voice calls or biking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ic6bbQ5pazL2xPMxsqg_NQV9CwI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236519/bfarsace_210114_4372_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xuUMnY"&gt;The wonderfully pocketable Buds Pro charging case is so close in size and shape to the Buds Live case that accessories for the latter will fit the former, and it still charges over both USB-C and Qi wireless charging. But endurance is one area where these earbuds settle for very average numbers. Samsung promises up to five hours of playback with ANC enabled (or eight with it off). Case top-offs put you at 18 hours of total battery life or 28 without noise cancellation. That’s basically on par with the rest of the field, but it doesn’t hold a candle to the 11 hours of continuous audio that the Galaxy Buds Plus are capable of. Alas, it turns out the Buds Pro have a smaller battery capacity (61mAh for each bud versus 85mAh) on top of their more power-hungry ANC feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYAtLF"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Pro have two-way speakers in each earbud: there’s an 11-millimeter woofer and 6.5mm tweeter. Those are larger than what was in the Buds Plus, though smaller than the single 12mm driver from the Buds Live; in that instance, Samsung was most focused on getting satisfactory bass out of an open-style earbud. Here, it’s aiming for “the most comprehensive sound in the Galaxy Buds line yet.” I can’t speak to what “comprehensive” is supposed to mean, but the Buds Pro are enjoyable to listen to, with a good bass thump, crisp treble, and a pleasant soundstage / imaging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDHevF"&gt;A lot of earbuds can make it feel like everything is happening in the middle of your head, but these do a solid job keeping instrumentation and vocals distinct. Sturgill Simpson’s “Oh Sarah” and Troye Sivan’s “Easy” (with Kacey Musgraves and Mark Ronson) make for nice showcases — in very different genres — of how layered the Buds Pro can get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3e7sR1"&gt;Bass heads might want to go for the “bass boost” EQ setting, and the tweeters can occasionally give off a little too much brightness and sibilance for some tracks like Jason Isbell’s “Be Afraid,” but for the most part I was very pleased with the sound signature. I don’t think Samsung hits the same fidelity as something like Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 2, but those are nearly $100 more expensive. I’d be perfectly content with the Buds Pro as my daily earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yNW734sCMRRYOoDN8UucyACpbg0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236520/bfarsace_210114_4372_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Buds Pro blend design aspects of the Galaxy Buds Plus and Galaxy Buds Live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9dzkSF"&gt;The active noise cancellation on the Galaxy Buds Pro is much better than the Galaxy Buds Live, where it seems to barely do anything since there’s so much outside noise to contend with. Samsung claims that the Buds Pro can cut down on “up to 99 percent” of noise “at 118.43Hz,” which is wildly specific and won’t mean much to most people. In my experience, Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds, Sony’s WF-1000XM3 earbuds, and the AirPods Pro all outperform Samsung at quieting the world around you, but Samsung does a perfectly adequate job at muffling street noise and household distractions. You can choose between high and low levels of noise cancellation in case you’re sensitive to the effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3edOA"&gt;Samsung’s latest transparency / ambient mode still doesn’t sound as natural as what Apple and Bose have achieved, but it’s a definite improvement over the very digitized version from the Galaxy Buds Plus. And the fantastic “voice detect” feature, which automatically lowers audio volume and switches from ANC to ambient mode when you start talking, is one of the best things about the Galaxy Buds Pro. Sony did something similar on its 1000XM4 headphones, but I haven’t seen this convenient trick in many earbuds, and now I wish all of them at least had the option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHnSB0"&gt;Samsung uses a “voice pickup unit” — basically an accelerometer that senses jaw movement — to know that it’s you talking and not someone nearby. After a few seconds of no more talking, ANC returns and your music gets turned back up. Voice detect works as expected, but if you’ve got a tendency to talk to yourself or sing to your music, you might want to keep it disabled and assign ambient sound to a long press of one of the earbuds. Controls work the same way as other Samsung buds, with a single tap to pause / play, double to skip to the next song, triple to go back, and a customizable long press that can be used for volume, voice assistants, or ambient mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXp56T"&gt;For voice calls, Samsung has a three-mic system and uses beamforming to isolate your voice from your environment. The lower profile of the Buds Pro helps combat wind noise, and the mesh-covered chamber does a good job filtering out any gusts if you’re talking with someone outside. Clarity is also good, as you should be able to hear in Becca’s video review above. Speaking of voice, the Galaxy Buds Pro still have hands-free “Hey Bixby” capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ab6T8d"&gt;Pro as in… AirPods Pro?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="24qsnY"&gt;There’s no denying that a few features of the Galaxy Buds Pro are heavily influenced by Apple’s AirPods Pro. The first of these is 3D audio, which is Samsung’s take on the immersive spatial audio capabilities of the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. Load up a movie with Dolby surround, and the Buds Pro will attempt to cram a surround sound listening experience into a pair of earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKVdZA"&gt;Samsung says that 360 audio uses Dolby head tracking technology, which “enables you to stay at the center of the scene when you’re watching a movie or TV show.” In concept, this sounds similar to Apple’s approach, which uses sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes in the earbuds and your iPhone or iPad to keep the sound source anchored to your device — even when you turn your head side to side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltdaZg"&gt;Unfortunately, I can’t tell you how convincing Samsung’s 3D audio is or whether it compares favorably to spatial audio because it requires OneUI 3.1, which for now is only available on the new Galaxy S21 lineup. The $1,300 Galaxy Note 20 Ultra that Samsung sent for this review doesn’t have that update yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="UErqKn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10285752"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VVvUyb"&gt;The second AirPods feature that Samsung has tried to directly counter is automatic switching. Apple’s earbuds can hop between an iPhone, iPad, or Mac depending on which one you’re using in that moment without you having to manually make the change. Samsung says it has now pulled off the same trick, so the Buds Pro should automatically switch between your Galaxy smartphone and tablet. Unfortunately, the laptop gets left out of Samsung’s equation completely, which makes the feature somewhat less helpful. I wish that more earbuds would just give us proper multipoint Bluetooth pairing to two devices at once; Jabra continues to be the standout there. Automatic switching feels like a makeshift solution until Samsung can get to multipoint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1eFw8"&gt;Both of these capabilities require you to be fairly entrenched in Samsung’s ecosystem. 3D audio only works on Samsung hardware, so if your Android phone is from a different brand, you lose out on it altogether. Same goes for auto-switching. If neither feature is important to you, that might not matter, but it’s something to keep in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRfglF"&gt;Also worth mentioning is that Samsung isn’t extending the same level of iOS support it has maintained for the Buds Plus and Buds Live: the existing iOS app doesn’t work with the Buds Pro, so you can’t use features like voice detect on iPhone. I’m not sure what the reasoning is there, but maybe Samsung’s internal data shows that not many people are pairing its earbuds to Apple devices. You can still pair them and use noise canceling and ambient modes — much like the way AirPods Pro function on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfZ2fi"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Pro face stiff competition everywhere you look, and you can find superior ANC and sound quality elsewhere. But with these latest earbuds, Samsung has blended much of what worked best about the Buds Plus and Buds Live. Battery life is merely average, but that’s the only real gripe I’ve got. They don’t necessarily win at any one category, but the Galaxy Buds Pro strike an excellent all-around balance. And you can clearly see Samsung trying to recreate some of the ecosystem “magic” that AirPods owners are now used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="YrJXKF"&gt;The Buds Pro feel great in your ears, sound better than any Samsung earbuds to date, and have convenient tricks to complement their decent noise cancellation. There’s still a place for the Galaxy Buds Plus if all you want are wireless earbuds with a battery that just goes and goes, and the Buds Live remain the better pick if you need environmental awareness at all times. But if you’re nabbing the Buds Pro as a preorder bonus for a new Galaxy S21, you should be more than satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ca9N59"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1S55s"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1bWBce"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzMgUL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttXwIT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0322me"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCs0Hg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WandaVision welcomes a new line of Earth’s first defense in the Marvel Cinematic Universe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/htDy-Qa4UY9dAgO8qwiLInx94bc=/133x0:1555x948/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68673094/wandavision_art.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vy41SB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision, &lt;/em&gt;the first original television series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22229076/wandavision-marvel-studios-disney-plus-streaming-loki-falcon-winter-solider-black-widow-theatrical"&gt;produced by Marvel Studios&lt;/a&gt;, isn’t quite like anything Marvel has released before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4kIgT"&gt;It’s absurdist and pays authentic tribute to some of the best American sitcoms produced in the 1950s, ‘60s, ‘70s, and ‘80s, including &lt;em&gt;Bewitched &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; The Dick Van Dyke Show. WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;is still a Marvel Studios show, however, and that means it ties into the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe. The first two episodes, now streaming on Disney Plus, set up a key organization that ties &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22231578/wandavision-marvel-studios-disney-plus-streaming-characters-mcu-audience"&gt;the current Marvel Cinematic Universe’s&lt;/a&gt; moment, while also setting up the enticing “cosmic universe” era it’s about to enter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJxSYm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[This is your mandatory spoiler warning. Stop reading here if you don’t want to know anything that happens in the first two episodes.] &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMBu5m0LOJeZE5XYdDdc0Hk_GyA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22237729/Screen_Shot_2021_01_15_at_9.42.24_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A S.W.O.R.D. agent watching Wanda and Vision.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TkPNnw"&gt;The first episode finds Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) living a charming suburban life in a fictional town. Although the show takes place after &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame, &lt;/em&gt;there’s no reference to anything that happened — no explanation for how Vision is suddenly alive, why they’re living in an alternate, dreamlike world, or why they can’t remember anything that came before moving into their new house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vmssmA"&gt;Throughout the first episode, there are a few hints that all is not what it appears for Wanda and Vision. Vision reiterates that Wanda came from Sokovia, and during a dinner scene, Wanda is transfixed by one specific question: “Why did you come here?” It’s not until the end of the episode, however, that &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;finds its most interesting reveal: the presence of S.W.O.R.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iYePaz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is S.W.O.R.D.?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="knIC15"&gt;S.W.O.R.D., or Sentient World Observation and Response Department, is a cosmic version of S.H.I.E.L.D. Most MCU fans know S.H.I.E.L.D. It’s the organization that Howard Stark and Peggy Carter started and Nick Fury oversees, designed to employ superbeings as Earth’s mightiest defenders from supernatural threats — Loki’s attack on New York City or Ultron’s attack on Sokovia. S.H.I.E.L.D. was famously infiltrated by Hydra, as seen in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/1/5566896/captain-america-the-winter-soldier-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s key as &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;includes a reference to Wolfgang von Strucker. In the MCU, von Strucker was a Hydra sleeper agent within S.H.I.E.L.D. who is seen holding custody of Wanda and her twin brother Pietro in a &lt;em&gt;Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; post-credits&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;scene and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/22/8464479/avengers-age-of-ultron-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron’&lt;/em&gt;s opening battle&lt;/a&gt;. It’s these little moments that tie Wanda and Vision back to the MCU-at-large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BOwGEr"&gt;Fine, that’s S.H.I.E.L.D.; what about S.W.O.R.D? The organization first appeared in &lt;em&gt;Astonishing X-Men #3&lt;/em&gt;, which was written by Joss Whedon back in 2004. (Fun fact: the first appearance of anything S.W.O.R.D. related in the MCU is a tiny Easter egg in &lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron&lt;/em&gt;, which Whedon also directed.) The organization was originally created to defend the entire universe from extraterrestrial threats. Run by Abigail Brand, a woman who is basically a space-based, mutant version of Nick Fury, the whole idea was to act as an intelligence agency based outside of Earth. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A man in a beekeeper outfit with the S.W.O.R.D. logo on the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tmcC7k"&gt;The most memorable nod to S.W.O.R.D. arrived in the form of a &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Far From Home &lt;/em&gt;post-credits scene. Fury, seemingly on vacation, walks out onto the deck of a spaceship while a bunch of Skrull (those green aliens from &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt;) are walking around. It’s clear that Marvel Studios is setting up S.W.O.R.D. to appear and possibly connect the fourth and fifth phases of the MCU, but what does it mean for &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ERdbVY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It all ties together &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2DYxhD"&gt;Interestingly enough, S.W.O.R.D’s name in &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;is changed slightly to Sentient Weapon Observation Response Division. This could just be a title change (the definition of S.H.I.E.L.D in the MCU is slightly different from the comics), but it could also point to Wanda being imprisoned in a fictional world where S.W.O.R.D. is watching &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;. Monica Rambeau, who originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251874/captain-marvel-review-marvel-mcu-brie-larson-samuel-l-jackson"&gt;appeared in &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as Maria Rambeau’s (Carol Danvers’ best friend) daughter, is now an adult and an agent of S.W.O.R.D., based on official Topps playing cards released ahead of &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJFkZ7"&gt;Small, visual glitches that appear in the sky insinuate Wanda and Vision are trapped in an artificial world, and the final scene of the first episode confirms that S.W.O.R.D. agents are watching their every move. In the second episode, even more clues appear. A voice coming through a radio (it sounds like &lt;em&gt;Ant-Man&lt;/em&gt;’s Agent Jimmy Woo) asks Wanda, “Who’s doing this to you?” Later on in the episode, Wanda suddenly becomes pregnant. She asks Vision if “this is really happening,” and after he first reflects that something seems off, time suddenly rewinds and he changes his answer to a simple, “Yes, this is really happening.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1sDSO1FTf3lFgafz37K6gNaX7Eo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22237747/Screen_Shot_2021_01_15_at_9.48.39_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monica Rambeau talking Wanda.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O41QPu"&gt;The most important moment happens when Wanda and Vision are standing in the middle of the street after hearing a noise. A beekeeper emerges from a manhole, the S.W.O.R.D. logo on his back. Wanda, fear-stricken, utters a simple “no,” and everything goes back to normal — well, her version of normal. If the title change does mean Wanda is being watched as a possible sentient weapon (we still have no idea what happened to Vision’s actual body), it would play slightly into her arc in the &lt;em&gt;House of M &lt;/em&gt;comics, where Wanda creates a fictional reality to cope with a devastating loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TIINi"&gt;Here’s where some fun predictions come in. Marvel Studios needs to unite its new group of superheroes, many of which are tied into other planets. Remember when Captain Marvel&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;told the makeshift &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18513309/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review-marvel-cinematic-universe-iron-man-thor-captain-america-phase-4"&gt;council of Avengers in &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that when Thanos snapped his fingers, it devastated a bunch of other planets, too? The way they can do that is through S.W.O.R.D. We already know that &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;connects to &lt;a href="https://collider.com/elizabeth-olsen-interview-wandavision-doctor-strange-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/comics/discover/258/house-of-m-the-complete-event"&gt;&lt;em&gt;House of M&lt;/em&gt; comic series&lt;/a&gt;, Professor X reveals that he brought in Doctor Strange to try to break Wanda’s fictional reality. It doesn’t work, but it’s possible that Doctor Strange could work with S.W.O.R.D. in &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;to try something similar.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRL2Ew"&gt;It also seems likely that Monica Rambeau &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/captain-marvel-2-ms-marvel-monica-rambeau-mcu-sequel"&gt;will also appear&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel 2&lt;/em&gt;. The character was in the first &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel,&lt;/em&gt; and, considering that Fury seemed like he was working with S.W.O.R.D. at &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/16/20693929/spider-man-far-from-home-post-credits-scene-fury-skrull-sword"&gt;the end of &lt;em&gt;Far From Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not too much of a stretch to assume that Carol Danvers, Nick Fury, and Monica Rambeau all know and continue to work with each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="akNBIG"&gt;Remember: &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;wasn’t originally supposed to air until the end of this year, closer to &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel 2&lt;/em&gt;’s release date&lt;/a&gt;, and after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21437889/black-widow-delayed-release-date-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-streaming-mulan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eternals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Not to mention that with X-Men and the Fantastic Four under Feige’s belt — and a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168833/the-fantastic-four-marvel-studios-cinematic-universe-jon-watts"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantastic Four &lt;/em&gt;movie in the works&lt;/a&gt; — using S.W.O.R.D. to connect everything the &lt;a href="https://ew.com/article/2012/05/17/avengers-marvel-movie-timeline/"&gt;way S.H.I.E.L.D. did&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Iron Man, Captain America: First Avenger, Thor, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Avengers&lt;/em&gt;, is a good way to do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9fvHj"&gt;It seems like &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;will spend its first season determining whether S.W.O.R.D. is an ally or an enemy. More importantly for the MCU, having fans dive into S.W.O.R.D. before &lt;em&gt;The Eternals, Captain Marvel 2&lt;/em&gt;, and other cosmic movies is a good place to get people acquainted with the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3sZQNm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A brief chat with Storymodebae</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7ePyoeJLEir9nwz1TBHG-3JyRp0=/0x0:1287x858/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68672864/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_5.20.29_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wRWxWS"&gt;Briana became &lt;a href="http://twitch.tv/storymodebae"&gt;Storymodebae&lt;/a&gt; when she started her Twitch channel in January 2018. Back then she was still a year away from graduating from college, and in her own words, got the idea to start making things online after she started watching Let’s Plays on YouTube when she found herself stuck in games. “I was like, ‘I mean, I like playing video games and I think I can crack a joke on occasion. So maybe I should give this a try.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwHMRg"&gt;Three years later, Storymodebae has made Twitch her full-time career — though she’s still understandably a little nervous about putting her full name online. (“You know, I don’t put the government out there,” she jokes.) Last year, Storymodebae hosted three shows for Twitch — &lt;em&gt;This is Dope&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Follow Fridays&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Weekly — &lt;/em&gt;and also live concert shows for Live Nation. Her come up has been a wonderful thing to see: she’s a very visible Black woman in a scene dominated by white guys, and her streams are &lt;em&gt;fun &lt;/em&gt;to boot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zadzd4"&gt;And that’s kind of the reason she started in the first place. “I decided that I wanted to start streaming because I would look for Let’s Plays and things like that, but I didn’t see a whole lot of people that looked like me,” she says. “I saw Black men on YouTube. But as far as Black women, it’s like you have to type in “Black girl gamers” or these specific keywords so you could kind of find your tribe and find your people.” So she gave it a shot herself. “And it kind of turned into all of this. It started as a hobby, and now it’s the whole career.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5Af4ap"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=BitterOddHerdTTours&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9RqEx3"&gt;Today, when she’s not hosting shows, you can find Briana &lt;a href="http://twitch.tv/storymodebae"&gt;live on her own channel&lt;/a&gt;, where she mostly plays single-player games. “I focus on story based games. That’s where Storymodebae came from,” she says. Though lately she says she’s felt at a loss for finding new games to play. “It’s like, the last game I was really excited about was &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;. And then I thought I was gonna be excited about &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt;. And I wasn’t.” (Though, to be fair, hardly anyone was.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMpZya"&gt;This week marks her third anniversary on Twitch, and it’s clear she’s come a long way from those early days when she was streaming without a camera; today, for example, she’s being featured in &lt;em&gt;InStyle&lt;/em&gt; magazine on a list of badass women. Which she says is exciting, but it’s not exactly her goal. “My goal with streaming, if nothing else — I really want to inspire,” she says.  “I want to inspire people that look like me, specifically women that, you know, they can do this too. And there’s room for them as well.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5U9d2r"&gt;It’s a noble mission. “As we know, the gaming industry is a very white male-dominated and, as we saw with everything going on with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229209/criticalbard-pogchamp-gootecks-hasanabi-twitch-emote-harassment"&gt;PogChamp emotes&lt;/a&gt;, people will make it clear that they don’t want people of color, specifically Black people in this industry,” she says. “I definitely want to kick down doors and open doors not even just for myself, but for others that look like me as well.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQ757n"&gt;And she has. Briana’s been more successful in three years that most people ever become on Twitch; she’s hosting shows for thousands, that sometimes land on the site’s front page. Even so, despite all the success the last year has brought, Briana says that 2020 was tough. Which makes sense, considering the global pandemic and the continuing rise of the authoritarian right. “Personally, I feel like it was the hardest year I’ve ever experienced,” she says. “I went through depression, second-guessing myself, and impostor syndrome. And, you know, dealing with everything going on in the news and with COVID. And the government.” But in terms of business, and in terms of streaming specifically, she says it was the most successful year she’s ever had. (This year, Briana tells me, she plans to be kinder to herself, and mostly just to keep her sanity intact.  “You can’t be in front of the computer all the time,” she says.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmj3m0"&gt;2020 was also Twitch’s best year ever. The number of hours people spent watching Twitch have nearly doubled since last year, and the pandemic meant that the gaming influencer landscape had begun to shift and become much more mainstream. While Briana jokes that she wishes she’d found streaming earlier — “so I wouldn’t have all this student debt” — she does feel like she came into the space at an interesting time. Numbers matter less when working with brands, and, she says, brands are starting to realize the content and viewer engagement is more important when choosing who to partner with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eQkW8H"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=AliveAdventurousEggnogSaltBae&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L7rtNy"&gt;Even so, Briana says she wants to diversify her output. “What happened with Mixer really solidified something in my head, like, ‘OK, all of this could be gone tomorrow. What’s going to happen after that? What are you going to do?’” she says. “If all of my content is in one place, what am I gonna do if it’s gone tomorrow?” It’s led her back to YouTube, where she got her start, and also to TikTok. “While Twitch is starting to become a household name, a lot of people still don’t get it,” she says. Even her own family, it’s a strange conversation to have — she was in school to become a teacher, and now she plays games online for her community, the Bae Brigade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGlGpm"&gt;By now it’s the end of our interview, and I ask my favorite interview question — is there anything that I should have asked you that I didn’t? “OK, so I was starting to think maybe we should use my full name,” she says. “It’s Briana Williams. I feel like you know, 2021 is the year that I maybe start using my government name.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4iPuAk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUJHNb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to delete your Facebook account</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3sYy8rKh0cwIfLUFjJKm-l3oZWk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68672679/acastro_180319_1777_facebook_data_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="amc9vX"&gt;\\If you’ve finally given up on the world’s most popular social media network, it’s not too complicated to remove yourself from the service. But before you delete all of those pictures, posts, and likes, you should download your personal information from Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fv7htI"&gt;Your Facebook archives contain just about &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/405183566203254?helpref=faq_content"&gt;all of the pertinent information related to your account&lt;/a&gt;, including your photos, active sessions, chat history, IP addresses, facial recognition data, and which ads you clicked, just to name a few. That’s a ton of personal information that you should probably maintain access to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAnPVG"&gt;To download your archive using the web:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tB7vax"&gt;Click on the “down” arrow in the upper right corner. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Kt1gj6"&gt;Go to “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy” &amp;gt; “Settings.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lgR1ve"&gt;In the left-hand column, click on “Your Facebook Information.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cDMGa3"&gt;In the center, find and click on “Download Your Information.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HTwPMi"&gt;You can select which info you want to download (or you can just download all of it). At the top of the page, there are drop-down lists that let you create a date range (if you want to), download your data in either HTML or JSON, and choose between high, medium, or low media quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mvP37T"&gt;When you’re ready, click on “Create File.” You’ll get notified via email when your file is ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can choose which Facebook data you want to download." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lUZk4Q6xFgcb5peanneSZXgHkOA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236250/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_3.55.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can choose which Facebook data you want to download.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SMQa5r"&gt;After you’ve finished downloading your archive, you can now delete your account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KtRjWX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beware: once you delete your account, it cannot be recovered. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpYFGE"&gt;When you are ready to delete your account, go back to the page headed “Your Facebook Information” and click on “Deactivation and Deletion.” Here, you can choose between temporarily deactivating your account or permanently deleting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zOhLic"&gt;If you want to delete it, either click on “Delete Account” on that page, or click &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;, which will take you to the same account deletion page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96KTd8"&gt;You’ll get another chance here to download your archive or choose deactivation rather than deletion. Once you click “Delete My Account,” your account will be marked for termination and inaccessible to others using Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Before you delete your account, you get another chance to deactivate or download your info." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EbEa6byRI3aXdADpgdcF41SDzLE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236285/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_4.06.50_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before you delete your account, you get another chance to deactivate or download your info.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4kAsuU"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/125338004213029?helpref=uf_permalink"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that it delays termination for a few days after it’s requested. If you log back in during that period, your deletion request will be canceled. So don’t sign on, or you’ll be forced to start the process over again. Certain things, like comments you’ve made on a friend’s post, may still appear even after you delete your account. Facebook also says that copies of certain items like log records will remain in its database, but it notes that those are disassociated with personal identifiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9tXW7T"&gt;If you’re really serious about quitting Facebook, remember that the company owns several other popular services as well, like Instagram and WhatsApp, so you should delete your accounts there, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbiWVi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 9:15AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on September 28th, 2018 and has been updated to allow for changes in the Facebook interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
