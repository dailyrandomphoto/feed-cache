    <title>Clubhouse embraces spatial audio for more lifelike conversations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rd__2oO0onevj913JZnY7CllLAQ=/0x155:1024x838/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69792065/Leah_Full.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leah Lamarr is currently featured as the Clubhouse icon.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Clubhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xjif2O"&gt;Clubhouse began rolling out a iOS app update on Sunday that enables &lt;a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/spatial-audio-clubhouse/"&gt;spatial audio support&lt;/a&gt;. The Android update is “coming soon,” according to the company. The feature works by introducing subtle spatial cues that position speakers on Clubhouse calls into three-dimensional space around your head, making the remote listening experience a better approximation of being in a room full of people. It works best with headphones, either Bluetooth or wired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkE178"&gt;Clubhouse tweeted out a video allowing you to hear for yourself how it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BB2ytc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hear ye, hear ye   spAAaAaAatial audio on Clubhouse!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's like surround sound, but w/ your own headphones. A more vibrant, human experience! Plus makes it much easier to tell who's talking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/juberti?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@juberti&lt;/a&gt; for this one    rolling out now on iOS, Android coming soon! &lt;a href="https://t.co/Zit6F9ijRK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Zit6F9ijRK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Clubhouse (@Clubhouse) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Clubhouse/status/1432014506247417860?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9YCUeg"&gt;Clubhouse’s implementation of spatial audio first assigns a specific position to each speaker and then evenly distributes them around a room. It then applies HRTFs, or head related transfer functions, similar to what we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fresearch%2Fproject%2Fspatial-audio%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;used by Microsoft in the HoloLens&lt;/a&gt; to make it seem like you’re in the center of a conversation. Clubhouse’s implementation doesn’t include head tracking like Apple’s, which makes audio from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631444/netflix-spatial-audio-support-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; and Apple TV Plus shows seem like it’s coming from your playback device as you move your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2G0qS"&gt;Spatial audio is having a moment in 2021 after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;Apple embraced it&lt;/a&gt; across the company’s product lines. Sony added 3D audio to the PS5, and followed the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Amazon Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; with its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22360437/sony-srs-ra5000-speaker-review-360-audio-features"&gt;object-based 360-degree speaker&lt;/a&gt; this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567035/verizon-spatial-audio-adaptive-sound-motorola"&gt;Even Verizon is getting in on the game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GoPro’s next flagship action camera leaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uKnDpl0qIe7a83YC0sagpEj8c9o=/0x34:1700x1167/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69792009/GoPro_Hero10_Black_hero.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GoPro Hero 10 Black leaks in full.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,124840.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qrDJpe"&gt;Images and specs of the GoPro Hero 10 Black have apparently leaked in full. &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,124840.html"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which accurately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408480/gopro-hero9-leak-render-front-facing-display-full-color"&gt;leaked the redesigned Hero 9 Black&lt;/a&gt; at this same time last year, the new flagship GoPro action camera will look pretty much the same as last year’s miniature cam only with a more powerful GP2 processor of GoPro design inside for improved overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plNikH"&gt;The new GP2 processor is expected to provide a major boost in performance with support for 5.3K videos shot at a smooth 60fps, or 4K video recorded at 120fps which is useful for slo-mo. That’s an improvement from 5K30 and 4K60 on last year’s flagship. The Hero 10 Black can also record at 2.7K and 240fps for even more motion control but at reduced resolution. There’s also a new image sensor that bumps photo resolution from 20 megapixels to 23 megapixels, according to marketing materials and packaging seen by &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eETVQ0phJoM7WXhpxRynLaBRTfw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22814344/GoPro_Hero10_Black_1630067101_0_0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The front display carries over from last year but the blue logo is new.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DEULer"&gt;GoPro’s excellent in-camera software stabilization is also seeing an update to HyperSmooth 4.0 and TimeWarp 3.0 for time-lapse videos. Features like a watertight housing up to a depth of 10 meters, touch and voice control, and front and rear displays carry over from last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f515Mv"&gt;Ther’s no pricing or release information yet (the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgopro.com%2Fen%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fhero9-black%2Ftech-specs%3Fpid%3DCHDHX-901-master&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F30%2F22648027%2Fgopros-hero-10-black-leak-specs-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hero 9 Black currently costs $399.99&lt;/a&gt; without a subscription), but if history holds then an announcement should be coming within the next few weeks. &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,124840.html"&gt;Check out &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for even more pics until then.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch Series 7 reportedly has flat sides and bigger screens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 6, in Product Red" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q3FJ6kTRJM7msaX0SC0af6SVElI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69791607/vpavic_200929_4216_0128.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eE2i2p"&gt;The upcoming Apple Watch will feature its first new hardware design in years, according to Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman’s &lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt; newsletter. Gurman says the Apple Watch Series 7 will have “a flatter display and edges,” seemingly continuing Apple’s quest to flatten the sides of every product in its lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3pmZVT"&gt;The display is said to be slightly larger than the current panels found in the Series 6, and the cases’ sizes will also be a little bigger than before, with each model getting a 1mm bump to 41mm and 45mm. Unverified leaked images last week suggested the same &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1430866547787149315"&gt;41mm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1430698847450189824"&gt;45mm&lt;/a&gt; sizing. Gurman says Apple will include multiple new watch faces to make the most of the extra screen real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HgOepv"&gt;Physical appearance aside, the Series 7 will also have a faster processor, according to Gurman. However, there reportedly won’t be any major health-focused upgrades this year, though Apple “may” include a body-temperature sensor in next year’s model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WVxDPW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 6 review: minute improvements","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WGSRhu"&gt;An updated design for the Series 7 would continue an every-three-years cadence for major Apple Watch hardware refreshes. The first and last time Apple changed the case design of the Apple Watch was the Series 4; that basic appearance has remained unchanged through the Series 6, save the introduction of new materials and finishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7ZLo0"&gt;Apple usually announces new watches in September, so a reveal for the Series 7 may not be far off. Last year the Series 6 and SE watches were a headline announcement at Apple’s September event, since the iPhone 12 unveiling was pushed back to October.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>“Extremely dangerous” Hurricane Ida strengthens dramatically overnight </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k4GiXzierwUf33dnL-cDFKFhV1s=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69789949/latest.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A satellite image of Hurricane Ida over the Gulf of Mexico. | GOES-East NOAA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MxaNmA"&gt;Hurricane Ida is pummeling Louisiana as an “extremely dangerous” storm after strengthening rapidly over the weekend. The hurricane swirled towards the coast with winds of 150 miles per hour, accompanied by a life-threatening surge of water, forecasters with the National Hurricane Center &lt;a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/291157.shtml?"&gt;warned on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oni6Do"&gt;“This will be one of the strongest hurricanes to hit anywhere in Louisiana since at least the 1850s,” Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/27/us/ida-forecast.html"&gt;said at a press conference&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday. The storm &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NHC_Atlantic/status/1432024656932794373"&gt;made landfall just before noon&lt;/a&gt; local time, near Port Fourchon, Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zN1Co1"&gt;Ida already had wind speeds of 103 miles per hour on Saturday night. Just six hours later, the storm had strengthened into a major hurricane with wind speeds increasing to 130 miles per hour. Soon after, it had strengthened even more—&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NHC_Atlantic/status/1432024656932794373?s=20"&gt;making landfall as a Category 4 hurricane&lt;/a&gt; with sustained winds up to 150 miles per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RlM9FJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NOAA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NOAA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GOESEast?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GOESEast&lt;/a&gt;  ️ is tracking the extremely dangerous Cat. 4 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HurricaneIda?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#HurricaneIda&lt;/a&gt;, expected to bring a life-threatening storm surge and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/hurricane?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#hurricane&lt;/a&gt;-force winds to the coast of southeastern &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Louisiana?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Updates: &lt;a href="https://t.co/arzjJiHnjF"&gt;https://t.co/arzjJiHnjF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LAwx?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#LAwx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MSwx?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MSwx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ida?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Ida&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IdaHurricane?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#IdaHurricane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ElscY3GZOB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ElscY3GZOB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NOAA Satellites (@NOAASatellites) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NOAASatellites/status/1431963481130086402?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xduS0X"&gt;The storm was able to intensify so quickly because it had &lt;a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2021/al09/al092021.discus.010.shtml?"&gt;all the ingredients&lt;/a&gt; a hurricane needs to grow. Warm waters below the hurricane and plenty of moisture in the atmosphere provided fuel for the storm, while winds in the upper atmosphere favored the hurricane. All those factors allowed it to keep developing and prevented it from weakening before landfall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZnckc"&gt;“Ida found the perfect path across the gulf, where the warmest water is,” Chris Slocum, a researcher at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/29/climate/hurricane-ida-category.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “You could say it’s a worst-case scenario.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fi88s7"&gt;Rapidly intensifying hurricanes have developed many times in the past few years, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/25/16207190/hurricane-harvey-category-four-intensity-warm-water-gulf"&gt;Harvey in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/10/17960272/hurricane-michael-category-strength-florida-panhandle-intensity"&gt;Michael in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. This rapid intensification may be caused in part by climate change, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08471-z"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; studies suggest. A recent United Nations report also found that storms a&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;re becoming stronger&lt;/a&gt; as the planet warms. Other factors, including cyclical changes in the ocean and atmosphere, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/08/27/hurricane-laura-rapid-intensification/"&gt;may also play a role&lt;/a&gt; in rapid intensification — researchers are actively gathering more data about how the process works so that they can better predict when storms like Ida are likely to develop.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="L0nmmo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Do not play around&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="frMX2d"&gt;Ida made landfall on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina hitting the state.  Hurricanes are &lt;a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php"&gt;categorized by wind speed&lt;/a&gt;, and Ida, currently a Category 4, is expected to bring catastrophic winds to the region. Along with the winds will come&lt;a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/surge/surge_intro.pdf"&gt; a storm surge&lt;/a&gt;, a huge pileup of water driven inland by the storm. F&lt;a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/291157.shtml?"&gt;orecasters predicted waters&lt;/a&gt; could reach heights of 12-16 feet in parts of Louisiana. Ida will also dump 10-18 inches of rainfall on the region, and some areas could see as much as two feet of rainfall, with the potential for more flooding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7BBbu"&gt;On Saturday, the National Weather Service office in New Orleans issued a &lt;a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=LIX&amp;amp;issuedby=LIX&amp;amp;product=AFD&amp;amp;format=CI&amp;amp;version=3&amp;amp;glossary=1"&gt;dire warning to residents in its forecast discussion&lt;/a&gt; that underscores the seriousness of the storm: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="wpsDP3"&gt;These are the last few hours to prepare or leave. Conditions are expected to deteriorate late tonight and especially tomorrow morning. Once sustained tropical storm force winds move in first responders will button down and YOU WILL BE ON YOUR OWN. Please understand this, there is the possibility that conditions could be unlivable along the coast for some time and areas around New Orleans and Baton Rouge could be without power for weeks. We have all seen the destruction and pain caused by Harvey, Michael, and Laura. Anticipate devastation on this level and if it doesn`t happen then we should all count our blessings...Do not play around and say “I`ve been through Andrew/Camille/Katrina/Betsy” all storms are different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="e91dJu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 8/29 3:30 PM ET: This post has been updated with information about Ida’s landfall, and path across the Gulf.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 could have satellite connectivity</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Kjyga"&gt;Finally a fun iPhone 13 rumor! If Apple holds to its traditional schedule we’re mere weeks away from a new iPhone, and until now the rumors have been slight and, dare I say boring. Yet noted Apple prognosticator and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is now claiming the iPhone 13 could have the ability to make satellite calls built right in, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/29/iphone-13-to-feature-leo-to-make-calls-and-text/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j35M46"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The X60 would likely be supporting another element of 5G&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ErnFaS"&gt;In a note to investors, Kuo claims that the iPhone 13 will be able to connect directly to low earth orbit (or LEO) satellites thanks to a customized Qualcomm X60 baseband chip. LEO satellites are probably best known as the backbone of Elon Musk’s Starlink internet service which relies on satellites in a lower orbit to beam internet down to customers and avoid some of the common pitfalls of satellite internet, including high latency, and common blackouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFD2U2"&gt;But Starlink isn’t the only company using LEO satellites for connectivity. Hughesnet and OneWeb have combined forces to roll out a competitor to Starlink and &lt;a href="https://www.inmarsat.com/en/about/technology/orchestra.html"&gt;Immarsat announced a new constellation&lt;/a&gt; intended to blend with terrestrial 5G networks for a more global solution. More crucial for this iPhone rumor is Globalstar, which &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/globalstar-stock-price-qualcomm-iot-devices-5g-modem-satellite-technology-2021-2"&gt;saw its stock skyrocket&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year when Qualcomm announced its upcoming X65 chip would support Globalstar’s Band n53 tech. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-businesswire/da8bf860a2be436c8ce7b886c8dd3d67"&gt;3GPP had previously approved Band n53 as a 5G band&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ELbxsr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Everything you need to know about 5G","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="v2Tuej"&gt;If this rumor is true the X60 would likely be supporting another element of 5G, which is currently comprised of a whole mix of technologies, including the ultrafast but limited range millimeter-wave and the more widespread, but slower C-Band. LEO 5G would provide support in places that don’t yet have towers beaming down the other forms of 5G speed—particularly useful in many rural areas that often struggle to get 3G or 4G connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="txbaUQ"&gt;What that means for battery life remains to be seen. There’s also the tree factor. Hopefully, the X60 chip in the iPhone 13 won’t be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;as susceptible to arboreal interference&lt;/a&gt; as a Starlink’s Dishy McFlatface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46wKlU"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Astra rocket does a real smooth slide before failing to reach orbit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I_dIYFYIefFKP5c8PxsSaGV2zt4=/108x0:1287x786/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69790247/Capto_Capture_2021_08_29_11_34_48_AM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Astra LV0006 sliding across the launch pad after an engine failed to fire. | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8Tdm797BzM" target="_blank"&gt;NASASpaceflight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WU1Myl"&gt;Astra’s first rocket launch since it the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262004/astra-rocket-launch-startup-spac"&gt;company went public&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t exactly the success the company hoped for. An engine failing to fire a second into the launch caused the rocket to hover sideways before attempting to reach orbit. The flight safety crew purposely stalled the engines 2 minutes and 28 seconds into the flight after a piece of the rocket appeared to break off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUGToL"&gt;Before returning to earth it had reached an altitude of 31 miles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgUiQE"&gt;The two-stage Launch Vehicle 0006 (or LV0006) was originally scheduled to launch from the Pacific Spaceport Complex in Kodiak, Alaska on Friday, August 27. That launch was delayed until August 28 after the &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/astra-rocket-aborts-launch-with-us-military-payload"&gt;rocket’s guidance system called an abort&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/astra-rocket-fails-reach-space-military-test-flight"&gt;According to Space&lt;/a&gt; the initial abort was due to an engine configuration issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZRPNMv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was obviously not successful at putting anything in orbit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7Cdk9"&gt;While the second launch attempt failed to reach orbit Astra CEO Chris Kemp seemed optimistic &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/28/watch-rocket-builder-astra-make-second-attempt-at-a-rocket-launch-from-alaska.html"&gt;when speaking to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. “It was obviously not successful at putting anything in orbit, but it was a flight where we learned a tremendous amount.” He noted that the attempt contributed a “tremendous amount of data” that would be reviewed and that Astra planned to use what it had learned and apply it to the LV0007 currently in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiX4Lj"&gt;On Twitter Kemp noted the engine failed to fire but said he was “incredibly proud” of the Astra team for its performance during the launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7CfLLU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Reviewing flight data and video, two things are very clear - 1) An engine shut down right after launch 2) Everything that happened next made me incredibly proud of our team. Space may be hard, but like this rocket, we are not giving up.  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AdAstra?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AdAstra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/2g3n812EaW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2g3n812EaW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Kemp (@Kemp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Kemp/status/1431812555324854272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DdtPxC"&gt;You can watch the entire launch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8Tdm797BzM"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dating’s hard when you live the #vanlife</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQRPqMRuqes2QBi4vg45C0X3-I4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69789833/VRG_ILLO_4687_Van_Life_Dating.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Claudia Chinyere Akole&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Tinder doesn’t quite work for those living a ‘nomadic’ lifestyle&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="jX2E0q"&gt;Suriyan Ramasami’s first date with the professor from Sacramento was special. After matching on Bumble and texting and FaceTiming for a week, Ramasami suggested they meet in person. He reserved a table at Ruth’s Chris Steak House, drove two hours from the Bay Area to Sacramento, and even bought her a rose. They hit it off and scheduled a second date of hiking and dinner by a lake. It was then that Ramasami disclosed his living situation: “I don’t stay in an apartment or anything. I’m nomadic, and I actually love it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haBQIC"&gt;At first, the Sacramento professor was curious. But, soon after, she gave him the bad news: she wanted to just be friends. This wasn’t Ramasami’s first time in the “friend zone.” In fact, most of his experiences with online dating apps like Bumble, Hinge, and PlentyofFish played out similarly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r7Qrpl"&gt;Like Ramasami, many who consider themselves nomadic have tried to find love on the usual dating apps, like Tinder and Bumble, without much luck. Dating apps are generally meant to help you find a partner near you, but for vanlifers, they may not be near any place for too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3lUSej"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mentions of “nomad,” “RV,” and “van” in Tinder profiles are growing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GeWZS2"&gt;In Ramasami’s case, being “nomadic” means living out of his 2018 Subaru Outback. Especially during the past year, &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2021/02/17/van-life-coronavirus-pandemic-remote-work-mercedes-sprinter-van-life/4371726001/"&gt;many Americans have foregone apartments&lt;/a&gt; and houses for mobile homes like vans, RVs, or, in Ramasami’s case, their cars. &lt;a href="https://www.gorving.com/newsroom/rv-industry-association-manufacturing-statistics"&gt;Recent studies&lt;/a&gt; show that RV ownership increased by 26 percent during the past decade, and &lt;a href="https://www.rvia.org/news-insights/rv-shipments-reach-all-time-high-first-quarter-2021"&gt;sales of RVs broke records in March&lt;/a&gt; this year, with over 54,000 shipped to dealers in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcwI5p"&gt;Tinder tells us between February 1st and July 1st this year, mentions of “nomad” increased by 23 percent in profiles, while mentions of “RV” and “van” both increased by 8 percent. Still, these users sometimes strike out when they disclose their lifestyle to dates. Most apps use location as a parameter to surface potential matches, and if you’re on the move, that might not be the most accurate way to date. Plus, the apps don’t include a filter for people who move around frequently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hs2ycj"&gt;Now, other apps and websites have sprung up to address these issues — and they’re growing in popularity. There’s &lt;a href="https://nomadsoulmates.com/"&gt;Nomad Soulmates&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/nomadsoulmates/"&gt;Facebook group&lt;/a&gt; for remote workers and nomads to connect and date (the team says they are working on an app that is scheduled to release later this year). There’s &lt;a href="https://www.thevanlifeapp.com/"&gt;Sēkr&lt;/a&gt;, an app meant for vanlifers to find community and resources while on the move. Sēkr doesn’t market itself explicitly as a dating app, but &lt;a href="https://www.thevanlifeapp.com/blog/vanlife-dating-and-relationships-101"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; people in the community refer to it as the “Tinder of vanlife.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshots of Fairytrail showing a profile with a photo and text beneath it, options for “virtual adventures,” and a screen where users agree to chat in a virtual location." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PXnZAQjJewWt-dTd5_g7juDnIqE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802963/Screen_Shot_2021_08_24_at_1.33.35_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fairytrail&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J1dquL"&gt;There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.fairytrail.app/"&gt;Fairytrail&lt;/a&gt;, a dating app launched in 2019 for remote workers, nomads, and van dwellers. Taige Zhang, a remote worker himself and the founder of Fairytrail, says he initially launched the app as a travel-matching platform, to find people to travel with or share an Airbnb. But over time, he found more people using the app to date, so his team adjusted their strategy. They stopped accepting travel bookings and poured all their resources into the dating functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1gCx3n"&gt;The app has become increasingly popular among van dwellers throughout the pandemic, Zhang says, with an 1,100 percent increase in the number of Fairytrail profiles that mention the words “van,” “campervan,” or “RV” from February 2020 to July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7Ma0h0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have so much fun together and I’m like, ‘Oh man, how am I going to break up with this guy, you know, eventually?’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E1PGkM"&gt;Bryce Yates is one such person. He moved into his 1999 Chevy Astro van in November of 2019. He experienced similar problems to Ramasami’s on mainstream dating apps and says he’s struggled to convince people he owns a home but chooses to live on the road. To assure one woman he was seeing, Yates requested his then-tenant let the two of them see the place he was renting out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJWGWU"&gt;“In the back of my mind I’m thinking that if I have to convince someone like this, I don’t think I’ll be dating them for very long,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMrzUF"&gt;Ramasami believes that part of the problem is that as a society, we connect having a house with stability and security. “In general, a person looks for security, and security is tied to being in one place, being able to be a provider,” he says, adding that even though he sees himself as stable, his dates don’t often share the same opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKgvA7"&gt;While some vanlifers struggle to get dates because of a stigma against their lifestyle, for others, vanlife has proven to be an advantage, at least in the initial stages of the dating process. “If anything, I feel like I’m more attractive than ever living in my van,” says Amber Hawkins, who started her vanlife journey in a mini school bus about two years ago. Hawkins adds that in her experience, many men on dating apps were fascinated by her decision and expressed a desire to also do something similar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4cJtmL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These apps have a much smaller dating pool than mainstream competitors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8qhdNp"&gt;The challenge, for Hawkins, arises after she has already been on a couple dates with someone. She normally moves cities every season and often finds herself going through “mini-breakups.” For instance, Hawkins is currently in Portland, Maine, and has been going on dates with a man who she likes. “We have so much fun together and I’m like, ‘Oh man, how am I going to break up with this guy, you know, eventually?’” says Hawkins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syb2Qf"&gt;Hawkins has a profile on Fairytrail and says she likes the idea of a dating app for remote workers and vanlifers because ultimately, she is looking for someone who shares a similar lifestyle. Yates and Ramasami say they’ve had more success with Fairytrail than with mainstream dating apps because Fairytrail users tend to be more accepting of nontraditional housing situations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tl7D6G"&gt;Still, despite the app’s promise of romantic bliss, it doesn’t magically solve nomadic daters’ hurdles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEoCZk"&gt;Though there’s an almost even split between men and women on the app, Fairytrail and other apps dwindle in comparison to the size of mainstream dating apps, which makes the possible dating pool relatively small. For instance, as of July 2021, Fairytrail has a little under 20,000 users, whereas Tinder saw a turnout of &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/tinders-interactive-swipe-night-stories-return-after-a-20-million-user-turnout/"&gt;20 million&lt;/a&gt; people to use just one particular feature on the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DFlGDC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even for nomads, distance is still an issue&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dHd049"&gt;Also, because Fairytrail serves remote workers, users often find themselves speaking to someone thousands of miles away, sometimes on a different continent. Ramasami says he recently matched with someone in Portugal. She seems interesting, but realistically, he doesn’t see them meeting in person any time soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFqqVT"&gt;Plus, Ramasami says most women on Fairytrail are in their 20s. He, 51, doesn’t see himself dating someone that young because he doesn’t know if their priorities would match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="oiOC4d"&gt;Recently, he did find a woman closer in age, named Amy. He’s planning a trip to Mexico soon and hopes to meet her on his way. She’ll fly into New Mexico around the same time he’ll be passing through, and the two will meet there. For years, Ramasami has ridden alone in the driver’s seat of his Subaru Outback. Maybe, this time around, he can find someone who’d like to ride shotgun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>V-Moda BoomPro X review: turn your favorite headphones into the perfect gaming or Zoom headset</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;An easy way to upgrade your headphone microphone&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="4dp9Sl"&gt;There’s something to be said for cheap, simple gadgets. The BoomPro is a smart idea that’s executed almost perfectly. With a single cable, you get a microphone (with a flexible arm for easy repositioning), volume controls, and a mute switch. It can substitute for the 3.5mm audio cable that you’d normally plug into your favorite wireless headphones, immediately transforming them into a much better communication tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4eJdU"&gt;For years now, I’ve been using V-Moda’s BoomPro microphone to chat with people while gaming. During the pandemic, I’ve also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-BoomPro-Microphone-Gaming-Communication/dp/B00BJ17WKK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;regularly used the $35 accessory&lt;/a&gt; to improve the audio quality on my end of conference calls — when I don’t want to bother with my desk-mounted Rode microphone, that is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tj4Siy"&gt;This week, V-Moda announced a new evolution of that idea: &lt;a href="https://www.v-moda.com/us/en/products/boom-pro-x"&gt;the $45 BoomPro X&lt;/a&gt; has a tweaked design, revamped mic, and more streamlined controls. But otherwise it sticks largely to the same formula. You can plug it in when you’re sitting down for some multiplayer or joining a Zoom meeting, and then just detach the cable once you’re done and use your headphones like normal. Antlion’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YN25KWN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ModMic products are similar in concept&lt;/a&gt;, but they use a magnetic attachment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gdYomO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10722580"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OE5mLf"&gt;The best aspect of the BoomPro X is its versatility. You can instantly convert any headphones you already own into a gaming or conference call headset. Sure, V-Moda would love for you to use it with the company’s own headphones — but it’ll work equally well with other pairs like Sony’s WH-1000XM4 or Microsoft’s Surface Headphones 2. As long as you’ve got headphones with a detachable 3.5mm cable, you’re all set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMi6Dp"&gt;Some headsets (like those from Bose) use a smaller 2.5mm jack, but even then, you can use a 2.5mm-to-3.5mm adapter to get the BoomPro X working. USB-C adapters work fine too. In many cases, using the headphones you already love will also give you better sound quality than you’d get buying a single-purpose gaming headset. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NxcSmq3cIfEy133T7ZlwtMWEenQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22812067/DSCF4717_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The BoomPro X can be plugged into any set of wireless headphones that accepts a 3.5mm cable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CSGS5B"&gt;Compared to the original BoomPro, V-Moda has made quite a few changes. The most significant difference is the type of microphone being used: to help reduce background noise, it’s now a cardioid unidirectional mic that’s designed to only pick up sound coming from wherever it’s pointed. The older BoomPro used an omnidirectional mic, which allowed more ambient sound to come through. But now your voice should be better isolated when on work calls or in the middle of a hectic &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; match. I’ve regularly got either an air conditioner running or a fan blasting to combat the New York summer heat, and they’re not nearly as audible in my recordings with the new mic so far. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7G_qS9WKmfFZ79Aj7ZXzXFMS5ic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22812065/DSCF4705_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The microphone is now unidirectional and better at isolating your voice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Jrq2U7"&gt;In terms of mic audio quality, the BoomPro X certainly isn’t going to approach a proper podcasting setup or professional microphone. It seems to favor lower frequencies and lacks some crispness. But it’s definitely &lt;em&gt;clear&lt;/em&gt;, and you’ll get far better results than you normally would through the built-in mics on wireless headphones. The boom arm makes all the difference for clarity, and you don’t have to worry about nearby noise that your laptop’s mics would pick up during a work meeting. In my tests on both PS5 and Xbox Series X, everyone said my voice came through loud and clear without any annoying audio hiss or other distractions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rk5zvM"&gt;The onboard controls have also been redesigned and downsized. They now look much closer to the inline controls on many headphone cables, and the housing is much thinner and lighter. The old controls were so large that V-Moda included a non-removable clip for attaching the plastic to your clothes, but that’s gone — and so is the occasional pull/drag you’d feel from the previous, heavier controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2PLZG73yaGRU7TkDDVMJiHfKq-o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22812068/DSCF4722_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;V-Moda shrank down the controls, but that meant getting rid of the volume dial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vX9CUY"&gt;But the controls themselves have also changed. Instead of a dial for adjusting headphone volume, V-Moda switched to a slider. It does the job, but something about the dial felt more natural to me. On the other side is a mute switch, which works exactly as you’d expect. Since both of the controls now use similar slider buttons, it’s hard to distinguish between them by feel, which is another reason I preferred the old volume knob. But I don’t think V-Moda had much of a choice considering how much smaller the new controls are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYfmHW"&gt;The BoomPro X cable is shorter than the original, but in the box you get an extension cable if you need more length between your device and the headphones. (Both the standard cable and extension are each 1 meter in length.) I like that, since you don’t always want a ton of extra cord if you’re plugging into a game controller or nearby laptop. There’s also a Y-adapter included. New for the BoomPro X, V-Moda also throws in five different tiny microphone covers in different colors: this company is &lt;a href="https://www.v-moda.com/us/en/customization"&gt;known for its customization and personalized ear cup shields&lt;/a&gt;, but the mic covers are way more subtle. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Different mic cover colors are included.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A9qUzJ"&gt;I’ve liked the BoomPro enough to carry it in my headphones case for a long time, and I’m even happier with the BoomPro X thanks to the improved, unidirectional mic. That’s easily worth the $10 extra, and in return I get a simple gadget that leaves me sounding better when I’m gaming or working from home — all with the headphones I’d be wearing anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s new PS5 model weighs less because it has a smaller heatsink</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xC7ly7_3uC_kYtAc4zAHXSuKrPc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69789710/vpavic_4278_20201030_0292.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vhTqE"&gt;A new PS5 model started appearing in Australia, Japan, and parts of the US earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637524/sony-new-ps5-model-revision-lighter-screwdriver-stand-base-features"&gt;with a new stand design&lt;/a&gt; and a mysterious reduction in weight. Thanks to a teardown video from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taKKVBVoKhg"&gt;YouTuber Austin Evans&lt;/a&gt;, the mystery has now been solved: Sony has changed the heatsink that helps cool the PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfW9xf"&gt;The new heatsink is significantly smaller than the original, and makes up for the entire weight reduction of 300 grams (0.6 pounds), according to Evans. It’s not clear why Sony has swapped out the heatsink so early on in the PS5’s lifecycle, but Evans does note that his particular unit ran hotter as a result — with rear exhaust temperatures around 3 to 5 degrees higher. That could be down to manufacturing variance, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XsEagxUKr9LL8-Xt2lGzot-MdE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22812813/newps5heatsink.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old PS5 heat sink (left) vs. new PS5 heat sink (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w10wIf"&gt;Sony uses this heatsink to cool the PS5, and the console has a heat pipe with a shape and airflow that’s designed to create the same level of performance as a vapor chamber. The heatsink, hard copper plate, and aluminum dissipation fins all take up a significant amount of space inside the PS5, and contribute greatly to its overall size. It’s interesting to see Sony reduce the size of this part, and I’m hoping this could be the first sign of the company working towards a smaller PS5 model. The PS5 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21438782/sony-ps5-size-specs-dimensions-console-huge-large-big"&gt;biggest game console in modern history&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5wuqe"&gt;Evans does conclude that the changes make the PS5 worse though, due to the extra heat he recorded. That could well make the launch PS5s more desirable, if it’s something we see replicated elsewhere. “I don’t think there’s any argument that this is a worse console, at least for thermals and for cooling,” says Evans. “As far as I’m concerned I’d rather have a launch PS5.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hgt6Wn"&gt;The revision comes just as Sony reveals it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609150/sony-playstation-5-ps5-loss-profit"&gt;no longer selling the $499 version&lt;/a&gt; of the PS5 at a loss, and after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137392/sony-ps5-price-cost-of-manufacture-psvr-2-report"&gt;reports last year suggested&lt;/a&gt; Sony was battling to keep the PS5 costs down thanks in part to its expensive cooling solution. Evans has only opened up a Digital Edition version of the PS5, so we don’t know for sure whether Sony has also changed the cooling unit on the model with a disc drive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile CEO calls latest data breach ‘humbling,’ claims it’s committed to security</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="T-Mobile Kicks Off $3 Billion Bond Sale To Buy 5G Spectrum" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2V0H5We63VdhnL-hKeUivSOYQgw=/0x0:3999x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69788941/1231755320.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y2NwJ4"&gt;A recent T-Mobile data breach &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633853/tmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc"&gt;coughed up the information of more than 50 million people&lt;/a&gt;, including some who aren’t current customers or never were. The 21-year-old hacker who says they’re responsible for the attack already did &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-hacker-who-stole-data-on-50-million-customers-their-security-is-awful-11629985105"&gt;an interview with the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; calling its security “awful,” and now CEO Mike Sievert is speaking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zn26vr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is T-Mobile’s fifth incident in four years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="17ezIQ"&gt;Sievert says he’s taking a moment to update us now that the breach is contained and the investigation is “substantially complete.” “Keeping our customers’ data safe is a responsibility we take incredibly seriously and preventing this type of event from happening has always been a top priority of ours,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Fcyberattack-against-tmobile-and-our-customers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F28%2F22646439%2Ft-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;he writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBxgkw"&gt;It’s true that these attacks happen to many companies, but it’s hard to take the statement as sincere when T-Mobile has had at least five breaches since 2018. That includes this one, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22211839/t-mobile-customers-call-records-hacker-security"&gt;two in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, plus one each for 2018 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UAdfgU"&gt;To do something about it, T-Mobile is partnering with cybersecurity firm Mandiant and consultants at KPMG to tighten things up. Will that put an end to this ridiculous streak of insecurity? No one can know, but that’s more than the “sorry for any inconvenience” notes released &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcustomers%2F6305378821&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F28%2F22646439%2Ft-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;after&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcustomers%2F6305378822&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F28%2F22646439%2Ft-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; of the past breaches, and of course, all the subscribers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637797/tmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans"&gt;got a free year of Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Too bad it’s only happening after a hacker made off with enough IMEI/IMSI, driver’s license, and social security data to spend the next few years stealing identities and phone numbers at will.&lt;/p&gt;
