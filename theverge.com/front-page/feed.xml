    <title>Surprise: Amazon has four new smart switches</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CJP0eE"&gt;A new line of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Single-Neutral-Required/dp/B095X911T8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Basics Smart Switches&lt;/a&gt; has landed on &lt;a href="http://Amazon.com"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the Amazon-branded smart home gadgets count up to seven, including the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Smart-Thermostat/dp/B08J4C8871?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new smart thermostat&lt;/a&gt; and smart &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Amazon-Smart-Quality-Monitor/dp/B08W8KS8D3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;indoor air quality monitor&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a big leap from the one, lonely &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882918/amazon-smart-plug-price-release-date-alexa-voice-control-routines-lights-ac"&gt;Amazon smart plug&lt;/a&gt; the company had left after discontinuing its indoor smart security camera last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCUPoX"&gt;Spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danwroc/status/1460277219503353864"&gt;Dan Wroclawski of Consumer Reports&lt;/a&gt;, the four smart switches launched on November 11th and include a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Single-Neutral-Required/dp/B095X911T8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;single-pole switch ($17.99)&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Single-Neutral-Required/dp/B095X5H16X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;single-pole dimmer ($19.99)&lt;/a&gt; both for controlling one lighting circuit, and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Switch-Neutral-Required/dp/B095X8YD3Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-way switch ($18.99) &lt;/a&gt;and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Dimmer-Neutral-Required/dp/B095X5HTLS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-way dimmer ($20.99)&lt;/a&gt;, which can control one circuit from two locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQofml"&gt;A smart switch turns existing hardwired lighting into smart lighting, adding app and voice control. It’s a good alternative to smart bulbs when you want to automate lighting in a room with lots of lightbulbs or decorative fixtures. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qwkK0sC4-vHi6f7fKYOtjCL6M8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23016479/71pPnO0kwHL._AC_SL1500_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Amazon Basics 3-Way Smart Dimmer Switch needs a neutral wire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WWfFfg"&gt;One advantage of Amazon’s own smart home devices is that they work with Amazon’s Frustration Free Setup and Certified for Humans programs, which means they should be simple to set up, especially if you already have an Echo smart speaker in your home. The downside is that these switches will not work with any other smart home system or voice assistant; they are only Alexa-compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuArjs"&gt;You also have to install them. These smart switches need to be hardwired into your home’s wiring and require a neutral wire. If you have an older home with no neutral, then &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lutron-Wallplate-Assistant-Incandescent-PDW-6WCL-WH/dp/B07SJJBTYY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lutron Caseta&lt;/a&gt; or GE Lighting &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/GE-3-Wire-Smart-Switch-Motion-Sensing/dp/B082LK4X4X/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?keywords=ge+cync+no+neutral+wire+switch&amp;amp;qid=1636995782&amp;amp;sr=8-3-spons&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFFSlk4MDBGTVdVRDImZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAxODI0MzgzQ1BHSkhBWVRIN1I2JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxNzgwNDkxRjg3MEVTUlFZNVFMJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cync’&lt;/a&gt;s neutral-wire free options will be a better fit. But if you have the right wiring, these are a good value for a smart switch, prices for which generally range from around $25 to upwards of $60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="klEIDj"&gt;The new Amazon switches do not require a smart home hub to connect to the internet for automation and will work with Alexa for voice and app control. Once installed, they can be used as a traditional light switch, with the added smarts that come from being able to ask the voice assistant to turn them on and off with an Echo speaker, add them into Alexa Routines in the Alexa app, and create schedules for them. The two switches with dimming capability can also adjust the brightness with voice or app control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PABHh4_s1t0no5MmOX1bOeNq6nM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23016521/61Kt4yA1e5L._AC_SL1500_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The single-pole smart switch costs $17.99 and adds smart control with Alexa to a single lighting circuit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hgDEOq"&gt;As is the theme with Amazon Basics devices, these are simply designed. The single-pole switches look just like a regular paddle switch and have a small status light LED at the bottom. The dimmer options have a plus or minus button above the paddle to adjust the brightness and a row of green LEDs up top for a visual indicator of brightness level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2j1EJy"&gt;It’s surprising, however, to see Amazon stating on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Single-Neutral-Required/dp/B095X5H16X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;product page&lt;/a&gt; that these smart switches are for exclusive use with Alexa and will not support other voice assistants or smart hubs, especially considering the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761340/amazon-matter-smart-home-standard"&gt;recently reaffirmed its support of Matter&lt;/a&gt;, the open smart home standard coming in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izOHni"&gt;I asked Amazon this question and Chris DeCenzo, Principal Software Development Engineer at Amazon Lab126, told me: “Matter was just an idea when these devices were being developed so we designed the product to work over WiFi without the need for a hub to make it accessible to the broadest number of customers.” When the Matter SDK is released and Amazon has a clearer idea of the range technical details, DeCenzo said it will have more to share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dd4mua"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 16th, 12PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Added a response from Amazon regarding compatibility with the new Matter standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PztXdK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Wheel of Time tries a little too hard to be Game of Thrones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m25LLGaLGMAYabGC7BeloG32fBg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70149903/WOFT_S1_UT_102_191105_THIJAN_00081_1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon Prime Video&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fyMrHa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; is Amazon’s second-biggest TV bet ever. “I want my &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;,” CEO Jeff Bezos is &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/inside-amazons-wheel-of-time"&gt;reported to have said&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt;, along with Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/amazons-lord-of-the-rings-cost-465-million-one-season-4167791/"&gt;eye-wateringly expensive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings &lt;/em&gt;show coming in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22606267/lord-of-the-rings-amazon-series-release-date"&gt;September 2022&lt;/a&gt;, are the results. It’s a big adaptation of even bigger fantasy novels, an attempt to beat HBO’s blockbuster hit at its own game and give Amazon a prestige genre series of its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7sMyh"&gt;But for all the money and effort that’s gone into the show, Amazon hasn’t made a &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;successor, try as it might. &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time &lt;/em&gt;is an interesting attempt at adapting Robert Jordan’s behemoth of a book series, but it’s also dragged down both by its unwieldy source material and its efforts to twist itself into a second coming of &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oY8mmG"&gt;To understand the difficulty of what Amazon and showrunner Rafe Judkins are attempting, you need to understand the sheer scale of the source material, which spans 14 novels and a prequel. The original books weigh in at over 10,000 pages (over twice as long as the completed A Song of Ice and Fire books) and were published over a span of 30 years by two authors (with Brandon Sanderson stepping in to finish the saga after Jordan’s death in 2007). There are no fewer than 2,782 named characters mentioned over the course of the series, 148 of which are &lt;a href="https://wot.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Point_of_View_Characters"&gt;point of view characters&lt;/a&gt; at one point or another. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0pbnCHDjz3OyKVvYxW3-FZAvWhw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018832/WOFT_S1_UT_101_190917_THIJAN_00549_1.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon Prime Video&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="owV7PO"&gt;What distinguishes the initially generic &lt;em&gt;Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; from other &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;-inspired fantasies is its setting. Thousands of years before the show begins, magic was corrupted, tainting the source of power such that any man who tried to use it would go mad. Women, on the other hand, were still spared that disaster, leading to a group of powerful magic-wielders known as the Aes Sedai, who hold considerable sway — both sorcerous and politically. The world of the Wheel of Time is a cyclical one, though, where people are reborn in each age. That includes the Dragon, the person who caused magic to be tainted in the first place and who is destined to either destroy the world again or save it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xn2JAO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; does its best to ease viewers into all that, paring down some of the more esoteric names and concepts and spreading out the minute details of how the world and its magic works over time. Amazon is also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheWheelOfTime/status/1459223681687699458"&gt;promising animated shorts&lt;/a&gt; that will be available alongside the show to help explain some of the backstory and lore (although those weren’t made available ahead of the premiere). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5YUw2B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; does its best to ease viewers in&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0t0XP"&gt;The show starts off leaning heavily on cookie-cutter fantasy tropes, though. One of the Aes Sedai, Moiraine (Rosamund Pike), is searching to try and find the prophesied Dragon Reborn to usher them onto their path of destiny. She, along with her Warder (a warrior ally who travels with and protects an Aes Sedai), Lan Mandragoran (Daniel Henney), follows the trail to the Two Rivers, a town far in the mountains and recruits five young individuals who might fulfill the prophecy. There’s Rand (Josha Stradowski), a shepherd boy; Perrin (Marcus Rutherford), a blacksmith; Mat (Barney Harris), a gambling thief; Egwene (Madeleine Madden), the innkeeper’s daughter; and Nynaeve (Zoë Robins), the village’s healer — any of whom could be the Dragon Reborn. I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; mention that there were a lot of characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0sm6sS"&gt;Judkins does make some key changes to update the series. The cast is aged up and far more diverse than Jordan’s iteration of his protagonists. Egwene and Nynaeve are given bigger roles, in particular, whereas Rand, Perrin, and Mat tend to take up most of the spotlight in the books.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TQxf00mQ45KkncO9NSSZor2ryYE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018833/WOFT_S1_UT_102_191029_THIJAN_00637_v1__1.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon Prime Video&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3hivRN"&gt;Other changes are less thoughtful. One male character, for example, is paired up with a spouse that’s created from whole cloth for the series &lt;em&gt;solely&lt;/em&gt; for the purpose of fridging her in the first episode so that he can have something to be sad about over the course of the season. And the first season over-commits to making the central mystery of the series the basic question of which of the five main characters is going to be the prophesied Dragon Reborn, capable of wielding massive power and challenging the Dark One. It feels like an odd choice, given that it’s a fairly easy-to-guess answer, unless the show plans to diverge in far greater ways than it has in the six episodes that I got to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqdKP5"&gt;The series also focuses more on Rosamund Pike’s Moiraine as the protagonist for the show, fleshing out her role in the story and her screen time. That’s not a bad thing, given that Pike is both one of the most recognizable members of the cast and one of the best parts of the show. But it does stand out, much in the same way as making Dumbledore the main character in the first &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2hPAY"&gt;The show does generally look good, with sweeping shots of the lovely Czech landscapes, impressive costumes, and expensive-looking sets. The depiction of the primary form of magic (“channeling”), where characters are meant to be drawing in power from the world around them and weaving it into blasts of fire or bursts of air, is more hit or miss. Some scenes manage to portray it as powerful and compelling magic, while others consist of characters just standing around while white wisps of smoke fly around them. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Z8DjqqOPyLeGBkR0Mw-7NnSn-c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018834/WOFT_S1_FG_101_435109_Still090.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon Prime Video&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt;’s hit or miss channeling in action&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TaoEBa"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; influence is problematically strong, though, with extra sex, blood, and gore added in. It’s enough to be jarring, although nothing here quite reaches the often-gratuitous levels of its HBO predecessor. &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time &lt;/em&gt;is also a much grimmer show than its source material, having excised nearly all the levity and humor in an effort to be more mature, to its detriment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6aiZt"&gt;And that’s a big part of &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt;’s problem. It spends too much time trying to be Game of Thrones, even as it tells a very different kind of story. &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; reveled in its darker world, characters, and the machinations to try and seize power. &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, doesn’t have the games, and it doesn’t have the throne. There are few, if any, grey areas; the big bad of the world is literally “The Dark One,” served by his army of bestial, unthinking Trollocs (think orcs, crossed variously with wolves, bears, and boars) who literally eat people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mBpU0T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Wheel of Time might actually succeed — if it stops trying so hard to be another Game of Thrones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2UAtg9"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; does fire on all cylinders, it’s proof that it might actually be possible to fit the book into a coherent TV show. And Amazon is definitely confident that it’ll be able to find some success; the company has already renewed the show for a second season, out of a planned eight that &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/11/the-wheel-of-time-mat-cauthon-role-donal-finn-rafe-jenkins-plans-amazon-series-1234870995/"&gt;Judkins has envisioned&lt;/a&gt;. A story this big definitely needs some time to get going — and at the very least, Amazon seems to be giving &lt;em&gt;Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W98lbp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first three episodes of the Wheel of Time debut on Amazon Prime Video on November 19th. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Avatar is being shot on a Mandalorian-style virtual stage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bwvZLX66dRBBNhgNdENbiMrRmbo=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70149893/Avatar_Group_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HFEpSc"&gt;Netflix’s live-action adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender&lt;/em&gt; has kicked off production in Vancouver, and the show will be utilizing some notable tech to create its fantasy world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSFsg0"&gt;Netflix says it has partnered with effects studio Pixomondo on a custom-built facility that’s 84 feet across, 28 feet high, and features 23,000 square feet of stage and more than 3,000 LED panels. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145671/mandalorian-sets-stagecraft-epic-games-ilm-fortnite-baby-yoda-digital"&gt;It’s similar to the virtual sets utilized most famously by Disney on &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. According to Netflix, the set “allows for visual effects to be done in real time in camera, combining multiple environments on a single stage.” The company calls it “one of the biggest virtual production volumes in North America.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga4b9t"&gt;The upcoming adaptation has not been without controversy; last year &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365329/avatar-last-airbender-netflix-live-action-michael-dante-dimartino-bryan-konietzko-departure"&gt;left the project citing creative differences&lt;/a&gt;. Albert Kim has since taken over as showrunner. This summer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621540/netflix-avatar-the-last-airbender-live-action-cast"&gt;Netflix revealed the initial cast for the show&lt;/a&gt;, and now the company has revealed three new roles: Paul Sun-Hyung Lee (&lt;em&gt;Kim’s Convenience) as&lt;/em&gt; Uncle Iroh, Ken Leung&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Lost&lt;/em&gt;) as Commander Zhao, and Lim Kay Siu&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Anna and The King&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Nightwatch&lt;/em&gt;) as&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Gyatso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnpwpQ"&gt;There’s no word yet on when Avatar is expected to hit Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WIe8uO"&gt;Amazon Photos on &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-photos-cloud-drive/id621574163"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; just got a major redesign, as outlined in a post on the &lt;a href="https://amazonphotos.blog/introducing-the-redesigned-amazon-photos-app-for-ios-6dba18d0fb2b"&gt;Amazon Photos blog&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that Amazon might be trying to level the playing field with Google Photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qO8ROb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2yGdL6no4E4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4MrH26"&gt;The update aims to bring smoother navigation, essentially placing all options within “a thumb’s reach.” From the home screen, you should be able to singlehandedly access your photos and account information. The home screen also features a customized slideshow that displays a reel of memories, highlighting vacations, photos of the current date from previous years, and a random selection of photos that change on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDKejz"&gt;Once you select a gallery, Amazon notes that you’ll no longer have to keep scrolling to find a specific picture — swiping up on the screen reveals a control panel that lets you filter through photos by people, place, and year. There’s no word on when (or if) Amazon will update the Photos app on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kVBJl"&gt;Despite Amazon offering free unlimited photo storage for Prime users, the service has lagged considerably behind Google Photos, so much so that some Echo users &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-echo-show-10-would-be-best-smart-screen-ever-if-it-just-added-one-feature"&gt;prefer using Google Photos&lt;/a&gt; on their devices — something that Amazon has yet to offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2XcLf"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/22719945/amazon-alexa-dave-limp-interview-ambient-computing-ring-eero-decoder"&gt;October interview with David Limp&lt;/a&gt;, the senior vice president of devices and services at Amazon, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked Limp about integrating Google Photos with Echo devices. His response suggests that Amazon would welcome the integration, but the decision would depend on Google: “Amazon Photos is in my organization, but I’d also love to entertain a deal with Google with their photos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tb1Yfg"&gt;It looks like Amazon is starting to focus more of its resources on its Photos service, though, as demonstrated by the age of the &lt;a href="https://amazonphotos.medium.com/"&gt;Amazon Photos blog&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon published its first post in August of this year and seems to be continually providing updates about Photos. While the establishment of a new blog doesn’t really mean much, it seems that Amazon is ready to remind people it has a Photos service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ohio suing Facebook, says it misled the public about the effect its products have on children</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ChuX_3q-btk-mm_eCWtB_gbXbhc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70149649/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Ohio is suing Facebook | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SEu2CI"&gt;Ohio is suing Facebook’s parent company, Meta, claiming the social media platform misled the public about the effects its products have on children. The lawsuit, filed November 12th on behalf of the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (OPERS), is seeking more than $100 billion in damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JYMEN"&gt;The suit alleges that between April 29th and October 21st, Facebook and top executives violated federal securities law when they intentionally misled the public and deceived shareholders about how its products can negatively affect children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5R6VNZ"&gt;“Facebook said it was looking out for our children and weeding out online trolls, but in reality was creating misery and divisiveness for profit,” Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost &lt;a href="https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/November-2021/Attorney-General-Yost-Sues-Facebook-for-Securities"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; Monday. He added that when the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; began publishing a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039?mod=article_inline"&gt;series of articles&lt;/a&gt; based on internal documents from whistleblower Frances Haugen, “the truth began to emerge.” According to the documents, Facebook’s own internal research showed its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712927/facebook-instagram-teen-mental-health-research"&gt;Instagram photo-sharing platform might be harmful&lt;/a&gt; to the mental health of teenagers, especially girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vmPhUg"&gt;After the reports were published, Facebook’s stock dropped, causing the retirement system and other investors in the company to lose more than $100 billion, Yost said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2hJq3"&gt;According to the lawsuit, OPERS manages assets worth approximately $125 billion on behalf of 1.1 million active members, retirees, and beneficiaries. The system “purchased shares of Facebook Class A common stock at artificially inflated prices” in 2021 and “suffered damages as a result of the violations of the federal securities laws alleged.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BT5W13"&gt;Meta spokesperson Joe Osborne said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the suit is “without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0GG0U"&gt;In addition to recovering the lost $100 billion, Yost said, the lawsuit “demands that Facebook make significant reforms to ensure it does not mislead the public about its internal practices.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first League of Legends indie spinoffs are out now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TKW6cQalREmm7sMuXx02gNGAGgk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70149638/29_Hero_Yasuo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruined King.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MiuKSX"&gt;In late 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993328/riot-forge-publishing-label-league-of-legends-games"&gt;Riot revealed a new publishing label&lt;/a&gt; designed to give indie studios the chance to play around in the vast &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; universe — and today, the first two Forge games are finally releasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OISmDl"&gt;That includes &lt;em&gt;Hextech Mayhem&lt;/em&gt;, a rhythm platformer from &lt;em&gt;Bit.Trip&lt;/em&gt; developer Choice Provisions, which is out on the Switch and PC, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772338/league-of-legends-spinoff-netflix-games-nintendo-switch-hextech-mayhem"&gt;with a version also coming to Netflix Games in the future&lt;/a&gt;. Joining it is &lt;em&gt;Ruined King&lt;/em&gt;, a turn-based role-playing game from Airship Syndicate, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21012514/league-of-legends-riot-indie-game-ruined-king-the-game-awards-tga"&gt;which was previously revealed in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. It’s launching first on the PC, Switch, PS4, and Xbox One, with next-gen versions for PlayStation and Xbox also on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n6IhFN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eUkyg3sUdWc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="bddC5N"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7pEg82R7P4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wCxt5H"&gt;Outside of those two games, Riot revealed a new title called &lt;em&gt;Song of Nunu&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/25/15691150/rime-review-ps4-xbox-pc-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rime&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;developer Tequila Works. It’s described as a “heartwarming single-player adventure game,” which “features beloved champions Nunu and Willump as they embark on an epic journey to find Nunu’s long-lost mother.” It’s slated to launch in 2022. Riot also confirmed that the previously announced 2D action game &lt;em&gt;Convergence&lt;/em&gt; will be out next year and teased a mystery game “that takes place in the Demacia region.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnTrfP"&gt;It’s a busy time for Riot and the &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; universe. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915506/riot-games-league-of-legends-10th-anniversary-marc-merrill-interview"&gt;After a decade focused entirely on &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; as its sole game&lt;/a&gt;, the developer has since expanded with plenty of spinoffs and is currently in the midst of its first animated series, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22763818/netflix-league-of-legends-arcane-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is streaming on Netflix. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22187980/riot-games-league-of-legends-mmo-greg-street"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; MMO is also currently in the works.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best wired or wireless gaming headsets to buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best gaming headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v1RJtFLddK43NxKDkfTFTv0_OH8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67799392/acastro_201109_4282_gamingHeadsets_0001_2021update.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A few options for each platform&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="eErA8y"&gt;If you’re shopping for a gaming headset, you have a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of options. While there are some great ones out there, it’s easy to pay too much, to accidentally purchase a headset that doesn’t work with your desired console or platform, or to get one that’s uncomfortable after a few hours of use. Knowing a thing or two about headphones &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; aid in your search, but gaming headsets have only gotten more complicated to shop for — especially the wireless ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOIb46"&gt;For instance, wireless headsets made for Xbox operate via Microsoft’s proprietary wireless protocol. They’ll only work on Xbox consoles or a PC that has one of Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless Adapters plugged in, in most cases. Conversely, if you get a multiplatform wireless headset that includes a 2.4GHz wireless USB dongle, it’ll likely work on the likes of the PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch (when plugged into the console’s TV dock), and PC — but not Xbox. In short, it’s best to buy the headset that mentions support for your preferred platform(s) explicitly (or just buy a wired gaming headset instead).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7JNU3"&gt;This guide focuses mostly on newer options that you’re likely to encounter at stores as opposed to older models that, while possibly still being worthy of your money, are often tougher to find affordably and easily online. Also, just to mention it at the top, I have a large-ish head, and that factor obviously played a major role in how I judge the comfort of these headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKGdzA"&gt;You’ll find a few categories below, including the &lt;strong&gt;best multiplatform wireless headsets&lt;/strong&gt; that are compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch via its dock (and likely more products than that), the &lt;strong&gt;best Xbox wireless gaming headsets&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;the best PlayStation wireless gaming headsets&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;best wired gaming headsets&lt;/strong&gt; that support the widest variety of platforms, from console controllers to phones, tablets, and VR headsets that feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="cwk1AY"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="McEjqN"&gt;Best multiplatform wireless gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22665355/logitech-g435-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-headset-features-price"&gt;Logitech G435 Lightspeed&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G435-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B08R8DT7X6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$79&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VkhLA2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch (via its dock)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AK0wY-eE_KIKq1w2fqpMbo1QPd0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23001468/akrales_211109_4870_0263.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rmR97d"&gt;For some time now, Logitech has been on the cusp of making a gaming headset that’s good enough for console gamers, mobile gamers, and PC gamers alike. It has finally nailed the balancing act with its new $79.99 G435 wireless gaming headset. While this headset likely won’t satisfy most enthusiasts because of its lack of a boom microphone (it utilizes beamforming microphones) and its minimal noise isolation, that doesn’t take away from the G435 being a lightweight and comfortable delight to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qm50XY"&gt;The G435 ships with a USB-A audio transmitter and is compatible with most platforms that have that port, including PCs, PlayStation consoles, and the Nintendo Switch’s dock. It isn’t compatible with Xbox, though. I’ve also had success using a USB-A to USB-C adapter to plug it into my Oculus Quest 2, MacBook Pro, and other devices. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kSXoyFKV3-99o7xb9TzpTt1-dqQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23001470/akrales_211109_4870_0299.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="loNIV3"&gt;The G435’s killer feature (aside from its broad compatibility and comfort) is its Bluetooth mode, which lets you connect to a phone so you can remain available to accept calls while you use the headset for something else via the 2.4GHz transmitter. You can also just use them as standard headphones via Bluetooth. It’s far from the first device to combine Bluetooth with 2.4GHz wireless, but the G435’s lightweight design makes it an easier companion to carry around and use for work and play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aZK2cz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10866389"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="psEEeB"&gt;The G435 headset is an evolution of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21378026/logitech-g733-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-headset-accessories-g203-g305-g915-colors"&gt;made-for-PC G733&lt;/a&gt;’s design but without the futuristic LEDs. Like the G733, it utilizes breathable ear pads, though its plastic headband is wrapped in a layer of fabric. Speaking of plastic, that’s mostly what you’ll find here. This isn’t a robust headset with steel-reinforced arms, like many of our other options below. Yet, when it’s on your head, it’s comfortable enough that you might just forget about that little detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9cEM2"&gt;The ear cups are mounted to rails that extend from the headband, letting you easily move them around until you find the right fit. And even though &lt;a href="https://imp.i125364.net/c/482924/1195040/11355?subId1=vergegamingheadsets111521&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fgaming-audio%2Fg435-wireless-bluetooth-gaming-headset.981-001073.html"&gt;one look at its advertising&lt;/a&gt; should tell you that these were built for a younger generation, my large head fits comfortably within the range of the G435’s sizing. There’s no annoying clamping, and these are extremely lightweight, so fatigue wasn’t something that I encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lyIuWslohYKsqKZs0pmPd0QI6QI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23001471/akrales_211109_4870_0311.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="COhKuT"&gt;Sound quality is better than I expected for the price, and I often found myself picking these up just to listen to music. They’re also fine for gaming, though they lack the hearty low-end sound and noise isolation you might be looking for (especially if you game competitively). Generally, if you’re in the market for a lightweight wireless gaming headset that costs no more than $80 and has a good number of features and broad compatibility, check out the G435.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mZOYqO"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Logitech G435 Lightspeed headset sounds like:

&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLXEQ9"&gt;The Epos H3Pro Hybrid is a new favorite if you’re okay with spending a little more on a gaming headset. At $279, this wireless model supports 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth concurrently, like the G435 Lightspeed above. However, in several ways, it’s a huge upgrade in terms of comfort, overall build quality, thoughtful design, and sound quality — all while still remaining relatively lightweight at about 311 grams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZX5q1"&gt;It’s actually similar in appearance and comfort to the company’s more affordable H3Pro wired headset, which includes Bluetooth support in addition to its wired connection. But the H3Pro Hybrid cuts the cord (the option for wired is still there, though) and adds other capabilities that make it worth the price hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cnWdAU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10868309"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ywj8RS"&gt;Notably, the H3Pro Hybrid features a switch that toggles active noise cancellation and further reduces the amount of incoming noise from your surroundings. The thick, plush ear cups already do a good job at limiting noise as it is, and ANC takes it a step further. It’s difficult to hear much of anything around you when the sound-dampening feature is on, so gamers who need to focus closely on positional sounds should find these to be a great companion (not to mention how handy the feature is for just filtering out noise to focus on work). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B64dqL"&gt;Outside of that, the H3Pro Hybrid makes good on its price by nailing the fundamentals. The steel-reinforced headband feels strong and flexible, and it offers a staggering amount of sizing options, going far beyond the size that my large head requires. The ear cups clamp down just tightly enough to make a seal with your skin, and there’s a generous amount of padding at the headband to keep it from weighing you down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dahMWG"&gt;Battery life is good. These support USB-C charging, and with ANC on, they can last around 20 hours per charge or more than 30 hours with ANC off.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JNgms6"&gt;They sound good out of the box, but the Epos gaming suite software for Windows is necessary for tweaking the equalizer and other sound and mic settings. With a little fine-tuning, I was able to achieve my preferred sound reproduction of somewhere between warm and a reference sound, with just a little bass to give it some pep. The drivers are punchy and balanced, and in addition to gaming, these are a joy to listen to music with. They look, feel, and sound like premium headphones should in this price range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="BF4Nbd"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless headset is surprisingly good for $100. It has all of the same features as our previous top pick, Razer’s Kaira Pro, but knocks $50 off the price and has a better design. Like the Surface Headphones, this headset features twistable dials on the outside of its earcups, and it simplifies making quick adjustments, like turning up the volume on the right side or tweaking the game / chat audio mix on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrpptY"&gt;This headset operates on the Xbox Wireless protocol, letting it connect effortlessly to a modern Xbox console with a push of its pairing button (it pairs just like a controller). It supports a concurrent Bluetooth connection, too, so you can be paired to your phone and console at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LIHpB2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420028"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dv7vfB"&gt;Battery life is fine but not spectacular at around 15 hours per charge. While I really like the Bluetooth feature, this headset lacks a multifunction button for controlling, say, phone calls or playing / pausing music or podcasts coming from your phone or tablet that might be connected. Another fault is that this model lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack, but that might not be a big deal for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYmful"&gt;Microsoft’s headset doesn’t break new ground — it just does a lot right for a reasonable price. There are other options that offer noise cancellation and more hearty sound quality than this model. But if you don’t want to spend more than $100, most people should be very happy with what the Xbox Wireless headset offers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GxfKc3"&gt;I’m willing to bet that you may not have heard of Victrix, a brand owned by PDP Gaming that’s focused on making peripherals suited for e-sports pros and aspiring gamers. Either way, it made a killer wireless headset in the Gambit that I think many people will enjoy. It’s a $129.99 device that comes in two versions: one that’s compatible with the Xbox family of consoles and with PCs and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Victrix-Gambit-Wireless-Xbox-Headset-Microphone/dp/B08FCVR17N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a PlayStation version&lt;/a&gt; that operates with a different dongle than the one included with the Xbox version. I tested the Xbox version, which has a different chipset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p7cMDC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10866862"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g4jP5W"&gt;It’s easy to recommend this headset to people who want to do the least amount of fiddling. I’m no designer, but it’s tough to imagine how Victrix could have made the built-in controls any more intuitive. On the left ear cup, there’s a mic that turns on when you lower it and mutes when you raise it back upward. That cup also has a button that adjusts between three levels of mic monitoring sensitivity and a rubberized dial for finding the perfect balance of game and chat audio. Over on the right cup, a fantastic volume knob sits alone as the only control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UsdJW"&gt;I enjoyed the sound quality as much, if not slightly more, than the Xbox Wireless Headset above. The Victrix Gambit doesn’t try too hard to woo with bass or with an overly crisp sound that forgoes warmth. It just sounds good out of the box, and I have no complaints about its performance while tethered to the included USB audio transmitter (alternatively, it can be used wired via 3.5mm). Its mic quality is also better than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2mALx4gvMT8HzvBzYqqhqtRMgoY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23001474/akrales_211109_4870_0390.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7EqjY"&gt;Its build quality leans heavily on plastic and leatherette. This alone doesn’t negatively impact its comfort, but it didn’t feel like it seamlessly fit my head like a glove the way Microsoft’s option did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omhxWE"&gt;For me, this headset’s lack of a USB-C charging port would be a deal-breaker — it uses a Micro USB port for recharging. That aside, there’s very little that the Victrix Gambit does wrong, and unlike with Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless Headset, the included audio transmitter lets it work with a PC out of the box using the Xbox Wireless protocol (normally, you’d have to purchase Microsoft’s own transmitter that doubles as a wireless controller hub). But unless you prefer it aesthetically, it’s tough to recommend it over the cheaper Xbox Wireless Headset if you’re just gaming on Xbox. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="TNyeD4"&gt;The SteelSeries’ Arctis 7P Plus has dethroned Sony’s own Pulse 3D headset as the best option out there for PlayStation gamers, despite costing $69 more. It’s one of the company’s most complete headsets yet in terms of features, connectivity, and comfort. Really, the previous version nailed the comfort already, but this year, it added on more battery life, a game and chat audio dial, and USB-C charging (good riddance, Micro USB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tw7021"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10866865"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cqOHWp"&gt;If you’ve read anything about the older Arctis 7P, that’s probably still true about this newer one. It has SteelSeries’ signature ski goggle headband that suspends its weight without pressing down. The ear cups rotate to be stored more easily or lay on your chest. It still includes a USB-C audio transmitter (and a USB-A converter), making it compatible with a wide range of devices, including the Oculus Quest 2, Switch, and much more. It’s these small additions that elevate this year’s model higher in our rankings than before. Also, it comes in black if you prefer that color over white.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrnWL1G59uJIn_vKtUTmYPwV3Js=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23001467/akrales_211109_4870_0213.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jZRyTE"&gt;SteelSeries boosted the advertised battery life from 24 to 30 hours per charge — a claim that it meets. I won’t shut up about USB-C charging, and in this case, it really just makes a lot of sense to have since it’s the same charging port as the DualSense controller. This is the first of many (I hope) SteelSeries headsets to ditch Micro USB for the reversible USB standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQsvDR"&gt;The $169.99 price might be steep if you were hoping to spend less, but compared directly to the Pulse 3D headset, the Arctis 7P’s comfort, microphone quality, button layout, and ease of use make it a far better choice for gamers who want to get the best bang for their buck.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Sony Pulse 3D gaming headset&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KWlvfW"&gt;Sony’s $99 Pulse 3D wireless headset for the PS4 and PS5 is a surprisingly feature-packed headset that’s also one of the most comfortable options on this list. I’m a sucker for well-fitting headsets, and the bungie-style headband Sony supplies is fantastic. Instead of having a hard plastic band pulling down on the top of your head, this headset hangs its weight on a silicone band. It gives the headset a near-weightless feel when it’s on my head. &lt;strong&gt;Just a note&lt;/strong&gt;: the ear cups are on the smaller side, and while mine fit just fine, folks with larger ears might not find them all that comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avxDnB"&gt;The Pulse 3D’s headline feature, though, is its ability to serve up 3D audio from the PS5’s Tempest sound engine. Actually, Sony says most headphones can push out the 3D effect, but this headset was made to really show it off. Support for 3D audio varies from game to game, but I found the PS5’s &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; to be a great showcase for it. In that game, everything from the highs that ring out from swords clashing to daunting fire-breathing dragons that push out medium- and low-frequency sounds were a delight to hear. For a more relaxing experience, &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; sound great, too. There are little sounds coming from everywhere, it seems. Games that don’t support 3D audio still sound good but are not quite as enthralling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPcK8B"&gt;For a $99 headset, the positional audio quality is better than I expected, as is the sound balance. There’s not an overwhelming amount of bass or tinny highs — everything is delivered delicately. I like that because it helps prevent fatigue during long play sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="63qvPj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420564"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gb182h"&gt;Sony claims 13 hours of wireless performance per charge. The headset actually landed between about 10 and 12 hours during my testing, which is an underwhelming result. Of course, this is less of an issue if you’re connecting it to a power source each time you stop gaming for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uWo9Sy"&gt;Bose’s QC 35 II gaming headset offers the most features but at the highest cost of any other headset featured in this guide. Despite usually costing more than an Xbox Series S or Nintendo Switch, this set delivers on value. It comes with the QC 35 II wireless noise-canceling headphones that can be used on the go with Bluetooth and wired 3.5mm connectivity. There are no other options I’ve listed that have a noise cancellation feature and support for voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant. It’s also among the most comfortable, lightweight options on this list. You’ll know when the QC 35 II is on your head, but it doesn’t pinch or press hard against your ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRyE2r"&gt;Used as a gaming headset, either connected via USB through its included desktop controller or via 3.5mm, the QC 35 II makes for a lightweight, comfortable option with a microphone attachment that’s easy to use. This model offers the best noise isolation (even without the battery-draining noise cancellation feature switched on) in any headset I’ve tested. Noise isolation is usually something most headsets fumble, but with this one, you’ll be able to better hear footsteps and other crucial noises that might decide the match. With noise cancellation switched on, it really does make everything around you very quiet — perfect for boosting the immersion in your games. The desktop controller I mentioned above adds more features, including a nice volume dial and button that adjusts the intensity of mic monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZtgrRG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568255" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s3ZNt7"&gt;The $329 price is high, but if you value noise cancellation and want to have a headset you can easily take on the road (and that has ear cups that can swivel and fold into a compact size), check this out. It’s worth noting that current owners of the QC 35 II headphones, unfortunately, won’t be able to easily acquire the microphone attachment, as Bose isn’t selling it separately. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Ejvb7t"&gt;Razer’s updated BlackShark headset is my runner-up choice for a wired headset you can buy. It’s $100, yet it features a similar design and general feature set to Razer’s $200 wireless V2 Pro model. That also means it’s just as comfortable, with a plush headband and breathable ear cups that don’t apply too much pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOPElj"&gt;This model’s build materials are a step above the $59 BlackShark V2 X when it comes to being breathable, and it includes a USB sound card, into which the headset’s 3.5mm end plugs. With it, you’ll get slightly better sound quality. Also, using the sound card allows you to use THX spatial sound in Razer’s Synapse 3 software, which I found to be a nice value add but not particularly alluring in practice. Razer says it’s adding spatial audio profiles for popular games moving forward, so you’ll have plenty of ways to utilize the sound card if this feature strikes your interest. Regardless of your interest, you’ll also be able to plug the headset’s 3.5mm end into a variety of controllers and the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gz2EXW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568257" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HgFwUw"&gt;Something that stood out to me during testing is that finding a comfortable fit took almost no effort. And while many headsets are comfortable enough to wear for hours, I didn’t want to take the BlackShark V2 off my head. Another nice touch is its volume knob, which affords fine-tune adjustments that dials don’t usually provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SMekMu"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the BlackShark V2 sounds like:

    <title>Epos H3Pro Hybrid review: the complete package</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Minor issues aside, these are an incredible value for gamers who need to multitask&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="bnvtUW"&gt;The Epos H3Pro Hybrid is a wireless gaming headset with several perks and just a few easily dismissed flaws. It offers good sound quality, active noise cancellation (ANC), and a lightweight, comfortable fit (even for larger head sizes) suitable for long gameplay sessions. All of those assets are tough to find in one headset, and I won’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone &lt;a href="https://www.eposaudio.com/en/us/gaming/products/h3pro-hybrid-sebring-bluetooth-low-latency-connection-gaming-headset-1000892"&gt;who can afford to drop $279&lt;/a&gt; on a gaming headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Kqwj1"&gt;Compared to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21313551"&gt;other popular options&lt;/a&gt;, that’s a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of money. But as it turns out, buying the H3Pro Hybrid is easier to justify because it doubles as a set of equally good wireless Bluetooth headphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNZzs2"&gt;In the interest of not getting called out for wearing a gaming headset in public, this headset’s magnetically attached lift-to-mute boom microphone can be yanked off, converting them into fairly normal-looking headphones. Okay, &lt;em&gt;some &lt;/em&gt;people might still realize that you’re wearing a gaming headset, but at least this one looks more suave than most other models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Iwp32o"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10867213"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UFaz5x"&gt;The H3Pro Hybrid has a secondary microphone on the left ear cup that can work for calls, meetings, or anything else you need a mic for. Unfortunately, that mic can’t be muted with a button on the headset; you’ll need to mute using your Bluetooth device. Otherwise, juggling Bluetooth with 2.4GHz audio worked nearly flawlessly. The headset sometimes fumbled the signal for about five seconds after I transitioned between wireless sources in my testing. The issue seemed to stem from the dongle being plugged into my external USB hub. Once I swapped it to a USB port on my PC, the problem was resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Epos H3Pro Hybrid" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NWtzwpFH05xquTWzdHvv0rNNgCg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23001463/akrales_211109_4870_0115.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The steel headband offers a huge range of sizing options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Epos H3Pro Hybrid" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IaaR7wmV98zXQb1071_9q7ePDTk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23001459/akrales_211109_4870_0056.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;With the magnetized boom mic removed, a built-in mic kicks on for taking calls via Bluetooth.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W2atuL"&gt;This handy wireless feature is, thankfully, something that’s getting easier to find, and you don’t need to spend this much to get it in a headset. But so far, no other options at this price point come to mind that look this good, feel this good to wear, or deliver the rich audio quality that the H3Pro Hybrid does. Unless there’s some amazing sale happening, I heartily recommend these over the $329 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439699/bose-quiet-comfort-35-ii-noise-canceling-gaming-headset-pc-bluetooth-price"&gt;Bose QC35 II&lt;/a&gt; wired gaming headset that also doubles as a set of wireless headphones when you’re on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8eGie"&gt;The H3Pro Hybrid has a closed-back, over-ear design that blocks a good amount of ambient noise even before you turn them on — in fact, Epos claims that the ambient noise level can be reduced by around 30 decibels just by wearing them in a powered-down state. By turning on ANC, the company claims noise is reduced by another 16 decibels. To me, the noise-dampening effect of just having the cozy ear cups on my head was sufficient enough. So much so that most times I didn’t need to use ANC to achieve the level of quiet I was looking for (your mileage may vary) and that helped to conserve some battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Epos H3Pro Hybrid" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uQ9v8IhKPhER28glrVPeH_0HzCQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23001462/akrales_211109_4870_0081.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The right ear cup hosts the Bluetooth pairing button and a toggle switch for ANC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Epos H3Pro Hybrid" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UsHBuputWCagONM2_uTbD3FNH2E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23001461/akrales_211109_4870_0072.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The left ear cup handles the rest, including charging, wired audio, and more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0tR7zZ"&gt;Speaking of longevity, the battery life is impressive, even when you’re juggling multiple wireless connections. The H3Pro Hybrid can last nearly as long when you’re connected to two wireless sources as when you’re connected to one (30 hours with just the dongle, or 28 hours with the dongle and Bluetooth). With ANC turned on, the battery life drops to about 19 hours whether you’re connected to just the dongle or with concurrent wireless connections. If you plan to use just Bluetooth, it can last up to 38 hours per charge, but I didn’t have a chance to put this claim to the test. In any case, recharging using its USB-C charging port is a breeze, taking two hours to fully charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EOhli"&gt;The USB-A wireless dongle included with the Epos H3Pro Hybrid didn’t put up a fuss when I plugged it into my PC, a PlayStation 5, or the Nintendo Switch’s dock. It also worked with my MacBook Pro and the Oculus Quest 2 when I used it with my own USB-C adapter. Epos includes a USB-A extender cable so the dongle can get better range, and I needed to utilize it more than I expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUodDW"&gt;I encountered occasional signal cutouts when I walked away from my computer, and some even happened mere feet from the dongle. It’s typical for a headset to start cutting out when you put a wall or two between it and the dongle. What’s less common is choppy audio from the headset at about 15 feet away with line of sight to the dongle, or even less distance in some cases. Strangely, it was finicky some days, while it worked perfectly on others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Epos H3Pro Hybrid" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PrVofYfG1ovodLFjDfSKKt-EkoI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23001456/akrales_211109_4870_0021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This dial on the right ear cup makes adjusting volume easy. Epos includes a similar-looking cap to place over the boom mic port on the left ear cup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7OQkka"&gt;This headset lets you connect physically to devices for audio playback, too. It includes a USB-C to USB-A cable, which can charge the headset and ensure the lowest amount of audio latency. You can also use the console cable, which has a 3.5mm jack on its end that can go into any device that has a headphone port, like a controller or a tablet. Either of these wired modes can be used in conjunction with Bluetooth, which is handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3aT1Ui"&gt;I quickly grew fond of what the H3Pro Hybrid can deliver for both gaming audio and listening to music. Its performance is good out of the box, but it gets better if you have access to a Windows PC to customize equalizer settings in the free Epos gaming suite download. I was able to create an EQ that sounded the best to me, with a warm sound delivery that had noticeable, but not booming, bass. I’ve mentioned several times now that the sound quality here is good, but it’s not quite at the same level as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/11/17844914/sony-1000x-m3-review-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt; that I usually wear for music. Audio aficionados should probably still chase after headphones geared specifically toward music playback, but the H3Pro Hybrid generally deliver better sound than I expected, and the customization settings are great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7s3l9N64VR1cXNpRJwsRsnsjybc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23001458/akrales_211109_4870_0045.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V42Sd0"&gt;The software offers the option to switch to 7.1 surround sound instead of its default 2.0 mode. It seems to split apart the sound, making all of its layers easier to pick apart (at the risk of sounding echo-y, depending on the content). Whether you prefer the 2.0 or the 7.1 sound mode, there’s a reverb slider that can give games and music some more spatial depth, as if it’s a live show. I also like that mic monitoring can be adjusted within the app, if you prefer to hear your voice and your surroundings while speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XGcmW"&gt;Epos has been riffing on a similar design for its headsets for a while now, but the H3Pro Hybrid delivers its most refined, easy-on-the-eyes take yet. The ear cups are mounted to hinges that branch off of the headband and let the cups swivel, improving the chances that they’ll fit you as comfortably as they did me. I was delighted to see that the headband offered several more sizing notches beyond what my large head required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2mcTkh"&gt;The leatherette (read: not genuine leather) on the ear cups is high quality enough that I wouldn’t have known it wasn’t real leather unless Epos told me. And I was happy to find out that this headset is covered by a two-year warranty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="M3qo0U"&gt;For those who want many of the same perks for less, the wired H3 Hybrid costs $179 and supports Bluetooth connections. But if you’re a gamer who’s constantly multitasking and wants to go totally wire-free (and keep the distractions at bay with noise cancellation), the $100 premium for the H3Pro Hybrid isn’t a ridiculous price to pay for those luxuries.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to control your Apple Watch hands-free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An Apple Watch Series 7 screen with Assistive Touch’s Motion pointer enabled. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TWDzIgIvjeT25GZXv5FecU0VKVs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70149392/vsong_211112_4882_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assistive Touch is a new accessibility feature introduced in watchOS 8.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BpkyDu"&gt;Starting with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667046/apple-watchos-8-feature-release-date"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;, Apple introduced a new accessibility feature called Assistive Touch. The cool thing about this feature is that it allows you to control the watch via gestures and your arm movements. Meaning, now you don’t even need to touch the Apple Watch screen to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkD5er"&gt;The tech behind it is pretty neat. Using on-device machine learning, the feature makes use of the watch’s accelerometer, gyroscope, and optical heart rate sensor to read how your muscles and tendons move. The result is that the watch can tell when you’re pinching your fingers or clenching your fists. You can also enable a motion-based cursor that works like a mini-mouse when you tilt your arm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5jPgh"&gt;To be clear, Apple developed Assistive Touch to make the Apple Watch easier to use if you have limited mobility or limb differences. However, it can also be a convenient tool for those moments when you don’t have full use of one or both hands. Maybe you’re whipping up something messy in the kitchen. Maybe it’s freezing out and you really don’t want to peel off your gloves to use the touchscreen. Whatever the scenario, Assistive Touch can help you answer calls, start workouts, access settings, use Apple Pay, activate Siri, and navigate various menus and apps. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A gif of a person shaking their wrist and the Assistive Touch outline appearing. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m7IRAjN_89y1cMWMzRcCkQwSoUQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23017154/vsong_211115_4882_Apple_Watch_How_To_01.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can shake your wrist to activate Assistive Touch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="qkHcPb"&gt;How to enable Assistive Touch&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="xnoTQK"&gt;First things first — which Apple Watch do you have? Assistive Touch is a new feature, and unfortunately it only works if you have an Apple Watch SE, Series 6, or Series 7.  If you’ve got a compatible watch, here’s how to get started. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4qCTH"&gt;You can choose to set it up (and then manage it) either on your iPhone or on the Watch itself. There is a minor advantage to the phone as it’s easier to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMCuU0"&gt;On the iPhone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="37pkMa"&gt;In the My Watch tab, scroll down to the Accessibility menu. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="J9Q4sN"&gt;Select Assistive Touch. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XvjAE8"&gt;Toggle on Assistive Touch and enable Hand Gestures. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="iPBony"&gt;On the Apple Watch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="dFAxkD"&gt;Launch the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iFbCVv"&gt;Scroll down to Accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ubu8rD"&gt;Select Assistive Touch and enable Hand Gestures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="iUyz9x"&gt;If you choose to set it up on your phone, you’ll be prompted to practice the pinching and clenching gestures directly on the watch. You should take the time to do it, but if you’re in a hurry, you can always hit the Learn More link underneath the Hand Gestures toggle. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A cursor moves around the watch screen and when the user double clenches their fist, it selects an app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PjblfOAyWksWH2dA_63QOPTZF3k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23017158/vsong_211115_4882_Apple_Watch_How_To_05.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also use a combination of the motion pointer and hand gestures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="7UdCJr"&gt;How to use the hand gestures and motion pointer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="TovgAO"&gt;Once Assistive Touch is enabled, double clench to activate it. The default gesture settings are as follows: pinch once to go forward, pinch twice to go backward, clench once to tap and clench twice for the Action Menu. The Action Menu is where you select options such as controlling the digital crown, scrolling, Apple Pay, and Siri. As for navigation, you’ll see a highlighted outline indicating what complication, app, or button you’re currently on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeZrLb"&gt;To bring up the motion pointer, double clench twice to bring up the Action Menu. From there, pinch to find the Interaction button. Clench to open the menu, navigate to the motion pointer button and clench again. You should see the cursor from there and then you’ll be able to tilt your arm in various directions to scroll through menus, swipe through screens, and tap buttons. You can also avoid tapping altogether by hovering the cursor over the complication or app you want to select.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="User demonstrates using pinching gestures to scroll through a menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vC-_ZCkHLLBKIGQF5pnNmXsMHtM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23017156/vsong_211115_4882_Apple_Watch_How_To_03.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The default gestures are to pinch to move forward, and pinch twice to move backward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="LmTbnk"&gt;How to customize Assistive Touch settings&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="L2mmju"&gt;I’m not going to lie: there’s a learning curve to using Assistive Touch. I don’t have the best memory when it comes to gesture controls, so I had to practice before I remembered which gesture did what while going about my daily business. There were a lot of times where I accidentally did the wrong gesture and had to start over again. Likewise, I had to really practice with the motion pointer to use it effectively. In general, depending on which method you’re using — gesture controls or the motion pointer — you’ll need a little patience when getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jz6XOR"&gt;That’s where customization comes in. If you don’t feel like the default settings work for you, you can reprogram them in the Watch app or directly from the wrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJ2APN"&gt;For example, say you want a quicker way to access the motion pointer. You can reassign double pinch to automatically bring it up. Speaking of which, you can also customize the motion pointer’s sensitivity, activation time, movement tolerance, and hot edges to better suit your needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xmaa3h"&gt;To reprogram gestures, head back to the Hand Gestures menu and tap the one you want to reprogram. From there, you’ll see a list of available actions, menus, or controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfnFJt"&gt;If at any point you feel like you went a little overboard, you can always go back to square one by tapping “Reset to Default.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="User demonstrates the double clenching gesture." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dd65nRVbGt3ONhmKj3epEuqx-Qc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23017155/vsong_211115_4882_Apple_Watch_How_To_02.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Double clenching both activates Assistive Touch and brings up the Action Menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="gBMJ3o"&gt;Some extra tips&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="XsRPKD"&gt;Turn on Quick Actions in the Hand Gestures menu. For certain apps, this will allow you to double clench to confirm when prompted. If you get a call, for instance, you’ll see a message telling you to double clench to answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fYG9cR"&gt;Enable Dwell Control in the Motion Pointer menu and select “Shake to start.” This lets you shake your wrist to bring up the cursor. No menu navigation required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pIasuW"&gt;Try out Auto Scanning. The default is set to manual, but turning this setting on continuously cycles through the available buttons, apps, and complications. This cuts down on how many gestures you need to navigate through menus and screens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pK6AQE"&gt;For better visibility, toggle on High Contrast in the Appearance menu. In the Customize Menu, you can also select Large Menu to increase icon sizes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EYeuHi"&gt;Enable Side Button Confirmation. This lets you use Assistive Touch in lieu of double-clicking the side button for things like Apple Pay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
