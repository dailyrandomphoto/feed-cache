    <title>Plaid, the service used by Venmo, Acorns, Robinhood, and more, may owe you some money</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BE9Bj_3KNEgsgUlZ7SKuR13vll8=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70423809/1227801650.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UKc6EB"&gt;If you’ve connected your bank account to financial apps like Robinhood, Acorns, Venmo, American Express, Coinbase, and Credit Karma, you may be entitled to some cash, according to a report by &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90715125/plaid-might-owe-you-money-if-you-use-any-of-these-banking-or-financial-apps"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OfHKh"&gt;Plaid, the financial service these apps (and &lt;a href="https://plaid.com/company/"&gt;5,500 others&lt;/a&gt;) use to link your bank account, has &lt;a href="https://www.plaidsettlement.com/index.php"&gt;settled a class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; accusing the company of collecting more financial data from users than necessary. The suit also alleges Plaid obtained users’ bank login information “through its user interface, known as ‘Plaid Link,’ which had the look and feel of the user’s own bank account login screen.” In reality, users were inputting their information “directly to Plaid.” Plaid denies these claims and says it was transparent with its customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1MLbeE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Plaid has been ordered to pay $58 million to affected users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eY8I7h"&gt;Plaid will pay $58 million to affected users, but unfortunately for us, payouts might be slim — &lt;a href="https://plaid.com/blog/leading-fintechs-join-the-plaid-network/"&gt;the company says millions&lt;/a&gt; of people have interacted with its service, which means more money to split up. You may qualify to receive a claim if you’re a US resident who has connected a bank account to an app between January 1st, 2013 and November 19th, 2021. If you’re unsure whether an app you use (or have used) is affected, you can search for specific financial apps on the &lt;a href="https://www.plaidsettlement.com/search.php"&gt;settlement’s site&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to the aforementioned apps, some other popular apps that Plaid powers include Chime, Mint, Betterment, and NerdWallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6K7BXy"&gt;You might’ve already received an email alerting you about the class action lawsuit, and if you have, make sure to &lt;a href="https://www.plaidsettlement.com/submit-claim.php"&gt;submit your claim&lt;/a&gt; by April 28th, 2022. If you didn’t receive an email but think you’ve been affected, you can still file a claim by heading to the same page and hitting the “Click Here” button. From here, you’ll have to fill out a form with your name and address, as well as a list of apps you linked your bank account to. You can find additional details about the settlement on &lt;a href="https://www.plaidsettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.php"&gt;its FAQ page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy S22 European price leak suggests a base Ultra model with less RAM</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D9sHrw3Udt7MJDg7K9rph2pgsRI=/15x0:1065x700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70423539/s22U.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1476660792527306754" target="_blank"&gt;evleaks (Twitter)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="id__l2h9sz0gz0o"&gt;Potential European pricing information for the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S22 series has been released by reliable leaker Roland Quandt, as reported by &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-series-could-be-more-expensive-than-s21/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung appears to have carried over its prices from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;the previous S21 lineup&lt;/a&gt;, with the only inconsistency being an equally-priced S22 Ultra model that supposedly comes with less RAM than its S21 predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BigvRp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Whoever said S22 series was to be cheaper, didn't think of Covid, parts shortages and inflation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actual official EURO prices:&lt;br&gt;S22 8/128GB = 849&lt;br&gt;S22 8/256GB = 899&lt;br&gt;S22+ 8/128GB = 1049&lt;br&gt;S22+ 8/256GB = 1099&lt;br&gt;S22 Ultra 8/128GB = 1249&lt;br&gt;S22 Ultra 12/256GB = 1349&lt;br&gt;S22 Ultra 12/512GB = 1449 &lt;a href="https://t.co/QRnfrhkzTz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QRnfrhkzTz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Roland Quandt (@rquandt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1484689280425414661?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 22, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uShSWX"&gt;Quandt claims the S22 will start at 849€ (~$963), the S22 Plus will set you back 1,049€ (~$1,190), and the base S22 Ultra will cost 1,249€ (~$1,417). It looks like all the base models in the series come with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage — the standard S22 and S22 Plus have a higher-priced option for 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, while the S22 Ultra offers two additional tiers that have 12GB of RAM with either 256GB or 512GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibYYwo"&gt;These prices are identical to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202864/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-specs-leak"&gt;those of the S21 devices&lt;/a&gt;, but as pointed out by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;, Quandt’s leak indicates the base S22 Ultra may come with just 8GB of RAM instead of the 12GB that the base S21 Ultra has. Despite this, the S22 Ultra may still be the same price as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;the S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; — a 100€ premium will get you the extra 4GB you’re missing out on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pta8hD"&gt;You &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893756/samsung-galaxy-s22-2022-preorders"&gt;can preorder a Galaxy S22 device&lt;/a&gt; before it’s even announced at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893640/samsung-unpacked-february-2022-galaxy-s22-ultra"&gt;Samsung’s February Unpacked&lt;/a&gt; event, which will give you a $50 credit towards your purchase. As &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; points out, US pricing information for the devices &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chunvn8888/status/1480953702177406979"&gt;leaked earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, with the base S22 allegedly starting at $899, the S22 Plus costing $1,099, and the S22 Ultra priced at $1,299. If these prices are true, this would mean a $100 increase across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2DsEy"&gt;There’s been plenty of leaked information about the S22 series floating around the internet, painting a near-complete picture of what the lineup could look like. Previous leaks show us an S22 Ultra that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"&gt;resembles the reportedly discontinued Note&lt;/a&gt; (complete with a stylus), while another gives us an early glimpse of what appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870027/samsung-s22-series-unofficial-dummy-leak-design-camera-specs"&gt;all three S22 dummy units in an unboxing video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple extends in-app purchase exemption for online group and event apps yet again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U44rZ18U7g6Ed8AyBm48Lyz0L4g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70423063/acastro_210831_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vxW3Oj"&gt;Apple has extended its deadline requiring online group and event apps to comply with the company’s in-app purchase policy once again, as announced in a post on &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=i71db0mv&amp;amp;1642879522"&gt;the company’s developer’s blog&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/22/apple-delays-app-store-rules/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Apps in this category can now use alternate payment options until June 30th, allowing them to skirt &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;Apple’s 15 to 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; the company takes out of in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zTRWcL"&gt;“In 2020, we chose to support apps and developers that needed to adapt services from in-person to digital as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Apple writes in the post. “Given the recent resurgence of COVID and its continued impact on in-person services, we’ve extended the most recent deadline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z270vJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple first deferred its rule targeting group event apps in November 2020&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Of0dJM"&gt;Apple introduced &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=xqk627qu"&gt;changes to its in-app purchase policy&lt;/a&gt; in September 2020, clarifying apps that provide “one-to-few and one-to-many realtime experiences,” such as online classes and virtual group events, must process payments through in-app purchases. However, the company changed its rules to permit “person-to-person experiences” consisting of just two people, like medical consultations or real-estate tours, to use other payment methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eU45TI"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455598/facebook-paid-events-apple-ios-30-percent-fees-waived"&gt;facing criticism&lt;/a&gt; for charging event platforms a commission in the midst of a pandemic, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21595040/apple-developer-in-app-purchase-deadline-online-classes-events"&gt;decided to defer its rule targeting group event apps&lt;/a&gt; in November 2020 and later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22398338/apple-iap-classes-events-deadline-december-2021-2022"&gt;extended the reprieve until December 31st, 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dark Souls 3 exploit could let hackers take control of your entire computer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dark Souls 3 screenshots" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YTHWxKmMmN7Q7Zk9382B6jpxJRE=/388x0:5248x3240/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70421505/dark-souls-3-screenshot-2.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M7f1b9"&gt;A dangerous remote code execution (RCE) exploit found in &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls 3 &lt;/em&gt;could let a bad actor take control of your computer, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/dark-souls-3-players-risk-having-their-pc-bricked-if-they-play-online-1746144/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dexerto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The vulnerability only puts PC gamers who play online at risk and may potentially affect &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls 2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774836/elden-ring-fromsoftware-hands-on-preview"&gt;the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Servers for various &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; games have since been shut down in response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnCGVy"&gt;The exploit was seen in action during &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1271478221"&gt;The__Grim__Sleeper’s Twitch stream&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls 3&lt;/em&gt; online. At the end of the stream (&lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1271478221?t=01h20m22s"&gt;1:20:22&lt;/a&gt;), The__Grim__Sleeper’s game crashes, and the robotic voice belonging to Microsoft’s text-to-speech generator suddenly starts criticizing his gameplay. The__Grim__Sleeper then reports that Microsoft PowerShell opened by itself, a sign that a hacker used the program to run a script that triggered the text-to-speech feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ERe6bV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;RCE is one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XW9R0Z"&gt;However, this likely wasn’t a malicious hacker — a &lt;a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/524597731121954816/934488192575500318/unknown.png"&gt;screenshotted post&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://discord.com/channels/81303778900316160/524597731121954816"&gt;SpeedSouls’ Discord&lt;/a&gt; may reveal the “hacker’s” actual intentions. According to the post, the “hacker” knew about the vulnerability and attempted to contact &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; developer FromSoftware about the issue. He was reportedly ignored, so he started using the hack on streamers to draw attention to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cj1Tb6"&gt;But if a bad actor discovered this problem first, the outcome could’ve been much worse. RCE is one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities, as &lt;a href="https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/remote-code-execution-rce/"&gt;noted by Kaspersky&lt;/a&gt;. It allows hackers to run malicious code on their victim’s computer, causing irreparable damage, and potentially stealing sensitive information while they’re at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpBRYI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/723"&gt;Blue Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, a community-made anti-cheat mod for &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls 3&lt;/em&gt;, has since been patched to protect against the RCE vulnerability. In &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/s9sd3w/new_remote_code_execution_vulnerability_discovered/"&gt;a post on the r/darksouls3 subreddit&lt;/a&gt;, a user explains that (hopefully) only four people know how to execute the RCE hack — two of which are Blue Sentinel developers, and the other two are people “who worked on it,” possibly referring to the individuals who helped uncover the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpZ7XD"&gt;A representative for Bandai Namco, &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls’&lt;/em&gt; publisher, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/s9wai2/it_is_now_possible_for_dark_souls_3_invaders_to/htsgybl/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;commented on a Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; in response to the issue, stating: “Thanks very much for the ping, a report on this topic was submitted to the relevant internal teams earlier today, the information is much appreciated!” &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Bandai Namco with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="amdAag"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;PvP servers for Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 2, and Dark Souls: Remastered have been temporarily deactivated to allow the team to investigate recent reports of an issue with online services. &lt;br&gt;Servers for Dark Souls: PtDE will join them shortly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We apologize for this inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;— Dark Souls (@DarkSoulsGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DarkSoulsGame/status/1485210967009071108?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 23, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tHelEw"&gt;Fortunately, it seems like FromSoftware and Bandai Namco are addressing the issue. Early Sunday morning, the &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account announced that PvP servers for &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls: Remastered, Dark Souls 2, and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls 3 &lt;/em&gt;have been temporarily shut down “to allow the team to investigate recent reports of an issue with online services.” It adds that the servers for &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition&lt;/em&gt; will also be deactivated soon. This only affects PC players — if you’re playing on PlayStation or Xbox, you can still play online. There’s no word on when servers will be back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqTN1n"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 23rd 10:50AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to add that the servers for &lt;/em&gt;Dark Souls: Remastered&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Dark Souls 2&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Dark Souls 3, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Dark Souls: PtDE&lt;em&gt; have been temporarily shut down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>European Parliament approves initial proposal to ban some targeted ads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_fP9u2vJpa8b-XAdIqIg655W68I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70422751/acastro_1800724_1777_EU_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WR8eOJ"&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220114IPR21017/digital-services-act-regulating-platforms-for-a-safer-online-space-for-users"&gt;the European Parliament voted to approve&lt;/a&gt; the initial draft of a bill that aims to curb Big Tech’s invasive advertising practices (via &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/facebook-google-face-tighter-ad-tracking-curbs-in-europe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The Parliament adopted the draft with 530 votes of approval, 78 against, and 80 absentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rblH9L"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_20_2348"&gt;Digital Services Act&lt;/a&gt;, which was &lt;a href="http://cnbc.com/2020/12/15/digital-markets-act-eus-new-rules-on-big-tech.html"&gt;first introduced in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, will prevent platforms, like Google, Amazon, and the Meta-owned Facebook, from using sensitive information, such as sexual orientation, race, and religion for targeted ads. It will require services to give users the ability to easily opt out of tracking, and pressures platforms to remove illegal content and products online, including hate speech or counterfeit goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yes! with a huge majority, the European Parliament adopted the Digital Services Act.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VY5vAF"&gt;“With a huge majority, the European Parliament adopted the Digital Services Act,” Dutch politician and Parliament member Paul Tang wrote on Twitter. “A big win, with support from left to right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqWCjg"&gt;The approved proposal also includes two rules that &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/key-eu-parliament-committee-agrees-tough-position-dsa-tech-rules-2021-12-14/"&gt;the Parliament agreed on last month&lt;/a&gt;: a ban on both targeted ads for minors and &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22351108/dark-patterns-ui-web-design-privacy"&gt;dark patterns&lt;/a&gt;, a practice that some platforms use to trick users into agreeing to share their data. Any company in violation of these policies could face fines of up to six percent of its global revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5QTqs5"&gt;As noted by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, the Digital Services Act still has more hurdles to overcome; negotiations with the European Council start on January 31st. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889903/democrats-targeted-advertising-facebook-google-surveillance"&gt;US Democrats introduced a similar bill last week&lt;/a&gt;, which would also ban targeted advertising if passed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yet another TV show features a character having a heart attack on a Peloton</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RkympJ5NeP1THxDzOpdSDCKorzI=/468x0:2880x1608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70422701/Screen_Shot_2022_01_21_at_18.03.12.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fitness company can’t catch a break on TV.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Showtime&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZF0vOs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers ahead for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just Like That... &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Billions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ws5nbR"&gt;Peloton really can’t catch a break. Not only did &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893462/peloton-bikes-treadmills-production-connected-fitness"&gt;rumors it’s temporarily suspending production of its connected bikes and treadmills&lt;/a&gt; send the stock plunging on Thursday, but — in a plot twist worthy of the big screen — a &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; TV show character has been shown having a heart attack while riding a Peloton. This comes just over a month after a beloved character from &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; was killed off after a workout on one of the company’s bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="1E4DbJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. Big’s ghost rides again to haunt Peloton&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yO8zDF"&gt;In the season six premiere of &lt;em&gt;Billions &lt;/em&gt;(available in an early release via streaming, including for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQdhtNHcOjQ"&gt;free on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of the show’s usual Sunday night time slot), the character Wags’ Peloton ride is &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/kQdhtNHcOjQ?t=360"&gt;interrupted by EMTs who tell him he’s having a heart attack&lt;/a&gt;. (The medics were called by his bosses who were secretly getting heart rate data from an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22789248/oura-ring-3-review-sleep-tracker-fitness-tracker"&gt;Oura-like ring&lt;/a&gt; and initially suspect a different kind of late-night workout.) When he returns to the office, he even makes a reference to the now-infamous scene from last month: “I’m not going out like Mr. Big!” he triumphantly announces to his co-workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="Iq64JI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kQdhtNHcOjQ?rel=0&amp;amp;start=297" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SdQFSZ"&gt;Mr. Big may be gone from &lt;em&gt;And Just Like That&lt;/em&gt;, but he’s been haunting Peloton. First, of course, was the fictional character’s death, which &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/10/peloton-selloff-continues-as-sex-and-the-city-reboot-adds-to-image-issues.html"&gt;hurt the company’s very real stock prices&lt;/a&gt;. Then, Peloton &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22831861/peloton-and-just-like-that-big-commercial-response"&gt;tried to quickly turn the situation around&lt;/a&gt; with an ad featuring Ryan Reynolds and Mr. Big’s actor, Chris Noth. The ad directly calls out the show, explaining the health benefits of regular cycling and ending with “he’s alive.” Days later, Peloton &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22841034/peloton-viral-ads-sex-and-the-city-mr-big-chris-noth-sexual-assault"&gt;scrubbed the ad from the internet&lt;/a&gt; after two women accused Noth of sexual assault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJpj1f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billions&lt;/em&gt; using almost the same plot point as &lt;em&gt;And Just Like That&lt;/em&gt; is completely coincidental, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/21/arts/television/billions-peloton-premiere.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The scene was apparently written and shot early last year, and the line about Mr. Big was dubbed in after the fact. Even as someone who doesn’t watch &lt;em&gt;Billions&lt;/em&gt;, this serendipity is delightful — though I don’t imagine Peloton would agree. While the company hasn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893462/peloton-bikes-treadmills-production-connected-fitness"&gt;blamed Wag’s extravagant lifestyle for the heart condition&lt;/a&gt;, it did point out to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; the virtues of a good cardio workout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWSVfF"&gt;I’m inclined to agree. I’m feeling great after the ab workout that laughing about this whole situation has given me. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp may soon let you transfer your chats from Android to iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8_fa6K0moCEDnL4kdB3lx_d2158=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70421195/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LltKLa"&gt;WhatsApp might be working on a feature that lets you migrate your chat history from Android to iOS, as reported by &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-messenger-beta-for-ios-22-2-74-whats-new/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; via (&lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp-chat-history-migration-from-android-ios-preview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mtMaU"&gt;The feature was first spotted in the latest WhatsApp beta version 22.2.74 for iOS, and appears to corroborate &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-21-20-11-whats-new/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; previous discovery in beta version 2.21.20.11 for Android&lt;/a&gt;. Both updates point towards a feature that may let you transfer your WhatsApp chats from Android to iOS using the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.movetoios"&gt;Move to iOS app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uRDR8NY6aSSsqg_8fQn91Qej9S4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23187939/wa_chat_history_android_to_ios.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-messenger-beta-for-ios-22-2-74-whats-new/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WaBetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eZPKQH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; also shared a couple of screenshots that show what the feature may look like. Judging by the images, it appears WhatsApp will ask for permission before starting the transfer process, and will then instruct you to keep the app open and your phone unlocked as it migrates your chats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKe9NE"&gt;WhatsApp first started letting users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655753/migrate-iphone-whatsapp-data-chat-history-samsung-phone"&gt;migrate their chat histories from iOS to Samsung phones&lt;/a&gt; in September, and later extended the feature to support chat transfers from iOS to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747446/whatsapp-chat-migrate-iphone-pixel-android-12"&gt;Google Pixels and other Android 12 devices&lt;/a&gt;. Letting users transfer their chats from Android to iOS would close an obvious loop, but it remains unclear which devices will support the rumored feature, as well as when (or if) it will start rolling out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US athletes told to use burner phones at Beijing Winter Olympics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Workers Set Up Winter Olympics-themed Installation In Beijing" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mQ1NxLKE73bGtLlJ5yNBTIZvQhU=/0x322:4096x3053/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70420898/1364561792.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FQXv71"&gt;The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee is telling athletes to ditch their personal phones for burners ahead of next month’s Winter Olympics in China, according to a report from the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/team-usa-athletes-beijing-olympics-phones-11642177765"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/us-wants-athletes-use-burner-phones-beijing-winter-olympics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zwduFv"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “Every device, communication, transaction and online activity may be monitored”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wpul9o"&gt;The advisory was reportedly sent out twice last year to warn athletes about the possibility of digital surveillance while in China. “Every device, communication, transaction and online activity may be monitored,” the bulletin states. “Your device(s) may also be compromised with malicious software, which could negatively impact future use.” As noted by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, Great Britain, Canada, and the Netherlands have also cautioned athletes against bringing their personal electronics into the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlKoIN"&gt;The Committee’s fears aren’t unfounded. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/2/20679053/china-spyware-tourists-android-phones-xinjiang"&gt;China was caught secretly installing spyware on tourists’ phones&lt;/a&gt; who entered from the Xinjiang region. This &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745068/best-buy-home-depot-lorex-ezviz-uyghur-surveillance-sales-dji"&gt;heavily-surveilled area&lt;/a&gt; is populated by the Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority that &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/06/china-draconian-repression-of-muslims-in-xinjiang-amounts-to-crimes-against-humanity/"&gt;China has subjected to imprisonment and torture&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, research group &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2022/01/cross-country-exposure-analysis-my2022-olympics-app/"&gt;Citizen Lab found that China’s My2022 Olympic app&lt;/a&gt;, which all attendees are required to install, is full of security holes that could lead to privacy breaches, surveillance, and hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGfdAe"&gt;Back when Beijing held the 2008 Summer Olympics, &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a12076/4276361/"&gt;the US Department of Homeland Security issued a similar advisory&lt;/a&gt; for any travelers headed to China, warning that bringing any devices potentially exposes them to “unauthorized access and theft of data by criminal or foreign government elements.” Things are a bit different this time around, however, as &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/29/beijing-olympics-to-ban-foreign-spectators-implement-covid-vaccination-protocols.html"&gt;China has banned all foreign spectators&lt;/a&gt; due to concerns over COVID-19. Athletes will likely be relying on their mobile devices to stay in touch with friends and family, which could be more complicated on a burner phone that comes with limits on mobile data, texting, and calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6cW1l"&gt;But even if the Olympic athletes want to use their burner phones to browse the internet, they still might not get unlimited access. During the 2008 Olympics, China promised to offer spectators, journalists, and athletes unrestricted access to the web, since &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/which-websites-and-online-services-are-banned-in-china"&gt;The Great Firewall of China currently blocks a number of popular websites&lt;/a&gt; in the country, like Google, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Netflix, and more. China didn’t seem to follow through on its promise, however. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/31/sports/olympics/31china.html"&gt;Journalists reported that they still weren’t able to access certain websites&lt;/a&gt;, including BBC China, a number of Hong Kong newspapers, as well as the site for human rights organization Amnesty International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0GABh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2022/01/07/china-winter-olympics-beijing-omicron/"&gt;China has once again said&lt;/a&gt; it will give athletes and journalists uncensored access to the internet, but it’s unclear if the country will still block certain sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vMW7I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRG7k4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NYC Mayor takes pay cut as cryptocurrency market plunges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Conference Of Mayors Held In Washington, DC" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kbqnW5DWQ7G94vJV0oEA4LAuX8s=/0x0:5585x3723/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70420482/1365932278.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xCcGAh"&gt;Even in the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-21/crypto-meltdown-erases-more-than-1-trillion-in-market-value"&gt;midst of a crypto slump&lt;/a&gt;, New York City Mayor Eric Adams isn’t backing out of his plans to take his first three paychecks in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin fell beneath $36,000 on Friday — &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-price-falls-below-40-000-in-tandem-with-tech-selloff-11642765835"&gt;a 47 percent dive&lt;/a&gt; from its all-time high in November — dragging the &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/21/crypto-market-cap-falls-below-2t-amid-selloff/"&gt;entire cryptocurrency market cap below $2 trillion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GjQewL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If the crypto market continues to trend downwards, Adams’ first check may evaporate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PgIn0l"&gt;Adams officially received his first paycheck yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893275/nyc-mayor-adams-convert-paycheck-cryptocurrency-coinbase-bitcoin-ethereum"&gt;which was converted to Bitcoin and Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; through cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. According to the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/01/20/eric-adams-converting-first-paycheck-as-nyc-mayor-to-bitcoin-ethereum/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the NYC mayor receives biweekly paychecks of about $5,900, amounting to a salary of $258,750 a year. Adams didn’t reveal how much of his $5,900 check is split between Bitcoin and Ethereum, but if the crypto market continues to trend downwards, the funds from Adams’ first check may quickly evaporate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGtGDR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22764104/new-york-city-mayor-elect-eric-adams-announces-bitcoin-paycheck-miami"&gt;Mayor Adams announced he would&lt;/a&gt; take his first three paychecks in Bitcoin last November (which, of course, was just before &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/11/bitcoin-retreats-from-all-time-high-ether-follows/"&gt;Bitcoin reached a record $69,000&lt;/a&gt;). The move came out of a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericadamsfornyc/status/1456311827550384129?s=20"&gt;Twitter exchange&lt;/a&gt; between Adams and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who said he would receive his next paycheck in Bitcoin. Adams wanted to take things a bit further, though, electing to get not one, but three paychecks in digital currency, as part of his bid to &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/041-22/mayor-adams-receive-first-paycheck-cryptocurrency"&gt;turn NYC into “the center of cryptocurrency.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISPlFk"&gt;Mayor Adams is but one of a number of high-profile figures to take their paychecks in cryptocurrency. &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/7-nfl-players-that-chose-crypto-over-cash-salaries"&gt;NFL players including Aaron Rodgers&lt;/a&gt;, Tom Brady, and Odell Beckham Jr. have also chosen to convert a portion, if not their entire salaries into cryptocurrency. The current crypto slump is likely wringing out their digital wallets even more so than Adams’, however, as all three players switched over their salaries when Bitcoin was at its highest last fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wgytC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New YouTube TV subscribers can pay YouTube TV $54.99 each month instead of $64.99.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0ADTn"&gt;Just in time for Super Bowl season, a three-month subscription to the YouTube TV streaming service is a little more affordable. Right now, new subscribers can &lt;a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/"&gt;pay $54.99 each month instead of $64.99 for your first three months&lt;/a&gt;. Normally, that would cost you around $195, so that means you’ll pay $165 by the end of this discount period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lx08Ii"&gt;That’s still expensive, but it’s a welcome discount for a service that significantly gone up in price within the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/12/17109018/youtube-tv-price-change-signup-grandfathered-google"&gt;last few years&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, it’s a solid streaming app if you want many channels on-demand (with DVR capabilities available), presented in a familiar YouTube interface. For this price, you’ll get access to over 85 major channels, covering live sports, news, entertainment, and more. It also includes unlimited recording for up to six accounts, and you can cancel whenever you’d like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="on3ady"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max over-ear headphones sold for their lowest price ever during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In case you missed out on that deal, you have another chance at saving big today. For the first time since the holidays, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Silver/dp/B08PZJN7BD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy the headphones in the sky blue colorway for $449 from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is just $20 shy of their best price ever. That equates to a savings of $100 on some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; you can buy right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCQQ7R"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;we noted in our review&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s over-ear headphones offer excellent sound quality, while boasting great spatial audio features so you can better immerse yourself in a movie or  compatible music. The headphones are comfortable to wear for a long time as well thanks to their breathable knit mesh canopy. While $449 is still quite expensive, this could be a good deal for those deeply embedded within the Apple ecosystem given how seamlessly these headphones can also pair with other Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XA9McH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yvE4iK"&gt;When we first published &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt; of Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra one year ago, we called it the best Android phone on the market. We were impressed with the huge phone’s excellent camera system, as well as its stunning 6.8-inch dynamic OLED screen that boasts a high refresh rate. We appreciated its lengthy battery life, too, as well as how fast the  Snapdragon 888 processor-powered phone is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Raudj"&gt;Though, almost a full year out from its release, we wouldn’t suggest paying $1,199.99 — its original price. However, if you can be swayed by a decent deal, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N2MSSZY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling the phantom black, 128GB model for $1049.99 today&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $150. That’s the lowest we’ve seen it sell for since the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67VNhH"&gt;Note, Samsung will soon release the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870027/samsung-s22-series-unofficial-dummy-leak-design-camera-specs"&gt;Galaxy S22 series&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear exactly when, but that means we’ll likely see even more discounts on the Galaxy S21 lineup sooner rather than later. Still, if you can’t wait, this is a good deal for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AoP20p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326077"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="lvmHwQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Want to preorder Samsung’s next Galaxy phone sight unseen? You can","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893756/samsung-galaxy-s22-2022-preorders"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ab5Gu2"&gt;On the market for a budget-friendly tablet? Amazon is selling its 2020 Fire HD 8 tablets for half-off, with the ad-supported, 32GB base model &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TMJ1R3X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $44.99 instead of $89.99&lt;/a&gt;. If you want slightly more RAM and wireless charging, the Fire HD 8 Plus is also 50 percent off, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0839NDRB2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling for $54.99 instead of $109.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5I7pLX"&gt;Regardless of which you buy, both offer a USB-C port for faster charging, and have a faster processor than their predecessors. While app selection is limited to Amazon’s Appstore, that still gives you access to the likes of Netflix, Hulu, Facebook, Zoom, Outlook, and more. If you’re leaning toward the Fire HD 8 Plus, &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21294989/fire-hd-8-plus-review-amazon-prime-android-tablet-fireos-price"&gt;Dieter Bohn pointed out&lt;/a&gt; in his review that you can use the Plus as an Echo Show if you &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MP4PNYG/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;purchase Amazon’s wireless charging dock alongside the tablet&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so costs $108, down from $163.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1fLyTb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882618"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="t6bbI0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736517"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BXkoFx"&gt;Here are some even more deals to treat yourself to this weekend:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rUrVrp"&gt;Typically $59.99, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F265419191923%3Famdata%3Denc%253AAQAGAAAAkHzZbW8KkgQEADiqzkcqzSQgmhXsDBMhRufhkwVazKmaFBPeBDG82c%252FRmtwDbnCzhMqvq7yXrDR2PPTZy%252F9vFsysnuyNx5wGB%252FL4xiibIrnlaELM03nhesgW0oaZcTAlOogZvdMHW9b8n6EuttuaZIADxG3YYMFG5WBFm9zHztRfwoxxh3ksNJLLamCrfpuhiw%253D%253D%257Ctkp%253ABFBMnv6xpNBf%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F22%2F22894955%2Fyoutube-tv-apple-airpods-xbox-headset-amazon-fire-tablet-ravpower-myq-chamberlain-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s official eBay storefront is selling wired Xbox One gaming headsets for just $19.99.&lt;/a&gt;  While it’s not &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632185/microsoft-new-xbox-wired-stereo-headset-series-x-s-pc-headphones-features-price"&gt;the latest version&lt;/a&gt;, it should be suitable if you don’t want to spend too much on a headset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BNVlyp"&gt;Apple’s Magic Keyboard, which is compatible with 11-inch iPad Pros (2018 and up) and the fourth-gen iPad Air, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1066108/9383?subId1=TheVergeDailyDeals1212022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMagic-Keyboard-for-11-inch-iPad-Pro-1st-2nd-or-3rd-Generation-and-iPad-Air-4th-Generation-iPad-Not-Included%2F984505060&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is selling for $229 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li id="1UA0vo"&gt;The popular &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GD3D9YJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;myQ Chamberlain smart garage door controller is once again selling for $19.98 instead of $29.98&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since the holidays, which is just $2 shy of its Black Friday price.
