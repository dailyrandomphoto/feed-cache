    <title>The best Chromebook for 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best Chromebook laptop or two-in-one for every Chrome OS fan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="oqi8dk"&gt;The best Chromebooks aren’t just laptops that run a few Google apps anymore. Chromebooks can cover a wide variety of computing needs now, and a good Chrome OS laptop or two-in-one can be more useful than a mediocre &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21231636/windows-10-pc-user-guide-how-to-microsoft"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281530/macos-mac-imac-user-guide-how-to-os-tips"&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt; laptop. That’s why our pick for the best Chromebook of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;, which does just about everything right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnwyna"&gt;The best Chromebooks are known to deliver good value. The message that many people actually want &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;Chromebooks — rather than just cheap ones — has gotten through to manufacturers. Many are around $500 or $600, though there are good options in the higher and lower ranges as well. The extra money goes a long way toward getting something you’ll be happy with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUTNYw"&gt;For the first time, the quality of the best Chromebooks in this range has been consistent. There are so many similarities between the offerings from Asus, Lenovo, Google, HP, Dell, and Samsung that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they’re all sourcing their components from the same factory. That’s great news if you’re comparison shopping; the majority of this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount. They can even rival some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21528540/budget-windows-10-chromebook-systems-acer-lenovo-cheap"&gt;best budget laptops&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptops&lt;/a&gt; on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMCGia"&gt;Our pick for the best Chromebook is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and we’ve selected the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; for shoppers on a budget. Other picks for the best Chromebooks of 2021 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, the HP Chromebook x360, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch4TuU"&gt;What most buyers want in the best Chromebook are likely the same things they want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want. More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but these are the ones that rise above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the best Chromebook of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KQRVus"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BfZy92"&gt;Best Chromebook of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LpXHDz"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is, hands-down, the best Chromebook you can buy. With a gorgeous 3:2 screen that rivals some more expensive competitors, you’ll have a ton of extra vertical space for your work and multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarhIJ"&gt;The keyboard is excellent with a comfortable, quiet feel, and nice backlighting. There’s even an HDMI port, which you don’t see on a thin Chromebook every day. And (most importantly) the 11th-Gen Intel processors can handle a heavy load of tabs with no problem. The Spin’s speakers aren’t great, and there’s no biometric login, but those are reasonable sacrifices to make for a laptop of this quality at this low of a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX2USx"&gt;In a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Acer sets itself apart by making an affordable laptop that’s excellent in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For students or anyone looking for a small secondary device, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great affordable pick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RGZEpN"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P8MGAD"&gt;Best Chromebook on a budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xJq778"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable device for on-the-go work, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet delivers excellent value for its low price. It’s an ultra-portable 10.1-inch 2-in-1 device with a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfnBmb"&gt;The Duet contains a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage, and it performs well if you’re just browsing and don’t plan on using a super heavy load. It also uses a version of Chrome OS that’s made for its convertible form factor, including the first version of Chrome that’s optimized for tablet use. When detached from its keyboard, the Duet supports an Android-esque gesture navigation system that makes switching between apps a breeze. But the most impressive feature is battery life; I got close to 11.5 hours of fairly heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93jX9I"&gt;Of course, there are drawbacks. The touchpad and keyboard are quite small, there’s no headphone jack (and only one USB-C port), and the 16:10 screen is a bit dim. But those are reasonable trade-offs to make for such an affordable price. It makes a great secondary device for schoolwork or on-the-go browsing.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a larger device with more power, one of the best Chromebooks you can buy is the HP Chromebook x360 14.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C2SoIE"&gt;3. HP Chromebook x360 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rtrWbQ"&gt;Powerful Chromebook with a sleek design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rGvI"&gt;If you’re looking to get more power and you don’t mind getting a slightly larger laptop, the HP Chromebook x360 14 is a great choice. HP has several configurations that fall under this name, but we suggest the model we tested with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage to go along with the i3 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUDxQ"&gt;While we picked the Asus because of its elegant design, there isn’t much to complain about on the slightly larger HP. It has the same ports, RAM, and storage. The keyboard is great, and it also sounds slightly better because the speakers are up on the keyboard deck instead of on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="epP0CZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508136"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;If the Chomebook Duet isn’t enough, the Chromebook Detachable CM3 brings some new perks to the detachable form factor, for an extra cost.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FxguZ6"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CrrPVI"&gt;Best detachable Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="canZPK"&gt;The Chromebook Detachable CM3 is Asus’s attempt to compete with Lenovo’s highly praised Chromebook Duet. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch, 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, a kickstand, and a keyboard that pops on and off. It’s a bit more expensive than the Duet, but also has a few extra features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNgQvV"&gt;One unique perk is that the kickstand folds multiple ways: You can fold it the long way to stand the tablet up like a laptop, or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. We’re not sure how practical this functionality actually is, but it’s there if you have a use case in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlTu0z"&gt;The CM3 also comes with a built-in USI stylus, and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. But the thing we found most impressive was the battery life: We averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work on the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11a1Pz"&gt;The CM3 won’t be the best Chromebook for everyone: It only has two ports (one USB-C and one audio jack) and its MediaTek processor was a bit sluggish compared to more expensive offerings. But if you’re looking for a convertible Chrome OS device and find that the Duet doesn’t quite suit your needs, you’re likely the CM3’s target audience. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 one of the best Chromebooks of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AZSrVU"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yloceu"&gt;Best midrange Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="IqMUru"&gt;Samsung’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; shot for the moon, with a $1,000 price tag, an OLED display, a packaged stylus, and a premium build. The Galaxy Chromebook 2 isn’t so much a sequel to that device as it is a pared-down, more affordable alternative. There’s no fingerprint sensor, no stylus, and no OLED — but it’s quite functional, and with a sub-$600 starting price it’s a much more reasonable purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMshkm"&gt;The Chromebook 2’s highlight feature is its finish: It comes in a bright “fiesta red” that will certainly stand out wherever you’re using it. (There’s a gray option as well, if you’d prefer something subtle.) It’s also the first Chromebook ever to feature one of Samsung’s QLED panels. QLED isn’t OLED — it’s just a fancier LED — but it still makes for one of the most gorgeous displays I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91mDFz"&gt;Nice screens sometimes wreck battery life, but that’s not the case here. I averaged about seven hours and 21 minutes of continuous work on the Chromebook 2, which means you shouldn’t need to plug it in &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;too often. And while the Core i3 processor isn’t the most powerful chip you can get in a Chromebook, it’s just fine for everyday work use. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go has a stylish and portable design with a standout keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s4tmgA"&gt;Best Google Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WMItcT"&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop that weighs just 2.3 pounds. It has a sturdy magnesium chassis, and a ridged grip on the bottom to keep itself from slipping on slanted surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M72CDq"&gt;Not only is the Pixelbook Go portable and stylish, but it delivers solid performance, and supports fast charging through either of its USB-C ports. Battery life is also impressive. The Go lasted over eight hours in our testing, and it should get you through a full workday with no problem. But its standout feature is the keyboard, which is quiet with good travel and a springy feel. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Dieter Bohn found it to be his “favorite thing to type on by a long shot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCvQ3C"&gt;The Go is an expensive product, as Chromebooks go, and it doesn’t top our list because the Chromebook Flip C434 offers similar specs and features for a slightly lower price. But we think plenty of shoppers who value long battery life and lightweight build might prefer to spend a bit more on this device instead.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook is a premium Chromebook for grown-ups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="URZefw"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22424783/lenovo-thinkpad-c13-yoga-review-price-specs-features-amd"&gt;Lenovo C13 Yoga Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="U2ykf7"&gt;Best premium Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nT7MLq"&gt;Many modern Chromebooks are oriented towards kids and students, but not this one. The C13 Yoga Chromebook is a sturdy, pricey, convertible Chromebook for grown-ups. It’s part of Lenovo’s renowned ThinkPad business line, and has all kinds of ThinkPad perks including a red Trackpoint, discrete touchpad clickers, a fingerprint sensor, a webcam shutter, and an aluminum design. Put this Chromebook next to any number of Windows ThinkPads, and we might not be able to pick it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLVSSi"&gt;The C13 is also unique in that it’s the first Chromebook to include AMD’s Ryzen 3000 Mobile C-series processors, which are marketed specifically for Chromebooks. The chips run all kinds of programs — even mobile games — quite smoothly. We do wish the battery life was a bit better — we only averaged just over six hours on one charge. We averaged seven and a half hours from our top pick, the Chromebook Spin 713, and plenty of the devices here break eight hours with no problem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wNILY1"&gt;8. Dell Inspiron 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sajnTX"&gt;Premium 2-in-1 with a built-in stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6nUXhF"&gt;It’s a bit heavy as Chromebooks go, but the 3.99-pound Inspiron 14 is still a sturdy convertible device with brushed aluminum chassis that gives it a premium look. It has a spacious backlit keyboard and a nice 1920 x 1080 display with accurate colors. With an 8th Gen Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, it delivers snappy performance for streaming, browsing, multitasking, and even more demanding artistic tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kX7aDx"&gt;Speaking of artists, the Inspiron 14 comes with a stylus, which lives in a dedicated socket inside the chassis so you don’t have to worry about losing it. Thanks to electromagnetic resonance technology (EMR), it doesn’t need batteries or any kind of charge. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X6cCFz"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22400085/lenovo-ideapad-flex-3-chromebook-review-price-screen"&gt;Lenovo Flex 3 Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YGLlQl"&gt;Best Chromebook for kids&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="S71N4L"&gt;The Lenovo Flex 3 is ideal for someone on a tight budget who wants a small, lightweight device. It’s most useful as a portable companion for travel or school: It lasted us close to nine hours one a charge, and also juices up pretty quickly with its 45W power brick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMomXG"&gt;There are some other perks as well. It has one of the better keyboards we’ve ever used on a Chromebook, let alone a Chromebook in the $350 price range. And it has excellent connectivity, including four modern USB ports and a microSD reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0kBcV"&gt;All that said, this isn’t the device for things beyond basic tasks. The tiny screen (11 inches) doesn’t have a lot of room for multitasking, and the Intel Celeron processor isn’t designed to handle many demanding apps or too many Chrome tabs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workers at a repair facility used by Apple compare conditions to sweatshops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MxZMxUAwaJR3jbZv8zkeTr2yIc0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69642266/acastro_170731_1777_0004_v5.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eKwK9I"&gt;Workers at a Houston, Texas facility that processes repairs for Apple, Dell, and Lenovo reportedly say they are working in “sweatshop” conditions, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-repair-workers-sweatshop-csat-solutions-2021-7"&gt;according to a story from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Workers’ toilets are reportedly unsanitary and insufficient, they say they lack air conditioning, and they claim their pay is low at CSAT Solutions, a company that acts as a repair partner for tech companies like Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlrWzk"&gt;In the report, which is &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-repair-workers-sweatshop-csat-solutions-2021-7"&gt;worth reading in its entirety&lt;/a&gt;, employees also reportedly say there aren’t enough bathrooms or parking spots for the number of workers, and that they’re not allowed to use their phones while working, even in the case of family or personal emergencies. One employee told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that she got off work to discover that her son had been taken to the hospital after being burned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Su658a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some employees expected an environment that reflected the prestige of the Apple brand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V4E92a"&gt;The working conditions alleged at CSAT took some employees by surprise, according to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, as they expected an environment reflective of the prestige that comes with the Apple brand. Instead, they reportedly faced quotas that were difficult to meet, and pay that ranged from $12 to $14 an hour, with little hope for raises or promotions. Some employees told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that they had to work 60 hours a week just to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUWPKl"&gt;A CSAT Solutions representative told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;that the company has “high workplace standards,” that the company takes great pride in the opportunities it provides its employees, and that it takes allegations seriously and investigates complaints. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, which can be read in full below, Apple said that it will be investigating the allegations, and that its focus is “making sure that everyone in [its] supply chain is protected and treated with dignity and respect.” Dell told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it “takes all allegations of this nature seriously, and will investigate fully,” and Lenovo didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="73XQaj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Employees reportedly felt like their requests and concerns were unaddressed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kKaZ4E"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, employees felt as if their previous concerns and reports to management had been ignored. Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it has assessed CSAT’s Houston location multiple times in recent years, but didn’t discuss its findings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="veJanZ"&gt;The practice of Apple visiting and inspecting suppliers’ facilities, however, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupplier-responsibility%2Fpdf%2FApple-Supplier-Code-of-Conduct-and-Supplier-Responsibility-Standards.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596784%2Fcsat-solutions-repair-facility-texas-apple-macbook-dell-lenovo-working-conditions-employees" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;seems to be routine&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) to the point that suppliers may be able to paint themselves in a more positive light. &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;’s report includes stories from multiple employees about being asked to carry out work in a more by-the-book fashion when Apple’s auditors were around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypoowl"&gt;Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it has the highest standards in the industry, and it has a page on its website &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupplier-responsibility%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596784%2Fcsat-solutions-repair-facility-texas-apple-macbook-dell-lenovo-working-conditions-employees" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dedicated to talking about supplier responsibility&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the company’s suppliers have faced accusations of poor factory working conditions, with three stories about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22204920/lens-technology-uighur-forced-labor-xinjiang-amazon-apple-tesla"&gt;forced labor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166286/apple-china-labor-violations-temporary-workers"&gt;labor law violations&lt;/a&gt; (where Apple allegedly turned a blind eye), and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/13/22172383/workers-protest-wistron-iphone-se-plant-india-pay"&gt;protests of pay reduction&lt;/a&gt; coming out in December 2020 alone. There’s also recently been the issue of Apple’s own employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453302/apple-culture-secrecy-leak-antonio-garcia-martinez-letter"&gt;fighting for the ability to work remotely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WVeMCI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;CSAT also does work for Dell and Lenovo&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VFy9NR"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; report also raises concerns about CSAT’s usage of temp agencies to hire workers. According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupplier-responsibility%2Fpdf%2FApple-Supplier-Code-of-Conduct-and-Supplier-Responsibility-Standards.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596784%2Fcsat-solutions-repair-facility-texas-apple-macbook-dell-lenovo-working-conditions-employees" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s Supplier Code of Conduct and Responsibility Standards&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), its standards also apply to subcontractors, and Apple’s suppliers are responsible for ensuring that the companies they hire are also in compliance. The responsibility, however, is not Apple’s alone — according to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, CSAT also does work for Dell and Lenovo. In particular, Dell’s logo shows up frequently &lt;a href="https://www.csat.com/about/"&gt;in the promotional video atop CSAT’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7d0adt"&gt;Employee reviews for CSAT Solutions on sites like &lt;a href="https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Csat-Solutions/reviews"&gt;Indeed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CSAT-Solutions-Reviews-E483310.htm"&gt;Glassdoor&lt;/a&gt; echo some of the concerns brought up by &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, with many &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-CSAT-Solutions-RVW38166423.htm"&gt;comparing working conditions to sweatshops&lt;/a&gt;, warning prospective employees about &lt;a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-CSAT-Solutions-RVW47647065.htm"&gt;low pay&lt;/a&gt;, and expressing dissatisfaction with &lt;a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-CSAT-Solutions-RVW46375146.htm"&gt;working hours&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-CSAT-Solutions-RVW45963998.htm"&gt;quotas&lt;/a&gt;. A few reviews also back up the claims about the cleanliness and availability of the bathrooms, the heat, and broken air conditioners, as well as the strict no-cellphone rules. There are a fair number of positive reviews as well, but many of them are from non-repair employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0MlK1"&gt;In response, CSAT claims it’s required to keep its buildings climate controlled by its clients, with regular maintenance and upgrades to the HVAC and climate control systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="odHgic"&gt;&lt;q&gt;60-hour workweeks are often mentioned in CSAT employee reviews&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="As7HOc"&gt;A job listing for a computer repair technician position at CSAT, found on the company’s website, says that candidates must be willing to work overtime, without saying how much. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupplier-responsibility%2Fpdf%2FApple-Supplier-Code-of-Conduct-and-Supplier-Responsibility-Standards.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596784%2Fcsat-solutions-repair-facility-texas-apple-macbook-dell-lenovo-working-conditions-employees" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s standards&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) state that workweeks have to be restricted to 60 hours, including overtime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The job listing includes the line “This position will require the candidate to have some knowledge of computer components and be willing to work overtime.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Gn2i89r01_cYZNsp7M7tIaMmO8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22744454/Screen_Shot_2021_07_27_at_2.10.30_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A job listing from CSAT’s website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C22ptY"&gt;Here’s Apple’s full statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NcrptJ"&gt;We uphold the highest standards in the industry and regularly assess our suppliers to ensure they comply. We have undertaken three assessments at CSAT in Houston in recent years, and Apple members regularly visit the site. We take all allegations seriously and will investigate. As always, our focus is on making sure that everyone in our supply chain is protected and treated with dignity and respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="YgjZXL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 28th, 5:00PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from Dell and information from CSAT. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will require masks again in most of its US stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An Apple Store Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tdZEjxMAhexg8qebj3MM6MGIQUg=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69646869/1234211745.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MejYUc"&gt;Apple will be requiring customers and staff at most of its more than 270 US retail stores to wear masks even if they are vaccinated, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-28/apple-to-restore-mask-mandate-at-most-stores-for-shoppers-staff?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;according to a new &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;, bringing back a requirement that had been removed &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-13/apple-s-u-s-stores-offices-to-start-dropping-mask-requirement"&gt;starting in June&lt;/a&gt;. The change goes into effect Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvlBaF"&gt;“After carefully reviewing the latest CDC recommendations, and analyzing the health and safety data for your local area, we are updating our guidance on face masks for your store,” Apple informed workers in a memo obtained by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “Starting July 29, face masks will be required in store for customers and team members — even if they’re vaccinated.” Apple employees who work in its corporate offices have also been told they must wear masks inside of Apple office buildings, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zea24U"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FBDbiP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;COVID-19 case rates are rising in many parts of the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B6DaVc"&gt;The move comes as COVID-19 case rates are rising in many parts of the country and on the heels of new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations advising people who are vaccinated against COVID-19 to wear masks indoors in public if “you are in an area of substantial or high transmission” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595945/cdc-mask-recommendations-vaccinated-delta"&gt;that were issued Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBDwI5"&gt;Google also upped its response to COVID-19 on Wednesday, saying that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598316/google-vaccination-requirement-return-offices-covid-19-delta-variant"&gt;it would require employees to be vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; before they can return to the office and delaying its full return to offices from September to October 18th. Apple has also pushed its return to the office &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584761/apple-return-to-office-delayed-covid-delta-variant"&gt;until October at the earliest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to back up your Gmail</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mobile Apps Logos" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_qYiiPCwbHDr6-6f1ksYauLsrkE=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67061348/1202324974.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration byJakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZEk1VN"&gt;You may be switching jobs, or maybe you’ve decided to stop using a specific email account, or maybe you just want a copy of all your email just in case. Whatever your reasons, it’s not a bad idea to back up and export your Gmail and other Google accounts using Google’s Takeout feature. In fact, you can set your accounts to back up regularly, which is a good practice in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHv2wD"&gt;One note: if you’re backing up a company account, you may find that your company has disabled Takeout. There are third-party apps that say they can back up your Gmail, but you should check your company’s policies before you try them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eqmXEa"&gt;How to back up your Gmail:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tSrRu9"&gt;Go to &lt;a href="http://myaccount.google.com"&gt;myaccount.google.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cUmMit"&gt;Under Privacy &amp;amp; personalization, click on “Manage your data &amp;amp; personalization.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jQxw4O"&gt;Scroll down to “Download or delete your data.” Click on “Download your data.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Download your data.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DnjgP2ZuLUnv4DgyLz5deC8Vdp0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746414/Screen_Shot_2021_07_28_at_3.09.08_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Download your data.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="d7ZbuT"&gt;This will take you to the Google Takeout page. Under “Select data to include” check the box next to Gmail and any other apps you want to back up. (Note that some services have buttons labeled “Multiple formats.” Click on that button to choose the format in which your data will be downloaded.)  Then click “Next step.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Takeout options" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PqGgLY_YmHk3pAx5iHszj_GFHe0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20085106/Screen_Shot_2020_07_15_at_11.30.46_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scroll down and make sure Mail is selected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="74EAz9"&gt;To decide how you want to receive your data, click the arrow underneath “Delivery method” to see your options, including emailing a download link or adding it to your Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, or Box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QnDti0"&gt;You can also choose whether to export just one time or every two months (for up to a year), and you can choose the type of file and the maximum file size. (If the file size is larger than your maximum, it will be separated into multiple flies; and any files larger than 2GB will use the zip64 compression format.) After you’re done making your selections, click “Create export.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Takeout settings" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jRv-CUA9YW0MN9PlYhtaQbUh_vM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20084890/Screenshot__181_.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here you’ll find the options for exporting your data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="14Vcmh"&gt;Your export will start. Be prepared to wait; it might take days to finish. You can also click “Cancel export” or “Create another export.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Export progress" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QPAOqDp5_CaLFL3S5GfJTnKXsbg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20084891/Screenshot__184_.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll get this message when your export starts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kRUlKP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 28th, 2021, 3:30PM ET:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on July 15th, 2020. The introduction, along with some of the directions and screenshots, have been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s business is doing better than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B4M40BzTae-wOL81LTfxdezGJCs=/0x1:7371x4915/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69646845/1327685551.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. | Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DPOhJz"&gt;If you pay even the slightest attention to tech news, you’ve probably recently seen nonstop criticism of Facebook’s handling of COVID-19 misinformation, along with a barrage of negative headlines tied to a new book about the company called &lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVwUoZ"&gt;These headlines generally paint the picture of a tech giant that is on the outs with users, advertisers, lawmakers, and its Silicon Valley peers. But as the world’s largest social network showed Wednesday, the reality of how its business is performing couldn’t be more opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Zt7sz"&gt;Facebook said its revenue grew 56 percent in the second quarter to $29 billion, meaning it grew faster during the period than Apple or Microsoft. More impressively, its profit grew an astounding 101 percent to $10.4 billion. Daily users across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp increased 12 percent from the same time last year to 2.76 billion. Non-advertising revenue — namely sales of the Oculus Quest VR headset — grew at a more modest rate of 36 percent. And Apple’s new ad tracking prompt for iPhone apps didn’t materially hurt ad revenue like some expected, though Facebook indicated that the worst is ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OdFOfE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;CFO David Wehner said to expect revenue growth to “decelerate significantly” in the second half of this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uqeNXY"&gt;In prepared remarks to investors, Facebook CFO David Wehner said to expect revenue growth to “decelerate significantly” in the second half of this year, mainly due to a momentary boost in usage last year during pandemic lockdowns. He also cited “regulatory and platform changes, notably the recent iOS updates” from Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4uMlU"&gt;Facebook’s stock price has ballooned 39 percent since the beginning of this year, but the warning about a coming growth slowdown spooked investors, sending its stock down about 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sv7wdk"&gt;The digital ads industry is booming coming out the pandemic, as earlier earnings reports from Snap and Google have already showed. As the number-two player after Google, Facebook stands to benefit from more ad dollars flowing online, even if its targeting capabilities are hindered by Apple in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J90FDb"&gt;A sign of Facebook’s growing strength is the price it chargers advertisers to show ads to users, since that system is run through an auction that increases pricing alongside rising demand. Facebook’s average price per ad grew 47 percent from the year-ago period in the second quarter, and CFO Wehner said the company expects higher ad rates it be the primary driver of revenue growth for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard employees walk out of work to protest rampant sexism and discrimination</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘Until these demands are met, we won’t stop fighting’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="5MQAn0"&gt;Wednesday morning, hundreds of Blizzard employees rallied outside the company’s main campus in Irvine, California to protest the company’s handling of sexual harassment and discrimination charges. They’re asking the gaming studio to agree to four demands, including ending mandatory arbitration in all employment contracts. “Until these demands are met, we won’t stop fighting,” a walkout representative tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFMYuh"&gt;The move comes after the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;sued Activision Blizzard on July 20th&lt;/a&gt;, alleging the company had a pervasive “frat boy” culture where female employees were constantly harassed, discriminated against, and underpaid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4YQtd"&gt;The lawsuit alleged a male employee nicknamed his BlizzCon 2013 hotel room the “Cosby Suite.” &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762"&gt;A Kotaku investigation&lt;/a&gt; later found that multiple other employees were aware of the name. “We’re really glad to see these stories are being told and appreciate the journalists who are telling these stories,” a walkout representative tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We stand by the victims and are appalled by what we read. This only makes us more committed to our task.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQsHe1"&gt;At the protest, employees stood shoulder to shoulder across two city blocks, holding signs that read “send the frat boys back to school” and “women in the video game industry deserve a safe place to work.” The energy was hopeful, almost light, despite the 80-degree heat. There were no protest chants, just chatter among colleagues. Around the corner, organizers had erected a tent for protestors, complete with water and snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JgdkAnfCEO86oQ3u6CMLSkMCipM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746633/zschiffer_210728_4684_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photography by Zoe Schiffer / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cqZvbv"&gt;Employees say the lawsuit was a watershed moment for the company, which previously isolated victims of sexual harassment. “There was validation, and there was education,” a walkout representative says. “It was a way for people to realize that if they experienced something like this they were not an isolated case. And there was an opportunity for folks who maybe did partake in this but did not realize that it’s toxic behavior to learn that it’s toxic behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpDiR5"&gt;Journalists were instructed not to speak directly with protestors, for fear footage of the conversations would out sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlUqFc"&gt;These anxieties aren’t entirely unfounded. During its two-year investigation, DFEH found numerous instances of retaliation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zgzxv5"&gt;Activision Blizzard initially denied the allegations, with chief compliance officer Frances Townsend saying, “we cannot let egregious actions of others, and a truly meritless lawsuit, damage our culture of respect and equal opportunity for all employees,” &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/activision-blizzard-fallout-lawsuit-9306c0a1-b4f1-46d8-925d-90a6086d193f.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Townsend previously served as homeland security advisor to George W. Bush. She joined Activision Blizzard in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zglcMR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re taking something that has existed and permeated through the gaming industry for decades and beginning to build a movement”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DbNrYA"&gt;On Tuesday, CEO Bobby Kotick &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;wrote a public letter&lt;/a&gt; calling the initial response “tone deaf.” He noted the company was engaging WilmerHale, an outside law firm, to audit its “policies and procedures.” Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178609/pinterest-wilmer-hale-workplace-culture-report-gender-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;Pinterest hired WilmerHale&lt;/a&gt; to investigate its company culture after two prominent Black women who’d worked at the company went public with allegations of racism and discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0baQO"&gt;Activision Blizzard employees say the latest note from executives — while encouraging — does not go far enough. “Right now they aren’t listening to us,” a walkout representative says. “They’ve made that very clear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcI6Ad"&gt;In addition to taking forced arbitration out of employment contracts, employees want the company to overhaul its hiring and promotion processes, publish salary and promotion data, and hire an outside firm to audit the executive team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rjltn9RgQQpX7qUMoONcb6WU5mM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746635/zschiffer_210728_4684_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photography by Zoe Schiffer / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WeKwsq"&gt;They say that ending mandatory arbitration is particularly important so employees who’ve experienced harassment can come together to push for change. Doing so would “remove the feeling of isolation and allow for more solidarity with one another,” a walkout representative says. “In addition to that, it helps mitigate the risk of retaliation — that is huge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="NLvBbQ"&gt;Employees won’t say what actions they have planned next. When asked if staff plans to unionize, organizers simply said, “no comment.” Still, they made it clear the walkout is not the end. “We’re taking something that has existed and permeated through the gaming industry for decades and beginning to build a movement,” a spokesperson says. “So it’s important to remember where we came from with our demands, what the end goal is and not lose sight of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>White House says infrastructure deal includes $65 billion for broadband</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Participates In Campaign Event For Virginia Gubernatorial Candidate Terry McAuliffe" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g-aHvyOs3pl8XV_ocsn75SGspjc=/0x0:5088x3392/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69646655/1234138315.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OEeePl"&gt;On Wednesday, bipartisan Senate negotiators &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/28/fact-sheet-historic-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/"&gt;reached a deal&lt;/a&gt; on an infrastructure package after weeks of tense discussion. The package includes billions in new funding, including more money to connect every household to high-speed broadband, according to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDaqM2"&gt;The Senate’s infrastructure package is expected to be around $1.2 trillion over the next eight years with around $559 billion in new spending. The White House sent out a press release Wednesday outlining what’s included in the bill, focusing on “hard” infrastructure issues like roads, bridges, EV charging, public transit, and high-speed broadband. Specifically, the package includes a $65 billion “investment ensuring every American has access to reliable high-speed internet,” according to the White House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ldbnvC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Telecom companies that receive this funding will be required to offer “low-cost affordable” internet plans&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k8QTXk"&gt;Telecom companies that receive this funding will be required to offer “low-cost affordable” internet plans to consumers along with easy ways to “comparison shop” amongst providers. Still, the bill text remains unwritten and it’s unclear how the new investment in broadband will be delegated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gELow"&gt;The $65 billion figure is significantly lower than what President Joe Biden originally proposed last March. The administration’s initial goal was to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359496/biden-american-jobs-package-broadband-semiconductors-electric-vehicles"&gt;pass $100 billion in broadband spending&lt;/a&gt; and include language that would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397778/biden-infrastructure-broadband-digital-divide-municipal-networks-republicans"&gt;prioritize networks&lt;/a&gt; affiliated with local governments, nonprofits, and cooperatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEKEK2"&gt;The White House also announced Wednesday that the package would include language from the Digital Equity Act that would create a permanent program to subsidize the cost of broadband for low-income families along with a new program to help pay for devices like laptops and tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87Enq8"&gt;As the Senate moves to start voting on this package tonight, the agency in charge of broadband expansion, the Federal Communications Commission, is still without a permanent leader. Earlier this year, former FCC Chair Ajit Pai &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726572/ajit-pai-fcc-step-down-date-trump-telecom-net-neutrality"&gt;stepped down&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the agency deadlocked with two Republicans and two Democrats. Biden has yet to appoint a fifth commissioner or formally appoint a permanent chair.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google remembers Voice exists, adds new missed call and caller ID features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/73GmjMEHt8eQx-ovsoZSkiUmgHQ=/60x0:1707x1098/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69646522/Screen_Shot_2021_07_28_at_11.14.27_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sdrNRB"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/07/enhancements-to-google-voice.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it’s adding new caller ID, missed call, and SMS message features to Google Voice on Wednesday. The otherwise minor update is notable because Google Voice has fallen to the wayside while Google focused &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532559/google-workspace-chat-officially-available-consumer-gmail-spaces"&gt;on other messaging boondoggles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pD2xqC"&gt;From the missed calls or voicemail sections of the mobile Google Voice app, you can now learn why you might have missed a call (for example, Do Not Disturb was on), and receive directions on how to make sure that doesn’t happen again (turning Do Not Disturb off). Google is also making it easier to redial dropped calls and switch to your mobile network if your Wi-Fi connection was the reason your call failed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eVAqTYpNg6wfH3PMVityxc2_rWM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746295/ezgif.com_gif_maker__1_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Voice can tell you why you missed a call.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sUqQCE"&gt;If you use Google Voice on iOS to forward calls to your personal number, now you can have the app display your Google Voice number on caller ID rather than the original linked number. SMS messages can now be deleted in bulk on the web version of Google Voice as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3YYTT"&gt;Google’s various attempts to connect people outside of Gmail have long been somewhat confused — we’ve even made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22538240/google-chat-allo-hangouts-talk-messaging-mess-timeline"&gt;a timeline of the journey so far&lt;/a&gt; — but Voice, in particular, has felt forgotten in the wake of Google Fi offering a more traditional phone service. Voice received &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/14/17687862/google-voice-icon-dnd-ios-update"&gt;a redesign in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2020/08/dark-theme-now-available-for-google.html"&gt;a dark mode in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but as a business-oriented Workspace product, it hasn’t really received as many dramatic evolutions as Google’s wild stabs at text and video chats. For the committed Google Voice user not at risk of forgetting the service exists, that might be for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s the evidence a fired Blizzard developer’s ‘Cosby Suite’ existed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3G6kvN9mc6N1nNo-63vYWAJVtOI=/0x0:924x616/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69646496/cosby_suite.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K5qQmW"&gt;As employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596957/blizzard-pto-sexual-harassment-walkout"&gt;walk out of Activision Blizzard today&lt;/a&gt; over allegations of “constant sexual harassment” and workplace discrimination — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598128/activision-blizzard-employees-ceo-letter-response-key-concerns"&gt;how poorly they felt the company responded&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; has released &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; backing up allegations that a fired developer kept a hotel suite named after alleged rapist Bill Cosby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RbSPHK"&gt;In case you’re catching up, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;the state of California sued Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; for gender discrimination last week. The allegations include claims specifically naming Alex Afrasiabi, the former senior creative director of &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft. &lt;/em&gt;The suit says that on top of sexually harassing women, Afrasiabi had a hotel room during BlizzCon 2013 nicknamed the “Cosby Suite” — and it suggested that other employees knew about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cz219z"&gt;Neither &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;’s report nor the California lawsuit say anyone was sexually abused specifically in the Cosby Suite, but it’s increasingly clear the suite was a real thing. As you can see above, there’s a picture of alleged Blizzard developers literally holding up a framed photo of Bill Cosby. &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; says the suite was “a hot spot for informal networking at BlizzCon ... where people looking to make inroads at the company would go to meet and hang out with some of its top designers.” One source told &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; that the original intent wasn’t sexual — saying it was a reference to Cosby’s “iconic ugly sweaters” — but Cosby already faced multiple sexual assault accusations at the time and other sources apparently understood it as a reference to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08Vuyg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; says it has a Facebook album full of photos from the suite, comments of a sexual nature, screenshots of an alleged chat with several named Blizzard developers identifying themselves as the “BlizzCon Cosby Crew,” and sources attesting to the existence of a “boys club” there. One former Blizzard designer allegedly bragged in comments about “gathering the hot chixx for the Coz.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lBwlZG"&gt;It’s not clear how serious the “BlizzCon Cosby Crew’s” statements were intended to be, but Activision Blizzard confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; that it terminated Afrasiabi after it was made aware of the complaint’s allegations last month. That’s something the company hadn’t previously revealed publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Mo6SA"&gt;You can read &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762"&gt;the full report at &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Is Robinhood really democratizing finance?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mhXuuR9misRtxGy5wRzHBt7WozE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69646072/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ksr0Ml"&gt;Robinhood is scheduled to price its stock today before trading begins tomorrow, and yesterday, it disclosed a new investigation: the finance industry’s self-regulator is checking to see whether founders Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt should be registered with them. Currently, the co-founders aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kc6ncp"&gt;Is this a big deal? Maybe, I don’t know. I don’t work at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), an organization you may remember from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557419/robinhood-finra-fine-70-million"&gt;the historic fine&lt;/a&gt; it leveled against Robinhood — $70 million — for, among other things, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171584/robinhood-outage-week-us-stocks-third-market"&gt;the outages that took place in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;. (About $12 million went to the people who were harmed, and the rest went to FINRA because that’s Wall Street, baby.) I am somewhat less concerned with FINRA’s investigation than I am with how this was disclosed: in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000162828021014488/robinhoods-1a2.htm"&gt;an amended version of Robinhood’s prospectus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeKMnm"&gt;The prospectus is the regulatory filing investors are encouraged to read before they decide to put money into an IPO. It is very long. If you want to find the exact disclosures, I suggest CTRL+f (or CMD+f) for “on July 26, 2021.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zIeZrN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I am now under the impression that Robinhood expects its retail investors aren’t reading the prospectus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vzhwuf"&gt;As part of its go-public plan, Robinhood is offering an unprecedented amount of its IPO to retail investors &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the public trading starts tomorrow. Maybe &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ee755c02-dd09-4041-8b14-efad30a662a6"&gt;more than a third&lt;/a&gt; of its shares will go to users of its app, who — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574133/robinhood-meme-trades-dogecoin-ipo"&gt;as Robinhood has also told us in its prospectus&lt;/a&gt; — are often first-time investors (more than half of its customers!). I watched the roadshow for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22592076/robinhood-ipo-roadshow-tenev-questions"&gt;those investors on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, and I did not get the impression that the presentation was for sophisticated investors. This is partly because Tenev wasted time on a question about his favorite planet but also because some of the questions Robinhood chose to answer in the presentation &lt;em&gt;were in the prospectus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GREfpH"&gt;I am now under the impression that Robinhood expects its retail investors aren’t reading the prospectus. That’s why putting the FINRA thing in there has my eyebrows at my hairline. I know there are restrictions on what a company can say before it goes public, but &lt;a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/quiet-period"&gt;the Securities and Exchange Commission allows&lt;/a&gt; companies to communicate about “factual business information” during the quiet period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="td5Rm8"&gt;“I’m curious about why this is coming out now,” says Robert Le, a senior analyst at Pitchbook. “Why is it coming out on the eve of the IPO?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsOlm1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/04/investing/robinhood-ceo-vlad-tenev-finra/index.html"&gt;CNN first reported&lt;/a&gt; that Tenev, Robinhood’s CEO, and Bhatt, the company’s chief creative officer, weren’t registered with FINRA in February. FINRA has a rule about firms, called broker-dealers, that trade securities on behalf of their customers: their CEOs must be registered. But Tenev is the CEO of Robinhood Markets, the parent company, which is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;a broker-dealer. What &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;registered with FINRA is a subsidiary. In the February report, Robinhood told CNN that Tenev “does not directly manage the FINRA-registered leaders of the broker-dealer or clearing broker” and “declined to say who does.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tn3ysF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In the Robinhood democracy, everyone is equal — but some are more equal than others&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pzh0ky"&gt;Okay. It’s not clear to me that Tenev and Bhatt have &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; done anything wrong here. Our Bitcoin-addled boy, Jack Dorsey, isn’t listed among the registered, for instance — even though his company, Square, has an arm that allows investments, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/04/investing/robinhood-ceo-vlad-tenev-finra/index.html"&gt;according to CNN&lt;/a&gt;. In its initial report on Tenev and Bhatt, the registration concern was “a gray area,” Charles Whitehead, law professor at Cornell Law School, told CNN. “If they are the CEO of a shell company that does nothing more than manage the broker-dealer, that’s an issue,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9ZS1C"&gt;So Square isn’t primarily in the business of investments; payments are the bread and butter, really. With Robinhood, on the other hand, it kind of seems like investments are the entire point. Also, Tenev has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/investing/robinhood-gamestop-vlad-tenev/index.html"&gt;made comments on Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; (in an interview with Elon Musk!) about getting a call at 3AM because he needed to round up $3 billion to give to his clearinghouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYJFyL"&gt;I trust FINRA will sort this out. But however the investigation resolves, it doesn’t strengthen my confidence that Tenev and Bhatt’s big talk about democratizing finance is serious. In fact, it underlines something else in the S-1: the difference in voting rights between Class A stock (what IPO investors get) and Class B stock, which is what the founders get. Class B holders get 10x the voting rights of Class A owners. In the Robinhood democracy, everyone is equal, but — with apologies to George Orwell — &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Animal-Farm-George-Orwell/dp/0451526341?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some investors are more equal than others&lt;/a&gt;. Tenev and Bhatt didn’t discuss this in the roadshow, and I don’t think it was because the planet question was more important. &lt;/p&gt;
