    <title>Diablo II: Resurrected will let you import your 20-year-old savegames</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MVgjNxXuQ7Tc8erAmG6ex6Avtbk=/0x173:1280x1026/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913413/diablo_2_boxart.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LW1o0t"&gt;Blizzard wasn’t kidding &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/19/22289916/diablo-2-resurrected-blizzard-features-upgrades-updates"&gt;when it told &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the new remastered &lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt; would be faithful to the original. You’ll even be able to pick up where you left off with your 20-year-old savegames, &lt;a href="https://me.ign.com/en/pc/182380/interview/what-it-takes-to-remaster-a-cult-classic-like-diablo-ii"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN Middle East&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDkPOq"&gt;“Yes! Yes, keep those!” producer Matthew Cederquist told journalists, saying that the team called it “the best feature ever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsB8XE"&gt;As a lapsed player myself, the very idea is giving me chills — dangerous ones, ones that I imagine are akin to what Gollum felt in &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings &lt;/em&gt;when he decided to pull The One Ring off his brother’s throttled corpse. I thought I could &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1362905167515906048"&gt;safely leave this game behind&lt;/a&gt;, but no. It seems I may need to track down an old friend soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hWt3bj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Staying the hell away from this. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;True story: I had to give my fairly valuable account and discs to a friend sworn to never, ever return them, because I kept seeing unique items in my dreams&lt;a href="https://t.co/t7V7Oa26SH"&gt;https://t.co/t7V7Oa26SH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1362905167515906048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kHb5Hj"&gt;For the rest of the original game’s fanbase, though, this might be incredible news: players like me spent large amounts of time grinding &lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt;’s bosses and levels to dust searching for unique items, not to mention selling them online and trading them inside a game that wasn’t really designed for that sort of thing. (One particular rare item, the Stone of Jordan, was actually used as a makeshift form of currency.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yloqC"&gt;Now, all of that progress is theoretically yours instead of having to start from scratch, and it might even be portable, too: theoretically, the game’s cross-save abilities across PC and console mean you could even load up your OG save on a Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCRSO"&gt;Blizzard &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/19/22289916/diablo-2-resurrected-blizzard-features-upgrades-updates"&gt;told our sister site &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the remaster basically &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the original game, so it’s not too surprising that original saves still function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="gMbHoN"&gt;This isn’t a remake,” said Fergusson. “We’re not reverse-engineering it; we’re not rebuilding it and trying to make it look and sound like [&lt;em&gt;Diablo 2&lt;/em&gt;]. This &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Diablo 2&lt;/em&gt;]. [...] It’s right there, underneath the surface. The entire simulation, the engine for this game, that lifeblood of this game, is [&lt;em&gt;Diablo 2&lt;/em&gt;] right underneath. So there’s a toggle switch, a legacy toggle, that when you press the button, you’ll see behind the curtains, and there is &lt;em&gt;Diablo 2&lt;/em&gt; in 2D sprites running right there, and you can play the way that you played 20 years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5YXDpl"&gt;“[W]e kind of shoved it in and it worked!” the team told&lt;em&gt; IGN Middle East&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve has ended development on Artifact</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oDXmKHRVGVk71m9RO20BUbUT530=/0x0:990x660/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913397/artifact_dota_teaser.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Topdf4"&gt;Valve is &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/583950/view/3047218819080842820"&gt;ending development on &lt;em&gt;Artifact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, following over a year’s worth of work on rebooting the troubled virtual trading card game (TCG) based in the &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; universe. It originally launched in 2018, designed by famed &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt; creator Richard Garfield. Despite “good initial sales” during a time when Blizzard’s &lt;em&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/em&gt; was at peak popularity, Valve says its player count fell off “pretty dramatically.” At launch, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2018/11/28/18115031/artifact-review-dota-2-card-game"&gt;our sister site &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;said the game was “deep, but burdened by its marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWqYi4"&gt;Both versions of the game, &lt;em&gt;Artifact Classic&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Artifact Foundry&lt;/em&gt; (also known as &lt;em&gt;Artifact 2.0 beta&lt;/em&gt;), are now free to play. All cards and packs that were previously available for purchase can now be earned just by playing the game. The company says all card art that was in development has been released. Steam Marketplace’s integration for buying and selling cards&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has been removed from both versions of the game, but paid cards in &lt;em&gt;Artifact Classic&lt;/em&gt; can still be sold. Here are &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/583950/view/3047218819080850140"&gt;the final patch notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCfulT"&gt;Valve says both games will remain playable but not to count on any updates to gameplay. To that end, it says that &lt;em&gt;Artifact Foundry&lt;/em&gt; is technically “an unfinished project” that has core gameplay but is missing some polish and art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zewaE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artifact &lt;/em&gt;was one of Valve’s only new titles in the past half-decade, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22167726/half-life-alyx-valve-vr-game-of-the-year-2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Dota Underlords.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeep’s 2022 Wagoneer will have Amazon Fire TV built in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S89Jq5OzrO1fdtYqruZjUdErHYU=/110x0:1244x756/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913288/Screen_Shot_2021_03_04_at_1.30.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LvX6Xz"&gt;Amazon’s Fire TV entertainment platform is going to hit the road in Jeep’s 2022 Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs, which will be the first to feature built-in Fire TV support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1etrO"&gt;The upcoming Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer are set to be formally revealed on March 11th, but Jeep’s parent company, &lt;a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=22562&amp;amp;mid=1"&gt;Stellantis, has given a preview&lt;/a&gt; by announcing the new Amazon integration today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7GW26"&gt;Amazon’s software will be accessible from both the main display and rear seat screens. (Jeep says a &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-computer-screen-privacy-filters-work-1788615130"&gt;privacy filter&lt;/a&gt; will prevent the driver from watching Prime Video content while driving, although they’ll be able to watch when the cars are parked.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ljGflw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 2022 Jeep SUVs are getting Alexa&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fjyBSn"&gt;Fire TV for Auto is designed to work alongside Uconnect 5, with added support for Amazon’s Alexa Auto technology for things like smart home controls. There’s also a custom Fire TV remote with an integrated Alexa microphone and a Uconnect button to easily access things like in-car temperature controls or maps. Users will also be able to download compatible content for longer trips where they’re not able or willing to use data to stream their favorite shows and movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5jDZ0K"&gt;The addition of Fire TV is the latest in a trend of carmakers being increasingly on board with including software from major tech companies. This includes the expansion of Android Auto and Apple’s CarPlay to deeper integrations like the Polestar 2, which runs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537200/google-android-auto-volvo-polestar-2-hands-on-demo-io-2019"&gt;Android Automotive natively&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3acfZM"&gt;Fire TV for Auto will be available in fall 2021 in the US, Canada, and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hey now lets users create blogs and newsletters right from their emails</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/48w23Y1Jh_g1e41EIAagRl8zUgw=/103x0:1698x1063/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913285/step3_4bf2eee711da77caba47d89a17885308ba422ef94f020fe948c302f7e7ad43c2.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ugEaY4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch"&gt;Alternative email provider Hey&lt;/a&gt; is expanding its offering with a new blog and email newsletter service, called Hey World, which is being offered as a free addition to all personal Hey subscribers, the company announced today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxRO0X"&gt;Using Hey World is incredibly simple: Hey users just need to send an email to &lt;a href="mailto:world@hey.com"&gt;world@hey.com&lt;/a&gt;. The subject of that email then becomes the post’s headline, while the body text is the blog post itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nLvdng"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Hey is a wildly opinionated new email service from the makers of Basecamp","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WhmaKK"&gt;Once you’ve sent the first email, Hey will automatically create a blog for you, at “world.hey.com/yourusername,” which collects all of your posts and offers both an RSS feed and an email subscription box for followers to keep up with your latest missives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqoQM6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/hey-world-b02a6f2e"&gt;In a Hey World blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the feature, Hey co-founder Jason Fried explains that the feature was borne out of a desire for a place to share thoughts online in a longer-form context than a short Twitter post or tweetstorm, without the contentious public square of a place like Twitter. Fried also notes that the Hey World blogs are an experiment for now, and the company is going to “play for a while,” with the new feature. Additionally, as “a shoutout to simpler times,” Hey World pages feature “no javascript, no tracking, no junk.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WA5un4"&gt;Hey World likely won’t replace more premium newsletter services like Substack, which allow writers more robust tools and monetization tools; but for more casual writers looking for a place to share thoughts, it could be a good option. Plus, the simplicity of writing posts using the same UI and editor as Hey’s regular emails means there’s an incredibly low barrier to entry (assuming one is a Hey subscriber, at least).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppuQOT"&gt;Hey World blogs are available now for paying Hey subscribers with personal accounts; users on business accounts or with free trials aren’t eligible for the new feature. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple clarifies that iOS 14.5 won’t let you permanently choose a new default music service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EfwKUOnxyiybiW5YVbTtwQCpJT0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913130/akrales_190522_3444_0021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pceXmG"&gt;iOS 14.5 is in beta right now, and the first beta appeared to have a long-awaited feature: it seemed you would be able to set Spotify and other music services as the default for Siri requests. But Apple has clarified &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apple-clarifies-you-cant-actually-set-a-default-music-service-in-ios-14-5/"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the feature doesn’t actually work that way. Instead, selecting a music service for Siri requests is apparently intended to improve Siri’s smarts so that it can better know your audio-listening preferences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="penUze"&gt;In our testing of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272460/apple-ios-14-5-default-music-streaming-service-siri-spotify"&gt;the first iOS 14.5 beta&lt;/a&gt;, when you would ask Siri to play a song, it would show a list of music services to play a song from. After you made your choice, Siri song requests would then play from the service you selected without requiring you to pick again. But you’re not actually picking a default service, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnCp6L"&gt;“The feature is an attempt to help Siri to learn the listening apps you want to use for different types of audio content — not just music,” according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. “Perhaps you want to use Spotify to listen to music, but prefer to keep up with your podcasts in Apple Podcasts or some other third-party podcasts app. And you may want to listen to audiobooks in yet another app.” Apple’s assistant may even ask your preference again in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyDZHb"&gt;Apple also noted to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;that there’s no setting in iOS where you can set your music service default, unlike the options available for setting a default email service or browser. (We also observed this when we tested the feature with the first beta of iOS 14.5.) However, you can still ask that a song play from a specific service as part of your Siri request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PAXYrI"&gt;Apple still seems to be tweaking the feature, as it was &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/17/hands-on-with-ios-14-5-beta-2-changes-and-features-video/"&gt;dropped from the second beta&lt;/a&gt; before being reintroduced this week with the third. And because it is still in beta, there’s always the chance the feature could change ahead of the final release, though we’ve asked Apple if it can confirm that it will appear in the public version of iOS 14.5.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senators ask FTC to fight stalkers exploiting people search sites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Continuing Resolution" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hhtkIwzJojXpKsyoGI_3uQitLfw=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913088/908866726.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CfcPDF"&gt;Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) want the Federal Trade Commission to take steps to protect people who have experienced abuse and stalking from invasive people search sites, potentially including measures to help them remove their addresses from data brokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2aZzJE"&gt;“We write to express serious concerns about recent reports that data brokers are publicizing the location and contact information of victims of domestic violence, sexual violence, and stalking,” the senators wrote in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrisismills/status/1367521239049392136"&gt;the letter&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/541616-klobuchar-murkowski-urge-ftc-to-protect-domestic-abuse-victims-data"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt; reporter&lt;/a&gt; Chris Mills Rodrigo posted online. “We have serious concerns that third-party data brokers play a role in revealing [a] protected address and providing access to personal information that can lead to continued abuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NgOiom"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;here's the bipartisan letter in full &lt;a href="https://t.co/jDxs2xsjlZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jDxs2xsjlZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— chris mills rodrigo (@chrisismills) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrisismills/status/1367521239049392136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dcD8VU"&gt;The letter cites &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/personal-information/i-tried-to-get-my-name-off-peoplesearch-sites-it-was-nearly--a0741114794"&gt;a 2020 &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; story&lt;/a&gt; about the risks of data brokers like Intelius and Spokeo — which are promoted as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/21/14945884/people-search-sites-history-privacy-regulation"&gt;modern-day phone books&lt;/a&gt;, offering phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, and other information. These sites have takedown policies, but the sheer volume of services — as well as the way they automatically scrape personal data — can make it almost impossible to permanently keep phone numbers or addresses offline. That’s despite some state laws regulating data brokers or offering confidentiality programs to people threatened by stalkers or abusers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOKXAT"&gt;Murkowski and Klobuchar ask the FTC to outline how it could coordinate with other agencies to keep violent abuse perpetrators from accessing personal information, as well as its current measures to help educate victims about data broker services and help them in the event of a privacy breach. The letter also asks if the agency has plans to prevent brokers from “collecting, buying, or selling lists of vulnerable populations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5qiNg"&gt;The letter could be a precursor to more congressional action around abuse and privacy online.

    <title>YouTube will lift Trump’s suspension when ‘the risk of violence has decreased’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FzdKUy"&gt;YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki says the site will lift former President Donald Trump’s suspension when the risk of him inciting violence decreases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obbmQI"&gt;Trump was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251338/twitter-facebook-youtube-election-misinformation-ban-trump"&gt;temporarily suspended in January&lt;/a&gt; after encouraging supporters to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, just before a violent attack on the US Capitol. Unlike similar suspensions on Twitter and Facebook, however, his YouTube channel suspension was &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/19/youtube-extends-trump-suspension-for-another-week.html"&gt;described as temporary&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Nl-pl667U&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;In a new interview&lt;/a&gt; with the head of the Atlantic Council think tank, Wojcicki offered a more concrete description of how — although not precisely when — Trump could return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEPUhR"&gt;“The channel remains suspended due to the risk of incitement to violence,” Wojcicki said. “Given the warnings by the Capitol Police yesterday about a potential attack today, I think it’s pretty clear that that elevated violence risk still remains. However, I do want to confirm that we will lift the suspension of the channel. We will lift the suspension of the Donald Trump channel when we determine that the risk of violence has decreased. That’s per our policies, that’s how our three strikes system works. But when the channel is reinstated, it will be subject to the same policies that every other channel follows.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dgKHvt"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_0Nl-pl667U?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=1700&amp;amp;start=1700" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W0lmEE"&gt;Wojcicki noted that Trump could be given a second or third strike if he uploads more content that incites violence or violates YouTube’s election integrity policies; after three strikes with a 90-day period, a channel is removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XH2TOR"&gt;Trump was permanently suspended from Twitter and Facebook. However, it’s possible he will also return to Facebook in the future — since the semi-independent Facebook Oversight Board is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256821/facebook-trump-ban-oversight-board-public-feedback"&gt;reviewing his ban&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6ytBA"&gt;Meanwhile, federal investigators are still investigating the January attack on the Capitol, reportedly including &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/20/us/politics/justice-dept-roger-stone-capitol-riot.html"&gt;the potential role&lt;/a&gt; of Trump associate Roger Stone. Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/03/us/politics/capitol-riot-qanon-trump.html"&gt;police warned&lt;/a&gt; of a “possible” follow-up plot by right-wing militia members — possibly inspired by the QAnon conspiracy movement, which has circulated false claims that Trump will return to the White House on March 4th. Congress canceled the day’s session in response.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Porsche unveils a pair of ridiculously expensive electric bikes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3A0tKVFXcG0Hc3DD0jWmEBMCgSQ=/0x108:2560x1815/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68912976/Porsche_eBike_SPORT_CROSS_mood_outdoor_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tHBhu0"&gt;Porsche is the latest automaker to try its hand at making and selling electric bikes, and the result looks very interesting and very expensive. The Volkswagen-owned company announced that it would start selling a pair of full-suspension e-bikes this spring. The bikes were announced alongside the Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo, which was just unveiled today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwNiWZ"&gt;There are two models of Porsche e-bike, the Sport and the Cross. The Sport is a road bike intended for everyday use, with a full-suspension carbon fiber frame, integrated front and rear lights, Shimano mid-drive motor, and a price tag that would make Jeff Bezos blush. The Sport, which weighs a little less than 48 pounds, will set you back about $10,700, which is just an astonishing price for an e-bike. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8cHqeSp8896lBAx9FflLzPMHV4s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345773/Porsche_eBike_SPORT_mood_urban_scaled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4qySVU8s6JpVVz9-qvQLRGffTlo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345783/Porsche_eBike_SPORT_angle_view_front_scaled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IJPwzQ"&gt;But then again, carbon fiber frame bikes are traditionally more expensive than other bikes, and the Porsche badge on the head tube is worth a premium to a certain cross-section of bike rider. (I’m often reminded of how much money serious racing bike enthusiasts will spend, not just on the bike itself, but on all of the gear that goes with it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ucupwb"&gt;The Cross is more for off-roading adventures, Porsche says. It also sports a Shimano mid-drive, carbon fiber frame, and full suspension, in addition to Magura-MT Trail hydraulic disc brakes that are extra-large and “heat resistant.” It weighs 48.7 pounds and will retail for $8,549. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/khCASodcfMLH_L8vXH7c_QXUdBc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345784/Porsche_eBike_CROSS_mood_outdoor_scaled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ici2P03qv1W8kV8CIu3ADjyzN_s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345777/Porsche_eBike_CROSS_angle_view_front_scaled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hWWWrZ"&gt;The Shimano EP8 motor that is featured in both bikes is smaller than previous versions — Porsche describes it as “ultra-compact” — and provides up to 25 km/h of pedal-assisted support. (Seems slow, but that’s the legal top speed allowed under European Union regulations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVOs7T"&gt;Porsche is the latest company specializing in combustion engine vehicles to dip a toe into the world of electric two-wheelers. Aside from the price, there’s some reason to be skeptical. Often, when you hear about car companies releasing their own electric bikes, most of the time, it’s just a brand licensing deal. (Think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161230/jeep-ebike-electric-bike-quietkat-manufacturer-preorder-price-specs-date"&gt;Jeep’s e-bike&lt;/a&gt; or those &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/news030317-humbike/"&gt;Hummer bikes&lt;/a&gt; from last decade.) Other times, it’s a much-hyped project that ends up falling victim to larger corporate cost-cutting, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256722/gm-ariv-shuts-down-ebike-production-covid"&gt;General Motors’ Ariv e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7za3ip"&gt;But occasionally, something interesting emerges, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22179185/harley-davidson-serial-1-ebike-test-hands-on-specs-price"&gt;Harley-Davidson’s recently released Serial 1 e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;. Porsche’s bikes are sure to find an audience among the same people who love the 911 or Taycan, but it remains to be seen whether it will be a long-term business for the automaker. Both bikes will be available for purchase starting in spring 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I tried the Nuggs, and they tasted like memes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Some nuggets sitting in front of a Nuggs box, which has an image of a chicken being offered a nugget." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wSiBSLUs0sFVQBo3T_kYAgl-36A=/0x540:2393x2135/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68912189/NUGGS_box_nuggets.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Behold the Nuggs.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Simulate&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Every version of the chicken simulation&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Cfe7le"&gt;“Welcome to the simulation” read a card inside the package sent to me by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsimulate.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22308229%2Fsimulate-nuggs-fake-chicken-plant-based-memes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Simulate&lt;/a&gt;, the company responsible for the Nuggs brand of plant-based chicken nuggets. Inside the package, nestled among some dry ice, were what looked like several specimen bags. Each bag contained two Nuggs, from version 1.0 to version 2.0 with six versions in between. They were each carefully labeled: “Project: The Verge. Variant: V.1.6.” As I transferred the cargo to my freezer, I felt less like I was putting away some groceries and more like I was participating in a lab experiment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JVhd0"&gt;That’s the kind of energy Simulate is going for. Its branding is simultaneously silly and self-serious, and it’s deliberately steeped in internet culture. The &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/nuggs/"&gt;Nuggs Instagram&lt;/a&gt; is almost entirely memes, with product announcements interspersed sparingly. “The name Nuggs is funny to most people, so we kind of leaned on that,” says Ben Pasternak, the company’s founder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tkLFCN"&gt;Jokes aside, Simulate, founded in 2019, is part of an industry where the competition is only getting more serious. Meat alternatives have been around for decades — Morningstar Farms was founded in the mid-1970s — but the last few years have seen an explosion of similar products as companies have gotten better at mimicking meat. A combo platter of advanced food tech and concerns about the sustainability of factory farming has made more people than ever willing to give not-meats a try. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAnb1a"&gt;The giants are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22193672/beyond-meat-ceo-interview-ethan-brown-decoder-podcast"&gt;Beyond Meat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192336/impossible-foods-ceo-interview-vergecast-podcast-plant-based-meat"&gt;Impossible Foods&lt;/a&gt;, both of which make plant-based patties that are meant to be as indistinguishable from beef as possible, going so far as to make them “bleed.” In the chicken nugget space, &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/2020/2/4/21122370/kfc-beyond-chicken-nuggets-fake-meat"&gt;Beyond Meat paired up with KFC&lt;/a&gt; to offer plant-based nuggets at select locations of the chicken-based chain. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetforgrieve/2020/09/18/morningstar-farms-courts-kids-with-vegan-nuggets-shaped-like-mickey-mouse/?sh=17f3a43e5170"&gt;Morningstar Farms recently partnered with Disney&lt;/a&gt; to bring Mickey-shaped nuggets to the freezer aisle. Even Big Chicken companies like Tyson have &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/13/tyson-foods-unveils-plant-based-nuggets-in-move-into-meat-alternatives.html"&gt;plant-based offerings&lt;/a&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIvhbk"&gt;Which brings me back to Simulate, Pasternak, and my freezer full of experimental Nuggs. Pasternak sees Tyson as competition, but he’s more interested in putting his nuggets head-to-head with its chicken-based products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwivRx"&gt;Unlike other companies that keep most of their development behind closed doors, Pasternak says he wants to “operate from a place of truth,” showing everyone the changes Simulate’s recipe has gone through. When I was offered the chance to peek inside the lab (virtually) and try every single version of the company’s Nuggs, I figured why not. You know, for science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYiVoR"&gt;Each version of Nuggs comes with release notes, similar to software updates. “Nuggs 2.0 includes fixes and improvements,” says the Simulate site. “Enables a close to indistinguishable chicken flavor.” You can only buy the latest version (in this case, Nuggs 2.0), but &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsimulate.com%2Freleases%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22308229%2Fsimulate-nuggs-fake-chicken-plant-based-memes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the notes for each past version&lt;/a&gt; live on the site. Looking through the notes while eating each Nugg added some fun insights to my experience. Version 1.5, which “enable[d] decreased sodium content,” did indeed taste less salty than Version 1.4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L29cFj"&gt;Pasternak began his career building software, which explains why software updates show up in Simulate’s branding. He thinks of Simulate as a nutritional company with a software framework, where new iterations of the product are constantly being developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A skinned nugget sits on the side of a microscope while a nugget sliver is in the slide." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/34Z2XRFxMSu6qeT7jTsRREm3QFk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342542/Image_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Simulate&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Nugg ready for examination.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NKMumt"&gt;And there have been plenty of iterations. Doug Henderson and Bob Schultz, two of the five&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Simulate food engineers who spend their days poking and prodding simulated nuggets, say that for every version of Nuggs released, there were hundreds more&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;tested in the lab. They use devices that press, squeeze, and tear the Nuggs to measure and track tiny changes in their cohesiveness, chewiness, and springiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27uwEm"&gt;Between Versions 1.6 and 2.0, they put together a database of every plant-based meat product on the market so they could track and compare them to Nuggs. The constant testing and comparison led them to switch from pea protein — which Schultz says is an “immature technology” with several texture and flavor issues — to wheat and soy proteins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBvbpv"&gt;My own judgment of the Nuggs was much less rigorous. I have not eaten a nugget that originated from an actual chicken in about 14 years, and I therefore am less than qualified to say how close in taste and texture Nuggs and chicken nuggets are. I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; say that my face journeyed from a grimace at a strange aftertaste in Version 1.0 to a contented nod at the crunch of Version 2.0. I didn’t get to experience the Simulate &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsimulate.com%2Fsauce%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22308229%2Fsimulate-nuggs-fake-chicken-plant-based-memes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BBQ sauce&lt;/a&gt;, but I did divide my duos of Nuggs for a highly scientific taste test. For each version, I tried one Nugg plain; these were my control group. I added hot sauce to the other for an extremely research-driven reason. (I really like hot sauce.) The verdict: they are very good vehicles for hot sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rx6Bty"&gt;I’ve never been particularly interested in products that aim to perfectly re-create meat. The idea grosses me out, even though I appreciate the novelty. But Pasternak sees Nuggs as a product that should appeal to all people, vegans and meat lovers alike. (Though the current price of $35 for 32 ounces of Nuggs online, and $7 for 10.4 ounces in retail, might dissuade people in either camp.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The hands of two people, crossed at the wrists, holding nuggets that are almost touching. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-DcvwB3zDnKfeZB8JZqUBF_Ry3o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342576/NUGGS_2020_0495.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Simulate&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These nuggets are not here to proselytize.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rx05IP"&gt;Part of Simulate’s brand mission is to remain “non-preachy.” The people behind the company aren’t pushing a specific vegan or vegetarian agenda — “We wanted to not use any of the V words,” Pasternak tells me — they just want to make a good nugget. “We don’t want to tell anybody that this is a healthy food,” says Schultz, “we just want it to be the best chicken nugget experience you possibly can have.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1voH2N"&gt;That makes sense since plant-based doesn’t automatically equate healthy. “We didn’t evolve to eat ultra processed foods and these meat substitutes are ultra processed foods,” says Marion Nestle, a Nutrition and Food Studies professor at NYU. “People would be much better off eating real food.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gl66wB"&gt;Other experts take a softer stance: these aren’t health foods, but they are at least healthier than real nuggets — which, for the record, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/12/robert-c-baker-the-man-who-invented-chicken-nuggets.html"&gt;were also developed in a lab&lt;/a&gt;. Nuggs are processed, but they’re lower in cholesterol, a major contributor to heart disease. “If you’re taking that cholesterol out, and you can provide consumers with an alternative, then why not?” says Jillian Semaan, director of food and environment at Earth Day Network, an environmental activism nonprofit. As the Simulate site boasts, Nuggs “kill you slower.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UMFdzX"&gt;Simulated meats are also better for the planet, says Semaan. There’s no livestock involved when making meat from plants, meaning there’s &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22287498/meat-wildlife-biodiversity-species-plantbased"&gt;less land required&lt;/a&gt; and no &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#methane"&gt;greenhouse gas burps&lt;/a&gt;. “We need to take a closer look at how we’re using our resources,” she says. Whether it’s Nuggs or other plant-based foods, “it’s kind of a no-brainer when it comes to having a sustainable place for all of us to live on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="do6M3C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People are taking a closer look at what they’re eating”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vk26ps"&gt;Pasternak hopes that simulated meats will become more popular than their animal-based counterparts in the next few decades. Semaan isn’t sure the tide will turn so quickly, but she does see a shift happening. “I think people are taking a closer look at what they’re eating, how food is grown, and what foods that they can consume,” she says. “That’s going to be for the betterment of themselves and the planet.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFLb2Y"&gt;I could pretend otherwise, but I really wasn’t thinking much about the planet, or my own health, while I was munching on the different variations of Nuggs. My deepest thoughts were more along the lines of “This first version tastes like a shoe,” and “There’s a nice amount of seasoning in this breading.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="P2IsGg"&gt;Personally, when I’m staring down the shelves in the grocery store, taste and ease of preparation are further toward the front of my mind than a product’s environmental impact. Ultimately, even after going through the entire experiment, I still don’t know if Nuggs taste like chicken or if they will be the future of sustainable food. But I did find that they were enjoyable enough to eat when a hankering for nuggets strikes — along with some hot sauce, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iP5U9i"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction March 4th, 3:45PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this story implied there are only two engineers who spend their days poking and prodding the Nuggs. There are five. We regret the error. This story has also been updated with the retail price for Nuggs. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New funding models can help riskier games — and might change studios in the process</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3txffwXdTcnJsFEJaIjHUrZ3OoU=/0x0:1653x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68912955/Screen_Shot_2021_03_04_at_12.50.03_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OUxlBB"&gt;Evva Karr was frustrated. During talks with creators, they’d begun to notice a theme: the conversation always seemed to turn to funding. Developers wanted to know how &lt;em&gt;HyperDot &lt;/em&gt;creator Charles McGregor and Karr, who helped publish it, had shipped the game. Inevitably, the developers would share their own experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGIOTg"&gt;“While some of those deals were good news, others were just kind of shocking and really unimaginable to me,” Karr says. “There were just a lot of folks who were getting bad deals, not knowing what good deals even look like.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ihotg"&gt;Karr, the founder and CEO of Glitch, wanted “a whole new damn table” — a way for developers to play with new ideas and make games that might be unappealing to traditional publishers. Earlier this year, they created &lt;a href="https://heyglitch.com/moonrise"&gt;Moonrise&lt;/a&gt;, a fund that promises to help a handful of candidates annually. It’s a collective of backers that range from directors at AAA devs to leaders at successful independent studios — a simple theory that throwing support behind people over projects that Karr has big aspirations for. “I think that Moonrise fund is going to change the way that we think about making games, funding games,” they say. There’s untapped potential for change not just in what developers will make, but how they choose to make it — and what studios arise as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wYikCw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s an underserved market and money to be made”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1myOn"&gt;It’s not just funding for games; it’s funding for games that might otherwise be left out. Karr says the goal is to create a model for early prototype funding. “We wanted to design a different way to think about financing that gives creators options to raise those funds, work with publishers, or even team up with platforms that really isn’t focused on drawing money out at just the absolute wrong time,” Karr says. “We all recognize that there’s an underserved market and money to be made. Our approach is different because we only want to get paid when the creators are also getting paid — ideally, a very handsome amount when the time is right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EggcMR"&gt;Funding options for video games have evolved over the years. From the traditional model of pitching to big publishers to the rise of crowdfunded efforts on platforms like Kickstarter, money comes in many forms. Indie publishers like Devolver Digital and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540676/annapurna-games-indie-publisher-development-studio"&gt;Annapurna&lt;/a&gt; offer a more boutique experience for a handful of titles. Groups like Indie Fund finance projects — though as outlets like &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/feb/15/video-game-funding-indie-investment"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; note, “investors of Indie Fund perceive to be safe bets is a matter of perspective – and in a mostly white, cisgender male group, that perspective is arguably limited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9bZYq"&gt;It’s a perspective that Karr echoes: “Our current funding sources are just quite risk-averse. Especially when we’re looking at studios that are founded by women or BIPOC or queer creators who are thinking bigger or differently about play, especially in new markets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tI53TP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a big difference between a cool project and a cool project idea”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PRKV2s"&gt;Funding doesn’t just apply to money either, argues Karr. It comes down to the time and privilege someone has to even make games. “It’s either unpaid time, or borrowed time in a way,” says Karr. “Or it’s through savings, where someone has taken money to buy back their time in order to be able to create something.” Karr reflects on their own time during weekends and nights, spent drafting grants to secure funds. It also impacted the types of projects they worked on, restricting creativity in the name of making something that had a better chance of scoring necessary cash. “Early stage equity and financing in this way offers a way for people to buy their time back in order to be able to focus on the things they really want to do — and the games that they really want to make and put out into the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcB9Ds"&gt;Karr is less concerned with what teams want to make, as long as they can make it. “I don’t want them to have to ask for permission,” they say. Their interest is in people with a strong creative and technical background who brings a unique perspective on play. “I think there’s a big difference between a cool project and a cool project idea, or even a cool game idea vs. a mediocre game idea that a really great team can iterate and build off of to make into an even better game,” Karr says. “It’s just a different process. I don’t think they’re exclusive to one another.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dautS9"&gt;What makes a project appealing for something like Moonrise is also what could classify it as a risk for traditional publishers. “Seeing something at the earliest stages is often scary … it can be scary to think about funding towards it,” Karr says. Think barebones, a project distilled down to its most base ideas of play: no art, no form, just something to toy with — a paper prototype, a couple of on-screen cubes that move around a screen. “To the average person who plays, the games would be unrecognizable,” Karr says. “It just really hones in on interaction and discovering, or at least uncovering, the moments of fun and what makes something fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCsA1O"&gt;Much like the developers it benefits, Karr says Moonrise allows them to experiment. Funders can be a little risky about what they invest — a benefit that can help give new voices a way onto the field. “It’s really a system that has been created out of a desire for equity in a different sense,” Karr says. “It’s built out of trust and a shared love for play in this industry.” &lt;/p&gt;
