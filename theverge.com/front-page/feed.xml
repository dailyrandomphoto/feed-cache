    <title>Pokémon Legends: Arceus is an open-world RPG coming to the Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7k0dbcW4xCFMlRAmZ7UNIJ_1F4I=/108x0:1257x766/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68879860/0ULfxggHuL.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kk6snD"&gt;At a special live-streamed event today, The Pokémon Company revealed something fans having been waiting a long time for: an open-world &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; adventure. The next major entry in the franchise will be called &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt;, and it looks to be a huge evolution of the long-running RPG formula. The developers describe it as a “pre-make,” which offers “a new challenge and a new frontier for the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ysI3SG"&gt;The story takes place in the Sinnoh region, at a period that appears to be long before other &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; games, and will include a number of iconic monsters like Piplup, with your choice of starters including Rowlet, Oshawott, and Cyndaquil. It’s expected to launch worldwide on the Switch in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ov1hbH"&gt;At the same event, the company also revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302858/pokemon-diamond-pearl-remake-nintendo-switch"&gt;upcoming remakes of classics &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pearl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which will also be coming to the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KNUFtH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;First came Sinnoh remakes. Then came Sinnoh pre-makes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introducing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonLegendsArceus?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PokemonLegendsArceus&lt;/a&gt;, a new challenge and a new frontier for the Pokémon world. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Kgm8Y1UPjm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Kgm8Y1UPjm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Pokémon (@Pokemon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/1365321297190940673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LSo5S0"&gt;The last major &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; release was &lt;em&gt;Sword&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shield&lt;/em&gt; on the Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962722/pokemon-sword-shield-review-nintendo-switch-launch-date"&gt;which debuted in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and was followed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304196/pokemon-sword-and-shield-isle-of-armor-expansion-review"&gt;several expansions&lt;/a&gt;. Those games also introduced an open-world-like region called the Wild Area, hinting at this next evolution. Also on the way is a &lt;em&gt;League of Legends-&lt;/em&gt;style multiplayer game, called &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286163/pokemon-unite-moba-nintendo-beta-test-canada"&gt;going into open beta in March&lt;/a&gt; (in Canada, at least), as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230643/pokemon-snap-nintendo-switch-release-date"&gt;a new version of the beloved &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTdEcB"&gt;Today’s announcement comes as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297819/pokemon-25th-anniversary-nintendo-game-boy-pikachu"&gt;a 25th anniversary celebration for the franchise&lt;/a&gt;. Outside of new games, The Pokémon Company is also hosting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278179/post-malone-pokemon-concert-25th-anniversary"&gt;a virtual concert on February 27th&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/2/25/22300982/post-malone-pokemon-25th-anniversary-hootie-blowfish-cover"&gt;headlined by Post Malone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Diamond and Pearl are getting remakes for Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nUoxJ5a5JrkLrEIGmosyqsDv9bY=/341x0:2213x1248/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68879844/Screen_Shot_2021_02_26_at_10.21.49_AM.5.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F18cCr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Diamond &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Pearl &lt;/em&gt;will be remade for Nintendo Switch. The Pokémon Company announced the news today during a special Pokémon Presents broadcast. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Brilliant Diamond &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Shining Pearl &lt;/em&gt;will launch in late 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjXf7M"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diamond &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Pearl &lt;/em&gt;launched in 2006 for Nintendo DS. The game introduced the Sinnoh region, home to pokémon such as Bidoof, Luxio, Drifloon, and Arceus. The updated versions have a cute, chibified look, though both are “faithful remakes” of the originals. A trailer released alongside the news today teases familiar locations and faces in the Switch version.  &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Home&lt;/em&gt; developer Ilca is working on both games alongside Game Freak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YbUYq9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BjCwUk06ZSk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9JIuKa"&gt;There’ve been rumors of &lt;em&gt;Diamond &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Pearl &lt;/em&gt;remakes online for the past few weeks. This year marks the games’ 15th anniversary, alongside &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;’s overall &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297819/pokemon-25th-anniversary-nintendo-game-boy-pikachu"&gt;25th anniversary&lt;/a&gt;. The company has been celebrating with virtual concerts featuring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228760/pokemon-25th-anniversary-katy-perry"&gt;Katy Perry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/2/25/22300982/post-malone-pokemon-25th-anniversary-hootie-blowfish-cover"&gt;Post Malone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXRUy6"&gt;The Pokémon Company also announced an open-world RPG, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302841/pokemon-legends-arceus-open-world-rpg-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for Switch today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Final Fantasy VII Remake with a free PS5 upgrade is $30</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4CZRQVGSVURVn6DvF_CCFfb0eWY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68879630/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REMAKE_E3_2019_screenshot_6.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jpxq5C"&gt;Yesterday, Square Enix announced that it plans to release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;an enhanced version of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; for PS5&lt;/a&gt;, and there is a free next-gen upgrade available if you own the game digitally or physically. You can purchase a physical copy of the game &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZS80PC2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;right now for $30 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Note that if you plan to take advantage of this deal, you will need to own a PS5 with a disc drive to claim your free PS5 copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p85hOB"&gt;Although the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302776/finalfantasy-7-remake-free-playstation-plus-march-2021"&gt;will be free on PlayStation Plus beginning March 2nd&lt;/a&gt;, Sony confirmed that the PS Plus version &lt;strong&gt;will not be eligible&lt;/strong&gt; to receive a free upgrade. So, you’ll either need to buy the next-gen version, which &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-CUSA07211_00-FFVIIREMAKE00000"&gt;starts at $70&lt;/a&gt;, or buy the PS4 version, the latter of which I think is the better deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FqnB95"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546364"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="utCSDe"&gt;While on the topic of next-gen, if you are in the market for a new TV that takes advantage of next-gen, LG’s CX OLED line is one of the best options at the moment. Right now, the 65-inch model is on sale at a couple of places, most notably Newegg, where you can &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Flg-oled-cx-65%2Fp%2F16C-000P-004G1%3FDescription%3Dlg%2520cx%26cm_re%3Dlg_cx-_-16C-000P-004G1-_-Product%26quicklink%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy it for $1,997 and also receive a free $200 Newegg gift card&lt;/a&gt;. The TV is also on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0817H41YN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $1,950&lt;/a&gt; (when you apply a coupon), but it does not come with a $200 gift card.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Mj3iDj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9534696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kBOkeV"&gt;Last November, AMD released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506447/amd-zen-3-ryzen-5000-processors-gaming-cpu-price-release-date"&gt;new line of desktop CPUs&lt;/a&gt;. The Ryzen 5000 line includes the first chips from the company that carry its next-gen Zen 3 architecture. Like most highly anticipated gadgets released at the tail end of 2020, these processors at first were a bit difficult to find. But, if you are looking to buy the midrange $449 Ryzen 7 5800X, it’s available now at &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/AMD/Computers/Electronic_Components/Microprocessors/1411790"&gt;Antonline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1598376-REG%2Famd_100_100000063wof_ryzen_7_5800x_3_8.html%2FSID%2F00fa3612783911ebaccaee7b3f3e8d1f0INT#donotlink"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733394688089718680" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h44wiH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10363165"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="49lvgp"&gt;Lastly, Amazon is currently running a promotion where you can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fpromotion%2FABW7BWU3Q6D6Y&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F2%2F26%2F22302827%2Ffinal-fantasy-vii-remake-ps5-upgrade-lg-cx-4k-tv-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $40 when you purchase two eligible Surface accessories&lt;/a&gt;. Some items eligible for the promotion include the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074GYX6VR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Pen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071DTNNL7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Arc mouse&lt;/a&gt;, a nice pairing if you’re picking up a new Surface device at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC authorizes $50 discounts for low-income households’ internet bills</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KCFxylpy-QyTrXtZhcZyuedGuzM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68879514/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H0iuzF"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330663/DOC_370324A1.docx"&gt;voted unanimously on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; to adopt a program that provides emergency discounts of up to $50 per month toward broadband internet service for low-income households. The Emergency Broadband Benefit Program also provides up to $75 per month for households on Native American land and a one-time discount of up to $100 on a tablet or computer for those who qualify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFKkfn"&gt;The $3.2 billion for the program was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22193133/us-coronavirus-covid-relief-stimulus-package-broadband-huawei-zte"&gt;approved by Congress in December&lt;/a&gt; as part of a $900 billion coronavirus relief package. The subsidies are available to households that already participate in an internet provider’s low-income or pandemic relief program, subscribers to its Lifeline program, households with children receiving free or reduced-price meals at school, Pell Grant recipients, people on Medicaid or receiving SNAP benefits, and others who have lost their jobs over the past year, the commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjbr7b"&gt;The FCC still has to set up a program to approve applicants for the program and to bring internet service providers on board, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/technology/fcc-broadband-low-income-subsidy.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABZxRp"&gt;The lack of consistent internet service across the US has been in the spotlight during the pandemic, as students in low-income areas struggled to participate in virtual classes. The FCC said last year that &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-20-50A1.pdf"&gt;at least 18 million people&lt;/a&gt; in the US still don’t have reliable home internet connections, but the number is widely believed to be much higher; the FCC considers a ZIP code to have broadband if only one home in a census block actually has internet service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0Vi24"&gt;“This is a program that will help those at risk of digital disconnection,” FCC acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement Thursday. “It will help those sitting in cars in parking lots just to catch a Wi-Fi signal to go online for work. It will help those lingering outside the library with a laptop just to get a wireless signal for remote learning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKzwjm"&gt;Rosenworcel said the program will be available within 60 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sETPoR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Citizen will now tell you why helicopters are flying overhead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dg0Ls92cl9wDGbVm9I8ons2kZME=/341x0:4391x2700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68879285/Helicopter_Media_Asset.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Citizen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="drPv0m"&gt;Citizen, the app that turns everyone into a crime reporter, now wants to track helicopters. The company announced today that it’s introducing helicopter tracking to the app, which will explain to users why there are flying vehicles overhead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRQDYd"&gt;The team tells The Verge it employs a 24/7 group to review 911 communications, and now they’ll review data about police helicopters, too. Like any other info on Citizen, users can add their own videos and comments about the incident while Citizen verifies it on its end. When possible, the team will include a “related incident” for a helicopter spotting that’ll better explain the situation. That way, if the helicopter pertains to a missing person report, for example, that report will be linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CT9Ckb"&gt;The helicopter tool is the latest in Citizen’s arsenal in its attempt to become the place where people get all their local crime info. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it introduced an in-app contact tracing tool, and the company says it’s seen over 7 million signups since its launch in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0I3el"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best noise-canceling headphones to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of Sony’s 1000XM4 noise-canceling headphones on someone’s head." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VzENdS38TVENxg-3frszRkv9t0M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67126629/IMG_0625-1.0.7.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Get some peace and quiet with the best noise-canceling headphones for a variety of uses&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lvXWQl"&gt;Forget about taking them on a plane: noise-canceling headphones have done a better job proving their worth now — during all these months many of us have spent working at home — than ever before. They’re an essential piece of kit for finding some peace and quiet when you’re in a shared living space. And when you venture outside, they’ve only gotten more impressive at hushing those distractions, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLU1nQ"&gt;No matter how you’re using them, the criteria for picking the best noise-canceling headphones haven’t changed: the most important measures are comfort, how well they can eliminate outside noise, sound quality, battery life, and whether they support multipoint pairing so you can connect to two audio sources at once. The right headphones for you will differ based on which of those things you prioritize, but our overall pick for the best noise-canceling headphones is&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They offer a good mix of sound quality, everyday durability, and great noise cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XtIOrp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4dlNC4"&gt;But if you’re looking for something a bit different, there are still plenty of options. If you’re an iPhone owner and will only settle for the best, the AirPods Max live up to their price. But Sennheiser and Shure also sell some tremendous ANC headphones if sound quality is your main focus. Trying to find the best headphones for Zoom life? Microsoft and Bose both have strong contenders. And if you’re after something a little more stylish, Marshall’s headphones just might surprise you. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="e21VnC"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for most people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="49SoTG"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 might look identical to the previous 1000XM3s, but the company has made slight design tweaks for added comfort on those days when you find yourself wearing the M4s for hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjKN0Y"&gt;Noise cancellation has been further improved from the performance of the M3s, putting Sony neck and neck with Bose in overall effectiveness of silencing your surroundings. Sound quality is basically identical to the previous headphones — it’s still punchy, full, and very enjoyable — as is the marathon 30-hour battery life. But Sony addressed two of the biggest issues with the M3s this time around: the 1000XM4s have improved voice microphone performance, and they can now connect to two devices simultaneously, so you can stay clued into what’s happening on your phone when you’re working away on your laptop or tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iloOp"&gt;Sony also has a really unique trick for convenience: the optional “speak to chat” function will automatically pause your music and pipe in ambient audio when the headphones detect you’ve started talking, which is handy when you’re grabbing a coffee. And unlike their predecessors, the 1000XM4s can tell when they’ve been removed from your ears for auto-pause. They still cost the same hefty $350, but you’re getting more for your money with the 1000XM4s than before. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max don’t come cheap, but they’re the best noise-canceling headphones for sound quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TSER3c"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;2. Apple AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="b7jGRn"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for sound quality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="AXEBd8"&gt;There was definitely some sticker shock when Apple introduced a $549 set of noise-canceling headphones. The AirPods Max cost significantly more money than any of our other recommendations. But Apple’s build quality is on another level: these trade the plastic you’ll find in many noise-canceling headphones for steel and aluminum, and the ear cups are a breathable mesh fabric. They’re hefty headphones, there’s no denying that. But aside from Apple refusing to include a headphone cable in the box, there’s nothing about the AirPods Max that feels cheap. And I appreciate the simplicity of using the digital crown for controls instead of relying on hit-or-miss gestures like taps and swipes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KK007J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2d4O3y"&gt;The most important part is that the AirPods Max deliver the best audio quality you can get from high-end Bluetooth headphones. They have an immersive, wide soundstage, fantastic dynamics, and you’ll find yourself hopping around your music library just to hear what they bring out in your favorite songs. Apple’s noise cancellation is right up there with Sony and Bose, and no one does transparency mode better; at times, it can make you think you’re not wearing headphones at all. Extra features like Spatial Audio (surround sound for movies and TV shows) and automatic switching between Apple gadgets help make it a bit easier to swallow that daunting price.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVlWWZ"&gt;But the AirPods Max do have faults. The carrying case is abysmal, battery life is only average for the category, and just like regular AirPods, they’re designed with Apple’s ecosystem in mind. It gets much harder to justify dropping $550 on them if you live outside the iPhone and Mac universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="yj00sX"&gt;The best sounding noise-canceling headphones if you’re not an Apple user&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rqLSMi"&gt;If you prioritize enjoying your music over drowning out the world, then both Sennheiser and Shure have fantastic options with superb sound quality and adequate noise cancellation. Sennheiser’s Momentum Wireless have detailed, bass-rich, and vibrant sound combined with sublime comfort. The same can be said for the newer Shure Aonic 50 headphones, which support advanced codecs like apt-X HD and LDAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hSuEdn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SGZqkd"&gt;If you’re a stickler for audio quality, both headphones can be used wired with either a 3.5mm headphone jack or over USB-C. They each outdo Bose and other more mainstream picks in terms of build quality and materials. That premium feel does demand a bit more, with both of these selling for the same $400 price tag. Their noise-canceling isn’t on par with the best, but you still get convenient software features like ambient passthrough and customizable EQ on top of the brilliant sound.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Headphones 2 have intuitive dial controls and are a joy to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="i7fV4Q"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for multitasking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="GtniNJ"&gt;With the Surface Headphones 2, Microsoft retained the brilliant turning-dial control scheme of the first-generation pair and made noticeable improvements to sound quality and battery life. After you’ve gotten used to adjusting volume or noise cancellation levels simply by twisting the dial around each ear cup, you’ll never want to go back to hunting for button nubs again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dI25d6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361699"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PsR02w"&gt;The Surface Headphones 2 are also an excellent pick for productivity, as their multipoint pairing works seamlessly when a call comes in on your phone while you’re at work on your PC. Something about the way Microsoft handles simultaneous Bluetooth connections seems more reliable and consistent than what everyone else is doing. It’s rare that I encounter any bugs when connected to two devices at once. It’s hard to oversell this benefit during work-at-home life, and you get the convenience for much less cash than the Sony or Bose headphones. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose’s Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are excellent for all your Zoom and voice call needs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0FRbZM"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OJVxE6"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for voice calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="tdSxzI"&gt;Bose is the brand synonymous with noise-canceling headphones, and the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are another example of why that reputation is well-earned. They have satisfactory sound, excellent voice call quality, and great noise cancellation effectiveness. It’s really a flip of the coin between these and Sony’s 1000XM3 headphones in the eyes of many. Sony ekes out superior battery life and more lively, impactful sound, but Bose’s support for multipoint pairing with two devices at once is a big plus. The Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are comfortable to wear for long stretches of time, even if they aren’t as feather-light as the company’s less expensive QC35 II headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2PK7eH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9TYQUm"&gt;When it comes time to join a Zoom meeting or call someone, you’ll be heard loud and clear by whoever’s on the other end, which can’t be said for all wireless headphones on this list. Bose’s microphone setup on the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 is second to none, though Jabra also fares well here. Battery life is where Bose trails its competitors, with the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 rated at up to 20 hours — short of the 30 hours you can reach with Sony or other picks below. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Solo Pro headphones have an on-ear design and work best with Apple devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VroSfn"&gt;The best on-ear noise-canceling headphones&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ldtIVc"&gt;The Beats Solo Pro headphones rest on your ears instead of completely covering them, which some people might prefer. A popular choice at the gym, the Solo Pros have sweat resistance and a strong clamping force on your head so that they’ll stay put during a workout or run. As with most modern Beats headphones and earbuds, the Solo Pros are tuned to drive your day with some oomph to the bass, though they’re more well-balanced than Beats of old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sQrctH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361735"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jadUXW"&gt;If you use an iPhone, the Solo Pros can take advantage of Apple ecosystem features like audio sharing and the same seamless setup / pairing process as AirPods. They’ll also be getting the new spatial audio feature coming in iOS 14, which will let you get a surround sound-like experience when watching movies on your iOS device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0phvUS"&gt;They’re not as great at noise cancellation as Bose or Sony, but the on-ear design and a snug fit help the Solo Pros offer good passive noise isolation even when NC is switched off. (You can hit up to 40 hours of battery life if you keep noise cancellation off.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="6JQ6AT"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mtvtN5"&gt;7. Marshall Monitor II ANC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DO2V4l"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for style&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="F7quUY"&gt;Marshall’s wireless headphones have proven surprisingly popular, and the company’s most expensive pair is also its best yet. The Monitor II ANC headphones are priced at $320, which puts them on the same playing field as Bose, Sony, and other tech companies that have been making premium noise-canceling cans for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ht7uR3"&gt;Marshall doesn’t quite match them in sound quality or NC effectiveness; the Monitor IIs have warm, textured sound and perform decently at cutting down on ambient noise. But they definitely stand out from the pack in looks, with a design that speaks to the company’s heritage. The headphones fold up for easy carrying, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/24/18018074/marshall-joystick-headphone-button-control-audio-bluetooth-wireless"&gt;Marshall’s signature gold joystick&lt;/a&gt; makes the Monitor IIs simple to control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f6QyVt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361724"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wFNLUi"&gt;They can also last up to 30 hours with NC enabled or up to a staggering 45 hours if you’re already someplace quiet and can do without the feature. That impressive longevity beats our primary picks. A lack of AAC codec support at this price stings, but I’ve enjoyed the Monitor IIs every time I’ve put them on. They’re more than just an amp brand stamped onto an average pair of headphones. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Monster Hunter Rise was made for the Switch, and it’s coming to PC, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jSwzjOtxkmWvGCzSdMJQ4-FYTMA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68879194/MHRise_Multiplayer_Tigrex_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KTXHM8"&gt;Capcom finds itself in an interesting position with &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt;, its new title for the Nintendo Switch. 2018’s &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter World&lt;/em&gt; was a huge triumph, bringing the series to a Western audience accustomed to home consoles and PCs and becoming one of the company’s bestselling games ever. But in doing so, it had to abandon some of the biggest factors behind &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt;’s Japanese success: portability and local multiplayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwc6Tg"&gt;Since Capcom started work on &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter World&lt;/em&gt;, though, the Switch has become a global hit, and on paper it sounds like it should be a perfect system for the series. It’s much more capable than the PSP and 3DS hardware that made &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; a social phenomenon in Japan, while offering the flexibility to let you play on your TV or on the go. That’s where &lt;em&gt;Rise &lt;/em&gt;comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ShULlt"&gt;“We think that by releasing this on a portable console we’ve made it a lot more accessible, a lot more easy to pick up and play,” producer Ryōzō Tsujimoto tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s also obviously easier to play with people in your immediate environment. So it’s very well suited for playing at home with your family, and you can pick it up and play whenever you want — you can do a couple of quick quests before going to sleep. So yeah, we think it might bring back some people [who didn’t play &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;] because of just how easy to access it is, how easy to pick up it is.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5iOIa480QmgNzdRRwG1Kx9odT0s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330479/MHRise_Multiplayer_Mizutsune_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KUlBdJ"&gt;But the Switch presents technical challenges for &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; compared to &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;, which used more powerful PS4 and Xbox One hardware as a development baseline. Earlier &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; games took place in small, numbered areas separated by loading screens, while &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt; had complex multilevel stages that you could seamlessly explore. &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; manages to split the difference — you wouldn’t mistake the environmental complexity for that of &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;, but the graphical fidelity is impressive for the Switch and there aren’t any loading times once you’re in a level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4l54rt"&gt;“In the very early stages of development, we were still kind of toying around the idea of keeping the same map system from the older games, with separate areas divided by loading screens,” says director Yasunori Ichinose. “But over the course of development, as we saw how &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt; was doing, we basically got the request to make all of the environments open like in &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;. So it wasn’t something that we planned from the start, but it’s something that we are definitely happy we did.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7eUEX"&gt;The stages also have a much greater degree of verticality compared to earlier games — Ichinose says that’s what the “Rise” in the title refers to — and the ability to zip around the environments with the new Wirebug or ride on the back of a canine Palamute companion offers further options for traversal. In fact, Ichinose says, that’s why Capcom decided to put the monsters’ locations on the map from the start of every quest, rather than force hunters to track them down from scratch — in &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt;, figuring out how to get to the monsters could be a challenge in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bmkjuh21KaIoA0T3jya1DdPb-UA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330480/MHRise_Multiplayer_Barioth_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xopD8W"&gt;Still, I wondered whether Capcom had weighed the risk of losing some of its fans who jumped on board with &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt; and might be expecting another technical leap forward. Could the move to Switch have an effect on &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt;’s popularity in the West? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhTnUA"&gt;“We’re not particularly worried about that,” Tsujimoto says. “I mean, every time that we make a &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; game, we make sure that it is a good, proper new &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; game. It’s not that we’re less invested in our portable entries or anything like that. It’s just that &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; is a game that just happens to be on a portable console, and so we’ve optimized it for that. But it doesn’t really change anything from a gameplay perspective — it’s still very much &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt;, so the fans will still enjoy it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="embHQ5"&gt;Besides, as Tsujimoto confirmed at the end of our interview, &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; is actually coming to PC as well, with Capcom targeting a release date sometime in early 2022. That should be a good option for anyone who’s reluctant to give up &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;’s smooth frame rates on modern hardware. If you’re planning to play on Switch, though, there’s just one month to go — &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; will be released worldwide on March 26th.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="hTd6Ck"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;, the modern retelling of the 1997 PlayStation classic, will &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/02/26/playstation-plus-games-for-march-final-fantasy-vii-remake-maquette-remnant-from-the-ashes-and-farpoint/#sf243430485"&gt;be free for PlayStation Plus subscribers beginning March 2nd&lt;/a&gt;. It is important to note the PS4 version of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; available for users with an active PS Plus subscription &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;be able to receive a PS5 digital version of the game, which was announced yesterday at Sony’s State of Play event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kr6KYr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; launched last April exclusively on PlayStation 4 and serves as the first of an unknown number of entries in an episodic retelling of the original game. The game is also backward compatible on PlayStation 5, but yesterday's State of Play confirmed that a next-gen version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;the game will release on June 10th&lt;/a&gt; and will take full advantage of Sony’s next-gen console, with faster loading times, different graphical mode options, and a new episode focusing on the character Yuffie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2FBM61"&gt;

    <title>LG Stylo 6 review: great stylus features, sketchy performance</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Its built-in stylus is useful and enjoyable, but the Stylo 6 is too slow to recommend&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="h4S2g0"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733319724591682516" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG Stylo 6&lt;/a&gt; is a sub-$300 phone with a built-in stylus, which puts it in exclusive company: the $299 Motorola Moto G Stylus is more or less its only direct competition. For its $270 price, the Stylo 6 offers good battery performance; a big, bright screen; and the handy pen-derived features that stylus life offers. But as much fun as I had doodling on its generously sized screen, it’s just too slow to recommend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hL5PdO"&gt;That’s a shame because I genuinely enjoyed aspects of using this phone. I couldn’t seem to drain the battery below the 30 percent mark even on a day of heavy usage, and I experienced real enjoyment texting my spouse a precisely drawn, animated doodle of a farting butt. Photos look good on its vivid, wide 6.8-inch screen, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover while rewatching &lt;em&gt;Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt; (don’t worry, I talk to my therapist about this) that it has stereo speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUhKMV"&gt;Unfortunately, that enjoyment was overshadowed every time the phone took an extra beat to switch between apps, open Twitter, load my Instagram feed, or start my Google Maps navigation. It’s not unusably slow, but it is quite noticeably slow. If you have the patience of a small insect like I do, there’s a fine line between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UqXxuN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10361691"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BDKppqf5SpMvj0nAigrnc53mNuo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320967/ajohnson_210222_4437__004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stylo offers a large 6.8-inch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QjkepT"&gt;LG Stylo 6 screen and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8Uz8fQ"&gt;The Stylo 6 is a large phone, as you’d expect a phone with a stylus to be. It offers a 6.8-inch 1080p LCD with a standard 60Hz refresh rate and modest bezels. Its dimensions are similar to the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, also a large phone, except that it’s slightly taller. The screen itself is plenty bright and vivid, and the aforementioned stereo speakers make watching videos that bit nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNK9sC"&gt;I found the phone overall too big to use comfortably one-handed, and it felt awkward in even large coat pockets. That’s beside the point, though, if you’re considering the Stylo then you probably already know you want a large phone, so to each their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZOWPT"&gt;The Stylo 6 offers a Mediatek Helio P35 chipset and 3GB of RAM. Herein lies the Stylo 6’s troubles: this processor and RAM combination just doesn’t offer enough power for this phone. I noticed stuttering often as I scrolled through media-rich screens on Twitter and Instagram. Ditto the previously mentioned slowness opening and switching between apps, and the camera suffers from laggy processing speeds, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="y6tvY0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not unusably slow, but it is quite noticeably slow&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ob9G3z"&gt;I sometimes tapped the screen, then wondered if the phone had recognized the tap a split second before it opened an app or whatever I was trying to do. Conversely, I’d tap the screen too lightly or quickly and wait an extra second before realizing it hadn’t registered, just because I’d gotten used to giving the phone a little extra time to do everything. This would all be more forgivable (if still frustrating) on a $200 phone, but depending where you get the Stylo 6, it’s pushing closer to $300 and should really do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2sAoc"&gt;If there’s a bright spot to the phone’s processing woes, it’s that battery life is great — possibly as a side effect. The Stylo 6 has a 4,000mAh battery, and after a typical day with two-plus hours of screen-on time, I was usually down to only 70 percent. I was sure a day of heavier use with Google Maps navigation, Spotify, and more social media scrolling than usual would challenge it, but nope. I didn’t even drain it enough for a low battery warning before plugging it in at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8IYJSw"&gt;There’s just one configuration offered with 64GB of built-in storage, which isn’t great, but it’s expandable by way of microSD. It ships with Android 10 and, unfortunately, a lot of preloaded apps and games that you probably don’t want. LG isn’t known for a generous upgrade schedule so it’s very unlikely the Stylo 6 will see an Android 11 update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vRcl5BKl_rXx6u_nliCoGGMhhlE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320964/ajohnson_210222_4437__001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Popping out the stylus brings up some shortcuts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aJgWhZ"&gt;LG Stylo 6 stylus features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rkox7W"&gt;Of course, the stylus features are a big (sorry) draw here. The stylus is tucked away and spring-loaded into the lower-right corner of the device, and it activates a set of shortcuts when it’s removed. You can take a quick note, grab a screenshot or a GIF of whatever’s on your screen, and mark it up with notes, or draw something immature to text to your partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XdqUY1ak7gao0vM5Lb1VW1i4_AY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328590/IMG_20210225_092209.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can do useful, productive things with a stylus, but you can do this, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NzV0Qp"&gt;Despite Samsung’s Galaxy Note being the de facto stylus phone, LG has been making phones with styluses for ages, and it shows with little UI touches like automatically toggling off gesture navigation when you start a note so that you don’t accidentally swipe out of it. You won’t find advanced features like the (much more expensive) Galaxy Note series offers here such as handwriting-to-text conversion or the ability to use the stylus as a remote control. Basically though, it does all of the things you’d expect it to do, and these features work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLVOBQ"&gt;I was surprised by how much I enjoyed having the stylus available. It’s much easier to draw or write silly notes on images with the pen rather than your finger, which I had basically given up on doing because they always look terrible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qJM5e"&gt;The ability to also jot down a quick note without even turning the screen on is something I really appreciated. I feel like I’m always fumbling to unlock my phone, find the notes app, and open a new note just to type out something quick like an email address or a song title. None of this is unique compared to a Galaxy Note, of course, but the Stylo 6 has a set of genuinely useful features that aren’t very common, especially at this price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vLKC-lmsKjADAsgqK63vIZ9GrSs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320968/ajohnson_210222_4437__005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stylo 6 features standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras, plus a depth sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="P1fCne"&gt;LG Stylo 6 camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="cjD45v"&gt;The Stylo includes a 13-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, a 5-megapixel depth sensor, and a 13-megapixel selfie camera. That’s not a lot of resolution to work with, but it’s enough to allow the Stylo to take decent-quality images in good light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjHUA9"&gt;White balance occasionally leans a little too magenta or too green, which sometimes gave an effect I liked — kind of a nostalgic film-like quality. At other times, images just looked too cool and washed out. I like how the Stylo handles high-contrast scenes; the HDR effect doesn’t look too strong. Your preview image will look overly dark, but an HDR icon on the screen indicates that the final image will look much more balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mwvw8"&gt;Images in low light or moderate indoor lighting look okay for social media but show a lot of smeared detail if you look closely. The ultrawide lens is somewhat limited by its low-res sensor. Even in bright daylight shots details look smoothed over, and it’s just not up to low light photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UfnwHC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10361491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5cDMaZ"&gt;The camera is also a victim of the phone’s underpowered processor, particularly in portrait mode. The live preview is quite laggy, which gets worse once you push the shutter and wait for the phone to process the image. This can take as long as six seconds, during which you’re unable to take another image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1iNah"&gt;It’s hard to know if you got the right frame of your subject, and it’s a frustrating experience trying to photograph a subject that’s moving even just a little bit because you can’t “spray and pray.” The camera keeps shutter speeds relatively low, too, so blurry subjects can be a problem. By sheer luck I got a portrait mode photo of my cat mid-yawn, but I wouldn’t count on being able to do that again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KfLINq"&gt;I captured a few images with the Stylo that I really like, but I felt like it was more in spite of the camera rather than because of it. The images this phone captures will look okay on Instagram and Facebook, but overall, the Stylo’s camera capabilities lag behind most other devices at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VhETtn7zE5XDblbQ0DDcTTKR-ME=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320965/ajohnson_210222_4437__002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stylo 6 offers a lot of likable stylus-based features, but it’s ultimately too slow to recommend.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="F0GltV"&gt;The Stylo 6 has a few good things going for it: an affordable price, built-in stylus, big screen, and great battery life. But factoring in its shortcomings, namely an underpowered processor, it’s not a device I can easily recommend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sgRTD8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even around its $270 price, there are many other more capable options&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="neYcAs"&gt;Even around its $270 price, there are many other more capable options. The $300 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; offers a better camera and processor. The 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Motorola Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt; includes a massive battery and better processor performance for $200. Neither of those comes with a stylus, of course, but I don’t think the Stylo 6 is even your best bet for an inexpensive phone with a stylus: for just a little more, the 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218732/motorola-moto-g-stylus-power-play-2021-one-5g-ace-specs-price-release-date-budget"&gt;Moto G Stylus&lt;/a&gt; offers better performance and an upgraded camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCkXdH"&gt;If speed isn’t a concern, a stylus is a must-have, and the price is right, I think you can live a reasonably happy life with this phone. Maybe my patience is just too thin, and a more enlightened person can coexist peacefully with it. The rest of us would do best to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Security researcher recommends against LastPass after detailing 7 trackers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sugEk3HY0X1rJt3O87VjM9W47E0=/0x0:1395x930/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68878964/msedge_qX48b5uD4r.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LastPass&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SjjrIA"&gt;A security researcher is recommending against LastPass password manager after detailing seven trackers found in the Android app, &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/25/lastpass_android_trackers_found/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Register &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Although there is no suggestion that the trackers, which were analyzed by researcher &lt;a href="https://www.kuketz-blog.de/lastpass-android-drittanbieter-ueberwachen-jeden-schritt/"&gt;Mike Kuketz&lt;/a&gt;, are transferring a user’s actual passwords or usernames, Kuketz says their presence is bad practice for a security-critical app handling such sensitive information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zh6AuU"&gt;Responding to the report, a spokesperson from LastPass says the company gathers limited data “about how LastPass is used” to help it “improve and optimize the product.” Importantly, LastPass tells &lt;em&gt;The Register &lt;/em&gt;that “no sensitive personally identifiable user data or vault activity could be passed through these trackers,” and users can opt out of the analytics in the Privacy section of the Advanced Settings menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zbrjW5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Users can opt out in the advanced settings menu&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iXLcXg"&gt;LastPass’s trackers include four from Google which handle analytics and crash reporting, as well as one from a company called Segment, which reportedly gathers data for marketing teams. Kuketz analyzed the data being transmitted and found it included information about the smartphone’s make and model, as well as information about whether a user has biometric security enabled. Even if the data transmitted isn’t personally identifiable, just integrating this third-party code in the first place introduces the potential for security vulnerabilities, according to Kuketz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wteBlt"&gt;“If you actually use LastPass, I recommend changing the password manager,” wrote Kuketz (via machine translation). “There are solutions that do not permanently send data to third parties and record user behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLor7b"&gt;LastPass isn’t the only password manager to include trackers like this, but it appears to have more than many popular competitors. Free alternative Bitwarden has just two &lt;a href="https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.x8bit.bitwarden/latest/"&gt;according to Exodus Privacy&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.siber.roboform/latest/"&gt;RoboForm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.dashlane/latest/"&gt;Dashlane&lt;/a&gt; have four, and &lt;a href="https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.agilebits.onepassword/latest/"&gt;1Password &lt;/a&gt;has none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vH2wIl"&gt;The report comes on the heels of LastPass’s announcement to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;severely limit functionality in its free tier&lt;/a&gt;. While free users are currently able to store an unlimited number of passwords across devices without limitation, soon they’ll have to pick one category of devices to view and manage their passwords on — “Mobile” or “Computer” — unless they want to pay for the service. The changes will come into effect on March 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOtWUQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
