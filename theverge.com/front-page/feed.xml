    <title>Apple says there are now over 1 billion active iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PzxQHS"&gt;Apple says there are now more than 1 billion active iPhones, an enormous milestone for the company that speaks to the phones’ continued success and longevity. There are now 1.65 billion Apple devices in active use overall, Tim Cook said during Apple’s earnings call this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laKAjl"&gt;The milestone had been approaching for a while. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/27/12302542/apple-billion-iphones-sold"&gt;sold its billionth iPhone&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, and in January 2019, Apple said that it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/29/18202736/apple-devices-ios-earnings-q1-2019"&gt;hit 900 million active iPhone users&lt;/a&gt;. An Apple spokesperson didn’t clarify how Apple is counting “active users” when asked by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. But the stat would suggest that a substantial number of the iPhones ever sold remain in active use, at least by Apple’s definition. &lt;a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-nears-two-billionth-iphone-sale-13-years-after-launch-1.1371339"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BNN Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported last year&lt;/a&gt; that analysts believed Apple would be approaching its 1.9 billionth iPhone sale by the end of 2020, though the company hasn’t announced if it’s passed that milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzIfJ6"&gt;Apple’s announcement came during an enormous quarter for the company, in which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252663/apple-q1-2021-earnings-iphone-12-mac-sales"&gt;set an all-time revenue record&lt;/a&gt;. iPhones did particularly well during the final quarter of 2020, with sales of $65 billion, another record (though one that was helped by delays pushing iPhone 12 sales fully into the holiday quarter). And the company saw more iPhone “upgraders” than ever before. Cook also said that a record-setting number of FaceTime calls were made on Christmas 2020 — a milestone that was certainly helped along by the pandemic keeping many families and friends apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECdPrQ"&gt;While sales are up and usage is at an all-time high, Apple has spent the last several years trying to diversify its product line as iPhone unit sales slow. Analysts have estimated a decline in &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1849696/apples-drop-in-iphone-sales-are-part-of-a-global-demand-shock/"&gt;overall phone shipments&lt;/a&gt; and sales in recent years, and &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-an-interesting-chart-iphone-unit-sales-have-been-declining-steadily-for-five-years/"&gt;Apple hasn’t been immune&lt;/a&gt; to the trend. But even if fewer iPhones are being put into people’s hands each year, people are evidently hanging on to them for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 bans unauthorized Keanu Reeves sex</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dbFcMSPFO0ngfVR6UJMHEQWNolA=/0x45:1570x1092/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730736/Screen_Shot_2021_01_27_at_4.46.27_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bt5HZL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; creator CD Projekt Red would kindly like modders to stop making Keanu Reeves into a sex object. Following a fan mod that allowed players to have sex with Reeves’ character, Johnny Silverhand, the developer told &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/cdpr-shuts-down-cyberpunk-mod-that-let-players-have-sex-with-keanu-reeves/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;user-generated content cannot be “harmful towards others” — especially when it comes to mods. “In the case of model swaps, especially those that involve explicit situations, it can be perceived as such by the people who lent us their appearance for the purpose of creating characters in &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077,&lt;/em&gt;” the developer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4MZP1"&gt;It’s worth noting that Reeves’ character does have an in-game sex scene, though it plays out from his perspective. As Johnny, the player has sex with a blonde woman who inexplicably dumps good liquor onto her white top to a backdrop of guitar riffs, while Johnny bounces her around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxxL28"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-26-people-are-modding-cyberpunk-2077-to-have-sex-with-keanu-reeves"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;first reported on the Nexus Mods files that swapped a sex worker “joytoy” character model for Reeves’ Johnny. In the mod, Johnny — who remains clothed — is now the sexualized character seen through the players’ eyes. It also uses the joytoy’s voice acting throughout the brief scene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QyOAGJ"&gt;It’s typical for players to personalize their experience through mods, and the&lt;em&gt; Cyberpunk &lt;/em&gt;community has been doing so since the game’s release. CD Projekt Red just released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252373/cyberpunk-2077-official-mod-support"&gt;official modding tools&lt;/a&gt;. However, the mod — which has since been &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/990?tab=description"&gt;hidden&lt;/a&gt; by the creator on Nexus Mods — crosses that boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AMUAjw"&gt;“For the characters we’ve invented for the game, we broadly permit you to tweak the game at will and just have fun,” CD Projekt Red told &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;. “When it comes to models of real people whom we’ve asked to participate in the game, we kindly ask you to refrain from using them in any situation that might be found offensive if you don’t have their explicit permission.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney pulls some movies from Disney Plus Kids profiles because they feature racist stereotypes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gMvvd8u65ArO_Qqmv14YwGuBvoA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730669/acastro_190411_1777_Disney_Streaming_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8n05bw"&gt;The history of cinema is littered with racist stereotypes. (Call it the long tail of minstrel shows.) As cultural preferences have evolved — which is to say it’s now not cool to be racist — so have our films. In practice, what that means is some stuff just doesn’t hold up, especially when you’re showing it to kids. According to Disney, that includes classics like &lt;em&gt;Peter Pan &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Dumbo. &lt;/em&gt;Disney Plus will now not show those two films and some others to &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/disney-plus/2021/1/27/22252244/disney-plus-removes-peter-pan-dumbo-racist-stereotypes-kids-profiles"&gt;profiles that indicate the viewer is seven years old or younger&lt;/a&gt;. Other blocked movies include &lt;em&gt;Aristocats&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lady and the Tramp&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Swiss Family Robinson&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Jungle Book.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgldbm"&gt;It’s a big move, though adult accounts will still be able to access the blocked films. If you do decide to stream those films, there is a warning: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LOY0lB"&gt;This program includes negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures. These stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now. Rather than remove this content, we want to acknowledge its harmful impact, learn from it and spark conversation to create a more inclusive future together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmDwd1"&gt;Disney is committed to creating stories with inspirational and aspirational themes that reflect the rich diversity of the human experience around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OcI1gt"&gt;It’s not unprecedented. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963014/disney-plus-racism-cultural-disclaimer-dumbo-song-of-the-south-warner-bros-tom-jerry"&gt;Disney added warning labels back in 2019 for different movies on Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; (though they weren’t as strongly worded). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ls1qCA"&gt;The times, as they say, are a-changing. And if you’re curious, you can read more about Disney’s diversity efforts &lt;a href="https://storiesmatter.thewaltdisneycompany.com/"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;, part of its Stories Matter initiative. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sling TV is raising prices and sweetening the deal with more free DVR space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sling TV stock 2040" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Itb9Bj5jWsT0SiawGhi6QqvDAJw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730556/theverge1_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6VDsHf"&gt;Sling TV, Dish’s live TV streaming service, &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sling-tv-expands-free-dvr-storage-updates-pricing-for-new-customers-301216392.html"&gt;announced that it’s raising the prices&lt;/a&gt; on its packages and add-ons for new customers starting today. Both the Orange and Blue channel packages from Sling will go up by $5 to $35 per month for new subscribers or $50 per month when bundled together. Because of Sling’s existing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21310302/sling-tv-same-price-guarantee-youtube-tv-att-fubotv"&gt;one-year price guarantee&lt;/a&gt;, current subscribers won’t have to deal with the new prices until August 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NffPWD"&gt;Along with the changes to the packages, Sling TV add-ons are also getting a small price bump. The “Sports Extra” for live sports is going up by $1 to $11 per month for new customers who subscribe to either Sling Blue or Orange. Customers who bundle Blue and Orange together will still pay $15 per month for the sports add-on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aU4kkS"&gt;All other extras and add-ons for comedy, lifestyle, and news channels will be raised by $1 to $6 per month. If navigating all of those add-ons seems like too much, Sling TV’s giant “total TV deal” for every add-on the service offers is available for new Orange or Blue package subscribers for $21 per month ($1 more than before). If you’re bundling Orange and Blue, you can get the deal for $27 per month ($2 more than before).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EryhMc"&gt;In addition to the new higher prices, Sling TV is also throwing in extra hours of DVR space. Customers will now have 10 extra hours, bringing up the total to 50 hours. If you subscribe to Sling’s DVR Plus add-on, your total DVR space will shoot up to 200 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvqOoR"&gt;Sling last &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/23/21035080/sling-tv-orange-blue-price-increase-subscription"&gt;raised prices in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but this year’s changes come after a cascade of rising TV subscription costs from competitors like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570259/hulu-live-tv-price-increase-cable-sports-news-virtual-bundle-disney"&gt;Hulu with Live TV&lt;/a&gt;. At $50 per month for the combined Sling Orange and Sling Blue bundle, Sling TV is still cheaper than YouTube TV at $64.99 a month or Hulu with Live TV for the same price. Sling TV’s various add-ons and packages make it a lot more complicated to navigate, but if you’re looking for core cable channels, you can still get a deal at Sling, albeit a slightly more expensive one.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook usage has soared during the pandemic, but the company warns of ‘significant uncertainty’ ahead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HStDhMW9rpARToE36CjcNxmKvUA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730404/mdoying_180118_2249_facebook_0581_1stills.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aPpRYl"&gt;Facebook finished 2020 much stronger financially than at the beginning of the year, proving its business could weather the coronavirus pandemic and even thrive thanks to skyrocketing screen time these past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UikNnA"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results/default.aspx"&gt;reported fourth quarter earnings on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; of more than $28 billion in revenue with profit of $11.2 billion, respective 31 percent and 53 percent year-over-year increases. As far as usage goes, Facebook is up all around, with more than 1.84 billion people using its main social network at least once a day in December 2020, an 11 percent year-over-year increase. As of December 31st, 2020, more than 2.8 billion people check Facebook at least once a month, a 12 percent jump from the year before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vDSQF"&gt;When measuring usage of its bundled family of apps that also includes Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp — a metric the company refers to as “family active people” — the numbers are even better, as usual. More than 2.6 billion people check one of Facebook’s apps every day (up 15 percent from 2019), while more than 3.3 billion check one of the apps at least once a month (up 14 percent). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0708f7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More than 3.3 billion people use a Facebook-owned app at least once a month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SkhwjL"&gt;Facebook’s business was largely unaffected by its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560969/facebook-political-ad-ban-extended-trump-2020-election-concede-misinformation"&gt;decision in October to temporarily ban political advertising&lt;/a&gt; following the US election. (The company extended the ban by one month in December, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215067/facebook-ads-georgia-runoff-political-ad-ban-zuckerberg"&gt;exempted advertising for the Georgia Senate races&lt;/a&gt;.) That was to be expected; political advertising pales in comparison to e-commerce, standard retailer, and small business ad spend on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ual4Pc"&gt;Facebook’s “Other” category, which includes its Portal video chat devices and Oculus virtual reality business, also fared quite well last quarter, with a 156 percent jump in revenue to $885 million. Last quarter included the launch of Facebook’s second-generation wireless Quest headset, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;, and Portal devices have seen surging sales all year as people shifted to remote work and virtual hangouts at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXvtXD"&gt;But it’s not all good news for Facebook looking ahead. The company says it will “continue to face significant uncertainty as we manage through a number of cross currents in 2021” in its earnings report, signaling concerns the company won’t be able to maintain the same pace of year-over-year growth as it enters the second half of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqOtX2"&gt;Unsaid in its report are privacy changes from Apple that could have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;significant consequences for Facebook’s ad business&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;new mandated privacy labels&lt;/a&gt; and Apple’s upcoming plan to mandate app makers get user consent to track people on iOS devices. Earlier this month, Facebook’s WhatsApp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;delayed a new privacy policy update&lt;/a&gt; that was sending users fleeing the app for competitors like Signal and Telegram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpWrtm"&gt;“At the same time, in the first half of 2021, we will be lapping a period of growth that was negatively impacted by reduced advertising demand during the early stages of the pandemic,” the company writes. “As a result, we expect year-over-year growth rates in total revenue to remain stable or modestly accelerate sequentially in the first and second quarters of 2021. In the second half of the year, we will lap periods of increasingly strong growth, which will significantly pressure year-over-year growth rates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WW2smV"&gt;Facebook also continues to weather its fair share of public relations and platform moderation controversies surrounding misinformation, election interference, and the recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242616/facebook-refers-decision-suspend-trump-oversight-board"&gt;banning of former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;. That is in addition to a new wave of US regulatory scrutiny punctuated last month by an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;unprecedented Federal Trade Commission lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; seeking to unwind the company’s pricey acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. But those issues appear to have little effect whatsoever on the company’s bottom line, for now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla unveils redesigned Model S with new interior and 520-mile range option</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UlpeiW1S3fx-qvr2tnNMT8spIBc=/398x0:3122x1816/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730354/Screen_Shot_2021_01_27_at_3.26.14_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l7PM7c"&gt;Tesla has just announced the first major redesign of the Model S since it &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-motors-begin-customer-deliveries-model-s-june-22nd"&gt;launched the electric sedan in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. This new version, which will launch later this year, has a refreshed exterior, a simplified interior, and the option for a more powerful powertrain that lets the car travel at least 520 miles and go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in under 2 seconds. Tesla says this makes it the “fastest accelerating production car ever made.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JiKiLU"&gt;Tesla’s Model X is also getting the interior update, and there will be a version with that new powertrain, though the SUV’s refresh is not as extensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27sMyg"&gt;The new Model S has some light updates to the exterior of the car, including a standard large glass roof, but the biggest visual change is inside. Tesla has axed the portrait touchscreen in favor of one more like what’s found in the Model 3 and Model Y, though with far smaller bezels (like we’ve seen on the Cybertruck prototype). There’s also a stalkless U-shaped butterfly steering wheel, much like what we’ve seen in the forthcoming second-generation Roadster, and a screen behind the center console for rear-seat passengers. Unlike the Model 3 and Model Y, the new Model S still features a screen behind the steering wheel.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w4rZ4j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first big overhaul since it launched in 2012&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="48aU1W"&gt;The new Model S starts at $79,990 for a “Long Range” dual-motor version that gets 412 miles of range. Or people can spend $119,000 for one with the new, more powerful “Plaid” powertrain that goes 390 miles with that sub-2 second 0–60 time. The “Plaid+” version with 520 miles starts at $139,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O124Wz"&gt;The Plaid and Plaid+ versions have top speeds of 200 miles per hour, while the Long Range tops out at 155 mph. Tesla says that the Plaid versions should be able to do five times as many quarter-mile runs than previous Model S sedans, thanks to the new powertrain and the new heat pump that was developed for the Model Y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2kzZuP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10306471"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nzDl5U"&gt;The new Model X retains the same exterior design, but features the new landscape dashboard screen, butterfly steering wheel, and rear passenger screen. The new Model X starts at $89,990 for a Long Range dual-motor spec that has 360 miles of range, a top speed of 155 mph, and a 0-60 time of 3.8 seconds. Tesla is selling a version with the Plaid powertrain for $119,000 that gets 340 miles of range, has a top speed of 163 mph, and can get to 60 mph in just 2.5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XW7ms"&gt;A Model S redesign has been rumored for years, with &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2018/07/30/tesla-model-s-x-interior-refresh-exclusive-first-look/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; posting allegedly leaked renders of the new interior all the way back in 2018. Tesla CEO Elon Musk threw cold water on the idea in 2019, though, when he tweeted “[t]here is no ‘refreshed’ Model X or Model S coming.” Tesla instead was constantly making minor improvements to both vehicles, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMDwOv"&gt;But that tune started to change once Tesla started testing out a new powertrain in 2019 dubbed “Plaid” — which, much like the “Ludicrous” acceleration mode in Tesla’s cars, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk7VWcuVOf0"&gt;is a &lt;em&gt;Spaceballs &lt;/em&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMoTmY"&gt;Musk said at Tesla’s Battery Day event in September 2020 that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451723/tesla-plaid-model-s-available-2021-specs-price-battery-day"&gt;Plaid Model S would be coming in late 2021&lt;/a&gt;. But aside from the basic specs, and the addition of the car to its website, Tesla didn’t mention anything about a design refresh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcEeQK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple surpasses $100 billion in quarterly revenue for first time in its history</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12, in blue." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F634QkTeHFCJIerV0S_RzB_RlYs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730336/vpavic_4243_20201018_0121.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IRJ132"&gt;Apple today reported its fiscal Q1 2021 earnings, which cover the final calendar quarter of 2020 and the holiday sales season. That means this is the first time we’re getting a real indication of how the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; are faring with consumers. As it turns out, they’re doing very well. Apple crossed $100 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in the company’s history: it brought in $111.4 billion in total, with earnings per share of $1.68. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NfT7Kw"&gt;The latest iPhones went on sale a bit later than normal, and Apple has had to again close some of its retail locations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But despite those obstacles, the iPhone business did extraordinarily well, tallying over $65 billion in revenue. The previous all-time record for iPhone revenue in a quarter was $61.58 billion, which Apple hit in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SBoIW"&gt;Alongside a tweaked, flatter design, the iPhone 12 series is the first to include 5G mobile data, which some have speculated could result in a so-called “super cycle” of upgrades from people who are still using iPhones that are a couple years old at this point. The strong early interest is certainly there; now we’ll have to see if it holds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l89BnE"&gt;Apple’s Mac and iPad lines have seen rocketing sales during the prolonged period of working at home and remote education as a result of the pandemic. The momentum continued in this latest quarter, with iPad sales up a staggering 41 percent — during a holiday quarter, remember — and Mac sales up 21 percent year over year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new iPad Air with Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uU0ZELodKHp9OMSCN3xNlwzpPww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21975638/vpavic_4244_20201020_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPad sales were up a staggering 41 percent year over year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AMFjtu"&gt;The company’s MacBook Air, base-level 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac mini are now powered by its own M1 processors. Those three products officially kicked off a transition away from Intel chips that will extend to Apple’s other Mac products over the coming months. The popular iPad Air was also updated in the fall with a more modern design similar to the iPad Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AozzPR"&gt;During an earnings call with investors, CEO Tim Cook said Apple crossed 1.65 billion active devices worldwide during the quarter. iPhones account for over 1 billion of those devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwYsfe"&gt;Unsurprisingly, AirPods / AirPods Pro and the Apple Watch were a holiday hit for another year running, boosting the wearables division up 30 percent year over year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMrAuy"&gt;Just as 2020 came to a close, Apple launched its latest paid subscription service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174574/apple-fitness-plus-watch-iphone-release-date-price"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which joins Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple TV Plus, and Apple News Plus as ways of getting recurring profits from consumers who buy Apple hardware. The company has continued to extend the trial periods for some of those services — namely, Apple TV Plus — but the services unit as a whole continues to perform very well and was up 24 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQoLcF"&gt;Executive shifts at the company also continue. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249393/apple-senior-vice-president-hardware-engineering-dan-riccio-john-ternus-new"&gt;Just this week, Apple announced&lt;/a&gt; that longtime hardware engineering SVP Dan Riccio will now focus on a new, unspecified project; John Ternus — who has publicly introduced well-received products like the revamped Mac Pro, iPad Pro, and M1 Macs — has replaced him as Apple’s hardware boss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZjbN2"&gt;The company has also pushed forward with its social initiatives, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228580/apple-detroit-developer-academy-equity-center-hbcu-tech-hub"&gt;announcing a number of racial equity investments&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. Apple also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;removed conservative social media app Parler&lt;/a&gt; from the App Store, citing insufficient moderation policies and calls to violence from some users on the app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla turns Model Y and China success into its first annual profit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZMonKuEmKkBzKVcwOM8D6A-QUk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730272/sokane_181116_3101_fremont_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pbmxqi"&gt;Tesla’s record sales in 2020 helped the Silicon Valley company turn its first annual profit, according to &lt;a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/78Z2ZX_2020_Q4_Quarterly_Update_Deck_SMXBZX.pdf?xseo=&amp;amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q4-2020-Update.pdf%22"&gt;financial figures released Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, though not by much. Aided by a fourth quarter that brought in $270 million in profit on $10.7 billion of revenue, Tesla finished 2020 with a $721 million in profit on $31.5 billion in total revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrX8K7"&gt;To help get over the line, Tesla booked $401 million in regulatory credit sales in the fourth quarter of 2020. The company generates this money by selling these credits to automakers that make fewer clean vehicles than are required by the US government and the European Union. The credit sales have come in handy the past year and a half, as they’ve generated hundreds of millions of dollars per quarter for Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="677jV6"&gt;Tesla shipped 180,667 vehicles total in the fourth quarter, and 161,701 of those were Model 3s and Model Ys. Ultimately, Tesla delivered 499,647 in 2020 — a few more than it estimated earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210191/tesla-delivery-goal-elon-musk-vehicles-2020"&gt;but still ever so shy of the goal of 500,000&lt;/a&gt; for the year. Still, it’s quite the accomplishment considering that Tesla had to deal with prolonged shutdowns at both of its automotive factories in California and China due to the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="I1IIVU"&gt;
&lt;div id="datawrapper-1nXQu" data-analytics-viewport="datawrapper" data-iframe-fallback="https://img.datawrapper.de/1nXQu/full.png" data-iframe-fallback-width="600" data-iframe-fallback-height="600" data-iframe-fallback-alt="(billions in USD; green indicates profitable quarter)" data-iframe="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1nXQu/1/" data-iframe-width="600" data-iframe-height="600" data-iframe-layout="responsive" data-iframe-title="Tesla's quarterly revenue and profit/loss through 2020" data-iframe-resizable=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&amp;&amp;(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){var i=document.createElement("iframe");var e=document.getElementById("datawrapper-1nXQu");var t=e.dataset.iframeTitle||'Interactive graphic';i.setAttribute("src",e.dataset.iframe);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("frameborder","0");i.setAttribute("scrolling","no");i.setAttribute("aria-label",e.dataset.iframeFallbackAlt||t);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("height","400");i.setAttribute("id","datawrapper-chart-1nXQu");i.style.minWidth="100%";i.style.border="none";e.appendChild(i)})}()&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="at0Jwk"&gt;While Tesla didn’t lay out a specific delivery estimate for 2021 in its presentation, the company did say that it now has the ability to make as many as 1.05 million cars in a year at its factories in Fremont, California, and Shanghai, China. Tesla also said that it expects to start deliveries of vehicles made at its new factories in Berlin, Germany, and outside Austin, Texas — which are still under construction — by the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFzRig"&gt;Tesla’s banner 2020 was bolstered by booming sales of the new Model Y SUV and increased success in the Chinese market after opening a factory there early in the year. Those developments, coupled with the continued success of the Model 3, helped Tesla absorb &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/vw-tops-tesla-in-bounce-back-year-for-europe-s-auto-incumbents"&gt;losing market share in Europe to the Volkswagen Group&lt;/a&gt;, which debuted multiple electric vehicles on its home continent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4feycj"&gt;Sustainable profitability had always eluded Tesla, in large part because the company spent much of its first decade trying to grow bigger. When the Model S sedan first went on sale, Tesla was already working on the more complex and more expensive Model X SUV. By the time that hit the market, Tesla had started work on the more affordable Model 3 sedan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cwx3HV"&gt;
&lt;div id="datawrapper-sx3W1" data-analytics-viewport="datawrapper" data-iframe-fallback="https://img.datawrapper.de/sx3W1/full.png" data-iframe-fallback-width="600" data-iframe-fallback-height="600" data-iframe-fallback-alt="" data-iframe="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sx3W1/1/" data-iframe-width="600" data-iframe-height="600" data-iframe-layout="responsive" data-iframe-title="Tesla production and deliveries through 2020" data-iframe-resizable=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&amp;&amp;(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){var i=document.createElement("iframe");var e=document.getElementById("datawrapper-sx3W1");var t=e.dataset.iframeTitle||'Interactive graphic';i.setAttribute("src",e.dataset.iframe);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("frameborder","0");i.setAttribute("scrolling","no");i.setAttribute("aria-label",e.dataset.iframeFallbackAlt||t);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("height","400");i.setAttribute("id","datawrapper-chart-sx3W1");i.style.minWidth="100%";i.style.border="none";e.appendChild(i)})}()&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h8XUrQ"&gt;Tesla turned a slight profit in the third quarter of 2016, not long after the Model X hit the market. But Model 3 development put the company back in the red. Trouble with Model 3 production kept it there until things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18203886/tesla-earnings-q1-revenue-profit-record-model-3"&gt;started to smooth out in the second half of 2018&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Tesla to turn back-to-back quarterly profits for the first time in what the company called its “most pivotal year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g68Xvi"&gt;After two more quarters in the red to start 2019, Tesla has remained profitable ever since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jY5fZ"&gt;A stable business is a good thing for Tesla’s future, but the company’s performance was also rewarded mightily in the stock market in 2020. Its share price skyrocketed last year, making &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22163361/elon-musk-billionaire-richest-world-jeff-bezos-tesla-stock-spacex"&gt;Musk the richest man in the world&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21286562/tesla-stock-most-valuable-automaker-slot-as-more-workers-contract-covid-19"&gt;Tesla the most valuable automaker&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla used this incredible run to shore up its finances, too, amassing a $19.4 billion war chest by the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7lCH1l"&gt;Tesla has long maintained that it is more than an automaker, despite the bulk of its revenues coming from its electric cars. The company shared Wednesday that it was able to keep increasing its sales of energy storage products by 200 percent year over year. Sales of solar products also went up, though by much less — just 59 percent year over year. That means Tesla’s solar division remains &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/21/13698314/tesla-completes-acquisition-solarcity-elon-musk"&gt;much smaller compared to what it acquired in the SolarCity deal in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1YuDQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this report about the tech systems behind the US’s vaccine distribution</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GoZ5BaEoZZGWRhshupvHyBYe1XU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730224/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gj3ZqK"&gt;There are many moving parts involved in the Biden administration’s goal to administer 100 million vaccine doses in its first 100 days. Boatloads of data need to flow between manufacturers, health agencies, state officials, and local clinics. An article by Cat Ferguson and Karen Hao, &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/27/1016790/covid-vaccine-distribution-us/"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; today&lt;/a&gt;, lays out each step of vaccine distribution and explains the hurdles that come up along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqV4Uc"&gt;At the federal level, the Department of Health and Human Services uses a Palantir-designed system called Tiberius to plan vaccine allocation. At the same time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s VTrckS helps states order vaccines. Both digital systems are constantly being fed data from a variety of sources. The number-crunching involves census data, reports of which areas have clusters of health care workers and elderly people, and information about which places have cold freezers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4z2pV"&gt;“When thinking about the utility of the system, it’s worth noting that many health departments have a shallow bench of tech-savvy employees who can easily navigate data-heavy systems,” Ferguson and Hao wrote. In addition to Tiberius and VTrckS, there are dozens of other technical systems at play, and some clinic workers are still entering vaccination records by hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNDJta"&gt;Actually getting the vaccines into people’s arms is the trickiest part. There’s a mixed bag of systems across jurisdictions for scheduling vaccinations and keeping track of who’s been vaccinated. Scheduling through an online system requires &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;digital literacy that not all elderly people possess&lt;/a&gt;, and call centers set up as alternatives are quickly overwhelmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtRBE6"&gt;There’s a lot of technological coordination going into the difficult task of vaccine distribution. To get a fuller picture of all the systems at work, read the &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/27/1016790/covid-vaccine-distribution-us/"&gt;full article here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Baidu is the sixth company approved to test fully driverless cars in California</title>

  &lt;p id="f8j1vv"&gt;Baidu has gotten the green light to test fully autonomous vehicles on public roads in California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jm4LrN"&gt;The Chinese search giant is the sixth company to receive a fully autonomous testing permit from the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (the others being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517833/cruise-driverless-cars-test-permit-california-dmv"&gt;Cruise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18044670/waymo-fully-driverless-car-permit-california-dmv"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21212719/nuro-driverless-car-test-california-dmv-delivery"&gt;Nuro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/zoox-becomes-fourth-company-to-land-driverless-testing-permit-in-california/"&gt;Zoox&lt;/a&gt;, and AutoX). Currently, 60 companies have an active permit to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MnN90z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Baidu is the leading Chinese company in the autonomous vehicle space&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KWI0LV"&gt;Baidu, which already spent years working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/5/15923966/baidu-apollo-self-driving-car-platform-ford-intel-nvidia"&gt;self-driving&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15352462/baidu-project-apollo-self-driving-cars-autonomous"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt;, is the leading Chinese company in the autonomous vehicle space. Last September, the company demonstrated its Level 4 fully autonomous vehicles at its developer conference, Baidu World. In December, Baidu &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/baidu-driverless-road-tests-beijing-china-autonomous-183933093.html"&gt;received the first license&lt;/a&gt; to test fully autonomous vehicles on public roads in China. The city of Beijing granted the company permission to test five of its self-driving Apollo vehicles, which are retrofitted Lincoln MKZs and Chrysler Pacificas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntGZY0"&gt;While Baidu has had permission from California regulators to test autonomous vehicles with safety drivers since 2016, the new permit allows the company to test three autonomous vehicles without a driver behind the wheel on specified streets within Sunnyvale, located in Santa Clara County. The vehicles are only allowed on roads with speed limits of 45 mph, and they can operate day or night but not during inclement weather like fog or rain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R14jcZ"&gt;Companies that receive these driverless permits have to provide evidence of insurance or a bond equal to $5 million and follow several other rules, such as training remote operators on the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQD4MM"&gt;Baidu recently announced plans to make electric vehicles with help from Geely, the country’s largest private automaker and the parent company of Volvo. Specifically, Baidu and Geely are in talks to use the latter’s &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-geely-electric/geely-launches-electric-vehicle-manufacturing-platform-idUKKCN26E1ZN"&gt;scalable electric vehicle platform&lt;/a&gt; that it announced late last year. But Baidu will own a majority stake in the new company and will therefore control its direction.&lt;/p&gt;
