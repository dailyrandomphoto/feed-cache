    <title>Sonos FCC filing hints it’s coming for the UE Boom and other small Bluetooth speakers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gC6MHEWI_TRACI-0nQrmDDS6Tnk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68777896/dseifert_190826_3622_0017.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6CMqrq"&gt;Sonos is preparing for the release of a new product that, according to FCC documentation, is likely to be the company’s second portable speaker with a rechargeable battery. The unannounced device, &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/SBVRM027"&gt;listed at the FCC as model number S27&lt;/a&gt;, is shown in testing diagrams to have a wireless charging dock and offer both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) wireless technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PESOW0-rZqPH33lx7waZNR32TnE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22285206/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_4.57.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://fccid.io/SBVRM027/Label/10-1-S27-FCC-ISED-Label-format-Location-12-14-2020-5097436" target="_blank"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;FCC diagrams reveal a wireless charging dock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="41y6tA"&gt;The mandatory FCC label reveals that this new product uses less power than existing Sonos speakers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871409/sonos-move-wireless-bluetooth-speaker-review-alexa-google-assistant-wifi-price-specs-sound-quality"&gt;the Sonos Move&lt;/a&gt;, lending more credence to a smaller overall size. The circular label design, and the fact that Sonos says the label is visible on the bottom surface of the product hints that this Sonos speaker could feature a cylindrical design similar to Bluetooth speaker mainstays like the UE Boom.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YDF9ooDzVL5Og2YZqCD9TcUb2GM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22285059/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_1.03.32_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://fccid.io/SBVRM027/Label/10-1-S27-FCC-ISED-Label-format-Location-12-14-2020-5097436" target="_blank"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PSj6Wh"&gt;The current Sonos Move’s size and weight help it to put out strong sound, but they also make it a less practical speaker for taking on the go. At a hefty 6.6 pounds, it’s something you’d bring from inside out to your porch, maybe, but Sonos still lacks a speaker portable enough for tossing into a bag and traveling with. S27 might just be the answer for that. The original Move, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20799366/sonos-bluetooth-portable-speaker-model-s17"&gt;leaked soon after its own FCC filing&lt;/a&gt;, is model number S17. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ocFbokhKCH3C04RBtuVZZO_rsgs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19208408/dseifert_190915_3647_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The current Sonos Move is far larger than many portable Bluetooth speakers. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="9A8C5W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10322870"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YSoeGq"&gt;This would also be the first speaker from Sonos to include Wi-Fi 5; the Move supports Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n). Bluetooth would come into play more often when using the speaker outside somewhere, but improved Wi-Fi could help performance when playing it around the home as part of Sonos’ multi-room systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZAid2"&gt;Other products that Sonos is rumored to be actively developing include a pair of premium headphones. But a line in one of the FCC documents seems to rule out that we’re looking at those. “For satisfying FCC RF exposure compliance requirements, the device must be used with a separation distance of at least 20 cm from all persons,” it says. So all signs — especially that wireless charger — point to a small, rechargeable device. As much as I’d love to see a Sonos shower head speaker or something a little unconventional, I’m banking on a Move Mini. And hopefully for a price significantly lower than the $400 Move. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden’s executive order on refugees matters a lot for climate migration </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A destroyed community on the banks of the Chemelecon river..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pcOZH6JhNmNz7nfLiSqhvpmaCzo=/0x2:4000x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68777745/1229526982.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;SAN PEDRO SULA, CORTES, HONDURAS - 2020/11/07: In the aftermath of Hurricane Eta, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced due to flooding. | Photo by Seth Sidney Berry/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WaEjkE"&gt;Joe Biden’s administration is crafting a report that will include proposals for how the US might respond to global migration due to climate change. Biden commissioned the report as part of a broader &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/04/executive-order-on-rebuilding-and-enhancing-programs-to-resettle-refugees-and-planning-for-the-impact-of-climate-change-on-migration/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; he signed yesterday aimed at overhauling the US refugee resettlement program, which was gutted under the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHgk3U"&gt;“I’ve worked on this very intersection of issues for over a decade, and I never thought that this would be a part of any American president’s priorities, especially within the first 30 days of their administration,” says Kayly Ober, climate displacement manager at the humanitarian organization Refugees International. “So I am delighted and surprised.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2sjxz2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A game-changer for people who’ve fled their homes because of climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0I6Y1Z"&gt;If Biden’s report, due in 179 days, leads to an actual pathway to resettlement in the US, it could be a game-changer for people who’ve fled their homes because of climate change. There are currently no policies that allow someone who’s been displaced by climate-related disasters to apply for a visa, green card, or refugee protections in the US. It’s a gap that’s, for the most part, missing globally, too. International institutions literally don’t even have the words to tackle the issue: there’s still a debate over whether to consider displaced people “migrants” or “refugees” since the terminology could affect what legal protections a person is entitled to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbHhXP"&gt;Meanwhile, an average of &lt;a href="https://www.internal-displacement.org/publications/seizing-the-momentum-displacement-on-the-global-climate-change-agenda"&gt;21.5 million people&lt;/a&gt; are pushed from their homes each year because of climate-related hazards. That includes people who’ve survived disasters like storms and floods that have grown more intense as the planet heats up. For comparison, that’s almost &lt;a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/new-framework-us-leadership-climate-migration"&gt;nine times&lt;/a&gt; as many people as those who apply for political asylum because of the fear of persecution in their home country. What’s more, 21.5 million people is likely an underestimate of how many people climate change is actually pushing to the brink. That figure &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; include people on the move because of the slower-moving consequences of climate change like drought and rising sea levels. The number of people seeking new homes as global temperatures rise is only expected to grow. So governments and international organizations need to start acting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vl5kBX"&gt;The US has a big role to play on the global stage when it comes to figuring out how to grapple with climate-driven migration. For one, the US has contributed the most to the climate crisis since it’s emitted &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/24/18512804/climate-change-united-states-china-emissions"&gt;more greenhouse gases historically&lt;/a&gt; than any other country. That aside, the US has played a leading role in refugee resettlement in the past. For decades until the Trump administration, it accepted &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/19/canada-now-leads-the-world-in-refugee-resettlement-surpassing-the-u-s/"&gt;more refugees every year than any other country&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMNzPv"&gt;“If the US plants a flag that says that they’re willing to figure out a way to offer refugee-like status to people who are displaced by climate change, it will allow other countries to take up their fair share of that burden as well,” says Ober.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="aljzTL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This executive order is still just a starting point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qSTdmb"&gt;The executive order signed yesterday is still just a starting point. While Biden has signaled that climate change and immigration will be key priorities for his administration, there need to be real policies in place to impart the kinds of changes he talks about. Sweeping changes to America’s immigration and refugee resettlement will require legislation, as will a plan to wean the US off fossil fuels. The US also needs to stop polluting so much in the first place if it wants to keep climate change from driving displacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fv1x5v"&gt;“With this climate and migration report, let’s make sure it’s not some sort of risk scenario and planning exercise,” says Ober. “Let’s make sure this is about actually offering a solution, especially for those who are at risk, who are already displaced.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A German man is keeping $60 million in bitcoin from police by never revealing his password</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PDhPhON_vphR3OBILvcf5GpHaPw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68777659/mdoying_180308_2373_0092still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I9Cou2"&gt;The wonderful thing about bitcoin is many of its apparent benefits, like the ability to be anonymously owned and securely transferred, are also the things that often create situations like this: police in Germany have seized more than €50 million ($60 million) in bitcoin, but they can’t access any of it because, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-germany-password/police-seize-60-million-of-bitcoin-now-wheres-the-password-idUSKBN2A511T"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, the person they took it from won’t tell them his password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXgUlQ"&gt;The man in question was sentenced and has served his time in jail for covertly installing bitcoin mining software on people’s computers, but throughout the entire process, he never shared a peep about how German authorities should get in. “We asked him but he didn’t say” is the explanation &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; was offered by a prosecutor. It presents a big, and probably obvious, question: can you really seize something, particularly money, that you can’t access or use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yb0EtT"&gt;The even more glaring issue is how often passwords, PINs, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/i-forgot-my-pin-an-epic-tale-of-losing-dollar30000-in-bitcoin/"&gt;and their collective absence&lt;/a&gt; pop up in stories about bitcoin, illegal or otherwise. There was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html"&gt;a recent story&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; about a programmer with his own bitcoin fortune locked away in a secure hard drive that revealed an amazing statistic: around 20 percent of bitcoin in existence today (totaling around $140 billion) are completely lost or locked up in wallets with lost passwords, meaning they’re completely inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FF9y4t"&gt;So maybe this German bitcoin enthusiast is sticking it to the people who had him locked up, or maybe he’s simply forgotten his password. &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports that prosecutors have “ensured the man cannot access [his] largesse” but if they can’t access it either, I think it’s safe to say that pile of lost bitcoin just got a bit larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydvpiY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3S1qe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0CHiL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Someone modded a Game Boy Color to act as a much better Apple TV remote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CIkCC-1sxHHqVasNJ5FBvs7Rq8A=/0x0:1908x1272/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68777610/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_12.31.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Otto Climan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BEyLzi"&gt;Most people who have used the Apple TV Siri remote have probably craved something that isn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/9/21002605/apple-tv-remote-salt-swiss-tv-company-replacement-buttons-normal"&gt;so darn frustrating to use&lt;/a&gt; — but most of us haven’t modded a Game Boy Color to work as one (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/i-think-we-can-all-agree-that-a-hacked-apple-themed-gam-1846188094"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). That’s exactly what &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYPw_wN1a9I"&gt;Italian YouTuber Otto Climan did&lt;/a&gt;, and while his project looks sleek as all get-out, it’s surprising how well it works using the Game Boy’s original hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0n0G3eg1f9fNxOvbMI9LHN3UUHk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284964/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_12.31.38_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Otto Climan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wow, that custom case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TssO1FdG6tIws3JyHjJJrtqOgWo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284958/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_12.28.47_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Otto Climan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That screen is looking nice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xm04pU"&gt;First off, we have to talk about the case he used. It was apparently made by a company called &lt;a href="https://www.retromodding.com"&gt;Retro Modding&lt;/a&gt;, specifically for the project, and it looks incredible with its blend of ‘90s Apple and Nintendo aesthetics. (Embarrassingly, it looks better than the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pippin#/media/File:Pippin-Atmark-Console-Set.jpg"&gt;actual video game console Apple worked on in the ‘90s&lt;/a&gt;.) If you’re familiar with the Game Boy Color, you may notice that the screen on Climan’s looks a bit crisper and better backlit. In addition to replacing the case, he also gave the screen an upgrade using what looks like another Retro Modding part.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d9FHNBiLgB59O0itxXlioWZ0F_Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284966/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_12.30.02_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Otto Climan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The IR blaster is actually original equipment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BfuHbs"&gt;Apart from giving it an incredible aesthetic upgrade, though, there wasn’t a ton of hardware hackery needed. The Game Boy Color comes stock with an IR blaster, which the newest Apple TV set still supports. Of course, some custom software was needed to map the buttons to the IR controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NEr1Abjrua0UfeHXIsdra6wv6ag=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284968/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_12.31.56_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Otto Climan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Climan’s UI for the ROM is clean and minimalist. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lk1gmEZPqb71eTYwn2i_4lYnROw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284973/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_12.32.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Otto Climan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even the Game Pak is custom-made and beautiful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RG2xRSP5IjaqiGbp0P8cROb4dwE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284987/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_12.28.16_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Otto Climan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of course, there’s a time period-appropriate clear version.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k0S2b3"&gt;I wouldn’t have blamed Climan for using a standard custom ROM cartridge, but of course he had one made that matches the Game Boy’s aesthetic. He loaded a ROM that he programmed with the Apple TV’s IR codes and button mappings, and there you have it: a Game Boy Color that can control an Apple TV. And because it has real directional buttons and not a feisty touchpad, it’s probably better at that task than Apple’s actual remote.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NOo1RW-RAN2_l4I_R0z30hboGT8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284983/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_12.31.48_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pictured: a reasonable navigation UX.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aDSD6qHx9ldSYHpmfGz4UIA7ZxI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22285025/GBC_Remote_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I need this in my life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HkIrAW"&gt;While this project is absolutely incredible, I have an idea for the next iteration: using a Nintendo DS. That way, you can have the touch input if you really want it along with a microphone for Siri support. It doesn’t have an IR blaster or support for Bluetooth like Apple’s remote, but maybe you could add it in with the Game Boy slot, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero:_On_Tour_(series)#/media/File:GuitarHero_On_Tour_Controller.jpg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guitar Hero&lt;/em&gt; style&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Please GameStop it, Hollywood</title>

  &lt;p id="mrbs5G"&gt;Okay, screenwriters, directors, authors, and production companies — we get it. You have some experience telling stories about Wall Street, the video game industry, or social networks, and you see some &lt;em&gt;mighty&lt;/em&gt; big dollar signs in the true tale of how Reddit managed to drive an ailing video game retailer’s stocks to completely ridiculous highs through sheer power of will plus a David versus Goliath narrative that probably &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-hedge-fund-made-700-million-on-gamestop-11612390687"&gt;doesn’t hold up under close examination&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgitZr"&gt;So you’re making movies — four of them&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;and a TV show. Why not? It’s not like any one person has the rights to a news event like this! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9B0px3"&gt;As of Friday, February 5th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="NPyjwt"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/gamestop-series-hbo-1234901914/"&gt;HBO now has a movie&lt;/a&gt; from the guy who wrote &lt;em&gt;Too Big to Fail &lt;/em&gt;and co-created Showtime’s &lt;em&gt;Billions&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="L4CGtC"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261036/wallstreet-bets-movie-adaptation-deals-netflix-mgm"&gt;MGM optioned a movie&lt;/a&gt; based on a book that hasn’t even been written yet&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;whose author you’ll probably know from the book that became David Fincher’s &lt;em&gt;The Social Network&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bmw51S"&gt;Netflix is negotiating with the screenwriter of &lt;em&gt;The Hurt Locker &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Zero Dark Thirty&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/netflix-gamestop-stock-movie-screenwriter-mark-boal-noah-centineo-scott-galloway-makeready-1234684568/"&gt;to write yet another movie&lt;/a&gt;, with one of those cute guys &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134580/netflix-to-all-the-boys-ive-loved-before-release-stream-subscriber"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; playing a role&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cxRrXy"&gt;The writer and director of &lt;em&gt;Console Wars &lt;/em&gt;(a book, also a movie) &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/jonah-tulis-gamestop-documentary-submarine-1234687991/"&gt;now have a feature-length documentary&lt;/a&gt; that’s “fully financed and already in production”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IWCNng"&gt;And yes, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/pinky-promise-limited-series-to-the-moon-1234684845/"&gt;a TV show&lt;/a&gt;. How can this possibly turn into a TV show?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="DcVG6v"&gt;No. But just in case &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;, we imagine this set of completely disparate productions will need some excellent titles going forward. May we humbly suggest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="x4vgLr"&gt;GameStop: Never Stop Stopping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9Dbqnx"&gt;Uncut GMEs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EJW0P4"&gt;Meme Streets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="loazlg"&gt;Short Stop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="X0Y6yi"&gt;From Pre-Order to Stock Order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7RC4H0"&gt;I Have No Shares, and I Must Sell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hQfsZM"&gt;Hate the Player, Not the GME&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eEfdMO"&gt;The Weeb of Wall Street&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="X6plIl"&gt;The Game is Up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Z1PcBM"&gt;GameStop Won’t Stop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="g416y3"&gt;Diamond Hands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l6gkQd"&gt;Robinhood and the Men in Gamer Chairs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LBHO7m"&gt;To The Moon, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and HODL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RJjNcV"&gt;This Theater Still Exists Because of This Movie’s Events (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251964/amc-stock-price-reddit-wallstreetbets-trading-gamestop"&gt;remember AMC&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qyXOgV"&gt;The Bankrupting of the Hedge Fund Melvin Capital by the Internet Message Board WallStreetBets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsGbDh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. The dictionary definition of the word “stonk” is “a concentrated artillery bombardment,” so if I told you there is now a stonk of GameStop movies in development, that would largely be correct.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Destruction AllStars no longer turns on voice chat by default, thanks to new hotfix</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9xaxVvgYKXPZSu3J4D3mFLhMnvo=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68777131/destruction_all_stars_screenshots_19_disclaimer_ps5_en_15oct20.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Characters from &lt;/em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EsgIxC"&gt;Sony released the car-smashing game &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; exclusively for the PlayStation 5 on Tuesday, but it shipped with one very annoying feature: voice chat in multiplayer matches was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264461/destruction-allstars-voice-chat-default-turn-off-dualsense"&gt;turned on by default&lt;/a&gt;, meaning you could be subject to the unfiltered comments and background noise from your opponents. And worse, it wasn’t immediately obvious how to turn voice chat off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpM0T2"&gt;On Friday, however, developer Lucid Games addressed the issue by releasing a hotfix for the game that disables voice chat in multiplayer lobbies by default (&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/you-no-longer-have-to-hear-hate-speech-while-playing-de-1846205888"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCYZ7J"&gt;I jumped into a couple of matches with the hotfix installed to test things out, and I was greeted with glorious silence from my fellow players. However, it seems there’s no option for public voice chat at all right now. I couldn’t find a way to turn on voice chat in the game’s menus. Before this patch, you could mute voice chat on a per-match basis with the PlayStation 5’s Activity Cards, and I didn’t see a way to turn on voice chat from those either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKZGuH"&gt;Perhaps public voice chat will return at some point down the line, though, as Lucid Games &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LucidGamesLtd/status/1357724839180709888"&gt;said it is&lt;/a&gt; “actively working on longer-term enhancements to the voice communications system.” And if you want to play &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; with friends and voice chat with them, that should still work, too. I was able to chat with a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleague as part of a party we made with no issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxwDaT"&gt;Here are the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LucidGamesLtd/status/1357724840405442567"&gt;full patch notes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Patient names and colonoscopy results from US hospitals posted by hackers to the dark web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j8cE4orv8zVXCzBYNhooXedDds0=/0x0:2130x1420/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68776984/VRG_ILLO_1777_AK_body_data.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ana Kova&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zEa8xz"&gt;Patients of two US hospital chains had their names, birthdays, and colonoscopy results posted on the dark web after a hack, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/hackers-post-detailed-patient-medical-records-two-hospitals-dark-web-n1256887"&gt;reported NBC News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The tens of thousands of files released were from patients at Leon Medical Centers in Miami and Nocona General Hospital in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLwxyn"&gt;The patient records posted in this hack also include letters to insurers. There does not appear to be ransomware locking up the systems at Nocona, and the organization did not open a ransomware demand, an attorney for the organization told NBC News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zajmvv"&gt;Cyberattacks on hospitals and health care organizations are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21551050/cyberattacks-hospitals-coronavirus-deadly-tactics"&gt;increasingly common&lt;/a&gt;. These attacks doubled in the second half of 2020 compared to the first half. Two major attacks targeted US health care facilities in the fall. However, cybercriminals typically don’t post patient information publicly. It’s more common for them to introduce a bug that locks up computer systems until the facility pays a ransom and only release data if the ransom isn’t paid.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5AHazV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cybercriminals typically don’t post patient information publicly&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PZFEjp"&gt;It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18293817/cybersecurity-hospitals-health-care-scan-simulation"&gt;dangerous&lt;/a&gt; for patients when ransomware attacks prevent doctors and nurses from accessing files. They may not be able to see patient health records, which include information about things like medication allergies, or use MRI and CT scan machinery. But it’s also dangerous when hospitals have data breaches — for 30 days after, more people die than usual, probably because people have to devote time to fix the systems rather than focusing entirely on medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfFw8Z"&gt;Most health care organizations are unprepared for cyberattacks and have even fewer resources to devote to the issue after nearly a year fighting COVID-19. “They are financially strapped because of that pandemic,” Caleb Barlow, CEO of cybersecurity consulting firm CynergisTek, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21551050/cyberattacks-hospitals-coronavirus-deadly-tactics"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in November.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Justice Department closes criminal probe of Ford emissions testing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NipowuCOIL2ssGVTHfcZbR0Ki4Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68776436/acastro_200406_1777_ford_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JWLfQt"&gt;The Department of Justice (DOJ) has closed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/26/18517991/ford-criminal-investigation-emissions-testing-problems-dieselgate"&gt;nearly two-year investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the process Ford uses to evaluate the emissions of its vehicles, the automaker disclosed in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000003799621000012/f-20201231.htm"&gt;a new filing&lt;/a&gt; with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ford says it “cooperated fully” with the probe, but no action was taken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDaInW"&gt;Ford originally disclosed the investigation in April 2019, just a few months after it &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/business/ford-emissions.html"&gt;announced its own internal probe&lt;/a&gt; into concerns over the process. Those concerns, first raised by Ford employees, had nothing to do with the kind of deceitful “defeat devices” at the center of Volkswagen’s Dieselgate scandal. Rather, the employees believed there were problems with some of the analytical models Ford was using to calculate things like aerodynamic drag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQWsiE"&gt;Ford said in the filing that California’s Air Resources Board has also closed an inquiry into the company’s emissions testing process, but “[r]eviews opened by EPA and Environment and Climate Change Canada remain open.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmzAj4"&gt;The DOJ and SEC are still separately investigating Fiat Chrysler (which is now known as Stellantis after merging with France’s PSA Group) for its own emissions cheating scandal, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000003799621000012/f-20201231.htm"&gt;according to a recent SEC filing&lt;/a&gt;. Fiat Chrysler recalled nearly 1 million vehicles in 2019 that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18264238/fiat-chrysler-recall-cars-emissions-investigation"&gt;didn’t meet US emissions standards&lt;/a&gt;, and it later settled a civil case with the DOJ that ultimately forced the automaker to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fiat-chrysler-emissions/u-s-judge-approves-fiat-chrysler-diesel-emissions-settlement-idUSKCN1S91YM"&gt;pay out $307 million to owners of affected cars&lt;/a&gt;. Just &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fiat-chrysler-emissions-idCAKBN27Y0DJ"&gt;one senior manager has been criminally charged so far&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="or8W0q"&gt;The DOJ was also investigating Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler, though the German automaker was ultimately allowed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367768/daimler-diesel-emissions-cheating-scandal-settlement-us-amount"&gt;settle those criminal charges for more than $2 billion last August&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this New York Times investigation of the location tracking data of the Capitol rioters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RbyQDmfPogvfcC6Exv__c2w12qk=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68776428/acastro_170711_1777_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3AVlXF"&gt;You’re being tracked — around the web, sure, but also in real life: the apps on your smartphone are constantly feeding data into the digital advertising market, where it’s bought and sold by hedge funds, financial institutions, and marketers. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/opinion/capitol-attack-cellphone-data.html"&gt;A new report in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; underscores the horrifying implications of the system&lt;/a&gt;, featuring location data mined from the rioters who sacked the US Capitol on January 6th, leaked by an anonymous source in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JKxzT"&gt;“This new data included a remarkable piece of information: a unique ID for each user that is tied to a smartphone,” they write. “This made it even easier to find people, since the supposedly anonymous ID could be matched with other databases containing the same ID, allowing us to add real names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and other information about smartphone owners in seconds.” Those IDs, the authors explain, are called mobile advertising identifiers, and they allow corporations to track people across the web. “They are supposed to be anonymous, and smartphone owners can reset them or disable them entirely. Our findings show the promise of anonymity is a farce,” they write. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="606h63"&gt;Furthermore, usage of that data doesn’t seem regulated at all. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/opinion/capitol-attack-cellphone-data.html"&gt;As the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;story notes&lt;/a&gt;, there aren’t any laws that force companies to disclose what they’re using the data for or how long they’re using it. Even if you know your records were sold, you can’t actually request that it be deleted in most states. That means, once collected, the data can be bought and sold in perpetuity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DH0yyO"&gt;That location data is also somewhat imprecise, which isn’t necessarily a good thing. The &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;story takes on one man’s case, in particular: he was at the Capitol riot, and his data possibly places him inside the Capitol as it was being stormed. He denies entering the Capitol. But in the hands of law enforcement, for example, that data might be used as evidence in a criminal case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVB8TX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/opinion/capitol-attack-cellphone-data.html"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; is terrifying for a number of reasons, but the worst is how little control we ordinary citizens have over how our data is used. It’s up to the people in power to do something about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9J3UOf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A cappella group covers iPhone tones after nailing Windows sound effects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Maytree&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bcS9sP"&gt;In January, South Korean a cappella group Maytree &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252590/maytree-a-cappella-group-windows-10-singing"&gt;wowed us&lt;/a&gt; with their spot-on vocal interpretations of Windows sound effects, and on Friday, the group released a video of their next impressive showcase: interpretations of sounds from iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NxN6cO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1cMdXs6wG0"&gt;The video&lt;/a&gt; is a little over a minute long, and I recommend watching the whole thing, which you can do at the top of this post. They cover a lot of ringtones, including the familiar &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8rew3w8AbA"&gt;“Opening” ringtone&lt;/a&gt;, the classic &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTcXZqIZxbA"&gt;“Marimba” ringtone&lt;/a&gt;, and even the twangy &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/03YxoOwKxn0"&gt;“Strum” ringtone&lt;/a&gt;. (I should warn you that they also re-create the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48qVYSDur-k"&gt;blaring “Alarm” ringtone&lt;/a&gt;, so be prepared to experience that brief moment of terror.) They even tackle some system noises, including the sounds of text messages being sent and received and a tightly choreographed version of the iPhone’s lock sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Nsbiu"&gt;If you haven’t seen the video of the Windows sound effects, you should take 28 seconds out of your day &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/4AZB64VBJfA"&gt;to watch it&lt;/a&gt;, too. I think it’s even better than their iPhone video. &lt;/p&gt;
