    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9XQjNZ"&gt;AI research lab DeepMind has created the most comprehensive map of human proteins to date using artificial intelligence. The company, a subsidiary of Google-parent Alphabet, is releasing the data for free, with some scientists comparing the potential impact of the work to that of the Human Genome Project, an international effort to map every human gene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySGTnQ"&gt;Proteins are long, complex molecules that perform numerous tasks in the body, from building tissue to fighting disease. Their purpose is dictated by their structure, which folds like origami into complex and irregular shapes. Understanding how a protein folds helps explain its function, which in turn helps scientists with a range of tasks — from pursuing fundamental research on how the body works, to designing new medicines and treatments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HQvlck"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the culmination of the entire 10-year-plus lifetime of DeepMind”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="csojN7"&gt;Previously, determining the structure of a protein relied on expensive and time-consuming experiments. But last year DeepMind showed it can produce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754310/deepmind-alphafold-ai-protein-folding-casp-competition"&gt;accurate predictions of a protein’s structure&lt;/a&gt; using AI software called AlphaFold. Now, the company is releasing hundreds of thousands of predictions made by the program to the public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRDcPO"&gt;“I see this as the culmination of the entire 10-year-plus lifetime of DeepMind,” company CEO and co-founder Demis Hassabis told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “From the beginning, this is what we set out to do: to make breakthroughs in AI, test that on games like Go and Atari, [and] apply that to real-world problems, to see if we can accelerate scientific breakthroughs and use those to benefit humanity.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A gif of two rotating protein fold models made up of curls and swirling lines. AlphaFold’s predictions are overlayed on the models, with 90.7 GDT accuracy on the left and 93.3 GDT accuracy on the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MLV4q-2KKwiqnXtDBpqLL6LTmY0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22132319/AlphaFold_prediction_comparisons.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DeepMind&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two examples of protein structures predicted by AlphaFold (in blue) compared with experimental results (in green). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P5XTtl"&gt;There are currently around 180,000 protein structures available in the public domain, each produced by experimental methods and accessible through the Protein Data Bank. DeepMind is releasing predictions for the structure of some 350,000 proteins across 20 different organisms, including animals like mice and fruit flies, and bacteria like &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. (There is some overlap between DeepMind’s data and pre-existing protein structures, but exactly how much is difficult to quantify because of the nature of the models.) Most significantly, the release includes predictions for 98 percent of all human proteins, around 20,000 different structures, which are collectively known as the human proteome. It isn’t the &lt;a href="https://swissmodel.expasy.org/repository/species/9606"&gt;first public dataset of human proteins&lt;/a&gt;, but it is the most comprehensive and accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1w6mgd"&gt;If they want, scientists can download the entire human proteome for themselves, says AlphaFold’s technical lead John Jumper. “There is a HumanProteome.zip effectively, I think it’s about 50 gigabytes in size,” Jumper tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “You can put it on a flash drive if you want, though it wouldn’t do you much good without a computer for analysis!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="723JoI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“anyone can use it for anything”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6uYU5C"&gt;After launching this first tranche of data, DeepMind plans to keep adding to the store of proteins, which will be maintained by Europe’s flagship life sciences lab, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL). By the end of the year, DeepMind hopes to release predictions for 100 million protein structures, a dataset that will be “transformative for our understanding of how life works,” according to Edith Heard, director general of the EMBL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlVKPJ"&gt;The data will be free in perpetuity for both scientific and commercial researchers, says Hassabis. “Anyone can use it for anything,” the DeepMind CEO noted at a press briefing. “They just need to credit the people involved in the citation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="QYoV0b"&gt;The benefits of protein folding&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="DbHqxJ"&gt;Understanding a protein’s structure is useful for scientists across a range of fields. The information can help design new medicines, synthesize novel enzymes that break down waste materials, and create crops that are resistant to viruses or extreme weather. Already, DeepMind’s protein predictions are being used &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind-alphafold-protein-diseases"&gt;for medical research&lt;/a&gt;, including studying &lt;a href="https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/computational-predictions-of-protein-structures-associated-with-COVID-19"&gt;the workings of SARS-CoV-2&lt;/a&gt;, the virus that causes COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bnGAKr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it will definitely have a huge impact for the scientific community”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gjWQXb"&gt;New data will speed these efforts, but scientists note it will still take a lot of time to turn this information into real-world results. “I don’t think it’s going to be something that changes the way patients are treated within the year, but it will definitely have a huge impact for the scientific community,” Marcelo C. Sousa, a professor at the University of Colorado’s biochemistry department, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38aIMk"&gt;Scientists will have to get used to having such information at their fingertips, says DeepMind senior research scientist Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool. “As a biologist, I can confirm we have no playbook for looking at even 20,000 structures, so this [amount of data] is hugely unexpected,” Tunyasuvunakool told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. “&lt;/em&gt;To be analyzing hundreds of thousands of structures — it’s crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ix7s1l"&gt;Notably, though, DeepMind’s software produces &lt;em&gt;predictions&lt;/em&gt; of protein structures rather than experimentally determined models, which means that in some cases further work will be needed to verify the structure. DeepMind says it spent a lot of time building accuracy metrics into its AlphaFold software, which ranks how confident it is for each prediction. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_8UQ_Dm92B1eSO4NQ58Rb3prFLQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22732723/Proteins.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Example protein structures predicted by AlphaFold&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BXCQ7n"&gt;Predictions of protein structures are still hugely useful, though. Determining a protein’s structure through experimental methods is expensive, time-consuming, and relies on a lot of trial and error. That means even a low-confidence prediction can save scientists years of work by pointing them in the right direction for research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Kpof6"&gt;Helen Walden, a professor of structural biology at the University of Glasgow, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that DeepMind’s data will “significantly ease” research bottlenecks, but that “the laborious, resource-draining work of doing the biochemistry and biological evaluation of, for example, drug functions” will remain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iM9Bq2"&gt;Sousa, who has previously used data from AlphaFold in his work, says for scientists the impact will be felt immediately. “In our collaboration we had with DeepMind, we had a dataset with a protein sample we’d had for 10 years, and we’d never got to the point of developing a model that fit,” he says. “DeepMind agreed to provide us with a structure, and they were able to solve the problem in 15 minutes after we’d been sitting on it for 10 years.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8hMn9y"&gt;Why protein folding is so difficult &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="a3NLUw"&gt;Proteins are constructed from chains of amino acids, which come in 20 different varieties in the human body. As any individual protein can be comprised of hundreds of individual amino acids, each of which can fold and twist in different directions, it means a molecule’s final structure has an incredibly large number of possible configurations. One &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110523080407/http://www-miller.ch.cam.ac.uk/levinthal/levinthal.html"&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; is that the typical protein can be folded in 10^300 ways — that’s a 1 followed by 300 zeroes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pcbicz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Protein folding has been a “grand challenge” of biology for decades&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IxJYVc"&gt;Because proteins are too small to examine with microscopes, scientists have had to indirectly determine their structure using expensive and complicated methods like nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray crystallography. The idea of determining the structure of a protein simply by reading a list of its constituent amino acids has been long theorized but difficult to achieve, leading many to describe it as a “grand challenge” of biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="poxrzP"&gt;In recent years, though, computational methods — particularly those using artificial intelligence — have suggested such analysis is possible. With these techniques, AI systems are trained on datasets of known protein structures and use this information to create their own predictions. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dfU3PBLX7QvyJvFBgNCjnlp0YQk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22732721/Median_Free_Modelling_Accuracy.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DeepMind&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DeepMind’s AlphaFold software has significantly increased the accuracy of computational protein-folding, as shown by its performance in the CASP competition. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9XWGHy"&gt;Many groups have been working on this problem for years, but DeepMind’s deep bench of AI talent and access to computing resources allowed it to accelerate progress dramatically. Last year, the company competed in an international protein-folding competition known as CASP and blew away the competition. Its results &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4"&gt;were so accurate&lt;/a&gt; that computational biologist John Moult, one of CASP’s co-founders, said that “in some sense the problem [of protein folding] is solved.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhMVmC"&gt;DeepMind’s AlphaFold program has been upgraded since last year’s CASP competition and is now 16 times faster. “We can fold an average protein in a matter of minutes, most cases seconds,” says Hassabis. The company also &lt;a href="https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/alphafold"&gt;released the underlying code&lt;/a&gt; for AlphaFold last week as open-source, allowing others to build on its work in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LpjXe"&gt;Liam McGuffin, a professor at Reading University who developed some of the UK’s leading protein-folding software, praised the technical brilliance of AlphaFold, but also noted that the program’s success relied on decades of prior research and public data. “DeepMind has vast resources to keep this database up to date and they are better placed to do this than any single academic group,” McGuffin told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I think academics would have got there in the end, but it would have been slower because we’re not as well resourced.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="M5Bl9c"&gt;Why does DeepMind care? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dmKdXE"&gt;Many scientists &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke to noted the generosity of DeepMind in releasing this data for free. After all, the lab is owned by Google-parent Alphabet, which has been pouring huge amounts of resources into commercial healthcare projects. DeepMind itself &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/17/deepmind-lost-649-million-and-alphabet-waived-a-1point5-billion-debt-.html#:~:text=Tech-,DeepMind%20A.I.,billion%20debt%20waived%20by%20Alphabet&amp;amp;text=The%20London%2Dheadquartered%20AI%20lab,U.K.'s%20Companies%20House%20registry."&gt;loses a lot of money&lt;/a&gt; each year, and there have been &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/deep-confusion-tensions-lingered-within-google-over-deepmind"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-unit-deepmind-triedand-failedto-win-ai-autonomy-from-parent-11621592951"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2019/03/01/deepmind-and-google-the-battle-to-control-artificial-intelligence"&gt;of tensions&lt;/a&gt; between the company and its parent firm over issues like research autonomy and commercial viability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAUHyQ"&gt;Hassabis, though, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company always planned to make this information freely available, and that doing so is a fulfillment of DeepMind’s founding ethos. He stresses that DeepMind’s work is used in lots of places at Google — “almost anything you use, there’s some of our technology that’s part of that under the hood” — but that the company’s primary goal has always been fundamental research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7kd7ns"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s many ways value can be attained.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lV8aar"&gt;“The agreement when we got acquired is that we are here primarily to advance the state of AGI and AI technologies and then use that to accelerate scientific breakthroughs,” says Hassabis. “[Alphabet] has plenty of divisions focused on making money,” he adds, noting that DeepMind’s focus on research “brings all sorts of benefits, in terms of prestige and goodwill for the scientific community. There’s many ways value can be attained.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="il68TS"&gt;Hassabis predicts that AlphaFold is a sign of things to come — a project that shows the huge potential of artificial intelligence to handle messy problems like human biology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDuzQ5"&gt;“I think we’re at a really exciting moment,” he says. “In the next decade, we, and others in the AI field, are hoping to produce amazing breakthroughs that will genuinely accelerate solutions to the really big problems we have here on Earth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cfGwWs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Framework Laptop review: pick your ports</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The value of this laptop hinges on future support&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="B2qeVe"&gt;There are a lot of 13-inch and 14-inch laptops out there, but very few offer much in the way of user-upgradability. Framework, a San Francisco-based startup, sees an opening in the market there. The new 13.5-inch Framework laptop allows customers to upgrade and replace not only internal parts (RAM, battery, storage), but also external components (the keyboard, bezels, and ports).   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sm9p18"&gt;If you’re very particular about your specs, you can also order a &lt;a href="https://frame.work/products/laptop-diy-edition/configuration/edit"&gt;“DIY edition,”&lt;/a&gt; including parts of your choosing, and assemble the laptop yourself. I suspect most people will go for one of the three pre-built systems that Framework has on offer, which can then be tweaked as needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0iqE6"&gt;Outside of its customizability, the Framework is a fairly standard productivity ultraportable. It’s a bit smaller than an M1 MacBook Pro, at 2.87 pounds and 0.62 inches thick. The chassis incorporates recycled materials. There’s a decently bright 3:2 display (with no touch option as of now), and a usable keyboard and touchpad. You’ll get decent performance from Intel’s 11th Gen processors, and okay (but unexciting) battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMGJrD"&gt;In other words, upgradability is the reason to buy the Framework laptop — there’s not much else to discuss here. And while it looks like a good package from where I’m standing, much of its value proposition hinges on whether the company lives up to its promise of supporting the device for years to come.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SG3LDX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10662592"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ROAgiV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10662603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cqb6QB"&gt;The pre-built systems should cover most use cases. I tested the base model, which costs $999 and includes a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of memory, 256GB of storage, and Windows 10 Home. The $1,399 Performance model has a Core i7-1165G7, 16GB of memory, and 512GB of storage, while the Professional model asks $1,999 for a Core i7-1185G7, 32GB of memory, and 1TB of storage, as well as Windows 10 Pro and vPro. Note that the latter two models aren’t shipping until August, while the base model won’t arrive until September — you can preorder all three now with a $100 deposit. DIY kits start at $749, and pricing varies based on the components you select. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3k9m7"&gt;The most unique benefit the Framework offers is the opportunity to customize ports. The chassis has four bays, but you can order as many expansion cards as you want, including USB-C, USB-A, microSD, HDMI, DP, and storage expansion (250GB or 1TB). Framework says more options are coming. I stuck in a USB-A, a USB-C, an HDMI, and some extra storage, and it was a very easy task. The cards are essentially dongles — they slide right in, and you can swap them while the computer’s on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8V0fm"&gt;I was also able to swap out the black bezels on the model I was sent for some white ones. This took about 10 seconds. The top and side bezels attach to the chassis via magnets, and there are strips of adhesive along the bottom edge, so it’s just a matter of pulling one frame off and sticking another on — you can do it while the laptop’s running. (Framework claims that the adhesive is reusable, so you can swap bezels back and forth.) You can also replace the keyboard, touchpad, and fingerprint reader, both individually and as a sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Framework laptop open, outdoors, on a red tablecloth with a garden and the wall of a house in the background. The screen displays a mountainous landscape." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KSauiRpoU5t3CDpg9LxSLUxHn9c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22728997/mchin_210720_4671_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the black bezel — you can put white ones on, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ml9HoN"&gt;Then, you can pop the keyboard off to tinker with the internal components — &lt;a href="https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Mainboard+Replacement/79?lang=en"&gt;even the mainboard&lt;/a&gt;. This is easy enough to do, but one annoyance is that the chassis is held together with T5 screws, which won’t play nice with a standard Phillips screwdriver. (Framework says this is because the T5 avoids stripping issues that can come up with Phillips screws.) If you don’t already have a kit with a T5 screwdriver, you’d better make sure you don’t lose the tool that Framework sends with the laptop (and it’s small — I’m sure I would lose it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gkqn6d"&gt;In theory, all of these replacement parts will be available on a centralized marketplace that’s also open to third-party manufacturers. Each of the various components has a QR code on it that, when scanned, will pull up a purchase page for the part’s replacement. This marketplace isn’t live yet, so I can’t speak to what’s actually going to be available there — Framework says it’ll be up in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PwBaK"&gt;That sort of underscores a theme of this review, which is that so much of this laptop’s value hinges on what its promised ecosystem and support network will actually look like. There are &lt;a href="https://guides.frame.work/c/Framework_Laptop"&gt;a few guides&lt;/a&gt; on Framework’s website — for setting up the pre-builts and the DIY kit, replacing the bezels, replacing the keyboard, and replacing the mainboard — but some processes that people will likely want are still missing as of this writing. There’s no guide to replacing the memory, for example (you have to find that in the mainboard replacement guide). Framework says that’s coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOZ9vQ"&gt;I also haven’t been able to find a list of supported parts, or a list of each screw and its size, which could make losing a screw a nightmare. Framework says the former list is coming soon, and that it will add screw specifications to its repair guides “as we go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Framework laptop closed, upside-down on a red tablecloth. One of its four port slots is empty. An expansion card sits beside the empty port, upside-down with its QR code facing up." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KnykEo3ghY3Oku_MJOtIPZwrA4c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729001/mchin_210720_4671_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a USB-C inside each enclosure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The fingerprint sensor on the Framework Laptop on top of a red tablecloth." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/47-q9kl94YEQ38U18o7MWDqGS1s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729000/mchin_210720_4671_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fingerprint sensor is in a convenient location,  but it was a bit finicky and sometimes had trouble reading my finger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="UTKGrA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10662627"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="48LzQb"&gt;The Framework’s build quality is a bit below that of top contenders at this price point; you’re paying a bit extra for the Framework’s futureproofing promise. The whole thing has a plasticky feel — it’s not cheap, but it feels closer to Acer Aspire than it is to Dell XPS. And there’s some flimsiness. Specifically, there’s a bit of flex in the keyboard and a whole bunch in the screen. (I was actually worried about snapping the latter and didn’t torque it as much as I could have.) And while I was never worried that the magnetic bezels were going to fall off, they’re not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; hard to pull loose, and I could definitely see them snagging on things or accumulating debris underneath. I do like that recycled material is being used here, including 50 percent PCR aluminum in the enclosure, “an average of” 30 percent PCR plastics, and 80 percent PCR packaging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bw9l7i"&gt;Another thing to call out is the 3:2 display. It’s one of the few parts of this laptop that can’t currently be upgraded; you’re stuck with a 2256 x 1504 non-touch panel. It reached 391 nits of brightness in my testing, which is quite good, and generally delivered a sharp picture — and the 3:2 aspect ratio provides a lot more vertical space than the 16:9 panels you’ll find on many 13-inch notebooks. It is quite glossy, though, and kicks back a bit more glare than I’m used to seeing from panels in this price range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Framework Laptop in a garden on top of a red tablecloth, facing away from the camera, open, angled to the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rysXDO637k5qfi2B2gJ4iy-WXkc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729002/mchin_210720_4671_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See? It looks fine. Like, it’s fine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RH1yzD"&gt;I’ll run through the rest of the laptop; the takeaway again is that reparability is the Framework’s only real calling card. The keyboard is nicely backlit, with almost no bleed, and comfortable with 1.5mm of travel. There’s a 1080p webcam with a physical shutter — its picture is an improvement over traditional 720p laptop fare. But neither is so astonishingly good that I’d buy the Framework just to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WoaxJl"&gt;Performance-wise, the base model was fine. The bottom sometimes got toasty under my load of around a dozen Chrome tabs and apps, but it was never uncomfortable to use on my lap. Fans were occasionally audible, but mostly silent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uqkl44"&gt;All three processor options come with Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics — there’s no GPU option. The integrated GPU isn’t enough to run highly demanding games, but it should do a good job with &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; and such. I got some lightweight photo editing done with no problem, though it wasn’t quite as snappy as I’ve seen on Core i7 machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="scypTb"&gt;Battery life was similarly acceptable but unremarkable. I averaged around six hours and 12 minutes of continuous work use with the screen at 200 nits of brightness. You can get much more from these specs: we saw seven to eight hours from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309005/microsoft-surface-pro-7-plus-review"&gt;Surface Pro 7 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Pro-7-for-Business%2F8P43N3K93409%3Fcrosssellid%3Dfbt-w1b%26selectedColor%3D86888a%26preview%3D%26previewModes%3D%26%3Focid%3DAID2200057_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%28ir__hcqj2eimmgkfqklvhybzgeuzq32xuarqlpwmp0xd00%29%287593%29%281243925%29%28nOD_rLJHOac-EjIVgOwsJ97kSdtLFdWT_A%29%28%29%26ranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DnOD%252frLJHOac%26ranSiteID%3DnOD_rLJHOac-EjIVgOwsJ97kSdtLFdWT_A%26epi%3DnOD_rLJHOac-EjIVgOwsJ97kSdtLFdWT_A%26irgwc%3D1%26irclickid%3D_hcqj2eimmgkfqklvhybzgeuzq32xuarqlpwmp0xd00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 more&lt;/a&gt; for a Core i5 model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Rtg0ca"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is a laptop that DIY computing enthusiasts have been waiting for&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="47HHVN"&gt;First and foremost: it’s admirable what Framework is trying to do. This is a laptop that DIY computing enthusiasts have been waiting for. And there’s certainly a lot here that’s promising. The ports and bezels are easy to swap, even if you’ve never upgraded a computer before — and that’s a legitimately unique feature. Plus, the fact that RAM isn’t soldered, in a chassis of this size, is an upgradability victory in itself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42F5Ya"&gt;But this community has been burned before. From &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21051879/intel-pc-nuc-9-extreme-ghost-canyon-element-hands-on-teardown-ces-2020"&gt;Intel’s Ghost Canyon NUC&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited"&gt;Alienware’s Area-51m&lt;/a&gt;, the virtual graveyard is littered with promised modular computers that never panned out because the company stopped making hardware for them. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522265/dell-alienware-area-51m-r1-gaming-laptop-upgradeability-unprecedented-lawsuit-claims-misleading"&gt;Dell was recently sued&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly promising that the Area-51m R1 could be upgraded to future Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs, which did not end up being the case. This kind of device is hard to make and even harder to support over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lurx4B"&gt;I asked Framework how many generations of Intel CPUs it was committed to supporting, and the company didn’t give a direct answer. A spokesperson stated, “We’ve been evaluating upcoming silicon roadmaps, and don’t see anything that makes us concerned about compatibility with our current chassis. We will continue to support the existing chassis for the forseeable future.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d71YCE"&gt;Sure. But until I actually have an Alder Lake mainboard in my hands, I’m hesitant to get too excited. Whether the Framework is a good purchase will depend on whether the company is actually able to forge ahead with this chassis — how long it continues releasing new modules, and whether it’s able to build a robust library of supporting materials. It’ll also depend on how good the promised marketplace is, and how robust the component selections are. Those are the real benefits of this device. Without them, the Framework is mostly an unremarkable laptop with lots of QR codes. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pebble’s hardware buttons couldn’t save smartwatches from touchscreens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q1nrwID6Tv6YfldnTeSfDbVKg0c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617057/akrales_210716_4656_0050.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="86pJHa"&gt;Touchscreens have taken over smartwatches. But it didn’t have to be this way. For a few short years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/28/3924904/pebble-smartwatch-review"&gt;Pebble showed a different way forward&lt;/a&gt; with a purely hardware-based user interface that reigned supreme, until it — like the rest of the company — was left behind by the rest of the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2mU9x"&gt;Virtually every smartwatch today relies on a mixture of touchscreens and hardware buttons — from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; and its digital crown to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368752/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Samsung’s rotating bezels&lt;/a&gt;. Even Fitbit’s most basic trackers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21199567/fitbit-charge-4-tracker-gps-nfc-spotify-sp02-announcement-price"&gt;like the Charge&lt;/a&gt; feature touchscreens to supplement physical buttons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HH1Koj"&gt;But Pebble held out. From the time it helped pioneer the concept of modern smartwatches in 2013 to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/7/13867158/fitbit-buys-pebble-smartwatch-acquisition-deal"&gt;eventual purchase and shutdown in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, the Pebble could only ever be controlled by pushing physical buttons. It traded more advanced functionality in the long run for a more user-friendly experience. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DQjkja7_SnFYkQrmSohLPXzgdJg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726445/akrales_210716_4656_0040.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AEAjs6"&gt;It’s not even that the buttons on the Pebble were particularly enjoyable to use, mechanically speaking. The original Kickstarter-famous model’s buttons were plastic-y and mushy, with a tiny center button that could be easily lost between the other two. And while the final Pebble watch — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/27/8661863/pebble-time-review-wearable-smartwatch"&gt;the more polished Pebble Time&lt;/a&gt; — would improve on things with clicker buttons and a refined design, it’s hard to laud its buttons as anything beyond “functional.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="asnLgJ"&gt;Overall, though, the Pebble’s design made it a joy to use. I fondly remember dismissing errant notifications with a quick button press and flipping through songs on a crowded bus or while skiing and wearing bulky gloves. The relatively simple nature of its input method also meant that the Pebble’s software was similarly streamlined, cutting down cumbersome menus in favor of simpler displays. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cDkIhrl64NH_fLXnoaCshPz-ToA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726442/akrales_210716_4656_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MDJgGs"&gt;The Pebble’s idea of how smartwatches should be controlled was rooted in how analog ones worked. You didn’t want to block the dial because the whole point of a watch is to be able to see the time. It’s a fact that makes touchscreen smartwatches an inherent paradox: watches are nicer to wear when they’re smaller, but touchscreens are nicer to use when they’re bigger. But the Pebble sidestepped that entirely by taking after a regular watch and only using case-mounted buttons to control it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4bgRS2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tiny touchscreens aren’t particularly enjoyable to use&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9Y3MPT"&gt;It’s undeniable that those tiny touchscreens aren’t particularly enjoyable to use. Apple spent years trying to figure out how to make text input work on the Apple Watch, simply because the postage stamp-sized display just doesn’t work well for fitting an entire keyboard. And of course, there’s the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nosy-apple-watch-users-discover-another-way-to-go-hands-free-1451077454"&gt;infamous “nose tap” maneuver&lt;/a&gt; for when you desperately need to dismiss a notification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6EV8E"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/27/16936922/pebble-smartwatch-hardware-button-physical-controls"&gt;Pebble’s simple hardware buttons&lt;/a&gt; offered new, useful ways to interact with my phone on the go. Conversely, an Apple Watch is just as difficult as a phone to use when my hands are wet or while wearing gloves. The benefit is just a screen that’s slightly easier to see since it’s on my wrist, not in my pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjBtQn"&gt;This really gets to the heart of the shift away from buttons: smartwatches have grown in scope. Today’s watches aren’t companion gadgets to smartphones; they’re full-blown miniature smartphones in their own right, complete with cellular data, GPS, and app stores. And while that may be a good thing for smartwatches as viable hardware platforms, it does mean that some things — like exclusively physical buttons or the entire Pebble platform — will inevitably get left behind. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rF6WAHeo0GvC4YhVowzS1xluMqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726444/akrales_210716_4656_0036.jpg"&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz says it will go all-electric in 2030, but with a major caveat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mercedes-Benz AG Auto Showroom Ahead of Earnings" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P2I82PYCwGH_2hVIUiQVMGUpMgk=/0x0:6397x4265/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617022/1234068952.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="soXUpq"&gt;Mercedes-Benz says it will go all-electric by 2030, but with conditions. The German automaker says it will only sell electric vehicles “where market conditions allow,” implying that Mercedes may still sell gas-powered vehicles after 2030 in countries that lack consumer demand for EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNdLjC"&gt;The company made the announcement during an EV strategy update Thursday morning, the latest in a series of automaker events to declare a major pivot to electric powertrains. But while other car companies have similarly promised to shift to all-EV production, Mercedes is notable by hedging its promise on external factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zpxrU6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Other major automakers have included similar caveats&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OCKtiK"&gt;Other major automakers have included similar caveats. GM, for example, said it would be carbon neutral by 2040, but wouldn’t commit to ending the sale of gas-powered vehicles by that date. And GM’s top executives described the goal of eliminating tailpipe emissions from its new light-duty vehicles by 2035 as “an aspiration” rather than a certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBtn4w"&gt;Still, Mercedes says it will commit €40 billion ($47 billion) to the electrification of its lineup by 2030. “We are convinced, we can do it with strong profitability, and we believe that focus on electrical is the right way to build a successful future and to enhance the value of Mercedes Benz,” said Ola Källenius, chairman of Daimler and head of Mercedes-Benz.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4HRS7H-W2SBiNMRR57jMrb2RqoQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733021/eqxx.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lzgcwf"&gt;From 2022, Mercedes says it will offer a fully electric model in every segment, and from 2025 every model sold will be offered with a pure-electric model. Mercedes will also launch three bespoke new EV architectures for use across its entire portfolio: MB.EA for midsized and large passenger cars, AMG.EA for performance models, and Van.EA for commercial vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2ZJLRi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company hinted at some of the new products that will be coming soon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3kCBO0"&gt;The company hinted at some of the new products that will be coming soon, including electric versions of Mercedes-Benz’s G-class wagons and AMG high-performance vehicles. Executives also teased the forthcoming long-range, high-powered Vision EQXX concept car, which it will reveal next year. With the EQXX, Mercedes is targeting 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) of range, and a consumption rating of more than six miles per kWh, which would make it one of the longest range EVs on the market if achieved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2A5hB3"&gt;With regard to its supply chain, the company will build eight gigafactory battery plants, including one in the US, with the aim of building out its battery cell capacity to 200GWh. And Mercedes announced the acquisition of Yasa, a UK-based EV motor manufacturer, to help speed up its production plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1K3TJ"&gt;Mercedes isn’t alone in charting out its all-electric (or mostly all-electric) future. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287284/ford-electric-vehicles-ev-europe-2030"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568625/stellantis-jeep-dodge-ev-day-shark-drone-autonomous"&gt;Stellantis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308851/volvo-electric-cars-only-2030-online-sales"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462504/bmw-i4-ev-price-specs-photos-release-date"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; have made similar promises about transitioning to mostly selling EVs. These announcements come as major governments push to put restrictions on the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles. The European Union, China, and California have all said they would ban the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus’ capable Nord 2 made better by midrange price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F2W5lNlzw3BMBuy6VTfnQgOJ3hQ=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617009/Many_OnePlus_Nord_2s_having_fun.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qwsZhO"&gt;OnePlus has officially announced the Nord 2, a successor to last year’s excellent midrange debut. Like the original, the Nord 2 is releasing in Europe and India, and there are no plans for a US release. In Europe and the UK, prices start at £399 / €399 for its 8GB RAM / 128GB storage model, rising to £469 / €499 for a 12GB RAM / 256GB version (about $550 and $645, respectively). In the UK, preorders open on July 22nd from OnePlus.com and Amazon, and the phone goes on general sale on July 28th. You can read my first-hand impressions of the phone over in my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22350856"&gt;full review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="doHCw5"&gt;OnePlus being OnePlus means we already had a good idea of what to expect from the Nord 2 before today. But now we know that in addition to its 50-megapixel main camera, the phone also has an 8-megapixel ultrawide and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor on its rear. Round the front, there’s a 32-megapixel selfie camera, although there’s no secondary ultrawide selfie camera like last year’s Nord. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jI19GFzBN9gvbX1OxAD4l8E1w2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22731129/Nord_2_Haze_Blue_07.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nord 2 in blue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hC6Eax"&gt;Like the original Nord, the Nord 2 has a 1080p 90Hz OLED display, but on this year’s model it’s ever so slightly smaller at 6.43-inches (compared to 6.44-inches). In Europe, the phone is available in blue and gray, while an additional green color will be available in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukdGY2"&gt;Internally, alongside the &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/nord-2-and-its-mediatek-dimensity-1200-ai-chipset-your-questions-answered.1464619/"&gt;MediaTek 1200-AI processor&lt;/a&gt; that OnePlus revealed earlier this month, in Europe the Nord 2 will be available with either 8 or 12GB of RAM, paired with 128 or 256GB of storage, respectively. There’s also a (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnePlus_IN/status/1417490218521964552"&gt;pre-announced)&lt;/a&gt; 4,500mAh battery with Warp Charge 65 fast charging, which OnePlus claims should be able to charge the phone to 100 percent in under 35 minutes. It’s 5G-compatible (sub-6GHz only) and includes dual-SIM support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGUOFV"&gt;The Nord 2 runs OxygenOS 11.3 out of the box, which &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-nord-2-oliver-zhang-interaction/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers &lt;/em&gt;has reported&lt;/a&gt; is the first version of the software to reflect the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;merger with Oppo’s ColorOS&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus is promising two years of Android updates and three years of security updates for the Nord 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FU1goy"&gt;As well as the Nord 2, OnePlus also used its event today to announce a new pair of true wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22351408"&gt;OnePlus Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which go on sale next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1d7lX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qihfpj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Buds Pro announced, coming September 1st for $150</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y7PwfH"&gt;OnePlus today announced its third set of true wireless earbuds, the OnePlus Buds Pro. Dubbed as the company’s “most advanced listening device” yet, the new earbuds are debuting alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22350856"&gt;Nord 2 smartphone&lt;/a&gt;. They go on sale in the US and Canada on September 1st for $149.99 and come in either white or matte black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xzx4P2"&gt;The shape of the earbuds is rather AirPods Pro-esque, though OnePlus has gone with a shiny chrome stem that looks quite eye-catching. After last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435637/us-cbp-counterfeit-airpods-oneplus-buds-mixup"&gt;awkward situation at the US border&lt;/a&gt;, the company has good reason to go for a more visually distinct design. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tboq5ZvimntBiEBnivFoqAxkkJk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22732933/Case_and_earbuds_white.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="redoTC"&gt;The OnePlus Buds Pro feature what the company describes as “smart adaptive noise cancellation,” which means they’ll automatically adjust how much NC is applied based on your environment. “Each earbud features a three-mic setup that actively filters out noise levels of up to 40dB as needed in order to deliver a much more comfortable and tailored listening experience, as opposed to conventional ANC systems with fixed levels of noise cancellation,” the company wrote in its press release. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E-6etDIHcH3TE3cqiXP7EQ2W5ew=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22732934/Lifestyle_matte_black_case_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ioDKJZ"&gt;OnePlus is pointing to endurance as another strength, with the OnePlus Buds Pro able to stretch to a total of 38 hours of listening time when you include case recharges. On a single charge, you’ll get five hours with ANC enabled and seven hours with it off. Those are both more average numbers that are in line with the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QxUQO4"&gt;The company’s Warp Charge wired charging is supported; a 10-minute recharge is supposedly good for 10 hours of listening, and you can also juice them up on any Qi wireless charger. The earbuds feature Bluetooth 5.2 and carry over the low-latency gaming mode from the company’s previous buds. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Nord 2 review: focused on the essentials</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;From its screen to its fast-charging, the Nord 2 has it where it counts&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QP7RPd"&gt;From the start, OnePlus has positioned its midrange lineup of Nord phones as a less expensive, entirely separate lineup to its flagship devices. But with the Nord 2, which comes as a direct successor to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;original Nord&lt;/a&gt; released last year, the line between the two seems blurrier than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jd6ENN"&gt;While the original Nord had its own character, such as a unique design and exclusive features like an ultrawide selfie camera, the Nord 2 feels more like a stripped down flagship. It’s got a very similar camera bump to the OnePlus 9, for example, and although the specific sensors are different, its cameras fill the same functions. But all the core essentials are still there: a vibrant high refresh rate screen, good battery life, and easy-to-use software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdYBz8"&gt;A more affordable, non-flagship starting price means it’s hard to argue with these tradeoffs. The OnePlus Nord 2 costs £399 / €399 for its 8GB RAM / 128GB storage model, rising to £469 / €499 for a 12GB RAM / 256GB storage version. (OnePlus isn’t selling the Nord 2 in the US, but those prices roughly convert to $470 and $588, respectively.) For this review, I’ve been using the 12GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kczner"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10662161"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uOChn3"&gt;With its 6.43-inch display, the OnePlus Nord 2 is a hair smaller than the OnePlus 9 (which has a 6.55-inch display), but otherwise this is a very similar-looking device. There’s a rectangular camera bump on the back containing three cameras, a hole-punch cutout for the selfie camera on the top left on the front, and a USB-C port on the bottom (but sadly, no headphone jack). Biometrics are handled via a snappy in-display fingerprint sensor, and there’s a physical slider to switch between silent and vibrate on the right of the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmod5R"&gt;You’ll find Gorilla Glass on the front and back of the phone, but since its frame is plastic you might want to use a case if you’re particularly worried about the frame’s finish wearing off. Otherwise I didn’t notice the phone flexing any more than a typical aluminum framed phone. Like the original Nord, the Nord 2 doesn’t have an official IP rating for dust or water resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2F0vrl"&gt;Oh, and this is also a 5G phone: you get sub-6GHz support, but no mmWave. Given the latter high-speed, low-range network type has &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/5G-mmWave-connectivity-is-finally-making-its-way-Europe-wide-with-promises-of-Gigabit-speeds.548139.0.html"&gt;barely started to roll out&lt;/a&gt; in the Nord 2’s release markets, it’s not something many people are likely to miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neMCas"&gt;The most notable sign that this isn’t a flagship OnePlus device is its processor, which is a MediaTek Dimensity 1200-AI rather than one of Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 888 chips. Considering MediaTek is a brand more commonly associated with budget devices, I was apprehensive about its inclusion on the OnePlus Nord 2, but I came away pleasantly surprised by performance overall. Yes, you miss out on Qualcomm-exclusive features like high quality AptX Bluetooth audio, but otherwise switching between apps was hitch-free, and the processors’ GPU happily made the most of the phone’s smooth 90Hz display while scrolling through even a relatively graphically intensive Twitter feed (which, in comparison, stuttered on the original Nord). I noticed the phone being slightly slow to wake up on a couple of occasions, however, but overall performance was on a par with, if not slightly better than the original Nord in everyday usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ipx1ZhE-EHjm4X0xIzPN5Ol4yPA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726845/jporter_210719_4669_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squint, and you could believe the Nord 2 is a OnePlus 9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v1w9x3"&gt;The Nord 2’s 1080p screen is generally hard to fault. It does everything well that you’d expect from an OLED display. Whites are crisp and bright, colors are punchy, and blacks are, well, black. Its 90Hz refresh rate is technically a step down from the 120Hz panel that you’ll find on phones like the OnePlus 9, but in practice I didn’t notice a downgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xztwe"&gt;As a bonus, this time around the Nord 2’s screen is actually flanked by stereo speakers (one downward-firing and one from the phone’s earpiece), as opposed to the original Nord, which only ever played media audio out of its downward-facing speaker. You’ll still want to use headphones for proper listening, but the speakers’ volume meant I had no trouble hearing podcasts played out of the phone’s speakers while cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOcGqr"&gt;I got a little under five hours of screen-on time out of the Nord 2’s 4,500mAh battery, easily enough to last through a full day with a little to spare. But I was more impressed by the inclusion of Warp Charge 65 fast-charging here. When charging from zero, I hit 89 percent after a half hour, and 99 percent after 35 minutes, which felt remarkably quick. You have to use one of OnePlus’ proprietary chargers and the cable it comes with to get these speeds, but at least you get both in the box. The Nord 2 doesn’t support wireless charging, which isn’t entirely surprising at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kjLKKz7Xz8c1jP-lSq8gSOGTn9w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726843/jporter_210719_4669_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a small hole-punch for the 32MP selfie camera on the top left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rSF9yoYjvHTO6az1G4XJDEhrq0A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726846/jporter_210719_4669_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A physical slider lets you put the phone into silent mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SLy64y"&gt;The Nord 2 runs on OxygenOS 11.3 out of the box, which is notable for being the first version of OnePlus’ software to reflect its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;integration with Oppo’s ColorOS&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-nord-2-oliver-zhang-interaction/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. But despite the under-the-hood changes, the phone didn’t feel radically different in everyday usage. I found a few changes in the Settings menu, though, where several controls have been renamed and shifted positions slightly. It meant I struggled initially to find OnePlus’ standard screen calibration options, for example, but they’re still there in a slightly different sub-menu. It bodes well for the future of OxygenOS, which continues to be an uncluttered take on Android that I mostly appreciate for its ability to keep out of my way. In terms of ongoing support, the company promises you get two major Android updates and three years of security updates with the Nord 2, though it declined to say how regular these security updates would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GZmTk"&gt;Around the back of the Nord 2, you’ll find three rear cameras. Its main camera uses a 50-megapixel Sony IMX766 sensor (which OnePlus previously used for the ultrawide cameras on the 9 and the 9 Pro), which is flanked by a much lower-resolution pair of cameras: an 8-megapixel ultrawide and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor of questionable utility. On its front there’s a 32-megapixel selfie camera, but it’s not paired with an ultrawide camera this time around, which makes me, personally, a little sad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NmRMZC"&gt;I generally liked the shots I got out of the Nord 2, and OIS on the main sensor means it’s easy to get consistently sharp shots every time you hit the shutter button. That said, they definitely have OnePlus’ typically punchy look, which prioritizes vibrancy over accuracy. It’s most obvious when you look at landscape photograph shots: I can promise you the grass in the photographs below was much less green and much more yellow in reality. Edges also tend to have a slightly over-sharpened look to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A9Uh0epNtadAvXUQRGIFHtFOFqA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726847/jporter_210719_4669_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nord 2 includes three rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eL8cN1"&gt;At night, the Nord 2’s standard photography mode automatically takes photos that are almost as bright as the Google Pixel’s Night Sight mode, and if you head into the phone’s dedicated Nightscape Ultra mode you get photos that almost look like they were taken in daylight were it not for how washed out they appear. In its standard photography mode, this brightness hides the fact that low-light shots aren’t particularly detailed, like in the photo below of an apartment block where the dividing lines between wooden slats have been smoothed out of existence. You’ll be able to make out your friends if you photograph them in a dimly lit bar, but their skin might come out looking a little smooth and plasticine-y in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GtA5eV"&gt;Oddly, this vibrancy doesn’t carry over to the ultrawide camera, where shots seem much more muted and arguably more color-accurate in comparison. There’s also less detail thanks to the lower resolution sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fvkvFT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10662184"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XTa70A"&gt;When it comes to people, the OnePlus Nord 2 can’t seem to resist the temptation to brighten skin tones, raise shadows, and make everything look a little flat. Even with its beautification mode turned off, I still got the impression the Nord 2 was avoiding showing me every last wrinkle and pore in my face. To its credit, the effect means you can barely tell I took the shots below while sweating my way through a horrid UK heatwave, but I think the overall photographs end up looking blander as a result. It’s a similar story with the phone’s selfie camera, although this is partially offset by the extra detail from defaulting to 32-megapixel shots, while the main camera on the rear defaults to around 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWQLwq"&gt;OnePlus’ continued insistence on including low-resolution monochrome sensors on the backs of its phones is baffling. The black and white photography option that makes use of it is still buried all the way at the end of the camera’s list of filters, and even once you go to the trouble of using it, I’ve yet to notice any difference it makes compared to a software-based filter. You can even cover up the monochrome sensor on the Nord 2 while you take a black and white shot, and the phone seemingly continues on unperturbed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obmHyO"&gt;But complaints about the easily ignorable monochrome sensor aside, I think the Nord 2’s cameras get a lot of things right if you share its preference for bright, colorful shots. OIS on the main camera means it’s relatively easy to get crisp photographs, and you could do a lot worse at this price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HCghE_7NJ6ZU06bqzumd_Y2P1eM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726844/jporter_210719_4669_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An in-display fingerprint scanner handles biometric security.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/00TZ0XJP6DMvIZ2zXNIBGbc-8j8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726848/jporter_210719_4669_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;USB-C, but no headphone jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Q86Vsv"&gt;A month ago, OnePlus announced the so-called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22543244/oneplus-nord-ce-5g-review"&gt;Nord CE&lt;/a&gt; or “Core Edition,” an affordable phone which was pitched as offering the essential features of a OnePlus smartphone without any extra bloat. But the more I use the OnePlus Nord 2, the more I think that this is the phone that fits that description much more accurately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCZ2uz"&gt;From its screen, to its cameras, its processor, and its software, the Nord 2 feels like a flagship phone stripped of any unnecessary features. There’s no Hasselblad-branded cameras, just a reasonably specced set of sensors. There’s no flagship Qualcomm chipset, but instead you get a processor that has no trouble handling the day-to-day duties of a modern smartphone. No wireless charging, but fast wired charging that more than makes up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="dIZhB2"&gt;All of this adds up to a compelling device if you’re looking to spend between £400 and £500 and you’re in a market when OnePlus is actually selling the Nord 2. A stripped down flagship it may be, but it’s hard to argue with what’s been left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="KaXPyQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10662155"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>How to download your TikTok video watch history</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jsbzEsDlyYWZ6DY20Ddl0mlOWw4=/13x0:1488x983/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69616867/microsoft_tiktok.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Based on wallpaper by Michael Gillett (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://wallpaperhub.app/wallpapers/7509" target="_blank"&gt;Wallpaper Hub&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fy15K1"&gt;I have a very bad habit of accidentally touching my phone’s screen, which often results in going a page forward or back in the book I’m reading or leaving the YouTube video I’m watching — or going to a different TikTok video than the one I was just enjoying. In addition, if I have to take a phone call or answer a Slack message, I can lose track of where I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSyJX1"&gt;Usually, this is an easy fix: I can just back up to the previous page of the book or check out my YouTube history. But unfortunately, it’s not as easy with TikTok, which doesn’t have a simple way to check the history of which videos you’ve watched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETsScY"&gt;For example, the day I started writing this, I accidentally swiped out of videos I was watching at least two times and was unable to immediately get back to them. And because I couldn’t remember the name of the creator, I was essentially sunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmOP08"&gt;What to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHZxnP"&gt;Well, if I had been smart quickly enough to “like” the video — or follow the creator — it would have been easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="DrUdpb"&gt;Tap on the “Me” icon in the lower-right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fZ0XUP"&gt;If you “liked” the video, tap on the heart icon below your profile to see thumbnails of all the videos you’ve liked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zlUZIX"&gt;If you’re following the creator, tap on the “Following” link just below your username to see a list of all the creators you’re following. Then tap on that person to see thumbnails of all their videos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on the heart to see your “liked” videos. Or tap on the “Following” link on top..." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xzbkgnYy34MPrftun99tE7q29T8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22728340/Screenshot_20210720_102425.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on the heart to see your “liked” videos. Or tap on the “Following” link on top...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="...to see all the creators that you are following." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HvUb77UKeoMjvuGZpNAg6gQ1_B0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22728338/Screenshot_20210720_102517.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...to see all the creators you are following.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2d7dC"&gt;However, if you haven’t yet liked the video or are not following that creator — something that often happens to me — then the best way to find your watch history is to download it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="pE0GBX"&gt;Go to your profile page (by tapping the “Me” icon in the bottom right), and tap on the three lines in the upper-right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zbZdk6"&gt;Select “Privacy” &amp;gt; “Personalization and data” &amp;gt; “Download your data”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PRZqzr"&gt;Under the “Request data” tab, select whether you want to download your data as a TXT file or a JSON file, and tap “Processing request”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Download your data” to get a copy of your watch history." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PM9e4RizFJmbUTb7RZypmqEsIaU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22728270/Screenshot_20210719_133127.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Download your data” to get a copy of your watch history.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can get your data in the TXT or JSON format." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XTqqGYFaFk_6lH9V_V5XLQZzbGc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22728271/Screenshot_20210719_133203.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can get your data in the TXT or JSON format.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mTkp3X"&gt;And wait. Unfortunately, this isn’t a fast process; it could be at least 24 hours — or more — before your data is made available. Until then, if you go to the “Download data” tab, you’ll see a grayed-out “Pending” button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="focyBO"&gt;It took about three days before I saw the red “Download” button appear under the “Download data” tab. It took me to the web version of TikTok, where I had to sign in again and was finally able to download a zipped file of my data. When I unzipped the file, I went to the Activity folder, where I found text files for Favorite Effects, Favorites Sounds, and so on — along with one labeled “Video Browsing.” It was there I finally found a list of dates and URLs for the videos I’d been looking at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWA0nc"&gt;Once your data is available, you will be able to download it for up to four days. By the time you finally get it, of course, you may have completely forgotten which video you wanted to go back to or why. But it doesn’t hurt to have a record of all the videos you’ve looked at — and you may be surprised at just how many there are.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PS5 owners can get six months of Apple TV Plus for no charge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nKXJSPlEO5ks0eWMlVgy89haBL0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69616772/acastro_191030_1777_appletvplus_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cKSeRI"&gt;Apple and Sony have teamed up to offer PS5 owners a great promotion on the Apple TV Plus streaming service. New and existing subscribers can get six months of service for no charge by simply opening the Apple TV Plus app on PS5 (and signing in with your Apple ID, if you aren’t a current user). After six months, you’ll be charged the normal rate of $4.99 per month to continue with the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbML5k"&gt;The timing of this promotion is no coincidence. &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, Apple TV Plus’ runaway hit show starring Jason Sudeikis, is beginning its second season Friday, July 23rd. There are other things to look forward to with this subscription, like catching up on two fantastic seasons of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21128489/mythic-quest-ravens-banquet-review-apple-tv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and getting ready for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547252/foundation-release-date-apple-tv-plus-september"&gt;a promising-looking adaptation of Isaac Asimov’s &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585674/jon-stewart-apple-tv-show-skit-roasting-space-billionaires-jason-alexander"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is launching in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZt7WV"&gt;If you have a PS5, this is a no-brainer. Tab over to the “Media” section on the main PS5 homescreen and download Apple TV Plus from there. The offer begins today and lasts through a year from now, giving you until July 22nd, 2022 to activate your six-month trial. You can see more details, terms, and eligible countries &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/6-months-trial-apple-tv-ps5-offer/"&gt;right here at the PlayStation website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDv2rg"&gt;Don’t have a PS5 yet? We know they’re still tough to find, but stay tuned for upcoming opportunities. Restocks will likely become more plentiful as we near the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Ferrari is coming to Fortnite</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ANvAU5ThpNX6RXiFfQA3p_tVPrc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69616694/Fortnite_Ferrari_In_Game_Screenshot_1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KDcxbV"&gt;Epic Games is partnering with Ferrari to bring one of the carmaker’s legendary sports cars to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, the two companies announced on Thursday. (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1417877073994166272"&gt;They teased the collaboration on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is already well-known for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22570612/lebron-james-fortnite-skin-release-date"&gt;celebrity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;brand collaborations&lt;/a&gt;, but the Ferrari coming to the game, the 296 GTB hybrid sports car, is the first licensed car to appear in the hugely popular battle royale shooter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ei1MH7"&gt;Cars have become a staple of the game since they were added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355571/fortnite-car-update-joy-ride-trailer-vehicle-types"&gt;nearly a year ago&lt;/a&gt;, but until now, they’ve all been generic representations of different kinds of cars, such as a sedan, a pickup truck, and yes, even a sports car. Epic says the Ferrari will play like other vehicles in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; but will sound like what you’d hear from the real car. If you aren’t familiar with the Ferrari 296 GTB and want to see one up close, &lt;a href="https://carconfigurator.ferrari.com/en_EN/ferrari_car_configurator/296gtb"&gt;check out Ferrari’s configurator for the car&lt;/a&gt;, which is powered by Epic’s Unreal Engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LBBooJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the only battle royale shooter featuring licensed cars. &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/07/12/tesla-partners-pubg-new-video-game-integration/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; just added Teslas&lt;/a&gt;, including Model Ys that drive you to preset markers and self-driving Tesla Semis that carry battle supplies. &lt;/p&gt;
