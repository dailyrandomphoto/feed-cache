    <title>Facebook will block Australian users and publishers from sharing news links in response to new bill</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0RDeqE"&gt;Facebook has decided to block both Australian users and media companies from sharing links to news articles and related content on its main social network, following the country’s proposed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/19/21227263/australia-facebook-google-ad-revenue-media-coronavirus-economy"&gt;landmark regulatory measure&lt;/a&gt; that would force tech giants to pay Australian news organizations for using their content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcX3WV"&gt;The bill, which passed the Australian House of Representatives yesterday and is &lt;a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6652"&gt;believed to have enough votes to pass the Senate&lt;/a&gt;, also targets Google, which at one point last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243468/google-threatens-to-remove-its-search-engine-from-australia-if-new-law-goes-into-effect"&gt;threatened to leave the country entirely&lt;/a&gt;. However, Google has since decided to start cutting deals with major Australian media organizations, like &lt;a href="https://newscorp.com/2021/02/17/news-corp-and-google-agree-to-global-partnership-on-news/"&gt;Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.&lt;/a&gt;, to comply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DC2f8J"&gt;“The proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content,” reads a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from William Easton, the managing director of Facebook Australia &amp;amp; New Zealand. “It has left us facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia. With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJHhnU"&gt;The policy change from Facebook will have stark consequences for both users and media organizations. Easton’s blog post outlines four distinct categories here that will be affected and in what ways: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Wc8FXj"&gt;Australian publishers: “They are restricted from sharing or posting any content on Facebook Pages. Admins will still be able to access other features from their Facebook Page, including Page insights and Creator Studio. We will continue to provide access to all other standard Facebook services, including data tools and CrowdTangle.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Hkhp2I"&gt;International publishers: “They can continue to publish news content on Facebook, but links and posts can’t be viewed or shared by Australian audiences.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mCdssv"&gt;Australian users: “They cannot view or share Australian or international news content on Facebook or content from Australian and international news Pages.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cB095A"&gt;International users: “They cannot view or share Australian news content on Facebook or content from Australian news Pages.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="qMuOuX"&gt;Facebook says it’s using a “combination of technologies” to restrict news content and it will have processes for reviewing content that was removed inadvertently, although it is not sharing those processes at this time. It also says the news content changes won’t affect any of the company’s products or services in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Er8R0O"&gt;Easton’s blog post makes clear the company saw this measure as a last resort. The company cites statistics, like how news content makes up less than 4 percent of what people see in the News Feed and how Facebook drove an estimated AU$407 million in referrals to Australian news publishers, as reasons why it felt the bill unfairly penalizes tech platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fECUJC"&gt;Facebook also draws a distinction between how news publishers and readers access news content on its social network versus Google’s search engine. “Google Search is inextricably intertwined with news and publishers do not voluntarily provide their content. On the other hand, publishers willingly choose to post news on Facebook, as it allows them to sell more subscriptions, grow their audiences and increase advertising revenue,” Easton argues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yuF9M0"&gt;“We were prepared to launch Facebook News in Australia and significantly increase our investments with local publishers, however, we were only prepared to do this with the right rules in place,” he goes on. “This legislation sets a precedent where the government decides who enters into these news content agreements, and ultimately, how much the party that already receives value from the free service gets paid. We will now prioritise investments to other countries, as part of our plans to invest in new licensing news programs and experiences.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The podcast wars will come down to ad tech, not exclusive content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dfsgvhQ9s3vGEfV1YTdfVxYoP5s=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68831596/adiaconis_201202_4322_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alix Diaconis / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5g8o7h"&gt;iHeartMedia, the company behind podcasts like &lt;em&gt;Stuff You Should Know&lt;/em&gt; and hundreds of radio stations across the US, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iheartmedia-to-acquire-triton-digital-from-scripps-11613563201"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s spending $230 million to acquire a platform many people outside the audio industry have likely never heard of: Triton Digital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDsUWF"&gt;Triton Digital specializes in audio ad technology, particularly for live radio broadcasts and podcasts. The company is able to insert ads dynamically, meaning they’re tailored to the individual listener on the fly, and create its own podcast rankings based on access to third-party podcast networks, like NPR. Essentially, iHeart can now take on an even bigger role in the audio advertising space, both in selling and programming ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jk4IQh"&gt;This news suggests ad technology will determine who ultimately cashes in on audio. We’ve already seen this point play out in other recent acquisitions. Spotify bought Megaphone, a hosting platform with a dynamic ad insertion marketplace, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt;, and SiriusXM acquired Midroll, an ad-serving marketplace and platform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21315911/siriusxm-stitcher-podcast-deal-buy-midroll-earwolf"&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UezDkT"&gt;Spotify’s made the biggest splash in audio over the past couple years with flashy acquisitions of podcasting networks and deals with big name stars, like Kim Kardashian West and the Obama family. But the exclusives route isn’t necessarily panning out. Joe Budden, one of Spotify’s original exclusive shows, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21403282/joe-budden-spotify-exclusive-leaving-host-podcast"&gt;left the network&lt;/a&gt; when his contract expired in September to instead make his show available everywhere, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22262497/joe-budden-podcast-network-patreon-spotify"&gt;bonus, Patreon-only content&lt;/a&gt;. Michelle Obama’s show, which was widely hyped as a major exclusive get, also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494284/spotify-michelle-obama-podcast-release-exclusive"&gt;now has its first season available everywhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrWzEY"&gt;Exclusive deals garner headlines and attention, but when it comes to succeeding in the medium to long-term, ad sales will be key. Brian Kaminsky, chief data officer and president of revenue strategies at iHeart, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this acquisition allows the company to create the equivalent of Google Ad Manager for audio, where advertisers can be paired with all kinds of audio programming to meet their goals. For iHeart, data on shows, ad purchases, and ad programming will happen on one united backend. (Kaminsky clarifies that iHeart will still employ and rely on a sales team, not just a digital marketplace.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEH2fU"&gt;“We will have the only complete ad technology stack for all forms of audio, so broadcast, streaming, podcasts, voice audio content experiences,” he says. “That puts iHeart in a position literally to serve the audio advertising needs of every customer possible, and not just the sort of enterprise class customer that you think of when you think of the big agencies, but all the way down through to the long tail of small businesses and people who were using self-service platforms to buy video and display and social from the likes of Facebook and Google.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUHKll"&gt;Although Google has entered the podcasting industry through its Google Podcasts player, the company only mentioned serving audio ads &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/admanager/listen-new-features-grow-your-digital-audio-business/"&gt;as a beta feature&lt;/a&gt; in August last year. The company says it’s exploring more ways to monetize audio, however, and will have updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r7N51y"&gt;Of course, as it goes with acquisitions, Triton’s existing customers might now be put in an uncomfortable bind. Entercom, an iHeart competitor that runs radio stations around the US, is a customer of Triton, for example, as is NPR and others. They might not want to put their money in iHeart’s pockets. Kaminsky says Triton will remain separate from iHeart with its own management and tech teams, and he points out that iHeart &lt;a href="https://www.iheartmedia.com/Other-Businesses"&gt;already operates&lt;/a&gt; three other companies that do business regularly with competitors with no issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlnuOb"&gt;“Obviously, we’re going to be sensitive to people’s concerns, we’re not going to just be cavalier about it, but I think that most folks in the audio community are going to see this as a good thing,” he says. “iHeart has been a staunch supporter of broadcast radio, of companionship audio, of audio as part of the community, as opposed to audio that’s driven exclusively by technology, and I think that the players in the audio space will see that and will continue to avail themselves of the technology and services that Triton provides.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXBt16"&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam’s biggest new hit is a Viking survival game that struck like a bolt from the blue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V1jZ3m6OHe2wY4qSrBownsaWqo4=/155x0:829x449/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68831563/valheim_steam.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WxySs4"&gt;The other day, I saw a game named &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;atop the Steam Early Access sales charts, with overwhelmingly positive reviews. &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22275109/valheim-viking-game-steam-charts-explainer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; seemed to like the $20 Viking-themed survival game&lt;/a&gt;, and I thought friends might like it, too. I wasn’t ready to commit quite yet — I waffled a while before giving it a go. Know who bought it while I was making up my mind? &lt;em&gt;One million other people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67WpZr"&gt;On February 10th, just eight days after launch, indie developer Iron Gate announced that &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;had &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970?emclan=103582791463217109&amp;amp;emgid=3059603085894895511"&gt;already sold 1 million copies&lt;/a&gt;. Five days after that, &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/4627981752752748715"&gt;reached 2 million sales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Here are a few other facts you might like to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4TAu80"&gt;It has now been &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/"&gt;the second-most played game on &lt;em&gt;all of Steam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at one point, ahead of every game save &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, &lt;/em&gt;and it’s comfortably sitting at number three now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fzcx0K"&gt;It’s already set a top-ten record for concurrent players on Steam &lt;a href="https://steamdb.info/app/892970/graphs/"&gt;with roughly 392,000&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, knocking &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/"&gt;off that top 10 chart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WJosSj"&gt;It topped the Steam Top Sellers list during Valve’s Steam Lunar New Year sale — despite having zero discounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ttr5q0GEPIwdbRlpZ4pb474KNjI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309259/steam_charts_top_played_games.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZJXT0NhkWQgCA4_iJaYyaP3x5AI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309223/steam_top_sellers_lunar_new_year.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshot taken February 15th, the last day of the Steam sale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O6RSp0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valheim-may-well-be-steams-biggest-ever-viral-hit/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt;’s trajectory is unlike anything we’ve seen before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUq6tJ"&gt;The closest parallel is perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/pubg-playerunknown-brendan-greene-interview-july-2017/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; —&lt;/em&gt; which similarly came out of Steam Early Access, sold oodles of copies during Steam sales &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/steam-summer-sale-pubg-player-unknown-battlegrounds/"&gt;(also without being on sale&lt;/a&gt;), set a record for the Steam game with the most simultaneous players (3.2 million) that still stands today, and kicked off the entire battle royale genre that spawned today’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and more. But even &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; took months to reach the kind of numbers that &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; already has now, and that was with a genre-defining, action-packed, nail-biting, streamer-friendly game that makes for a delightfully tense watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MmalvW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Technically, ‘Valheim’ released a 2018 alpha build on itch.io&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UjhWdv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt;, by comparison, is slow and methodical. It’s part of an established genre of survival games where you scavenge and harvest, chop and dig, hunt and skin, then build better tools to do it all more efficiently over and over again. Only here, you’re also a badass Viking who can (eventually) build fortresses and ships, you’re hunting down gods for sport, and you’re exploring &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valheim-player-discovers-whats-beyond-the-edge-of-its-enormous-map/"&gt;a gobsmackingly gigantic map&lt;/a&gt; filled with idyllic scenery, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PatrikJarlestam/status/1361604565531959305"&gt;charming music&lt;/a&gt;, a touch of lived-in mystery, and some enemies that stomp me convincingly enough that I get a slight &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; vibe out of it. Oh, and when you cut down trees, they fall and hit other things (like you) for massive damage! That’s never going to get old.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jvXfF31K_kYujVsQz_1WN9Ow060=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309294/valheim_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The game’s graphics may seem dull at first but can be picturesque, particularly with eye candy like depth of field, tessellation, and sun shafts. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zklytf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22275109/valheim-viking-game-steam-charts-explainer"&gt;As Cass Marshall at &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also incredibly accessible and easy to learn — I’d convinced myself that I disliked survival games due to their typically rigid mechanics, but in &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; everything seems to make sense without thinking too hard. I don’t need to spend ages punching trees to build some basic tools, there’s no need to acquire blueprints (recipes unlock as soon as you find new materials), and I don’t have to painstakingly plan how I want my house to look before I start building. You can instantly demolish a portion of a structure and refund your materials if it’s not quite right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wk3PCo"&gt;In fact, building is fast enough that I’m starting to build temporary forward operating bases before I venture into each new area, like the tiny fort below that took all of five minutes and I’ve since expanded twice. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDoTrQoXUEMDG9CjIsfEfptUEqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309305/valheim_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It gets real dark at night. Fire is a must if you’re planning to stay up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3dFC"&gt;There’s no telling how long the magic will last for me or for the game’s 2 million players and counting, of course. It’s been &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/945360#1y"&gt;all downhill for &lt;em&gt;Among Us &lt;/em&gt;on PC&lt;/a&gt;, which currently only attracts one-tenth of its peak player count of 438,000 last September (though it could still be wildly popular on mobile). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKI4K5"&gt;But I imagine word-of-mouth may keep &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; going for a while. I can’t wait to try the game’s two- to ten-player co-op mode with my circle of friends, and that means more copies in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khWT2s"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;does have staying power, expect to hear this game’s name on a lot of lips in the months to come. If history’s any indication, we’ll soon see a rush of knockoffs, &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-08-18-mobile-version-of-fall-guys-is-a-scam-mediatonic-warns"&gt;fake-outs&lt;/a&gt;, and attempts to make other games play more like it, and there may be a lot of pressure on Iron Gate to port the PC-only game to consoles and phones as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US announces charges against North Korean hackers for sweeping hacking scheme</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Stimulus Optimism Grows As GOP Lawmakers Warm To Bipartisan Plan" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J_488J0SRxOxWss1fzimdWx3Hcs=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68831179/1229946499.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NjAheI"&gt;The Justice Department unsealed charges Wednesday for three North Korean computer programmers accused of conspiring to extort over $1.3 billion from banks and other businesses across the globe, &lt;a href="http://washingtonpost.com/national-security/north-korea-hackers-banks-theft/2021/02/17/3dccf0dc-7129-11eb-93be-c10813e358a2_story.html"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJtIuf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17826722/north-korea-sony-hack-wannacry-charges"&gt;the Justice Department brought charges&lt;/a&gt; against one North Korean operative, Park Jin Hyok, for their involvement in the infamous Sony Pictures hack in 2014, as well as the devastating 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack. In Wednesday’s unsealed indictment, Park and others are accused of participating in a sweeping conspiracy to hack into banks and crypto exchanges as well as creating the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/14/15637888/authorities-wannacry-ransomware-attack-spread-150-countries"&gt;WannaCry virus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAwQ4V"&gt;“North Korea’s operatives, using keyboards rather than guns, stealing digital wallets of cryptocurrency instead of stacks of cash, are the world’s leading bank robbers,” Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers said in a statement Wednesday. “The Department will continue to confront malicious nation state cyber activity with our unique tools and work with our fellow agencies and the family of norms abiding nations to do the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ek5Bil"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1367701/download"&gt;The indictment&lt;/a&gt; was filed in December and alleges that the defendants work for North Korea’s military intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau. The DOJ says that the defendants targeted cryptocurrency exchanges, stealing millions from banks and businesses around the world. They are also accused of multiple phishing campaigns from March 2016 to February 2020 targeting US military contractors, energy and technology companies, and the State and Defense departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXxIJi"&gt;The victims of this wide-ranging hacking conspiracy vary from the Central Bank of Bangladesh to cryptocurrency companies based in South Korea, Indonesia, and Slovenia, according to the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tK8dSV"&gt;“Simply put, the regime has become a criminal syndicate with a flag,” Demers said on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tYa0X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brydge’s Pro Plus iPad keyboard gets much better trackpad support with new firmware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gz2ot_feK6QKxMzoBK4LczmOdR4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68830902/DSC00760.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Aeq4bm"&gt;Brydge has announced a new firmware update for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad"&gt;Pro Plus iPad keyboards&lt;/a&gt; that promises to hugely improve the trackpad experience. The update brings “native” multitouch to the trackpads, meaning you can use the same kind of multi-finger gestures on a Brydge device as Apple’s own Magic Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMzPc0"&gt;The Brydge Pro Plus was the victim of unfortunate timing. It was originally announced as a power-user product designed to support Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18743993/ipad-mouse-ipad-os-how-to"&gt;experimental cursor feature&lt;/a&gt;, but then Apple turned that into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/3/18/21184933/ipados-13-4-mouse-trackpad-support-ipad-apple-computer-date"&gt;consumer-level functionality&lt;/a&gt; with iOS 13.4 and released its own keyboard/trackpad accessory, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;expensive but excellent Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. At launch, the Pro Plus’ trackpad was usable for basic tasks, but it didn’t have full gesture support and couldn’t compete with the smoothness of Apple’s own hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="iOhmE1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Brydge Pro Plus review: an almost awesome iPad laptop","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vLCQyi"&gt;I’ve spent a couple of days with a beta version of Brydge’s new firmware, using the company’s keyboard designed for the 11-inch iPad, and the news is good so far. While the trackpad on this model is quite small, and its levered mechanism means there isn’t a lot of space for clicking, the cursor movement is far smoother and gestures work well. You can use three fingers to swipe between apps, for example, or swipe up to bring you to the multitasking interface. Simple two-finger scrolling is also much improved, working with consistent momentum as you’d expect across various apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQoBB1"&gt;I’ll have to test the Pro Plus’ new firmware further before giving a final verdict, but my first impressions are positive. The Pro Plus looks like it’ll soon be a much more viable product than it was upon its original launch, particularly since Brydge is putting it on sale today; the 12.9-inch model is getting a $60 reduction to $169.99, while the 11-inch version is available for $40 off at $159.99.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n1X3Uq"&gt;Brydge is also announcing a new trackpad-equipped iPad keyboard, the first product to come out of a collaboration with OtterBox that was &lt;a href="http://news.brydge.com/111070-brydge-announces-go-to-market-collaboration-with-otter-products"&gt;announced last year&lt;/a&gt;. The 10.2 Max Plus is designed for the seventh- and eighth generation iPads with 10.2-inch displays, and includes a detachable case that Brydge says offers 4-foot drop protection. It’s set to ship in late March and will be &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-10-2-max&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287000%2Fbrydge-pro-plus-ipad-keyboard-new-firmware-native-multitouch#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available to preorder today&lt;/a&gt; for $129.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPVa8E"&gt;If you already have a Pro Plus keyboard, meanwhile, Brydge is opening signups for a public beta of the new firmware. You can register &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fpages%2Fmulti-touch-beta&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287000%2Fbrydge-pro-plus-ipad-keyboard-new-firmware-native-multitouch#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;; the page notes that the firmware will require an iPad running Apple’s iPadOS 14.5 public beta. The program will begin on March 3rd, but 500 users will get earlier access on February 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new FPS Boost mode for Xbox Series X and S can double frame rates in games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6kALP86_rk4wAW-D30WsdzNb__A=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68830900/xboxfpsboost.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RPQoDU"&gt;Microsoft is launching a new FPS Boost feature for its latest Xbox Series X and Series S consoles that’s designed to make existing games run better. While Microsoft has previously focused on improving frame rates with backward compatibility for its latest Xbox consoles, FPS Boost is specifically designed to improve older games without developers having to put in any additional work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05jC0H"&gt;Some games will nearly double frame rates, and Microsoft says it has seen a few instances where backward-compatible titles even quadruple in frame rates. The first games to support FPS Boost are &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;New Super Lucky’s Tale&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sniper Elite 4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;UFC 4&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs 2. &lt;/em&gt;The improvements vary across games, with &lt;em&gt;New Super Lucky’s Tale &lt;/em&gt;now running at up to 120fps, and &lt;em&gt;UFC 4&lt;/em&gt; includes 60fps performance on the Xbox Series S specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7ngZR"&gt;Games that work with FPS Boost will include a new indicator when you hit the Xbox button on a controller, just like how Quick Resume or auto HDR indicators pop up today on Xbox Series X and S consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U_mco2cQwbPXCWC77mnPK3wFseE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309418/xboxfpsboost.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New FPS Boost feature for Xbox Series X and S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lm2Gg6"&gt;“This is just the beginning,” explains Paul Eng, a senior program manager at Xbox. “We will announce and release more titles featuring FPS Boost soon, as we roll out new menu icons and system settings in an upcoming system update.” This new dashboard update will arrive in the spring and include the ability to toggle compatibility options on games. You’ll be able to disable auto HDR or toggle this new FPS Boost feature on and off to really see the impact it provides or simply play games in their original form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMHulE"&gt;Microsoft will be rolling out FPS Boost more broadly soon with this new dashboard update. While the initial list is rather limited, Microsoft says it’s planning to announce more games that support FPS Boost in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Los Angeles police used Amazon Ring footage to investigate police brutality protests</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y-Y5JXUGko6WZ0mSWB6BCRDuiio=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68830803/ringvideodoorbell3plus.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nsmTjY"&gt;The Los Angeles Police Department requested access to Amazon Ring footage while investigating vandalism during last summer’s anti-racism and police brutality protests, according to newly released emails. &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/lapd-requested-ring-footage-black-lives-matter-protests"&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation calls it&lt;/a&gt; the first evidence of police trying to identify protest attendees with home surveillance cameras — although it’s part of a much longer relationship between Amazon and law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQSn5o"&gt;The EFF published a string of redacted emails between the LAPD and an Amazon representative. The document includes copies of several requests to Ring customers, asking for surveillance footage from their camera-equipped doorbells. Many of the forms are heavily redacted, but on June 16th, Amazon submitted a request clearly related to the protests. “During the recent protests, individuals were injured and property was looted, damaged, and destroyed,” the LAPD said in the request. It asked for video during a redacted period of time, “in an effort to identify those responsible.” At least one user appears to have sent video footage soon after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Zeb6R"&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22258856/amazon-ring-partners-police-fire-security-privacy-cameras"&gt;reportedly partnered with over 2,000 police and fire departments&lt;/a&gt;, which allegedly requested footage for around 22,000 total incidents in 2020. Most requests ask users to voluntarily submit video, but police can obtain footage directly through Amazon with a search warrant or court order. Police departments have also used social media and high-tech tools like facial recognition to track down protest attendees — sometimes in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295301/philadelphia-protester-arson-identified-social-media-etsy-instagram-linkedin"&gt;cases that involve&lt;/a&gt; clear acts of property destruction or violence, and sometimes over charges that appear &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373316/nypd-facial-recognition-black-lives-matter-activist-derrick-ingram"&gt;inflated or retaliatory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OQ4hS"&gt;In a statement to the EFF, the LAPD said it is “not uncommon for investigators to ask businesses or residents if they will voluntarily share their footage with them.” However, Ring cameras let police access a far greater wealth of video recordings — making questions of privacy even more urgent.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood’s in better shape than it looks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E5krugLedPTA1L1TYbK7_DFWX9I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68830761/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Never mind the House hearing, the company’s full steam ahead&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WQ9Cgx"&gt;So here we are: about to have a hearing about GameStonk. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev is going to have to explain himself tomorrow. What happens next for Robinhood?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1We0i"&gt;Perhaps you recall last month, when GameStop stock shot up by as much as 500 percent, hitting a peak of $483 on January 28th, thanks largely to memes and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22278890/jon-fortt-cnbc-anchor-interview-gamestop-stock-wallstreetbets-reddit"&gt;a shitposting finance subreddit&lt;/a&gt;. (I’m sure there will be entire academic books written on r/WallStreetBets. &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3776874"&gt;There is a paper already&lt;/a&gt;.) Many of the retail traders involved in the GameStop buying frenzy were using Robinhood, and the company became part of the meme — even though it had to limit trades on GameStop. The run-up had a populist theme: the little guys were gonna &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt; the hedge funds; they were gonna make those dang short-sellers &lt;em&gt;pay. &lt;/em&gt;The GameStop meme was a ton of free publicity for Robinhood, though the public outcry about limited trades means the House of Representatives is now inquiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EHQoND"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This will be fun political theater, but it’s unlikely to have any kind of serious outcome&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1Znpe"&gt;The House Financial Services Committee is going to have a hearing! This will be fun political theater, but it’s unlikely to have any kind of serious outcome. That’s probably why Robinhood is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/robinhood-s-other-drama-an-ipo-the-firm-may-need-more-than-ever?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;still planning to go public this year&lt;/a&gt;. Robinhood topped Apple’s mobile app store for days, and more than half a million people downloaded it, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/why-investors-were-willing-to-write-robinhood-a-3-billion-check-during-the-gamestop-chaos-.html"&gt;CNBC reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xo9oR8"&gt;“They actually have an incredible opportunity with new users right now,” said Catherine Lamberton, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania’s business school, Wharton. The GameStonk saga is actually evidence that Robinhood has changed power dynamics in the market, she said. “They have an opportunity to keep growing with this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltUi7U"&gt;Sure, Robinhood limited GameStop trading near the peak, enraging some of its customers. But in March 2020, during the pandemic-related market crash, you may recall Robinhood had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171584/robinhood-outage-week-us-stocks-third-market"&gt;three major outages&lt;/a&gt; in a little more than a week. In some ways, this makes sense: Robinhood is a startup, and it was having a painful growth moment. At the time, Tenev and his co-CEO Baiju Bhatt chalked that failure up to “&lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2020/3/3/an-update-from-robinhoods-founders"&gt;stress on our infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;.” They hadn’t predicted an event of that scale — and hadn’t planned for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZW4uP2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If this had been Twitter, there would have been a fail whale&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n3HK1v"&gt;Of course, the more famous service outage didn’t happen until January 2021, but the basic contours are the same. Robinhood hadn’t planned for an event of that scale, and when the clearinghouses raised their cash requirements, &lt;a href="https://robinhood.engineering/reflections-on-robinhoods-growth-4f117e75adc5"&gt;whoopsies&lt;/a&gt;! If this had been Twitter, there would have been a fail whale. People get mad enough when social media networks go down — but this is &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt;. Even so, what happened last March, and again around GameStop, fit into a larger pattern of tech startup behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0AlGC"&gt;“This is a normal startup thing,” said Lana Swartz, an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368876/venmo-paypal-square-cash-app-social-media-payments-new-money-lana-swartz-interview"&gt;author of &lt;em&gt;New Money: How Payment Became Social Media&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, the move is to bring a platform to market, get it to scale, and worry about everything else later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlIiIz"&gt;A lack of customer service is expected in social media companies, Swartz said. “But as Silicon Valley companies are trying to take over more and more parts of our life, that modus operandi — ‘Sorry, we don’t work now and you signed the terms of service, so it’s on you! You consented to this!’ — that way of doing things isn’t going to cut it,” Swartz said. That’s why the most interesting questions at the hearing are likely to be about the terms of service agreement, not hedge funds, short-sellers, or payment for order flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="9bALpI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This isn’t an area where one can dabble.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0R3pFW"&gt;The question here is what small investors were led to believe and what actually happened, said Anat Admati, a professor of finance and economics at the Stanford School of Business. Robinhood does say in its terms of service that it can decline trades — but how many of its users read the terms of service? “The broader issue is that we agree to all kinds of things online,” Admati said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMTFGz"&gt;What’s more, with complex financial transactions, “we’ll work out the details later” is difficult to pull off, Lamberton said. “This isn’t an area where one can dabble,” she said. Lamberton wants to know how Robinhood might handle a similar mass retail event in the future: is it its goal to never let the GameStop situation happen again? Or would it instead figure out how to let mass retail events occur without its own internal system capsizing? “That decision will change their platform and also how they fit with Wall Street,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJYCF4"&gt;There are a lot of free things online, and the question is always how they make money, Admati said. In Robinhood’s case, that will be one of the subjects House politicians are likely to dive into — a controversial practice called “payment for order flow.” This allows market makers to bundle trades and make money &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b"&gt;through arbitrage&lt;/a&gt;. It could also theoretically let banks front-run retail investors, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-05/robinhood-gamestop-saga-pressures-payment-for-order-flow"&gt;a practice which is illegal&lt;/a&gt;. Also, as &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Matt Levine notes: “The wholesaler is ordinarily filling your order at a price that is &lt;em&gt;better than &lt;/em&gt;what’s available in the public market, so ‘front-running’ — going out and buying on the stock exchange and then turning around and selling to you at a profit — doesn’t work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BaznMZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Robinhood makes money when people make more trades&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CaZYY7"&gt;The guest list suggests this is where we will focus. There is, first of all, Citadel Securities, which does payment for order flow for brokerages that include Robinhood. There is Melvin Capital, a hedge fund that was fabulously successful last year and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D52354809919862419471096576568858020508%7CMCORGID%3DCB68E4BA55144CAA0A4C98A5%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1613500951"&gt;had to be bailed out this year due&lt;/a&gt; in part to its GameStop short positions. Citadel, a hedge fund, bought a stake. To make matters more confusing, Citadel and Citadel Securities are not the same thing, though they were founded by the same guy, Ken Griffin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1idfKS"&gt;The thing about payment for order flow is that Robinhood makes money when people make more trades. The company sends push notifications about positions you own, and you can set up custom price targets if you like to receive more. This is only a problem for Robinhood’s users; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-15/day-traders-in-brazil-study-would-ve-done-better-with-9-to-5-job?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;in general, day traders&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trading%20Skill%20110523.pdf"&gt;mostly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trading%20and%20Learning%20110217.pdf"&gt;don’t make money&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rB1Zn2"&gt;This is particularly true for Robinhood, actually! During “herding events” like GameStonk, when Robinhood traders crowd into a stock, “large increases in Robinhood users are often accompanied by large price spikes and are followed by reliably negative returns,” the authors of &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3715077"&gt;a study on Robinhood users write&lt;/a&gt;. Another paper views Robinhood traders as, &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3776874"&gt;essentially, noise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTLgsN"&gt;Focusing on a hedge fund conspiracy is missing the point. Robinhood and Citadel Securities make money when people trade. It is reasonable to ask whether to limit push notifications that might prompt people to impulse-trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DnaRqU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I hope Gill wears his formal headband&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rdltyl"&gt;We will also hear from the Reddit representatives, CEO Steve Huffman and r/WallStreetBets user &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/keith-gill-drove-the-gamestop-reddit-mania-he-talked-to-the-journal-11611931696"&gt;Keith “DeepFuckingValue” Gill,&lt;/a&gt; also known as Roaring Kitty on YouTube. I imagine this will be about day trading, and someone will have to explain r/WallStreetBets, which: good luck! I hope Gill wears his formal headband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdDfDq"&gt;It’s possible Tenev will have a disastrous performance, setting Robinhood up for a world of hurt. But the questions focused on payment for order flow, hedge funds, and whether short-sellers are evil (they aren’t!) will miss the Silicon Valley thing. Part of the problem was the &lt;a href="https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/Customer%20Agreement.pdf"&gt;terms of service agreement&lt;/a&gt; itself — no one reads them. Robinhood absolutely had the right to restrict trades, and furthermore, Robinhood is not liable for service failures regardless of cause, including those caused by software malfunctions. There is also an arbitration clause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AK6lOA"&gt;What I’m getting at here is that Robinhood doesn’t have to change &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;. It’s scaling rapidly. Users have agreed it can have whoopsies whenever it likes. Robinhood makes money regardless of whether its users do. Disputes go to arbitration, not court. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/why-investors-were-willing-to-write-robinhood-a-3-billion-check-during-the-gamestop-chaos-.html"&gt;Investors are piling in&lt;/a&gt;. If Tenev can ride out this hearing (and perhaps a similar one from the Senate), he’s in an excellent position for an IPO. All he has to do is let the politicians get their soundbites and not say anything horrible, and he wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="kbR1QL"&gt;Robinhood &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264037/robinhood-super-bowl-ad-commercial-brand-crisis"&gt;ran a Super Bowl ad&lt;/a&gt; celebrating its customers. If that’s not confidence, I’m not sure what is.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to get more space in your Google storage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D3I3JurYKEMLagor1LBvIXUv3ts=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68830586/acastro_190318_1777_google_drive_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="995CJ1"&gt;For many of us, Google storage is the modern-day hard drive. It’s the place where our most important thoughts, documents, and memories reside. But just like with a traditional hard drive, the space isn’t infinite, and running out of room can be a real problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4NMAK"&gt;By default, Google gives you 15GB of space to use for everything associated with your account. (If you have a paid G Suite account, your limit’s likely higher.) That includes content connected to Gmail, Google Drive, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;all&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Google Photos saved after June 1st&lt;/a&gt;. Needless to say, data adds up fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxF6Db"&gt;You can check your current storage status by visiting &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/settings/storage"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;, and if push comes to shove, you can purchase more space there, too, for as little as &lt;a href="https://one.google.com/about"&gt;$2 a month&lt;/a&gt; for an extra 100GB. But shelling out more money might not be necessary. A quick round of old-fashioned housekeeping could be enough to clear away your virtual cobwebs and give yourself ample room to grow. Here’s how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wffTjP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delete Drive debris&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="U71Zuv"&gt;Google Drive is a common place for space-sucking files to build up and wear down your quota, but tidying things up doesn’t take long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FhULDM"&gt;Open &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/quota"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;, which will show you a list of all of your Drive files sorted by size with the largest items at the top&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8jiO21"&gt;Look through the heftiest offenders and delete anything you no longer need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EbNW2h"&gt;Click the gear-shaped icon in Drive’s upper-right corner, and select “Settings,” followed by “Manage Apps”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0JSjeI"&gt;For any apps that have a note about hidden data, click the gray “Options” box to the right, and select “Delete hidden app data”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Drive hidden data" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZiCKE3hpTX9bhDcrXlFW0ljAzKM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15969666/google_drive_storage_hidden_app_data.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For any apps that have a note about hidden data, click the gray “Options” box to the right, and select “Delete hidden app data.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="f7323i"&gt;Apps associated with your Google Drive storage can sometimes have hidden data, but all it takes is a couple of clicks to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="VuPUfN"&gt;Open &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/trash"&gt;your Drive Trash folder&lt;/a&gt; and click on the “Empty trash” link at the top of the page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ckrevF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free up Photos storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6baCi7"&gt;Unless you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562908/google-future-pixel-phone-no-unlimited-photos-storage-confirmed"&gt;currently have a Pixel phone&lt;/a&gt; (in which case, you will, for now, keep the unlimited “high quality” option), as of June 1st, 2021, every photo and video backed up to Google Photos is going to count against your Google storage. If you’ve been saving photos at their original sizes, you can free up tons of space by converting them to Google’s “high-quality” option, which compresses images down to 16MP and videos to 1080p (a change that’s &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/Google-Photos-High-quality-vs-Original-Whats-the-difference-and-should-you-care_id93938"&gt;unlikely to be noticeable&lt;/a&gt; for most people and purposes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="II1hIJ"&gt;Go to the &lt;a href="https://photos.google.com/settings"&gt;Photos settings page&lt;/a&gt;, and select “High quality (free unlimited storage)”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aqoG3F"&gt;When you make that selection, you’ll be asked whether you want to switch to the “high quality” format and compress your existing photos. If there are any photos you don’t want to compress, click on the “Learn how to keep original files” link for instructions on saving those photos to your device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When you switch to “high quality,” you can also compress the rest of your Google Photos content." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xMuX1eDvb3mXaQ3qGdXGFsCBEys=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309653/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_9.20.22_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you switch to “high quality,” you can also compress the rest of your Google Photos content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kIkJIH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say goodbye to Gmail junk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mjcRaE"&gt;Emails don’t take up a ton of space, but you know what does? Attachments. Odds are, you’ve got plenty of old attachments sitting in your Gmail account that you don’t really need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUTMcd"&gt;Here’s how to address that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="EaQUsC"&gt;Go to the Gmail website and type “has:attachment larger:10M” into the search box at the top&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="78cbK0"&gt;Identify any messages with disposable attachments and delete them. (There’s no great way to get rid of an attachment without also deleting the associated email, unfortunately, but you can always forward a message back to yourself and manually remove the attachment before axing the original.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="viHWJR"&gt;Open your &lt;a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#spam"&gt;Spam folder&lt;/a&gt;, and click the link to “Delete all spam messages now” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="v7aCfx"&gt;Open your &lt;a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#trash"&gt;Trash folder&lt;/a&gt;, and select “Empty Trash now” to send everything away for good &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="QN1Yay"&gt;Feeling lighter is liberating, isn’t it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxCbPk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 17th, 2021, 10:37AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on March 19th, 2019. The information on Google Photos has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford says it will go all-electric in Europe by 2030</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3GvSPyN99Jw4nuwQQXnQJeUtaZQ=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68830428/All_New_Ford_E_Transit_09.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9vTleR"&gt;Ford will only sell electric vehicles in Europe by 2030, it said Wednesday. The automaker said it will spend $1 billion to convert its factory in Cologne, Germany, into its first EV production line on the continent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EIGoE"&gt;Ford says it will transition to EV-production gradually over the next decade. By 2024, the company’s entire commercial vehicle lineup will be “zero-emissions capable, all-electric or plug-in hybrid.” By mid-2026, Ford says “100 percent” of its passenger vehicle lineup will be the same. And by 2030, Ford expects two-thirds of its commercial vehicle sales to be all-electric or plug-in hybrid, while all of its passenger vehicles sold will be pure battery-electric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WK1ujE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford said it will increase its investment in electric and autonomous vehicles to $29 billion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LmlX8k"&gt;The news comes on the heels of Ford announcing that it would increase its investment in electric and autonomous vehicles to $29 billion. The automaker had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/15/16892386/ford-electric-car-11-billion-2022-detroit-auto-show-2018"&gt;previously committed to spend $11.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; on electrifying its vehicle lineup through 2022. Now, it will spend double that amount, while extending the timeline to 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdcnRW"&gt;Ford will have help in its plans to electrify its vehicle lineup. In 2019, the company struck a deal with Volkswagen to use the German auto giant’s electric-vehicle modular electric vehicle platform. VW’s MEB platform will serve as the basis for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18536668/vw-volkswagen-id-3-preorders-oelectric-car-long-range-ev"&gt;15 million electric cars the automaker aims to sell&lt;/a&gt;. And Ford has said it will use the platform to design and build at least one high-volume fully electric vehicle in Europe starting in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7CgmX"&gt;Ford aims to deliver more than 600,000 European vehicles using the MEB architecture over six years, with a second all-new Ford model for European customers under discussion. The move would help Ford comply with European government mandates that push electrified vehicles and strict emissions standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbpHmG"&gt;Numerous European countries have set out targets for banning traditional gas-powered cars and vans, with Norway aiming for 2025 and France and the UK for 2040 and 2050, respectively. (Granted, the &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1341155/nine-countries-say-they-will-ban-internal-combustion-engines-none-have-a-law-to-do-so/"&gt;legislation for actually mandating the bans&lt;/a&gt; lags far behind.) Several states in the US are also making aggressive targets, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;California leading the pack&lt;/a&gt;, vowing to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVEw3i"&gt;Ford’s effort to speed up its electrification plans is meant to convince those on Wall Street who have been jittery about the company’s ability to catch up to Tesla, which has been the only automaker to successfully build an EV business over the last few years. Ford is keeping pace with other legacy automakers like GM and Volkswagen, having just begun delivering its hotly anticipated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265570/mustang-mach-e-review-electric-ford-ev-photos-video"&gt;Mustang Mach-E&lt;/a&gt; to customers late last year — though a &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/ford/2021/01/16/ford-mustang-mach-e-delivery-delay/4189265001/"&gt;quality review issue&lt;/a&gt; delayed hundreds of additional deliveries last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vDWTS"&gt;The company also introduced an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21163669/ford-all-electric-transit-cargo-van-2021"&gt;all-electric Transit van&lt;/a&gt; last year and plans on unveiling an electric version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21288000/ford-electric-f-150-2022-sale-launch-jim-farley"&gt;bestselling F-150 pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7Hqvo"&gt;Ford isn’t even the only carmaker to greatly increase its bet on electric. Late last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575153/gm-electric-ev-investment-deadline-cadillac-chevy-hummer"&gt;GM said it would spend $27 billion&lt;/a&gt; on electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025 — up from the $20 billion it announced before the COVID-19 pandemic. GM has also said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;transition to electric vehicles only by 2040&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
