    <title>Wipeout gets ‘reimagined’ as a mobile game where you manage instead of drive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Wipeout Rush" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wAYiRItfE5je3fDHFY-ogAwGD4w=/0x0:1942x1295/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866650/wipeoutrush.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="or3y46"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wipeout&lt;/em&gt;, the fast-paced, futuristic racing series that’s synonymous with PlayStation, is coming to iOS and Android mobile devices later in 2021. The new game is called &lt;em&gt;Wipeout Rush&lt;/em&gt;, and unfortunately, it might not be what you’re after if you’ve adored previous entries in the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DI50dq"&gt;The game, developed by Rogue, is a card-based racing game that doesn’t actually put you in the driver's seat. Instead, you’ll be the team manager of racers who will get to do all of the fun driving while you’re dealing with cards. The game promises to dive into the lore of &lt;em&gt;Wipeout&lt;/em&gt;, and I’m most looking forward to finding out why the player can’t drive. Did they lose their license?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pymiAg"&gt;Here’s a description of &lt;em&gt;Wipeout Rush&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://rogueco.com/portfolio-item/wipeout-rush/"&gt;as noted on Rogue’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="4Q0mTJ"&gt;For fans of the series, &lt;em&gt;Wipeout Rush&lt;/em&gt; is bringing loads of new lore through collectables and story. Players will be able to unlock collectable cards to learn more about the ships, teams, pilots, and tracks of the Wipeout world as they progress through an engaging single-player campaign told through exciting animated comics. &lt;em&gt;Wipeout Rush&lt;/em&gt; will include both Quick Race and Championship Cup game modes complete with 5 different tracks, 60 iconic Wipeout ships, a wide range of familiar weapons, 12 Championship Cups each with their own boss, and bundles of collectables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BX0rfV"&gt;For a second there, I imagined how great a &lt;em&gt;Wipeout &lt;/em&gt;game for phones could look and play, especially now that there are several phones with fast refresh rate displays (the iPhone 13 Pro is the most notable addition to that group recently), as well as solid mobile controllers like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;Backbone One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;Razer Kishi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RonRWE"&gt;I’m willing to give this game a shot when it comes out, and it could be fun in its own way, but it’s been a while since I’ve so quickly gone from being excited about something to just being a little sad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHi11c"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXLIvJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Razer Blade 15 Advanced is $800 off at Amazon today</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBksi0"&gt;Gaming laptops are by no means cheap, but today you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086M8PQYR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $800 on the Razer Blade 15 Advanced at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This laptop was built expressly for the purpose of delivering desktop gaming performance in a laptop form factor. Packing an RTX 2070 Super Max-Q graphics card and a 10875H Intel processor capable of topping out at 5.0GHz, the Razer Blade 15 does exactly that. The FHD display has a 300Hz refresh rate, better than you’d see on most desktop gaming monitors, allowing for sharp reaction times and virtually no lag, letting you get the drop on your enemy. A 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of RAM round out the laptop’s specs, offering you plenty of onboard storage and speed. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Razer Blade 15 Advanced review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="brF3EP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best gaming laptops you can buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="KJaYDv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10754577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y47mjC"&gt;Ahead of the new 2021 base iPad releasing next Friday, September 24th, you can save $30 on a preorder through Walmart. Normally $329 for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;the 64GB Wi-Fi model that Apple just introduced&lt;/a&gt; at its “California Streaming” event, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1133983/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F483978365&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;facet=shelf_id%3A6890999&amp;amp;search_sort=100&amp;amp;_be_shelf_id=6890999" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $299&lt;/a&gt;. So, get it for this price while you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwoqO3"&gt;This model features a slate of improvements over the previous generation, including the bump up to 64GB of storage, the faster A13 Bionic processor, and True Tone screen tech that lets the screen match the color temperature in your room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ObZyjs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cbGCeh"&gt;If you’re a streamer in the market for a new microphone, look no further than the Razer Seiren Emote, now &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XB39R7B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $100 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This slick hyper-cardioid condenser microphone bears a striking resemblance to the other entries in the Seiren family, until it connects with Razer’s streamer companion app. The front of the mic contains an 8-bit LED display, capable of showing hundreds of customizable emotes that react to your chat. While this mic certainly isn’t for everyone, you’ll have a hard time finding a microphone more unique or better suited to connecting with your audience during a stream. Amazon notes that only a few units are left in stock, so hopefully it replenishes throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w0ml3y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10754637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gj9UpW"&gt;Anyone looking for a midsize 4K TV should definitely check out this deal at Best Buy. This 50-inch model from Sony is still &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAEDde5Aev#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Best Buy for $700&lt;/a&gt;, its second-best price to date. In addition to offering crisp 4K resolution, the X80J touts several features that elevate the viewing experience. HDR10 and Dolby Vision certification provide deeper blacks and more vivid colors, while built-in voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant allow you to easily search and swap channels. The TV includes built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, too, which help cut down on cord clutter, and the X80J can be wall-mounted with any 200 x 200 VESA mount. The TV can also handle up to four HDMI devices and offers an audio return channel in case you want to route your devices through a soundbar or receiver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nHPwZ0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10754734"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gReWX9"&gt;One of the lightest wireless mice in Razer’s arsenal is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Ultimate-Hyperspeed-Lightest-Wireless/dp/B07YPC3BQC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for just $120 today at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down from its normal retail price of $150. The Viper has been a mainstay of the Razer armory for some time, but this wireless version brings some solid improvements to the tested design. The Razer Viper Ultimate Hyperspeed weighs a paltry 74 grams and packs a powerful 20K DPI optical sensor. The ambidextrous design also sports six remappable buttons, making it one of the best mice available for southpaw shooters. The most noticeable improvement, however, is the inclusion of wireless connectivity. It can be paired either via Bluetooth or to the included 2.4GHz dongle, and the Viper Ultimate is said to last up to 70 hours on a single charge and can be recharged either via Micro USB or with the included recharging dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="udUahX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10754700"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V7YzIa"&gt;A pair of earbuds that no Apple aficionado should be without, the Beats Powerbeats Pro, are &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1151608/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fpowerbeats-pro-wireless-earphones%2F-%2FA-78362035" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale at Target for $175 in red&lt;/a&gt;. These water-resistant earbuds can handle even the sweatiest workouts, and the adjustable ear hooks ensure they won’t jostle loose during a run. The earbuds can last for up to nine hours on a single charge but can stretch to 24 hours if the case is topped off. While the earbuds definitely work best with Apple devices thanks to their built-in H1 chip — a piece of hardware allows for always-on Siri detection and better call quality in windy environments, among other improvements — they can be used with a wide variety of Bluetooth-enabled devices. Just note that the charging case can only connect using an Apple lightning cable. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WGWd5F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9EzqOl"&gt;A solid addition to any Xbox or PC gaming setup, the HyperX CloudX Flight Wireless is currently available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAVP3dG6gn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fkingston-hyperx-cloudx-flight-wireless-gaming-headset%2F93G680VL1NKH%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt; for $120, its second-best price to date. HyperX is known for its comfortable and functional gaming headsets. It may lack some of the outward flair of its competitors, but the CloudX can still trade blows with competing headsets that are nearly double the price. The CloudX Flight comes with a detachable boom mic, leatherette ear cups, and boasts a battery life of up to 30 hours. While the CloudX has been designed for the Xbox family of consoles, it can still connect to PCs thanks to its 2.4GHz wireless dongle. It even comes with a built-in chat mixer, so you can adjust your audio levels without combing through in-game menus.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meet the YouTubers determined to find lost media</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3sCwC-RHX-F1GCne1KUh-_Mv9zQ=/119x0:1382x842/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866569/a2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bobdunga&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3AM5RO"&gt;When I was 11, I remember seeing a weird commercial on television. During the commercial break of a Slamball rerun (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Ib-AJA7v9Kk"&gt;remember Slamball?&lt;/a&gt;) on Cartoon Network, I saw an AIDS awareness ad. It was made specifically for kids, and it was accompanied by an annoying rap. I distinctly remember the chorus: “What do you know about AIDS?!” It’s been stuck in my head for years. I guess you’re expecting me to link the commercial I’m describing, right? Well, I can’t, because I’ve never found it. I’ve never even seen it mentioned online. This commercial is what’s known as “lost media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nM1W5Y"&gt;Online, there’s a lost media community dedicated to preserving everything from unaired television pilots to unreleased video game prototypes. Currently, the lost media community exists on both YouTube and &lt;a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Home"&gt;the Lost Media wiki&lt;/a&gt;, an archive of thousands of lost media topics. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LSuperSonicQ"&gt;LSuperSonicQ&lt;/a&gt; is a well-known member of the lost media community and has many videos covering lost media topics such as the &lt;em&gt;Johnny Bravo&lt;/em&gt; pilot and unreleased My Chemical Romance songs. His fascination with lost media started on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fs6Hiq"&gt;“I knew nothing about lost media at all until I watched a video from this other kind of lost media YouTuber,” said LSuperSonicQ. “His name is blameitonjorge. And this is like, back in 2015… It was like, top 40 lost or banned episodes of kids TV shows.” LSuperSonicQ watched the video, and from that point on, he said, he was “hooked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Ij0fR"&gt;Lost media searches can take a long time, depending on what is being sought after and whether there are any complications, such as nondisclosure agreements, people leaving jobs, or creators just not remembering past projects. LSuperSonicQ took months to find the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/2s0nFAw8GeU"&gt;lost pilot for the TV show &lt;em&gt;Kappa Mikey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which aired on Nicktoons Network in the mid-2000s. This lost pilot was made in order to pitch the show to MTV. LSuperSonicQ was able to contact the creator of the show and convince him to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8KoVLI3XuGM"&gt;upload that original pilot to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. He now considers this his favorite piece of lost media. Plus, the search was a good learning experience for him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FNSk3y"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8KoVLI3XuGM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iDuUMd"&gt;“That was a really, really big deal, when that happened,” said LSuperSonicQ. “It was my longest-lasting media search at the time, and I learned a lot of techniques in that search that I have applied to future searches and how I go about contacting people and trying to find stuff. So it was a really, really big turning point in my own personal lost media journey.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3hu7xP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was such a hot-button lost media topic that was surrounded by so much confusion and misinformation.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NIqqmw"&gt;Not all searches end in success, but they can still be entertaining, since lost media is all about the search and why the media became lost in the first place. YouTuber &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7GWq_TBvJKWLFIb2eLp-bw"&gt;Bobdunga&lt;/a&gt; recently dove into the world of lost media in her hunt for the &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls &lt;/em&gt;video game, chronicling her search in a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/D8ZUR2De15s"&gt;two-part Youtube documentary&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls &lt;/em&gt;game was always seen as a mystery by the lost media community, but most didn’t seem too interested in solving it. “I feel that a lot of that had to do with the fact that the game was inherently deemed as shovelware right off the bat,” said Bobdunga. The 2000s featured many licensed games that were created just to cash in on the popularity of an upcoming film release. “This was especially common for ‘girl games,’” said Bobdunga. “I think a lot of people behind the scenes didn’t have that good of a grasp at what girls liked in gaming.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRERfr"&gt;For her, &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls &lt;/em&gt;was more than just another “girl game.” “What really drew me to wanting to dive into &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/em&gt; was mainly because it was such a hot-button lost media topic that was surrounded by so much confusion and misinformation,” she said. “I think it was my want to dissect all of it, even if I didn’t come out finding the actual game, that really drew me into the project.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WT0ECm"&gt;She told me this was her first time creating YouTube content about lost media, but not her first experience with it. “I’ve always been very partial to both true crime and lost media videos,” she said. “They seem to fit together really well, because they both share an ominous, almost storytelling-like atmosphere. And a lot of the time, the narrator will have a really calm or even creepy voice to further immerse the viewer. There’s something inherently spooky about lost media, especially in a digital age where we feel we can find everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFC0Qy"&gt;After months of searching, she eventually found it. An anonymous source sent her the game’s ROM file after viewing the first part of her documentary. Since then, she has recently &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3AQh9Nx6_Gw"&gt;uploaded footage of the game&lt;/a&gt; to her YouTube channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ywokja"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D8ZUR2De15s?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3SLvt0"&gt;Enthusiasts see lost media as a way to preserve history, even if it’s something as obscure as a canceled video game or lost TV pilot. “Not everything has such a strong digital footprint, and it’s important to preserve all types of media, whether it be physical or digital,” said Bobdunga. “It isn’t only a nostalgic memory for some but the media in question could also act as a small glimpse into what the world was like when it was produced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuy427"&gt;LSuperSonicQ took a similar stance. “It has to do with pop culture. It has to do with, you know, what people were interested in at the time it was made. And there’s lost media that goes all the way back to the 1920s. They’re silent films that are lost for people to look for. And it goes all the way up to the 2010s and 2020s. By being able to preserve and archive and document that kind of thing, I really think, in a way, it really helps the historical aspect of our culture and where we came from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CyiBe"&gt;Without the work of the lost media community, these parts of our culture and history would be lost to time. In the digital age, it has become harder for media to get lost, since almost everything is online, but it is still a possibility. If companies don’t do their part by making their older media easily available, then it’s up to the fans to do their part and preserve history.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new ninth-gen iPad is $30 off before it’s even out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UmwDCYocH1nUKb0fnM_2ejgvhzo=/170x0:2006x1224/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866492/apple_event_2021_427.5.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XM74UA"&gt;Apple just announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;ninth-gen entry-level iPad&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday at the iPhone 13 event and began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665133/apple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date"&gt;taking orders&lt;/a&gt;, with availability opening up on September 24th. But now, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F674982024&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is offering a nice discount on preorders of its own&lt;/a&gt;. You can preorder the new base model 2021 iPad with a $30 discount, bringing the price down to just $299 for the 64GB Wi-Fi configuration. It will ship a little bit later than if purchased through Apple, around September 29th, but it’s rare get a 10 percent discount on a brand-new product if you’re willing to wait just a few more days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J4xFRv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I4Nhvs"&gt;The new iPad is the latest version of Apple’s most popular model of tablet. It features a 10.2-inch non-laminated Retina display, Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the physical home button, first-generation Apple Pencil compatibility, and a smart connector for a keyboard attachment. If that all sounds familiar, it should, because those are holdovers from last year’s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92b3sY"&gt;This new model also has a claimed 20 percent performance bump thanks to its A13 Bionic processor, double the base storage at 64GB, a 20W USB-C charger with USB-C to Lightning cable included, True Tone display, and the new Center Stage feature for keeping you framed up during video calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dq1RDA"&gt;The entry-level iPads have long been the default tablet for many, and it’s nice to see some quality of life improvements when many folks out there might find a device like this essential for child use or content-consumption — even nicer when you can be an early adopter and still save some coin.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GoPro announces Hero 10 Black with 5.3K60 and smartphone-like features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xxGdhOQ9nQCHMwhdxfcLqZS1YEs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866244/bfarsace_210909_4746_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HtLuLw"&gt;GoPro has announced the next version of its action camera, which has a new processor that lets the camera shoot in higher frame rates (for that cool slow-motion footage), have better stabilization, and automatically upload videos to the cloud while charging. The new processor also works to make using the GoPro Hero 10 Black a faster, more responsive experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXH0lD"&gt;In a lot of cases, the Hero 10 can shoot at double the frame rate of the Hero 9: it can now shoot at 5.3K at 60 frames per second (offering both the frame rate improvement as well as a small resolution bump) and can shoot at 4K120, and 2.7K240. While 240fps is still as slow (er, fast?) as the camera will get, it’s now able to shoot that frame rate at 2.7K, versus the 1080 resolution limit of the GoPro Hero 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3PvkVA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some of GoPro’s biggest competition is phone cameras, and it’s more like a phone than ever&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qI2gAq"&gt;GoPro says this increase in performance is due to the camera’s new GP2 processor, which is a successor to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgopro.com%2Fen%2Fus%2Fnews%2Fwhat-is-the-gp1-chip-in-hero6-black&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F16%2F22675730%2Fgopro-hero-10-black-announcement-gp2-high-frame-rate-auto-upload" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the GP1 chip it’s used in cameras ever since the Hero 6 Black&lt;/a&gt;. The company continuing to have custom chips for its cameras is a tactic that makes sense, as some of GoPro’s toughest competition comes from the smartphone market, where companies like Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;and Google&lt;/a&gt; are taking the same approach. The GP2 also allows the Hero 10 to be phone-like in a few ways, from its very responsive touchscreen to the heavy video processing that it's doing with things like local tone mapping and improved noise reduction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u74tCr"&gt;Arguably, though, one of the most smartphone-esque features is the camera's ability to upload videos to the cloud while it’s charging. However, doing so will require &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgopro.com%2Fen%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fsubscribe-to-gopro-subscription%2FGoProPlusYearly.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F16%2F22675730%2Fgopro-hero-10-black-announcement-gp2-high-frame-rate-auto-upload" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a GoPro subscription&lt;/a&gt;, which is $5 a month or $50 a year. The subscription also gets you $100 off the camera, bringing its price of $499 down to $399, and it also includes access to GoPro’s &lt;a href="https://community.gopro.com/t5/en/GoPro-Subscription-Camera-Replacement-FAQ/ta-p/394296"&gt;damaged camera replacement program&lt;/a&gt;. The launch price, though, represents the slow creep up of the cost of GoPro’s cameras — without a subscription, the Hero 9 cost $450 at launch, which was itself up from $399 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20892060/gopro-hero-8-black-mounitng-system-software-specs-price-ship"&gt;with the Hero 8&lt;/a&gt;. This year, of course, there’s also the possible factor of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;the ever-present chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ihdly_jTD5S3x-1x5hazefgXzEw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22853035/UuWJ4Owe.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GoPro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GoPro continues to push its subscription by offering discounts and adding new features that rely on it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="buOYUB"&gt;For those who don’t want a subscription, it’s also easier to get footage off the camera with your smartphone. GoPro says the new chip makes wireless transfers to its app 30 percent faster, and there’s also a new option to transfer your footage with an honest-to-goodness cable for those really looking for reliable, fast offloading.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ikY9y85R8pkH_IzQX2fuEkas-HQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22853257/GPOP.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GoPro’s maximum horizon leveling mixed with HyperSmooth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QOYQaD"&gt;The new camera also comes with a few smaller improvements that make it more appealing. The camera’s “horizon leveling” feature, where it tries to keep the horizon as a straight line, lets the camera tilt up to 45 degrees before the sky starts moving, compared to the 27 degrees from the Hero 9. Unfortunately, the improved horizon leveling isn’t available on the camera’s highest resolutions and frame rates, as it’s limited to 4K at 60 frames per second and 2.7K or 1080 at 120.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fiem0Y"&gt;The still photos the camera takes are also getting a resolution bump, from 20MP to 23MP, with still frames pulled from video reaching 19.6MP when shooting in the camera’s 5K 4:3 mode and 15.8MP when shooting in the 5.3K60 mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mooYPB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Hero 10 has some quality-of-life improvements&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yo91xI"&gt;GoPro also says that a new generation of its HyperSmooth stabilization feature can be used while you’re streaming live — though getting the highest video quality from your streams will also require a GoPro subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWNh8U"&gt;If you had a Hero 9 and bought some of GoPro’s Mod add-ons, the company says most of them should be compatible — including the Max Lens Mod, though support for it will be coming in a future software update. Even the stock lens gets a bit of improvement, though, with GoPro saying that it should repeal water easier and be harder to scratch. (And, of course, it’s still removable.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The GoPro Hero10: small step for the Hero10, big leap for GoPro</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A familiar body, but with all-new brains&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="ObBlrn"&gt;Last year GoPro did a complete overhaul of its Hero action camera lineup with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;GoPro Hero9&lt;/a&gt;. It added a front-facing screen, 5K filming, and more battery life. This year’s GoPro Hero10 is an iterative update that builds on the foundation laid by the 9. But while the $500 Hero10 looks almost identical to the Hero9, there is one big change that sets the stage for much bigger things to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="msg5t9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10755081"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UlNfDg"&gt;Although GoPro claims the Hero10 is 3 percent lighter than the Hero9 (153g vs. 158g), it feels identical in my hands. The one distinguishing feature between the two models is the blue labeling on the Hero10, versus the silver decals on the Hero9. There is a grippy, rubber finish; stowable mounting prongs; two physical rubber buttons for power, mode switching, and recording; two screens; and a latching battery, USB-C port, and microSD card slot compartment. GoPro claims the removable lens covers are more scratch resistant and water-repelling, while at the same time producing less ghosting. I didn’t have any trouble with my Hero9’s lens cover, but more protection is always welcomed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H_JiZxMHZkOOxjfIA4ZowFUXddc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22851873/bfarsace_210909_4746_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hero 10 has the same hardware as the Hero 9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6D4cmdRZzXPAqPO9hALVAvQRIUo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22851869/bfarsace_210909_4746_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a rubber record button on the top of the camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ETShAt2tvAjhrC-Ao5HWjfWOGiw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22851867/bfarsace_210909_4746_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rubber button on the side of the camera is for power and mode switching.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmlCGp"&gt;Internally the GoPro Hero10 is getting a big upgrade with the new GP2 processor. This is the first processor change to the Hero lineup since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/6/16388394/hero-6-black-hands-on-sample-video-photos"&gt;Hero6&lt;/a&gt; that came out in 2017, and it provides a much needed speed update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UK4Fga"&gt;First, GoPro claims the Hero10 can upload footage to your phone or the cloud 30 percent faster because of the GP2 processor. And for the first time in the Hero lineup, you can plug your GoPro directly into your phone for 50 percent faster uploads to your device via GoPro’s Quik app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zjHug"&gt;Second, the front screen now has a higher frame rate, even though it is exactly the same hardware as the Hero9. In most modes you will now see a 30fps image on that front screen. I also noticed there is a lot less lag on the front screen when actively recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3kGDI"&gt;But more importantly, the third speed boost, and the most notable one, is that the Hero10 can capture content quicker. In photo mode, the Hero10 both takes and saves a photo much faster than the Hero9. I was able to take three HDR photos on the Hero10 before a single photo was done processing on the Hero9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XlsuM"&gt;That speed is also noticeable when stopping a video recording, where the Hero10 is able to save the recorded video faster so you can get back to the live view and menus. All of that being said, there is still a lag that I find especially annoying when attempting to snap photos. The system is still far from perfect for a quick photo capture. But with higher resolution screen grabs from the video you don’t have to worry about snapping stills at all.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f9Uteno0sjpm9y_9oh2vnA5ma4w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22851866/bfarsace_210909_4746_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New this year is 5.3K filming at 60fps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kgHlVt"&gt;The Hero10 can grab 19.6-megapixel photos from 5.3K 4:3 video. That’s up from 12-megapixel frame grabs in 4K 4:3 video on the Hero9. In a 16:9 frame, the Hero10 can provide up to 15.8-megapixel photos from 5.3K video, where the Hero9 maxed out at 14.7-megapixel photos from 5K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSN3IX"&gt;Although this is the same 23.6-megapixel sensor that was used in the Hero9, GoPro claims the GP2 processor can get more out of it. The Hero10 takes photos in four modes: live burst, which continuously captures images as you hold down the shutter; burst, for a set amount of photos taken in one burst; night; and standard photo. There are also four color processing options that range from SuperPhoto for the most in-camera color and contrast processing, to RAW that provides the flattest image for post color work. Across the board, the photos are punchy in perfect lighting but take on a lot of grain in lower light, even in night mode. I’ve never viewed a GoPro camera as a photo-first tool, and even with the higher megapixel photos, this camera is best in video mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oLoJEg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10755129"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5 id="nDYPfc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photos taken with the GoPro Hero10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p id="AbtIyP"&gt;The Hero10 can shoot 5.3K video at 60fps, 4K at 120fps, and 2.7K at 240fps. That is a frame rate boost at every resolution compared to the Hero9, and that 5.3K60 setting is really great for dreamy shots of water or snow flying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtLK4t"&gt;GoPro is also releasing HyperSmooth 4.0, GoPro’s in-body stabilization software, with the Hero10. Long gone are the days of needing a gimbal for a GoPro. There are three stabilization levels: boost, standard, or off. Boost crops your image the most but provides the best stabilization. With HyperSmooth 4.0 also comes an extended tilt limit of its horizon leveling feature, letting you get more sideways while still maintaining a level shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CiTKta"&gt;If GoPro continues to improve this feature, I could see there being a day where needing to mount your GoPro level to the horizon is no more, much like Insta360’s micro action camera, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22319707/insta360-go-2-action-camera-test-price-specs-features"&gt;the Go 2&lt;/a&gt;, that supports 360-degree horizontal leveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyvihk"&gt;The Hero10 also uses the same batteries as the Hero9, although at the highest capture resolutions, like the new 5.3K 60fps, you will see greater battery drain. I was needing two batteries to get through a full day of casual filming in these high resolutions as opposed to one battery for a day of casual filming with the Hero9.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Qwwu54J95fUzcJwg0VOAyZrhVM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22851872/bfarsace_210909_4746_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hero 10 is still waterproof up to 33 feet without external housing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kNJCBl"&gt;The Hero9 and Hero10 footage is almost indistinguishable once exported. With the Hero10’s 5.3K footage there is a teeny-tiny bit more room to punch in, but unless you are a 60fps super fan, I think most Hero9 users won’t need to upgrade this year. GoPro claims the GP2 processor also allows for local tone mapping and 3D noise reduction in it’s video algorithms, not just in photos, which should provide for better low-light performance and better detail in small, typically tough to film places such as blades of grass. But while I found the Hero10 to have slightly better low-light performance, there is still a lot of smoothing and noise happening to the image, and there is still a graininess to the image when lighting conditions are not perfect. Check out our video above for loads of samples where you can see that this camera still performs best on sunny, blue sky days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8A8SbS"&gt;The last change in image is in the color differences between the two cameras. This year GoPro is natively setting the Hero10’s color preset to natural as opposed to vivid, or “GoPro Color” on the Hero9. Although, again, you really have to pixel peep to see a difference between the two settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCjsVF"&gt;There are a few features I didn’t get to test in my time with the Hero10 that will be rolling out in a large software update coming on November 16th. The Hero10 will be getting Max lens mod support, a few additional resolutions including 24fps at all resolutions, and the SuperView lens at 5.3K 30, 25, and 24fps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FOGob5LpGiSXwmrY9FXGHJc0RUo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22851868/bfarsace_210909_4746_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At $500, the Hero 10 is the most expensive Hero camera since the Hero6 launched in 2017.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HpL6yk"&gt;The Hero10 remains a great action camera because of its size, durability, and 5.3K 60fps abilities. There is simply no other camera this size that is this powerful, and if you currently own a Hero8 or older, the Hero10 will feel like a huge upgrade. But I don’t think it’s a big enough leap forward for Hero9 users unless you need that buttery 5.3K 60fps or have to have the latest and greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GY1hBA"&gt;The Hero10 is also very expensive. It retails for $500 without a GoPro subscription, $400 for existing GoPro subscribers, or $400 for new subscribers with an included year of GoPro subscription. This is the most expensive Hero camera GoPro has put out since it last updated the processor in the Hero6. For a hundred dollars less, the Hero9 is still plenty capable and still available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe5uCu"&gt;But, with all of that being said, the GP2 processor sends a very clear sign that GoPro isn’t done pushing the limits of this small, action camera. When GoPro released the GP1 processor in the Hero6, GoPro was facing an incredibly rocky future after its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/15/14922328/gopro-karma-drone-review"&gt;failed attempt&lt;/a&gt; at making a drone and a gimbal. GoPro decided with the GP1, its first custom-made processor, to slim down the company and focus solely on Hero Blacks, 360 cameras such as the Fusion then the Max, and its subscription service. Instead of going big in many directions, it set out to make a select few really great products that had enough features for the pros but were easy enough for a hobbyist to pick up, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPMN4W"&gt;The result is a balanced camera that provides plenty of resolutions for any task, an easy-to-use UI, and a subscription service worth its price. If GP1 is any indicator of how far GoPro can push its systems, the next few years looks very promising for the Hero lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="LNtu5R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10755247"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="flyhpb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429319/lucid-motors-air-electric-sedan-price-specs-range-reveal"&gt;Lucid Motors’ Air Dream Edition&lt;/a&gt; has received an Environmental Protection Agency-rated range of 520 miles, making it the longest-range EV ever rated by the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNnVJP"&gt;The EPA rating certifies Lucid’s claim from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21358613/lucid-motor-air-electric-vehicle-ev-range-517-miles"&gt;over a year ago&lt;/a&gt; that its forthcoming electric sedan would be the longest range production EV on the market. It also represents a victory for Lucid Motors CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/23/13723308/lucid-motors-vs-tesla-electric-luxury-car-concept-design"&gt;who led development of the Model S when he worked at Tesla&lt;/a&gt; and has said that the Air will outmatch Elon Musk’s company in terms of range, luxury, acceleration, and price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7a2gA"&gt;The Air Dream Edition bests the longest-range Tesla, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292629/tesla-model-3-long-range-plus-epa-rating-aerodynamic-wheels-mass-reduction-efficiency"&gt;the Model S Long Range Plus&lt;/a&gt;, by over 100 miles. But that added range will come at a cost, with the Dream Edition with 19-inch wheels starting at $169,000. If that sticker price is too spicy for you, it may be best to wait until 2022, when Lucid plans to release a base model that starts at $77,400 (or $69,900 with the federal EV tax credit). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VdRQwm"&gt;The EPA also rated the various trim levels, such as the Dream Edition with 21-inch wheels (481 miles), Dream Edition Performance (471 miles with 19-inch wheels and 451 miles with 21-inch wheels), and the Grand Touring (516 miles with 19-inch wheels and 469 miles with 21-inch wheels). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Zu2GuN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Air’s 113kWh battery pack, as well as its aerodynamic design, help contribute to the vehicle’s impressive range&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OFHr41"&gt;The Air’s 113kWh battery pack, as well as its aerodynamic design, help contribute to the vehicle’s impressive range. Of course, range is highly subjective and the EPA rating is meant to present a snapshot of the Air’s performance under the specific conditions of the agency’s testing process. It typically excludes factors such as steep hill climbing and the effects of cold weather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYjbbV"&gt;“The EPA estimates, including EV range, are meant to be a general guideline for consumers when comparing vehicles,” the agency says &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/explaining-electric-plug-hybrid-electric-vehicles"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;. “Just like ‘your mileage may vary’ for gasoline vehicles, your range will vary for EVs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2e7l0f"&gt;EV range is determined independently by the EPA, as well as Europe’s Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), which are typically more optimistic than the EPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mYXtUg"&gt;The Newark, California-based company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594177/lucid-motors-spac-nasdaq-saudi-arabia-ev-startup"&gt;which recently went public&lt;/a&gt;, is gearing up to start &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547202/lucid-motors-air-electric-vehicle-hands-on-test-drive"&gt;delivering its first vehicles to customers later this year&lt;/a&gt;, and it has already built more than 100 near-final quality versions at its new factory in Arizona. Lucid is hosting a production preview at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21739985/lucid-motors-ev-factory-construction-arizona"&gt;Advanced Manufacturing Plant factory&lt;/a&gt; (known as AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona at the end of September. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Make iPhone 13 preorders a one-step process on Friday by following these steps  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_vNfkWDiabkczCTpDc4TicD6fM=/277x0:1456x786/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866078/image__4_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The process lets you make your selection ahead of preorders opening.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Apple.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bQuvga"&gt;If you’re planning on preordering one of Apple’s new iPhone 13 models at 8AM ET on Friday, September 17th, you might be interested to know that &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-offers-more-ways-to-shop-for-the-iphone-13-lineup-ipad-and-ipad-mini/"&gt;Apple says&lt;/a&gt; customers can pre-register their details to make the checkout process a little easier. Now, before you say anything, I completely agree that the idea of &lt;em&gt;pre-registering &lt;/em&gt;for a &lt;em&gt;preorder&lt;/em&gt; sounds ridiculous. But if you’re someone who wants to complete the preorder as quickly as possible to guarantee an early ship date during a time of global component shortages, it’s a useful trick to know. Just be aware that this process is only available until midnight on Thursday, Eastern Time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xuY6R"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/13/iphone-upgrade-program-iphone-12/?Bibblio_source=true"&gt;isn’t the first time Apple has offered pre-registration&lt;/a&gt;. But previously this route appears to have been reserved for customers on the iPhone Upgrade Program, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/iphone-13-pre-orders-get-ready/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, a 24-month payment plan that includes AppleCare Plus and offers a phone upgrade each year. But now anyone can enter their details early to buy a phone with far less hassle on launch day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QU0o9c"&gt;To pre-register, head over to the Apple Store app or &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone"&gt;Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt; to get started. Anyone on the upgrade plan will have their upgrade eligibility checked and credit lines approved. Other customers can pick out their preferred iPhone model, register their carrier status, enter payment details, and pick out accessories and / or an AppleCare Plus plan. Just be aware that some users are reporting seeing a “Your iPhone pre-order has expired” error message, which &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/16/expired-phone-13-pre-order-message-glitch/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; appears to be a glitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69Xkgk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 16th, 9:35AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added link to Apple’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-offers-more-ways-to-shop-for-the-iphone-13-lineup-ipad-and-ipad-mini/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;press release&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp begins testing a yellow pages-style business directory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QWoGji3-OfC6t9PD760h3gqVqT0=/0x0:3840x2560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69865539/E_Vsa4mVEAEul1L.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vvQOnZ"&gt;WhatsApp is piloting a new business directory in São Paulo, Brazil that lets users find local shops and services with a presence on the app, the service’s head &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1438175348533829635"&gt;Will Cathcart has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Screenshots show how WhatsApp will show businesses sorted by categories like “grocery store” and “restaurant,” before letting users chat directly with them. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/whatsapp-business-idUSKBN2GB1SV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the test will include thousands of businesses in the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MbTnmT"&gt;Although the Facebook-owned messaging service is most famous as a person-to-person messaging service, e-commerce has become an increasingly important part of its offering in recent years. As of last October, WhatsApp reported that &lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/shopping-payments-and-customer-service-on-whatsapp"&gt;over 175 million people globally&lt;/a&gt; used the service to message a WhatsApp business account every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ovXeLN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I'm excited we’re starting to pilot a local business directory within &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;.  This will help you find and contact local businesses, like your neighborhood coffee shop, florist, clothing store and more.&lt;a href="https://t.co/kNvUtn7FWR"&gt;https://t.co/kNvUtn7FWR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Will Cathcart (@wcathcart) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1438175339541188608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kNeXLd"&gt;WhatsApp has offered a standalone app for small businesses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/19/16908810/whatsapp-business-app-launch-small-businesses"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and since then has added features like support for product catalogs and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163106/whatsapp-carts-feature-shopping-in-app-ecommerce"&gt;shopping carts&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22420029/whatsapp-payments-brazil-launch-regulations-fight"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552325/whatsapp-payment-service-india-launches-regulatory-approval-upi-graded-ncpi"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also started offering in-app payments, letting users make purchases &lt;a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/payments/business/br"&gt;directly from businesses&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to sending money to friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RefIMP"&gt;But this e-commerce push created problems for WhatsApp earlier this year when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;updated its privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;. The changes were widely interpreted as giving WhatsApp the ability to share data from people’s personal chats with Facebook, when in fact the changes only applied to chats with businesses, which may see data stored on Facebook servers. The new policy generated an outcry, with WhatsApp competitors &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1349014065931284480"&gt;Telegram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218989/signal-new-signups-whatsapp-facebook-privacy-controversy-elon-musk"&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt; reporting a surge in new users in response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYHYHY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1438175348533829635"&gt;Cathcart said&lt;/a&gt; WhatsApp is not logging users’ location or which businesses they browse when using the new directory feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R79zDw"&gt;As well as its app for small businesses, WhatsApp also offers a WhatsApp Business API to connect larger businesses with customers. It’s notable for being one of the few ways WhatsApp is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/1/17636418/facebook-whatsapp-ads-monetize"&gt;monetized directly&lt;/a&gt;, since it currently doesn’t show ads like Facebook and Instagram. Although WhatsApp reportedly backed down from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069422/facebook-whatsapp-ads-sales-advertising-plans"&gt;immediate plans to show in-app ads last year&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s vice president of business messaging Matt Idema told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that “over the long term” he expects ads to be part of WhatsApp’s business model “in some form or another.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gV08Nt"&gt;Although the pilot is limited to one city in Brazil for now, Idema said that India and Indonesia were among the candidates for expansion in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1D3PE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqhV5y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Electric scooter startup Gogoro is going public</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WnoYYOUurldpR7Kv0Ai4NHOz138=/450x0:2880x1620/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69865521/gogoro_1_burnout.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Gogoro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cOGFX8"&gt;Gogoro is the latest EV company to jump on the trend of going public by merging with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt;, or SPAC. The Taiwanese e-scooter and battery-swapping tech startup announced Thursday that it will combine with a SPAC called Poema Global Holdings, which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The deal — which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022 — will net Gogoro around $550 million, and will value the startup at more than $2.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imR1KZ"&gt;It’s a huge step for the scooter company, which has been rapidly expanding this year. In April, Gogoro announced a partnership with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394575/gogoro-india-hero-motorcorp-electric-scooters-battery-swap-stations"&gt;largest two-wheeler manufacturer&lt;/a&gt; in the world to bring its electric scooter and battery tech to India. That was Gogoro’s most major push outside of Taiwan to date — until May, when it announced an expansion into China through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440780/gogoro-china-electric-scooters-battery-swap-dcj-yadea"&gt;two more partnerships with established local players&lt;/a&gt;. Then, in June, Gogoro announced a &lt;a href="https://about.bach.gogoro.com/news/foxconn-gogoro-partnership-battery-swapping-smartscooters/"&gt;partnership with Taiwanese manufacturing giant Foxconn&lt;/a&gt; — which has been rapidly pushing into electric vehicles — that is supposed to “accelerate Gogoro’s global expansion” even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUFk5x"&gt;Foxconn is contributing an undisclosed amount to the so-called “Private Investment in Public Equity” portion of the SPAC merger — essentially a fundraising round that happens concurrently with the transaction. (The PIPE will contribute a total of a little more than $250 million, while $345 million will come from the Poema Global Holdings SPAC.) The iPhone assembler is also working with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569992/foxconn-fisker-wisconsin-electric-vehicle-factory-talks"&gt;EV startup Fisker Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, and has a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-foxconn-geely/geely-and-foxconn-form-partnership-to-build-cars-for-other-automakers-idUSKBN29I0P9"&gt;deal with China’s largest private automaker&lt;/a&gt;, Geely. It’s also been developing its own EV platform for other automakers to use. (At least one of its forays into EVs has failed, though, as &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/Apple-supplier-Foxconn-s-EV-project-with-China-s-Byton-halted"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reported this week&lt;/a&gt; that Foxconn has walked away from its investment in struggling Chinese startup Byton.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnI2Ud"&gt;Founded in 2011 by a pair of former HTC executives, Gogoro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7484171/gogoro-smartscooter-electric-scooter-removeable-battery"&gt;came out of stealth mode at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show&lt;/a&gt; where it revealed a slick electric scooter powered by two small swappable batteries. (In fact, it won our “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/9/7509787/verge-awards-best-of-ces-2015"&gt;best in show&lt;/a&gt;“ award that year.) The company has spent the six years since executing on the vision it laid out during that debut: building out an expansive network of battery-swapping stations across Taiwan that make it easy for owners to quickly “recharge” their scooters. Gogoro takes the tech even further, though, by letting those battery-swap stations interact with — and occasionally help power— the local electrical grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1oD1n"&gt;The company has also toyed with some other ideas along the way. It has offered its two-wheelers up for a number of different scooter-sharing programs around the world. And it also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344679/gogoro-eeyo-1s-e-bike-review-score-price-date"&gt;released a “sports car” of an e-bike in 2020&lt;/a&gt; meant to promote an all-in-one motor that the company designed.&lt;/p&gt;
