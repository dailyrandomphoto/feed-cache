    <title>Hulu with Live TV is raising its price to $70 but will include the Disney Bundle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vQ7N9gJcn19GhCLnNhCVFdNM5Bo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70168419/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tO2ysq"&gt;Hulu with Live TV is getting another price hike, but the subscription will now include Disney Plus and ESPN Plus at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHwvay"&gt;Beginning December 21st, Hulu with Live TV’s monthly subscription cost will jump from its current price of $65 per month to $70 per month for its ad-supported tier. Its ad-free live TV package, meanwhile, will jump from $71 per month to $76 per month when the change goes into effect. The new pricing will apply to both new subscribers and those already paying for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMkPso"&gt;With the change, both of Hulu’s live TV packages will include ESPN Plus as well as Disney Plus, which cost $7 and $8 per month, respectively. That’s a major benefit to anyone currently paying for one or either of those services in addition to their Hulu with Live TV package. It’s less so, however, for subscribers &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; interested in Hulu with Live TV. The service last &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570259/hulu-live-tv-price-increase-cable-sports-news-virtual-bundle-disney"&gt;got a price hike&lt;/a&gt; around this same time last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlZaIU"&gt;Currently, that makes Hulu the most expensive among similarly priced live TV streaming services like YouTube TV and Fubo TV — both of which start at around $65 per month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ISMvS"&gt;Hulu’s primary streaming service sans live TV just got a price hike as well last month. The streaming service, which hosts Disney’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21362271/disney-20th-century-fox-television-tv-studio-name-rebrand"&gt;20th Television&lt;/a&gt; catalog, as well as other more adult-leaning content, now costs $7 per month (ad-supported) or $13 per month (no-ads).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just provided the perfect example of why you can’t trust App Store review scores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rFx2DPvClVc8nhdFNYoS9B53oYM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70168316/acastro_210817_4721_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="61EF7S"&gt;You pissed off people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630517/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-launch-dashboard"&gt;by somewhat breaking your app&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re leaving angry reviews. How can you salvage your reputation? Apple just found one incredibly effective way — get listeners to submit &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; reviews by interrupting their podcast experience with an in-app prompt to submit a rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4O5ANy"&gt;That’s how the Apple Podcasts app went from a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700805/apple-app-store-built-in-ratings-reviews-stars"&gt;publicly embarrassing&lt;/a&gt; 1.8-star score all the way to 4.6 stars in a little over a month without any actual fixes, as developer and App Store watchdog Kosta Eleftheriou &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1460856187595804676"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s still going up: according to &lt;a href="https://appfigures.com/"&gt;AppFigures data&lt;/a&gt;, the app has been getting thousands of ratings every day since November 9th, with the vast, overwhelming majority of them issuing a 5-star score. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iEKI5P"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;How did “Apple Podcasts” suddenly go from 1.8 to 4.6 stars? Is Apple manipulating their own app ratings now? &lt;a href="https://t.co/bSAr8sFKqQ"&gt;https://t.co/bSAr8sFKqQ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/5kJKYd54VP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5kJKYd54VP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1460856187595804676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cLSaop"&gt;The app has made it to 4.7 stars overall as of this writing and is firmly the No. 1 App Store search result for “podcast.” It looks far more desirable to a new user than it might have before. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tJ4l36w1J8cs4Ok4ZBg5j-ulUc0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028458/app_figures2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppFigures estimates 6,292 five-star ratings were submitted on November 17th alone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DZqFVI"&gt;If you think there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation for this, you might be right — it could definitely be that people who bother to submit reviews tend to be angry, and a lot of people who love Apple Podcasts and never bothered to look it up in the App Store (remember, it’s preinstalled!) are finally balancing things out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ClRKH5"&gt;But do those people &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; love Apple Podcasts? Because if you really look at the reviews, it seems like some funny business is going on. There are new, positive reviews, but they aren’t reviews of the Apple Podcasts app at all — they’re reviews of podcasts themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="omaoOF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;All the new positive reviews appear to be talking about specific podcasts, instead of the app: &lt;a href="https://t.co/HCo7WCcmH3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HCo7WCcmH3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1460856197393772547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5AtQE"&gt;I kid you not — this is the top review for Apple Podcasts on the App Store: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_gjlDWMerX2-r8gik_iK5ynV0kk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028402/apple_podcasts_review.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple deems this the “Most Helpful” review of its Podcasts app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mp9WiE"&gt;Here are a few more of the “Most Recent” reviews of the Apple Podcasts app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2mG2cO"&gt;“Amazing show! Hilarious and well researched,” writes SammyAls, adding, “The dynamic is amazing, and the content is SO needed! Love this.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EjOpm8"&gt;“Mobley has Depth and Insight,” writes xbacksideslider. “Nice to listen to thoughtful and factual podcast. Far from the superficial emotional appeals to envy and self congratulating faux empathy that so dominate popular culture.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9gtRf9"&gt;“The table,” says Jkimble6091. “Being a future young millionaire listening to Anthony Oneal keeps me on track during all the ups and downs of life.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="IdJELO"&gt;I wondered if maybe this was a common confusion with podcast apps, where listeners think they’re reviewing a podcast instead of the app itself. But no, I didn’t see that obvious pattern when I checked reviews for other top podcast apps in the App Store. Almost every review on competing apps was a review of the apps themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="095B9Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“With iOS 15.1 released last month, Apple Podcasts began prompting listeners to leave a rating and review”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0pSFJU"&gt;Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s using a new prompt but claims it’s nothing out of the ordinary. “With iOS 15.1 released last month, Apple Podcasts began prompting listeners to leave a rating and review just like most third-party apps — using the standard Rating &amp;amp; Review prompt available to all developers,” a spokesperson tells us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJppJu"&gt;We weren’t able to track down a copy of the prompt ourselves to confirm when and where it appears or what it looks like — which seems important if people are getting confused — but it is indeed &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/ratings-and-reviews/"&gt;a standard feature of the App Store&lt;/a&gt;, one you can even turn off if you like under Settings &amp;gt; App Store &amp;gt; In-App Ratings &amp;amp; Reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6lQcf"&gt;But intentional or not, standard or not, the problem with star scores is there’s no way to tell whether they’re legitimate. We don’t know if someone pressed a five-star button because they loved the app, or thought they were rating the podcast itself, or just wanted to close the prompt as quickly as possible. We don’t know if Apple is prompting everyone, or just its most dedicated fans, or some other algorithmic subset that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528701/apple-rank-own-app-over-competitor-files-dropbox-wwdc-2017"&gt;just happened to give it an advantage&lt;/a&gt;. Some bad actors reportedly even buy star scores for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;their egregious App Store scams&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s impossible for most App Store shoppers to tell. We’ve even seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454468/ios-app-scam-review-3-star-force-review-process-apple"&gt;an iOS app that refuses to open unless you give it a good score&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3UShJ"&gt;These are the reasons why I suggested that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;should lead the industry by killing off star ratings for good&lt;/a&gt;, among other things it could do to prove it puts people ahead of profits in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM5ZQS"&gt;But with Apple Podcasts, the company is using the same broken star score system that uplifts scammers for its own benefit as well. And it’s a crystal clear example of why you can’t trust star scores — because everyone knows this was a 1.8-star app just last month &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/29/users-despair-at-apple-podcasts-app-after-update/"&gt;with many valid lingering complaints&lt;/a&gt;, and nothing’s fundamentally changed. It’s the exact same app today as it was then. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this look into how Amazon failed to secure customer personal data </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bAVrqxS-Sy9De24OzBAkHyvVyrA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70168309/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fn2M8A"&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-failed-to-protect-your-data-investigation/"&gt;investigation from &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; describes a shocking lack of concern for customer data at e-commerce giant Amazon, where employees took advantage of the faulty system to look up celebrities’ purchases, among other breaches. It seems that despite Amazon’s professed customer-first mentality, company officials failed to prioritize securing its customers’ most personal information. Customer purchase histories were available to Amazon’s global customer service team, with little security or supervision to prevent the employees’ snooping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="lEb6eC"&gt;One former service rep, who requested anonymity, said he remembered colleagues looking up the purchases of Kanye West and movie stars from the Avengers films, even scoping out a few dildos in a particular celebrity’s purchase log. Other staffers recalled coworkers looking up exes and girlfriends or boyfriends. “Everybody, everybody did it,” a former customer service manager says. They weren’t supposed to, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jumUo5"&gt;Eventually, accusations of employees &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015"&gt;viewing seller data&lt;/a&gt; to develop Amazon’s own products prompted questions about the company’s integrity. During an antitrust hearing in 2020, former Amazon CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21347083/jeff-bezos-amazon-tech-antitrust-hearing-jayapal-questioning"&gt;Jeff Bezos insisted &lt;/a&gt;that employees don’t access that data but said he couldn’t guarantee that the policy prohibiting employees from doing so wasn’t violated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNjFiQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-failed-to-protect-your-data-investigation/"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; is a deep dive that demonstrates how your data can be at risk if a massive company mismanages internal access to it or carelessly leaves it open to outsiders. Though &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/people-trust-amazon-and-google-more-than-the-police-or-the-government-2020-01-14"&gt;Amazon is often ranked&lt;/a&gt; one of the most trusted companies in the world, this &lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;story calls into question whether it’s worthy of that trust from its customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5OtpSH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Basics ripped off accessories, now Amazon is coming for gadgets ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22701965/amazon-fitbit-ecobee-basics-design-halo-view-smart-thermostat-clone-ripoff-regulators"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>NZXT introduces $800 gaming PC with no dedicated GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QXQwGSYrszaW5o9-tUWfzqVE3wE=/107x0:1238x754/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70168126/1636592366_foundation_h510_whatsanapu_primary.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: NZXT&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="07MzFQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnzxt.com%2Fnews%2Fintroducing-the-nzxt-bld-foundation-pc&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22791695%2Fnzxt-foundation-gaming-pc-apu-5600g-scalpers-availibility" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NZXT has introduced&lt;/a&gt; an interesting pre-built PC for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022"&gt;the age of the graphics card shortage&lt;/a&gt; — one that’s powered by a Ryzen 5600G, a CPU with a built-in GPU that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KycNI1FxIPc"&gt;can reasonably be used for gaming&lt;/a&gt;. While, in normal circumstances, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnzxt.com%2Fproduct%2Ffoundation-pc-h510-edition&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22791695%2Fnzxt-foundation-gaming-pc-apu-5600g-scalpers-availibility" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NZXT’s $800 Foundation PC&lt;/a&gt; might not be the first pick for those looking to get into PC gaming, the low availability and inflated prices of dedicated GPUs (and machines that include them) make it an interesting option for budget-minded buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="An2ch2"&gt;The AMD processor / graphics card combo is the centerpiece of the build, but its other specs are also respectable: it comes with a 500GB NVMe SSD and 16GB of RAM. And while its 650W Bronze power supply won’t be winning any efficiency awards, it should be able to power something like an RTX 3060 if you’re able to get your hands on one in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cws7-PI5Kf_72fTJ2wocAFaaM30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028365/Screen_Shot_2021_11_19_at_12.58.32.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NZXT says the machine should get reasonable frame rates at 1080p medium.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nx3fwc"&gt;Of course, having a dedicated GPU would be preferable for almost any gaming scenario, which is why most vendors include one — even the GTX 1650 included with the lowest-end HP Omen can outperform the 5600G’s graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6iWNbo"&gt;If you’re shopping for one of those models, though, you’ll likely have competition — they can be a gold mine for scalpers, who will sometimes “shuck” a valuable GPU from a pre-built and sell the card and now-GPU-less PC separately (the $900 Omen’s Nvidia 1650 could sell for upwards of $300 by itself on eBay). You don’t have to search for gaming PCs on eBay for very long before you run into listings for pre-builts with “NO GPU” or “without graphics card” in the title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eIvhsk"&gt;If you’re adventurous and know what to look for, you could potentially find a decent deal by buying one of those scalper leftovers. While the integrated graphics on modern Intel CPUs don’t match the power of the 5600G, they will let you at least use your computer until you can find a GPU. I was able to find at least a few shucked computers in the $500 to $600 range that would likely perform better than the Foundation once both were equipped with a dedicated GPU. Whether you want to support someone who likely scalped a GPU or not is really up to you — though if you do go this route, do keep in mind that the only desktop Ryzen CPUs that can be used without a dedicated graphics card &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/processors/ryzen-with-graphics"&gt;are actually APUs that have a G&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the model name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cNaBiI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Foundation’s selling point may be that you can actually buy it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6XLX1G"&gt;Since you can’t separate the 5600G’s graphics card and sell it for a markup, the Foundation may not be as enticing to scalpers, potentially preventing it from winding up constantly out-of-stock like many of NZXT’s other pre-builts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YKwKPN_HrD-EcdmOpshf89BcVVg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028398/Screen_Shot_2021_11_19_at_13.06.43.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The state of NZXT’s other PCs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vb4poZ"&gt;Some manufacturers can at least mitigate concerns of scalpers snapping up their pre-builts by giving base models low-end GPUs that aren’t particularly desirable — &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibuypower.com%2FStore%2FAMD-Ryzen-3rd-Gen-Starter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22791695%2Fnzxt-foundation-gaming-pc-apu-5600g-scalpers-availibility" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iBuyPower’s AMD Ryzen 3rd Gen Starter PC&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, comes stock with a Ryzen 3600 and an Nvidia GTX 1030 (which &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-5-5600g-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; is a tad slower than the 5600G’s integrated graphics for most games). But that configuration is almost $300 more than the NZXT, and the CPU is going to be slower — iBuyPower will let you upgrade to a 5600G, but then your 1030 would be next to useless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98P1mL"&gt;If the 5600G’s relative uselessness to scalpers helps NZXT keep the Foundation in stock, it could be a good choice for those who don’t want to build their own PCs but who would be comfortable slotting in a graphics card at some point in the future when they’re more readily attainable again. Hopefully, it could inspire other vendors, too — while some will currently let you equip the 5600G alongside an external graphics card, that configuration likely won’t be worth fighting scalpers for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Smart Thermostat review: a $60 stunner</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The budget thermostat Nest should have made&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="pKc8wM"&gt;Since the Nest Learning Thermostat launched in 2011, no other smart thermostat has emulated its core function — learning your schedule and adapting to it automatically, so you don’t have to lift a finger. This feature has made the Nest one of the best smart thermostats (lots of) money can buy for years. But just a decade on, Amazon has finally done it. The online shopping giant’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Smart-Thermostat/dp/B08J4C8871?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$60 Amazon Smart Thermostat&lt;/a&gt; can intelligently determine if you’re home, away, or sleeping and automatically adjust your climate to keep you comfortable and potentially save you money. And you don’t have to program anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="px6wKx"&gt;Amazon worked with Resideo (owner of the historic thermostat brand Honeywell Home) to develop the thermostat, and its internals are very similar to the Honeywell T9 and T5 smart thermostats. It’s compatible with most 24 volt HVAC systems (you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Smart-Thermostat/dp/B08J4C8871/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=smart+thermostat&amp;amp;qid=1637326592&amp;amp;s=hi&amp;amp;sr=1-4&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check compatibility here&lt;/a&gt;), but doesn’t support systems with more than three stages or multi-speed fans. Together, Amazon and Resideo seem to have finally cracked the smart thermostat conundrum, and the Amazon Smart Thermostat’s learning feature — called Hunches — is very good. No, it isn’t quite as good as Nest’s, but it also doesn’t cost $250. So, tradeoffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nue7FD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10875005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HtN1I8"&gt;Hunches — which are part of Amazon’s broader Alexa smart home platform — are AI-driven decisions that use data from your Alexa smart home to decide what to do with your temperature. It follows, unsurprisingly, that the more Echo smart speakers and displays you have in your home, the better it will be. According to Amazon, Hunches also uses “select other smart home devices like lights, locks, and sensors” to determine if you are home or away, as well as geolocation of yours and your household members’ smartphones (everyone has to have the Alexa app installed and location settings turned on for the thermostat). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0YTyB"&gt;However, unlike with the similar Nest experience, you don’t have control over which devices make those decisions; you don’t even know which ones make the decisions. This led to some confusion in my testing, including that Alexa now thinks I get up at 4:31AM every morning, I assume because my daughter sat up in bed at that time and has an Echo Show as her bedside clock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSQjnr"&gt;For the next three days, it turned on the heat a little too early, and I had to go into the thermostat settings in the app to tell Alexa its Hunch was wrong. After three times telling it that, no, we do not wake up at 4:31AM, it reverted to our regular wake-up time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-sjS4Nicw4w-eSg0vp726Jxi29U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019741/jtuohy_211116_4885_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The controls on the Smart Thermostat are three touch points on the bottom. LED icons show you the ambient temperature by default, then the current set point when you tap on one of the arrows.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Foqcf2"&gt;It’s hard to quibble much at this price, however, because at least it’s trying to be smart. Outside of Nest and Ecobee, few thermostats are actually smart. Most are just controlled remotely — either by an app, voice, or geolocation (where it adjusts based on whether your smartphone is at home). This is all very handy, but it’s not intelligent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3oHVU"&gt;Case in point, the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21725036/google-nest-thermostat-2020-review"&gt;Nest Thermostat&lt;/a&gt; has no advanced AI features of which to speak. While it can do useful energy-saving or comfort-increasing tasks such as preheat or cool the home or use the fan to circulate air to more efficiently use air conditioning, it doesn’t have any learning features and its smarts are reliant on Google’s geofenced home / away modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNGDdE"&gt;If you don’t like the idea of Amazon controlling your climate willy-nilly, the Smart Thermostat has a standard scheduling option. With either set up, you can also use Alexa’s Routines to have your thermostat do specific things based on time of day, when a smart home device tells it to (such as a compatible temperature or motion sensor), or with your voice. These functions are available to any smart thermostat that works with Alexa, but you will not find one as inexpensive as this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tlv1hKJQNQukGCEHtt0PV4lZhfk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019731/jtuohy_211115_4885_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazon Smart Thermostat is a simple white box that snaps on to a base, which you wire into your existing thermostat wiring. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SijpUPNp6MoMfHuKB0q4MtdXKQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019733/jtuohy_211115_4885_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It comes with a faceplate to help cover up any holes in the wall from removing your existing thermostat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Thnrgy"&gt;The closest competitor price-wise — the Wyze Smart Thermostat — is $80, and the Honeywell T5 and T9, whose hardware the Amazon thermostat shares, start at $120. Most other smart thermostats are over $100, including the Emerson Sensi, the Lux Kono, and then Ecobee’s and Nest’s start at $180 and $130, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fyte3e"&gt;Of course, almost all those thermostats work with multiple platforms. The Amazon thermostat only works with Alexa. And while the coming smart home standard Matter — which promises interoperability between ecosystems — may change that, Amazon has not confirmed that this device will be upgraded to support Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdjFQN"&gt;While this thermostat is inexpensive, it doesn’t look cheap, unlike the Wyze Smart Thermostat, which has a plasticky feel and an odd, oblong design. The simple, clean design of the Amazon Smart Thermostat will fit in with most homes, and because it doesn’t have an LCD screen, it doesn’t scream “high tech” like others in this space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqU6Qi"&gt;Instead, the all-white plastic body has a capacitive touch surface that illuminates LEDs to show you the touch points, system mode, and set temperature. There is also a small green tree that appears when you set the temperature to ones Amazon thinks are energy-saving — 68 degrees or below for heating and 75 degrees or above for cooling in my location. They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery; I have to wonder how Nest and its iconic green leaf feels about this. At least Amazon didn’t copy Nest and make you pay an extra $15 for a faceplate to cover up any wall warts left after installation; you get one included (and a screwdriver!). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="i3fzd1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The simple, clean design of the Amazon Smart Thermostat will fit in with most homes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i8FXYN"&gt;Despite the minimalist look, there are enough controls on the device for easy, everyday use — you can switch modes from heat, cool, fan, and auto, as well as adjust the temperature up and down and turn the system off. Only the bottom of the device is touch-capacitive, and there are three small markers to show where to touch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UZsYt"&gt;Most of the setup and programming of the thermostat requires the Alexa app. And, as you’d expect from an Amazon device, it’s designed to be controlled with your voice. This makes it surprising that the Alexa voice assistant isn’t built in as it is in some of Ecobee’s models. Instead, you need to have a compatible Alexa device for voice control. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_LtOPvE80jG3jALjBcjIwElY4QQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019735/jtuohy_211115_4885_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physical installation of the Smart Thermostat is identical to that of Honeywell’s T9 or T5 and requires shutting off the power and wiring the base.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="a7ZgMx"&gt;Integration with Alexa is straightforward and doesn't require a skill or account linking. Setup and installation of the thermostat is similarly simple. You will want to check if your heating and / or cooling system is compatible first, however. And if you don’t have a C-wire, you will need to opt for the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09F5M7ZJT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$75 version&lt;/a&gt; that comes with a C-wire adapter and plan for a much more involved installation. (C-wire is short for common wire and supplies power to your thermostat. Most connected thermostats need a C-wire to connect to Wi-Fi, which is a big power drain.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O6RpV8lPgtXL48kpW7TuL71apy8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23027512/1C240497_D38F_4D22_8F07_0B21AC3D1CD5.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Alexa app offers a good interface for controlling the thermostat, it just takes a bit of digging to find it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1pE2PA"&gt;Everything you need to install the thermostat comes in the box, including a screwdriver and handy labels for identifying the thermostat wires. The Alexa app guided me through installation very well, making it clear which wires should go where, connecting the thermostat to my Wi-Fi, and testing that everything was working correctly. If you are uncomfortable with wiring or aren’t familiar with how your heating and cooling system works, you should get professional help. Messing up your HVAC system will be a costly mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2Dxb8"&gt;Using the Alexa Smart Thermostat was a smooth experience. The Hunches worked well (other than my 4:30AM blip), turning my heating down between 11PM and 11:30PM every night and back on at 6AM in the morning. Switching to away when the house was empty during the day was less reliable, and in my week of testing, I wasn’t able to get a firm read on how long it takes to adjust to an empty home — this is a key component of any energy savings this device will get you, so I’ll update this review once I’ve had more time to evaluate the feature. However, you do have the option of telling Alexa, by saying “Alexa, I’m leaving” as you walk out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYZXdZ"&gt;Controlling the thermostat with voice using an Echo speaker or display was smooth — and with the latter, an interactive screen pops up for further control if needed. You can control the mode with voice, too, switching to heating or cooling, and even ask Alexa to change the temperature when no one is home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="rvCPbP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10875137"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3BRL4z"&gt;But the app was a more frustrating experience. It takes four or five taps to get into the thermostat screen, although eventually I was able to add the thermostat to the new Favorites section in Alexa’s devices page, which speeds things up a tad. Once on the correct screen, the controls mimic those of the physical device, plus there’s a humidity reading (the thermostat has a humidity sensor in it, a temperature sensor, and an ambient light sensor for adjusting the brightness of the LEDs). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUMrsx"&gt;The one other area I ran into issues with was using the thermostat in a two-zoned home. As with all thermostats, you need one for each zone in a multi-zoned system&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and they control the climate independently.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;But&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the Alexa app wouldn’t let me set the home, away, and sleep temperatures separately; whatever I set for my upstairs zone also applied to my downstairs zone. That’s not ideal if you like to sleep at 66 degrees but want your living room and kitchen to drop to 62 at night to save energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="4crZWU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Multi-zone support needs some work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EzlNni"&gt;Switching the upstairs thermostat to a schedule and keeping the downstairs on Hunches did allow me to have different set points, but that’s not an ideal solution. This is a problem in the Alexa software, as with every other thermostat I have tested in this two-zone system, each thermostat controls each zone entirely independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w93VPY"&gt;The other drawback is that there are no temperature sensors designed specifically for the Alexa Smart Thermostat. It’s possible to set Alexa Routines to use with the temperature sensors built into some Echo speakers or with compatible third-party motion or temperature sensors like those from Centralite and Aqara, plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761003/amazon-smart-air-quality-monitor-price-release-date-features-routines"&gt;Amazon’s new Smart Air Quality Monitor will work with Routines&lt;/a&gt;. But that integration isn’t as seamless or as easy to use as thermostats with native temperature sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nfsg2D968iwUDAINfSfwodY0a-0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019737/jtuohy_211115_4885_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;While there are basic controls on the device, the Alexa app on a compatible smartphone is required to set up and control the thermostat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EpowwF"&gt;The Nest Learning Thermostat, the Ecobee thermostats, and the Honeywell T9 Thermostat all work very well with their own external sensors, but these thermostats cost $100 to $150 more than Amazon’s. You also don’t get useful extra features such as the time and weather displayed on this cheaper thermostat or integration with platforms or voice assistants other than Alexa. Still, if those features aren’t important to you, then you really can’t go wrong with this device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ohct2i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to not be impressed with this thermostat&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aVJNM3"&gt;Based on my testing, it’s hard not to be impressed with the Amazon Smart Thermostat, and not just because it’s cheap. I have tested almost every smart thermostat released since the Nest Learning Thermostat launched a decade ago, and this is easily one of the best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Lh8bxj"&gt;I would still choose a Nest Learning Thermostat for my home because I love the look and feel of it, and I have more control over how it manages my home’s climate (plus it works with both Google and Alexa). However, I thoroughly recommend the Amazon Smart Thermostat over the new Google Nest Thermostat, which is a dumbed-down version of the original (something of a theme with Nest devices these days). Honestly, the Amazon Smart Thermostat is the budget thermostat Google Nest should have made.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A hedge fund billionaire outbid crypto investors for a rare copy of the US Constitution</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At The 2016 SALT Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LZoFYUcEX4FkPaTRf1ju3Jwr_bY=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70167731/530884400.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5SPRi4"&gt;It turns out the way to beat the collective will of the internet’s cryptocurrency fans is to have way, way more money than them. Ken Griffin, the CEO and founder of Citadel, has revealed himself as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790452/constitutiondao-loses-auction-for-rare-us-constitution-copy-sothebys"&gt;the winner of last night’s $43.2 million auction&lt;/a&gt; for a rare copy of the US Constitution. A collective of crypto enthusiasts, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787993/constitutiondao-crypto-buy-us-constitution-copy-sothebys-ethereum"&gt;calling themselves ConstitutionDAO&lt;/a&gt;, managed to raise $47 million in about a week’s time in a quixotic attempt to win the document themselves and put it on display to the public for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DajNmR"&gt;While the DAO didn’t win, they did manage to push the price up on Griffin, with the two parties slowly going back and forth million by million during the auction last night, each seemingly uncertain if they would be able to go a million higher with every passing bid. Finally, ConstitutionDAO threw in the towel, telling supporters they wouldn’t have had enough remaining money to “insure, store, and transport the document.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SUkRS9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This copy of our Constitution will be available for all Americans and visitors to view”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XuqpNW"&gt;Griffin seems to be aware that a collective of 17,000 people will be pretty unhappy with him, so, perhaps not-so-coincidentally, he’s committing to roughly the same goals that they laid out for the document had they won the auction. “I intend to ensure that this copy of our Constitution will be available for all Americans and visitors to view and appreciate in our museums and other public spaces,” he said in a statement. That’ll start with the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, which has free admission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttJu7v"&gt;Citadel is one of the largest hedge funds in the world, and &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2021/10/05/richest-hedge-fund-managers-forbes-400-list-2021/?sh=21da81e0eea4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; ranks him&lt;/a&gt; fourth on their list of wealthiest hedge fund managers, with a net worth of $16.1 billion. His win at the auction may only further frustrate the internet-first finance crowd, some of whom are skeptical of Griffin’s other company, Citadel Securities, because it pays Robinhood to execute its users’ trading orders. Just this week, a federal judge &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/robinhood-citadel-win-gamestop-lawsuit"&gt;dismissed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; alleging that Robinhood and Citadel Securities colluded to freeze trading during the GameStonk explosion in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BNnQO"&gt;After losing the bid, ConstitutionDAO is essentially dissolving and plans to return all funds raised to contributors, minus transaction fees. The group’s organizers say “this wasn’t the outcome we hoped for,” but they were “still in shock that we even got this far.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QeLeM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction November 19th, 6:10PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Griffin is the majority owner of both Citadel and Citadel Securities, but the two companies operate independently, according to a Citadel Securities spokesperson. This story originally stated Citadel Securities was a subsidiary of Citadel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vgwgAn"&gt;A year ago, the next generation of console gaming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430284/microsoft-sony-xbox-series-ps5-nvidia-rtx-3080-next-gen-gaming"&gt;was supposed to have arrived&lt;/a&gt;. The Xbox Series X (and Series S) and PlayStation 5 strode boldly onto the scene, with massive chassis and even bigger promises of games with better graphics, shorter loading times, and revolutionary new breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUu7MJ"&gt;But a year in, and that next generation of gaming has yet to arrive. There are still too few consoles, and more importantly, too few games that truly take advantage of them, leaving the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X more of a beta test for the lucky few who have been able to get ahold of one, rather than the proper start of a new era of gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="3O616f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10875632"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vwAMMJ"&gt;A complicated mess of factors have led to the next-gen bottleneck. The physical consoles themselves are still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22775829/sony-ps5-supply-chip-shortage-forecast-cut"&gt;nigh-impossible to buy&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428322/sony-ps5-supply-constraints-2022-hiroki-totoki"&gt;naturally limits&lt;/a&gt; the number of customers who own them and can buy games for them. That in turn means that there’s little incentive for developers to aim for exclusive next-gen titles that truly harness the power of the PS5 or Xbox Series X. Why limit yourself (and your sales) to the handful of next-gen console owners when there are millions of Xbox One and PS4 customers to whom you can sell copies of games? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Be1Y0u"&gt;Adding to the mess has been the fact that industry-wide delays (many of which are due to similar pandemic-related issues as the broader supply chain problems) have also seen tons of next-gen optimized or exclusive games moved out to 2022 and beyond. Meaning even if you can get ahold of a console, there are still relatively few blockbuster titles to actually play on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ip24V5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even if you can get ahold of a console, there are still too few next-gen games&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6GpEna"&gt;With the exception of a handful of true next-gen exclusives, like &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Returnal&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, virtually every big “next-gen” release has been available on older consoles and PC. &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; was on Xbox One and PS4, as was &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3eEBJ"&gt;And that’s a trend that’s set to continue for the foreseeable future: &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; are playable on an original Xbox One from 2013 right alongside the cutting-edge Xbox Series X; a first-generation PlayStation 4 from almost a decade ago will get the same &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;God of War Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt; games as an impossible-to-find PS5. Microsoft has already pledged to &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/10/21060019/xbox-series-x-exclusive-games-xbox-one-backward-compatibility-pc"&gt;aim for concurrent Xbox releases&lt;/a&gt; on its first-party games. And most Sony first-party games have been a successive series of reading the fine print after each announcement, only to discover that they weren’t PS5-exclusive titles that would actually take advantage of the processing power and SSD speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Asz-a230T-bzB37s2a7FcXq4X4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660013/ratchet_and_clank_rift_apart_screenshot_01_ps5_en_15jun20.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1AZrMp"&gt;It’s no wonder that on Sony’s list of the most-played PS5 games from the console’s first year, just a single title — &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;— is a true PS5 exclusive. And that’s a remake of a PS3 game from 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzgFB1"&gt;To be clear, there are always transition periods. A year into the Xbox 360’s and PS4’s lifes pan, and there were still plenty of major cross-platform titles. Huge titles like &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age: Inquisition&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt; all tried to cross the generational divide. Not all those ports were effective — &lt;em&gt;Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&lt;/em&gt;, for example, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/shadow-of-mordor-is-way-less-fun-on-old-consoles-1660387779"&gt;had an infamously watered down version&lt;/a&gt; of the Xbox One / PS4 game, a hint that developers were already starting to hit the wall of what the older consoles could do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTHjbl"&gt;But there were also already big, next-gen-only games that were taking advantage of the extra power of the new hardware, games like &lt;em&gt;inFamous: Second Son&lt;/em&gt; and its neon-particle-fueled powers, or &lt;em&gt;Sunset Overdrive&lt;/em&gt;’s hordes of soda zombies. And even some big third-party titles were starting to embrace the newer consoles, like the Xbox One and PS4-only &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Unity&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMUh0T"&gt;It’s not necessarily a bad thing that new games are available to a broader audience, either. But much like we saw in the last generational transition, when a game in 2021 has to be built to take into account the finest hardware that 2013 had to offer, those games are going to be held back in tangible ways. &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;dev team has already been frank about how memory streaming limits impacted how freely the game’s mechanical prehistoric creatures could roam or interact with each other. It’s the kind of feature that the PS5’s ultra-fast hardware should theoretically solve. But with &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; now set to launch on both Sony’s current-gen and next-gen consoles, it’s not clear that the sequel will be able to offer that kind of functionality, either. (Game director Mathijs de Jonge claims that they “didn’t really think about hardware limitations” in an interview with &lt;a href="https://singaporenewslive.com/interview-horizon-forbidden-wests-creators-promise-a-highly-ambitious-sequel/225124/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Singapore News Live&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OjOTE4FhYNQ7I45pG22GBQPvLtI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024250/Qi6iPb5.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Sw8aYe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cross-generational games are going to be held back in tangible ways&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZE70Zs"&gt;The same might be true of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22789079/halo-infinite-campaign-preview"&gt;semi-open world&lt;/a&gt;: how much of the virtual walls that divide up Zeta Halo into discrete playing areas in the upcoming game are design choices, and how many are due to the eight-year-old hardware that Microsoft is trying to support?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWiHQB"&gt;Even the consoles themselves have taken some time to work through growing pains: both Sony and Microsoft have had to make multiple updates to smooth out the rough edges of their software, and basic features, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738994/xbox-series-x-s-dashboard-native-4k-brightness-night-mode-quick-settings-update"&gt;Xbox Series X’s 4K dashboard&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22608153/ps5-ssd-speed-test-storage-expansion-m2-playstation-5"&gt;the PS5’s option to add additional storage&lt;/a&gt;, are only just now becoming available. If you’re just picking up an Xbox Series X or PS5 a year in, you managed to miss out on a lot of software awkwardness of the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDcs6I"&gt;The delays actually work in Sony’s and Microsoft’s favor in some ways here: these kinds of early issues are common for new consoles, and the supply issues mean that there’s more time to sort a lot of them out &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the majority of gamers get ahold of them. And even if the next-gen experiences aren’t quite here yet, there are still good reasons to pick one up, whether it’s just futureproofing or the fact that they do offer some nice perks in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;making old games look and play better&lt;/a&gt;. Load times &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; faster &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22608153/ps5-ssd-speed-test-storage-expansion-m2-playstation-5"&gt;in games that have been optimized&lt;/a&gt; for the PS5 and Xbox SSDs, and games do look nicer, with bonus ray-tracing perks, more consistent 4K gameplay, and faster frame rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="R02SbQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10875635"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rAte1o"&gt;It’s all but guaranteed that the PS5 and XSX will eventually get to the point where there are real, compelling reasons to pick one up over a current-gen console beyond faster frame rates or ray tracing on the same games. But where things stand now, the two consoles are just extremely pricey performance mode unlocks for games that you can already play on a console you already own; the experiences they offer now are still closer to a souped-up PS4 Pro or Xbox One X than the true leaps of which they’re capable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0jGAM"&gt;It’s certainly frustrating that over a year in, it’s nigh-impossible to just walk into a store and buy a PS5 or Xbox. And if you don’t have a PlayStation or Xbox already, it’s an especially problematic limbo, given the fact that buying any flavor of Xbox One or PlayStation 4 at the nadir of its time in the spotlight feels foolish. But for the millions of folks who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; own a previous-gen console, you’re still not missing out on much yet while you’re stuck endlessly waiting for a PS5 or XSX to appear. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford drops plan for Rivian-powered EV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uJeVaQdvEwWL-PX6MohmkLDdQ4o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70167504/mclark_210923_4776_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mitchell Clark / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSCBc2"&gt;Ford no longer plans to make an electric vehicle with EV startup Rivian, CEO Jim Farley tells &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/ford-rivian-cancel-plans-jointly-develop-ev"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Detroit automaker originally announced it wanted to make a Rivian-powered EV in 2019 when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18514031/ford-electric-pickup-truck-ev-startup-rivian-tech"&gt;made its first investment of $500 million into the startup&lt;/a&gt;. Ford and Rivian already canceled a vehicle they planned to make for the Lincoln luxury brand in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kyLYT"&gt;One reason Farley gave for canceling the EV collaboration was the complexity of combining Rivian’s electric architecture with Ford’s own software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FtnUT"&gt;“When you compare today with when we originally made that investment, so much has changed: about our ability, about the brand’s direction in both cases, and now it’s more certain to us what we have to do,” Farley said. “We want to invest in Rivian — we love their future as a company — but at this point, we’re going to develop our own vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XO6YgJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“so much has changed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J86lfP"&gt;The decision to cancel the EV was mutual, according to Rivian. “As Ford has scaled its own EV strategy and demand for Rivian vehicles has grown, we’ve mutually decided to focus on our own projects and deliveries,” Miranda Jimenez, a spokesperson for Rivian, said in a statement provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Our relationship with Ford is an important part of our journey, and Ford remains an investor and ally on our shared path to an electrified future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQ9gRs"&gt;Ford made its initial investment in Rivian seven months before it revealed the Mustang Mach-E, and just over two years before it revealed the F-150 Lightning. But it has found remarkable early success with those EVs. It has already made more than the 50,000 it planned to build in 2021, the first full year of Mustang Mach-E production, and is nearing &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/ford-aims-double-ev-production-capacity-two-years-ceo-jim-farley-says"&gt;200,000 deposits for the F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BL8Hk"&gt;Farley also told &lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt; this week that Ford plans to double the number of EVs it will build globally by the end of 2023 to 600,000. In September, Ford &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696427/ford-ev-battery-factory-tennessee-kentucky-investment"&gt;announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to build two new battery factories in Kentucky and a “mega campus” in Tennessee that will build batteries and electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZmgdj"&gt;Rivian, meanwhile, certainly has its hands full. It just started shipping its R1T electric pickup trucks, is aiming to ship its R1S electric SUVs by the end of the year, and is also working on electric delivery vans for Amazon — which is also heavily invested in the startup. The startup recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774403/rivian-ipo-debut-evs-12-billion-amazon-tesla-valuation"&gt;went public in one of the biggest IPOs ever&lt;/a&gt;, raising some $12 billion in the process. As a result, Ford’s 12 percent stake in Rivian is now worth more than $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOkauQ"&gt;Ford helped Rivian get to that point, as was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711196/rivian-s-1-ipo-amazon-ford-r1t-electric-pickup-truck"&gt;recently revealed&lt;/a&gt; in the startup’s stock exchange filings. Ford built the body-in-whites for Rivian’s prototypes — the skeletal frame that rides on the chassis — and agreed to supply “certain vehicle components... including related engineering work and tooling” for the entire lineup of R1 vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFLNSZ"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new Self Service Repair program is an opportunity to repair relationships</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8sIeyKODQ_fL0XnBmh3GLXXXxc0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70167244/akrales_190422_3301_0177.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r5nDrl"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787144/apple-home-repair-iphone-mac-parts-tools-instructions"&gt;newly announced&lt;/a&gt; Self Service Repair program, set to launch in early 2022, will finally provide individual customers access to genuine Apple OEM parts and manuals for DIY iPhone (and eventually Mac) repairs. Although this program has limitations, and there are &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F55370%2Fapple-diy-repair-program-parts-tools-guides-software&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22787245%2Fapple-iphone-mac-self-service-program-repair-diy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;many lingering questions&lt;/a&gt; about how it will be implemented, it is an opportunity for Apple to improve relationships with its customers by making repairs easier. If Apple prices the parts right, the program could also be a way for motivated customers to save money on repairs by going DIY while allowing independent repair shops to remain competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47lmru"&gt;Until now, access to factory OEM parts for iPhones and Macs has been restricted to several Apple-blessed places, including Apple Authorized Service Providers (AASP), Apple Stores, and Apple Independent Repair Providers (IRP), a program that allows independent shops to gain access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and training guides for common out-of-warranty Mac and iPhone repairs. Apple’s new self-service program — just like the IRP program — is focused only on screen, battery, and camera repairs when it comes to iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVd3Jc"&gt;Apple plans to become the main resource for individuals looking for access to parts and manuals — &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/"&gt;promising&lt;/a&gt; “more than 200 individual parts and tools” for iPhone 12 and 13 models early next year. While that number sounds high given that the self-service program will launch with parts for just two models of iPhones, Kevin Purdy, a writer for online repair guide site iFixit, found it believable. Apple, he says, could sell various adhesives, specialty tools, individual screws, custom presses, electrostatic discharge mats, and much more. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Illustration of girl at a workbench with various tools preparing to work on a replacement screen for an iPhone 12 or 13 pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1LxDtb991b4UeOa2L-dDyebr2h8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23026632/Apple_Self_Service_Repair_self_service_11172021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This illustration from an Apple press release depicts at least 10 parts and tools for a single repair coming out of one shipping box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xdhzC2"&gt;These parts are already available to Apple service providers, and the prices are pretty high because the devices are so new. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/service/screen-replacement"&gt;Apple itself&lt;/a&gt; charges customers $279 to repair the screen of an iPhone 12 or iPhone 13 Pro. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F55370%2Fapple-diy-repair-program-parts-tools-guides-software&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22787245%2Fapple-iphone-mac-self-service-program-repair-diy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to iFixit&lt;/a&gt;, members of Apple’s IRP program pay about $270 to stock up on these screens (nearly the same as what Apple charges for the repair). However, the out-of-pocket cost for IRP members is reduced to $235 if the old part is sent back, according to iFixit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="H28ygS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This removes a big barrier for Apple in the path to legislation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LU6wXd"&gt;While Apple says that individuals using the Self Service Repair program will receive a credit back for the old part, it’s not clear how much money you can save by taking this path, and Apple didn’t respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment on the matter. In my experience as a former employee of Apple, I recall that it was also Apple Store policy to not allow customers to take back old parts from the repairs we did for them (including bad hard drives from Macs). Based on how important bad part returns seem to Apple, whatever credit Apple will offer to customers using the self-service program could be significant enough to motivate old part returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNAiXp"&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2011/11/21/2578547/former-apple-retail-ron-johnson-interview"&gt;Ron Johnson era&lt;/a&gt; of Apple retail, I worked as a Genius repairing many Macs and early-model iPhones in an Apple retail store. While many of the repairs were expensive on paper, our employee training specifically taught us to provide some repairs for free to promote customer satisfaction, as long as devices didn’t show signs of abuse. Those policies tightened noticeably after Johnson’s departure in 2011, with John Browett taking over as SVP of Apple retail and &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/10/no-surprise-browetts-reign-over-apple-retail-a-short-7-months/"&gt;focusing on cutting costs&lt;/a&gt;. That same year, Apple also introduced the AppleCare Plus service plan add-on for iPhones, in which accidental damage is covered after paying a $49 service fee. Despite the changes, other former employees &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/tech/apple-retail-store-trick-free-repair-replacement-tiktok-video/"&gt;have talked about how Apple’s push to “surprise and delight”&lt;/a&gt; customers can still lead to customers getting free in-store repairs. Whether that will change in the era of self-service is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4V0ePk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The hope is that this will be enough to empower more DIY&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NLm56z"&gt;Normally, you could save money by buying aftermarket parts, but right now, aftermarket OLED screens for an iPhone 12 range from $279.99 (iFixit) for just the part to $329.99 (Amazon) for a full kit, which is a heavy cost. Going aftermarket also adds the risk that quality might not be as good as factory OEM pieces, and some parts could lose functionality, such as Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/21/11256118/apple-new-ipad-price-specs-release-date"&gt;True Tone adaptive screen feature&lt;/a&gt;. In theory, customers could save money via Self Service Repair if Apple priced the parts comparable to what IRPs currently pay. However, then IRPs would lose out on business unless Apple offered them a further discount on parts compared with the self-service program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptnIVc"&gt;Another potential way individuals might use the self-service program is to stock up on parts like independent shops in the IRP program can do. Apple might choose to differentiate the IRP program and the Self Service Repair program by not allowing individuals to stock up, however, making it harder for DIY folks trying to plan ahead for devices they’ll want to repair in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KJXvsb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfjWDQOMQdU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2RSETV"&gt;In general, it’s going to be people with older phones who are more likely to need a repair, and right now, Apple’s Self Service Repair program won’t help them. iFixit CEO&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Kyle Wiens notes that replacement batteries aren’t necessary for most customers until about a year and a half after the phone was purchased, when battery cells start depleting. While Wiens is overall excited about Apple’s announcement and direction, he believes that the self-service program is primarily Apple’s strategy for getting out in front of potential &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587331/right-to-repair-apple-iphone-ftc-lina-khan-open-meeting"&gt;regulatory action from FTC &lt;/a&gt;and even pressure from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787336/apple-right-to-repair-self-service-diy-reason-microsoft"&gt;its own shareholders over the right to repair&lt;/a&gt;. Apple has also been under scrutiny &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348240/apple-right-to-repair-legislation-antitrust-investigation-policy"&gt;from lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; over its restrictive repair practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pjIGB"&gt;Despite its limitations, there is hope that Apple’s new program will empower more DIY repair folks and perhaps give an opportunity to save some cash. And if a customer gets cold feet when the kit arrives, they might have another option: taking it to a local repair shop that doesn’t have access to genuine Apple parts. That shop could then charge a small fee and do the repair for them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rockstar promises fixes for GTA remaster mess, will relist original titles on PC</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CFYEPEaq8ErKjhYPVNcVpy-t2iI=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70166644/GTAVC_PC_Retail_6.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — Definitive Edition&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Rockstar&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aIMmFU"&gt;Rockstar has published a blog post apologizing for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783286/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-pc-hot-coffee-rockstar-games-launcher"&gt;rocky launch&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt;, which packages together remastered versions &lt;em&gt;GTA III&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;GTA: Vice City&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;GTA: San Andreas. &lt;/em&gt;The company is promising a “Title Update” in the coming days that will “address a number of issues” and plans to make the original PC versions of the three games available as a bundle “shortly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xHL3d"&gt;“Firstly, we want to sincerely apologize to everyone who has encountered issues playing these games,” the company wrote &lt;a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/393o373751k48k/a-note-from-the-rockstar-games-team-re-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-th?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=o_social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=gta-trilogy_announcement_update-20211119"&gt;in a post&lt;/a&gt; attributed only to Rockstar Games. “The &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt; series — and the games that make up this iconic trilogy — are as special to us as we know they are to fans around the world. The updated versions of these classic games did not launch in a state that meets our own standards of quality, or the standards our fans have come to expect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mjr9zh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have ongoing plans to address the technical issues and to improve each game going forward.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EIxF1p"&gt;In addition to the planned Title Update, Rockstar says it has “ongoing plans to address the technical issues and to improve each game going forward.” It didn’t specify or provide a timeline for when those updates might arrive. As for the rereleases of the classic versions of the games, PC players who already own or buy the &lt;em&gt;The Trilogy &lt;/em&gt;by June 30th, 2022 will receive the bundle for free. Rockstar also didn’t say exactly when this bundle would be released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERBtvG"&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;The Trilogy&lt;/em&gt;’s November 11th launch, players have observed &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22783178/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-3-remaster-issues-digital-foundry-video"&gt;numerous bugs and issues&lt;/a&gt;, made many memes about the &lt;a href="https://screenrant.com/gta-trilogy-definitive-edition-memes-mock-new-graphics/"&gt;disappointing remastered visuals&lt;/a&gt;, and Rockstar removed the game from sale &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783286/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-pc-hot-coffee-rockstar-games-launcher"&gt;for a few days on PC&lt;/a&gt; to “remove files unintentionally included in these versions.” The whole saga has shades of the &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; launch fiasco, another highly anticipated title that launched with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167303/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-console-google-stadia"&gt;a lot of problems&lt;/a&gt; and spawned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;a lot of memes&lt;/a&gt;. While CD Projekt Red has released many updates that have addressed a lot of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s&lt;/em&gt; issues, we’ll have to wait to see if Rockstar can follow through with its promises to turn around &lt;em&gt;The Trilogy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
