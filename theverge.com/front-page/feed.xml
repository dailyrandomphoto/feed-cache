    <title>Climate change made Europe’s summer floods worse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GERMANY-EUROPE-WEATHER-CLIMATE-FLOODS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xmm_iV-S8NWq2q5IJUlpjThQW8s=/0x66:5283x3588/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69769178/1234105132.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qo2e8k"&gt;Climate change raised the risk of deadly floods that swept&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;through Western Europe in July, &lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/heavy-rainfall-which-led-to-severe-flooding-in-western-europe-made-more-likely-by-climate-change/"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; confirms. As people around the world continue burning fossil fuels and pumping out greenhouse gas emissions, the threat of similar disasters grows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KmOIc4"&gt;Already, single-day rainfall events in the affected region are between 3 to 19 percent more intense than they would be without human-caused climate change. Global warming also makes extreme rainfall events like the one that&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;triggered mid-July floods in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg between 1.2 and nine times more likely to occur in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUplE5"&gt;At least 220 people died in Germany and Belgium because of swollen rivers and floods that raged through entire towns, knocking homes off their foundations. The disaster was triggered by heavy rainfall that smashed records as the amount of water that might normally fall over a span of a couple of months instead came down &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/summer-of-extremes-floods-heat-and-fire"&gt;in just two days&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y9sDsC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Human activity is the main culprit behind more extreme weather&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6v7FpL"&gt;“This event demonstrates once again in 2021 that extremes breaking observed records by far, exacerbated by climate change, can strike anywhere, induce huge damages and cause fatalities. Western Europe’s local and national authorities need to be aware of the increasing risks from extreme precipitation to be better prepared for potential future events,” Frank Kreienkamp, head of the Regional Climate Office Potsdam at the German weather service Deutscher Wetterdienst, said in a &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/climate-change-made-floods-western-europe-more-likely?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wmo%2FapqD+%28World+Meteorological+Organization+News%29"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; today from the World Meteorological Organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGL7t7"&gt;Human activity is the main culprit behind the more extreme weather we’re beginning to experience, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;landmark United Nations climate report&lt;/a&gt; found earlier this month. By burning fossil fuels, humans have unleashed greenhouse gases that heat the planet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;intensifying the water cycle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9GYQy"&gt;That UN report aggregated the findings from hundreds of “attribution studies” that determine if climate change supercharged individual weather events. The new &lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/wp-content/uploads/Scientific-report-Western-Europe-floods-2021-attribution.pdf"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on Europe’s July floods is one such attribution study, released yesterday by an international group of 39 researchers. Though their study hasn’t yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, the researchers used established methods to quickly analyze the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuVhOS"&gt;They looked back at rainfall records and modeled how much rainfall the area might have received with and without the influence of climate change. They started by homing in on two regions that were hit hard by the floods: Germany’s Ahr and Erft region and Belgium’s Meuse region. But with this particular study, the researchers came up against more challenges than they have with other attribution studies. They lacked data on river flow over time, in part because floodwaters washed away measurement stations. They also had limited long-term, local data, so they broadened their study to a larger area of Western Europe. Because of those limitations, the report gives a wide range for how much more likely climate change made the floods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="PySbTF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Extreme weather attribution is a field of study that’s growing in leaps and bounds&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xNhdDl"&gt;Extreme weather attribution is a field of study that’s growing in leaps and bounds. Thanks to more computation power, more advanced models, and remote sensing, scientists can now tie the climate crisis to individual weather events with more speed and certainty than they were able to just a few years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQz0fY"&gt;“This is a really exciting, cutting-edge field right now,” Alex Ruane, one of the authors of the recent UN report and a research physical scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this month&lt;/a&gt;. “Methodological advances and several groups that have really taken this on as a major focus of their efforts have, in many ways, increased our ability and the speed at which we can make these types of connections. So that’s a big advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfT9JN"&gt;Scientists will need that advantage as they study more extreme events. For now, global warming has reached about 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. When it reaches 2 degrees Celsius, rainfall from a similar event in Europe could be up to 6 percent more intense, according to the attribution study. That falls in line with findings from the UN report, which also predicted more severe rainfall and floods for Western and central Europe as the planet heats up. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu is adding HDR for some of its original shows and movies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/azcmG1crbYRBvSHCxU4QYl4eFHE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69769092/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Hf68h"&gt;Somehow, it is 2021 and Hulu is only just now adding HDR support — to &lt;em&gt;some &lt;/em&gt;of its original shows and movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3PlyX"&gt;The addition was quietly added to &lt;a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/video-quality#HDR"&gt;Hulu’s support page this week&lt;/a&gt;, noting that customers can now “stream select Hulu originals in high-dynamic range (HDR), HDR10, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision on select devices.” A new HDR badge will appear on content that supports it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUrT7X"&gt;HDR content with Hulu will be available on the usual streaming suspects to start: HDR-compatible Roku models, Fire TV hardware that supports HDR, Apple TV 4K, HDR-compatible Chromecasts, and Vizio TVs with HDR. Notably missing are mobile devices or consoles, although presumably Hulu will continue to expand HDR support over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBZLnX"&gt;The actual list of shows and movies that work so far is fairly limited: as compiled by an &lt;a href="https://www.avsforum.com/threads/hulu-shows-and-movies.3182712/page-10#post-60967879"&gt;AVS Forum&lt;/a&gt;, the list is mainly just Hulu’s high-profile shows and movies. Admittedly, given that the bulk of Hulu’s content catalog is network television, it’s had less of an impetus to add support for HDR and 4K (since broadcast TV rarely supports either specification in the US). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHoySa"&gt;Still, given that virtually every other streaming service (including Disney Plus, which shares a parent company with Hulu) has support for HDR, the addition is a nice plus here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTib2i"&gt;Here’s what supports HDR so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ff9fB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TV Shows:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="43VTx4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nine Perfect Strangers &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5KiIg0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f51Vwh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Little Fires Everywhere&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TTIQJW"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Dollface &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YG42sm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hellstrom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dxApjh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Great &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="te2ukC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The First &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="wvpT9m"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Castle Rock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iN5wrF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wu-Tang &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="iesDya"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Woke &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FL72zX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Looming Tower &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iaQ5Tk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Act &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TlcMP3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catch-22 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pbGgvT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reprisal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="svcp3p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four Weddings and a Funeral&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uMTUWV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Runaways&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="iLpQC1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="EbnJgm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Run&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>You can buy the Oculus Quest 2 again following a pause in sales</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1Rh2jfy9y_U2euHsAf1YhAgyrw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69769048/akrales_200904_4160_0265.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="arMNPI"&gt;You can now &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oculus/status/1430183158515896325"&gt;buy the Oculus Quest 2 again&lt;/a&gt; following a nearly monthlong pause in sales to outfit the headsets with new silicone covers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXh8jz"&gt;Facebook halted sales because the foam part of the facial interface that shipped with the original Quest 2 headsets caused skin irritation for some users. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596076/facebook-oculus-quest-2-storage-upgrade-foam-face-mask-recall"&gt;So on July 27th&lt;/a&gt;, the company announced it would stop selling the Quest 2 until August 24th and that it was participating in a joint voluntary recall with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) over the issue. &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/facebook-technologies-recalls-removable-foam-facial-interfaces-for-oculus-quest-2"&gt;The CPSC said&lt;/a&gt; that it received about 5,716 reports of incidents of skin irritation and “approximately 45 reports of consumers that required medical attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V86lmA"&gt;If you’re a current Quest 2 owner, you can request a free silicone mask to cover the foam by following &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fquest-2%2Fremovable-facial-interface-alert%2F%3Futm_source%3Drakuten%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_campaign%3DnOD_rLJHOac-C5egkfgockj4Nu71d_pq2w%26MID%3D43993" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the steps outlined here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7zT2B"&gt;In addition to the new silicon cover, the $299 base model Quest 2 also gets a bump in minimum storage from 64GB to 128GB. The $399 256GB model isn’t currently in stock &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=VergeOculusNews&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fquest-2%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on the Oculus website&lt;/a&gt;, though Facebook tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it expects availability to begin rolling out next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kvsmjk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 24th, 12:15PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added context from Facebook about the 256GB model’s availability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo starts offering autonomous rides in San Francisco</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QRS4NJ-BRBkyOOn4NFgJw0ZeLII=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69768955/vpavic_4412_20210111_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d3zLpt"&gt;Waymo is going to start shuttling a wider group of passengers around in its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, California — though they’ll have to sign nondisclosure agreements, and there still will be a human safety driver behind the wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsK9QZ"&gt;It’s the second city where the company has expanded its nascent autonomous vehicle offering, as the Google sibling has been performing fully driverless rides rides without a safety driver in parts of Phoenix, Arizona for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo-fully-driverless-car-self-driving-ride-hail-service-phoenix-arizona"&gt;more than a year now&lt;/a&gt;. Waymo is one of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22423489/autonomous-vehicle-consolidation-acquisition-lyft-uber"&gt;handful of companies&lt;/a&gt; trying to get a commercial service off the ground built around autonomous vehicles, like Argo AI (which is backed by Ford and Volkswagen) and Cruise (which is backed by General Motors). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjBIsn"&gt;Waymo has been testing self-driving cars in San Francisco for a decade, dating back to when it was still just a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/14/5716468/i-took-a-ride-in-a-self-driving-car"&gt;quirky-looking project&lt;/a&gt; inside Google. And it has let some Waymo employees ride in the early version of the commercial AV program in San Francisco. But now people can apply through the Waymo One smartphone app to take part in what it’s calling the “Trusted Tester” program, which is basically a rebranding of the “Early Rider” program it ran in Phoenix. (Waymo says the Early Rider program in Phoenix will also take on the new name.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="H5l9eE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Free rides in exchange for feedback and a tight lip&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IHUK0N"&gt;People who are accepted into the program will be able to take rides in Waymo’s autonomous Jaguar I-Pace SUVs for free but will have to offer feedback in exchange, and they won’t be able to publicly share what the experience is like. There will be vehicles that are wheelchair-accessible, too. This is how the company started out the service in Phoenix, though now anyone can hop into one of its vehicles there and even film and share the experience — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436584/waymo-driverless-stuck-traffic-roadside-assistance-video"&gt;warts and all&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nf1liM"&gt;“From using the Waymo One app, to pickup and drop-offs, to the ride itself, we receive valuable feedback from our riders that allows us to refine our product offering as we advance our service” in San Francisco, the company wrote in a blog post. “We kicked off this program last week with a select few and are now expanding the program to all interested San Franciscans. We’ll begin with an initial group and welcome more riders in the weeks to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeGdgE"&gt;Waymo has some 300 vehicles in Phoenix, some of which operate without a safety driver. The company declined to say how many vehicles will be running as part of this new program in San Francisco, or how many people it will accept into the program, or when it will start testing fully driverless vehicles in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmKeU2"&gt;But expanding this program to a second city is a big step. Phoenix has always offered wide roads and steady, warm weather. Those conditions will be harder to come by in San Francisco, a city that is famous for a zig-zagging road, and one where the fog is so notorious &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KarlTheFog"&gt;it has its own Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPhR7f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton’s recalled, redesigned Tread goes on sale in the US on August 30th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Peloton Tread" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/01YHN68kQAe9sFjyyD9ZW_CusVA=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69768810/2020.07.15_PRISMLAUNCH_DOUBLE_HANDOFF_3QUARTER_2500.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Peloton Tread | Image: Peloton&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZOzd2L"&gt;In May, after a series of accidents linked to multiple injuries and one death, Peloton announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt; for its Tread Plus treadmill and a redesigned version of the Peloton Tread. The more serious incidents involved the Tread Plus, which remains on the shelf. However, the new Tread has since received tweaks to keep the screen from loosening and falling off. Now &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/press/articles/peloton-tread-availability"&gt;Peloton says the $2,495 Tread will go on sale&lt;/a&gt; across the US, Canada, and the UK starting on August 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P10zzv"&gt;Unlike the 32-inch screen on the treadmill &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;we reviewed in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, this &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/tread"&gt;cheaper Tread&lt;/a&gt; has a 23.8-inch HD touchscreen with built-in speakers so you can interact with your trainer during a workout and track progress when you’re done. It also has a smaller footprint at 68 inches by 33 inches wide and a traditional belt instead of its predecessor’s slatted design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Peloton Tread" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zjWpEpX33KhcWAkiNooCRnQrS7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802610/2020.07.15_PRISMLAUNCH_RENDER_OTS_3QUARTERS_0072_1500.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Peloton&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peloton Tread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VZ1cnD"&gt;The Tread recall offered repairs for the 1,050 units that shipped during its limited availability earlier this year, and the new units will ship with the problems already addressed. Peloton also called out its safety features, including the Tread Lock passcode needed to unlock the belt before each workout, safety key, and buttons placed in easy to reach locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcWHLd"&gt;These days &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609744/peloton-update-tread-plus-treadmill-lock-subscription"&gt;you don’t need a Peloton subscription to access the Tread Lock feature&lt;/a&gt;, but given the company’s business model, the &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/membership"&gt;$39 per month All-Access membership&lt;/a&gt; is a recommended add-on. The new Tread will also launch in Germany for €2,495, and three new German running instructors will be available after it arrives in that market.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnlyFans CEO on why it banned adult content: ‘the short answer is banks’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I8GjgB3NljrJ5lgJjgl74irf-Ek=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69768584/acastro_200227_1777_onlyfans_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vohdfJ"&gt;OnlyFans founder and CEO Tim Stokely says banks were behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634785/onlyfans-new-terms-of-service-policy-banning-sex-masturbation"&gt;the online fundraising platform’s recent ban&lt;/a&gt; on sexually explicit content. “The change in policy, we had no choice — the short answer is banks,” Stokely &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7b8ce71c-a87a-440e-9f3d-58069ca0480b"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in an interview published today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8wsinH"&gt;Stokely named three major banks that refused service because of “reputational risk” associated with the UK-based OnlyFans’ sexual material: Bank of New York Mellon, Metro Bank, an JPMorgan Chase. He said BNY Mellon specifically had “flagged and rejected” every wire transaction involving OnlyFans, threatening its ability to pay creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vIjqHL"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-19/onlyfans-to-block-sexually-explicit-videos-starting-in-october?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; more generally that “banking partners and payment providers” had pressured OnlyFans — a platform previously known as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638310/onlyfans-ban-explicit-content-payment-processing-visa"&gt;a haven for sex workers&lt;/a&gt; — into banning the promotion of sexually explicit material starting October 1st. The ban will affect anything that “shows, promotes, advertises, or refers to” real or simulated sex, masturbation, and sex-related bodily fluids. It will still allow nudity, but an email to OnlyFans creators suggested that things like zooming too close to body parts could violate the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VyvLhg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ban starts October 1st&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gzKQMm"&gt;Payment processors like MasterCard and Visa are well-known bottlenecks in the digital economy. They’ve recently &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/business/visa-mastercard-block-pornhub.html"&gt;clamped down&lt;/a&gt; on the use of their cards to pay for sexual content, ostensibly to cut off platforms that allow child sexual abuse material and nonconsensual pornography — although the crackdown follows pressure from organizations that broadly oppose sex work and pornography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Ht4gD"&gt;Stokely’s comments, however, single out banks as the primary drivers behind the ban. He claims that JPMorgan Chase, for instance, is “particularly aggressive in closing accounts of sex workers” or any business that supports them. Similarly, he said that Metro Bank had closed OnlyFans’ account on short notice in 2019. Stokely told the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; that he was not disclosing the company’s current banking partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Swtzot"&gt;OnlyFans is the latest of several web companies to purge or limit sexual content in recent years — following platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18126451/tumblr-porn-social-media-ban"&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/vbqwwj/patreon-suspension-of-adult-content-creators"&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535109/ebay-sex-ban-adult-only-queer-collectors"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to payment-related pressures, companies serving sex workers face heightened legal risk after the 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17223720/trump-signs-fosta-sesta-sex-trafficking-section-230-law"&gt;passage of FOSTA-SESTA&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple and Google’s app stores restrict sexually explicit material. The day of OnlyFans’ sex crackdown, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/onlyfans-investors-struggle-9cc92523-6607-40ad-9893-4175e7966b52.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;also reported&lt;/a&gt; that OnlyFans has struggled to raise money from investors, citing its “porn problem” as a major cause. But sex workers were instrumental in the service’s growth — and despite its use by &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/blac-chyna-and-celebrities-who-have-made-onlyfans-profiles-2020-5"&gt;some film and music celebrities&lt;/a&gt;, its future &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/onlyfans-sex-workers-porn"&gt;without them&lt;/a&gt; is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s art-inspired Frame 4K TV is $200 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Frame TV 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rpVgcsh0R4DUKmVc_yF-9anmN-8=/0x1005:4194x3801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69768188/2018_2_The_Frame_Lifestyle_Image_Assets_20.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Frame camouflages itself as wall art when you’re not using it as a TV. | Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aofzh8"&gt;The Frame, Samsung’s HDR-compatible QLED that pulls double duty as wall art, is one of the more unique TV designs that didn’t die in the concept phase or on the showroom floor of CES. Designed to look like a framed and matted photograph, the 120Hz screen hides in plain sight when switched to an Art Mode that displays still imagery instead of a black void when turned off. It’s a stunner of a TV in many ways and, for a limited time, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749927639433300823#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are offering the 55-inch model for $200 off, the second-lowest price we’ve seen this year on the high-tech piece of home decor. It’s the perfect way to convince your friends you’re a person of culture and refinement while still being a techie nerd who loves large screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="StEUzN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZNP6n"&gt;If you use the larger 12.9-inch iPad Pro and want a more laptop-like experience, there are deals for both the previous-gen and newly revised Apple Magic Keyboards. Functionally the same, both Magic Keyboards augment the work and play capabilities of the iPad Pro with a quality trackpad and tactile keyboard that folds up to protect the screen. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749927298996490402#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; currently has the older model for $199 (a discount of $150) and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Magic-Keyboard-iPad-Pro-12-9-inch/dp/B09327XWMP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has the newer one for $324 (a discount of $25). The main difference between the two? The updated Magic Keyboard more adequately accommodates the slightly thicker dimensions of this year’s 12.9-inch iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BtRsMX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple says old Magic Keyboard is ‘functionally compatible’ with new 12.9-inch iPad Pro, but warns of imperfect fit","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410350/apple-ipad-pro-mini-led-magic-keyboard-case-2020-model-fit-accessory-screen-protector"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="Cmzl61"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295314"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="4tTXe9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10715671"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sLzcDa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22609444/google-nest-cam-indoor-floodlight-doorbell-price-specs-news" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google recently released&lt;/a&gt; a new version of its Nest Doorbell (formerly the Nest Hello) that lets you choose between battery or wired for power, and now the previous-gen wired model has received a sizable discount. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749927503440938157#dotnotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-hdr-video-doorbell-wired%2F-%2FA-52629447%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=Verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/nest_doorbell_wired?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; are all currently offering $50 off the wired configuration, matching the price of the newer model at $180. The newer model might be more convenient and include a few additional enhancements, but with the previous model you’ll get slightly higher resolution capture and 24/7 recording without ever having to worry about charging it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AUqG0V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10715814"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tulrmO"&gt;Aside from its drones, DJI is most known for its expertise with gyros and stabilizers in the world of gimbals. The DJI OM 4 is its latest-gen mobile gimbal, and it allows for rock-solid stability when shooting videos with a smartphone. The OM4 normally sells for $149, but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-OM-Handheld-Smartphone-Stabilizer/dp/B08CMVGVQY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1582634-REG%2Fdji_cp_os_00000108_01_osmo_mobile_4_smartphone.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F24%2F22637841%2Fsamsung-frame-tv-apple-ipad-keyboard-nest-doorbell-dji-om4-gimbal-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; both have it for $20 off. Pairing this three-axis stabilizer and mini tripod with an iPhone or Android device that captures 4K video can enhance any vlogging or amateur YouTube setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="2P5Url"&gt;While the Sony A7III camera with kit lens saw a discount last week, you can now save on just the body.

&lt;li id="FCeewS"&gt;The Razer Nari Essential is a great wireless gaming headset that gets the key basics down, while offering up added features like 7.1 surround and spatial audio.

    <title>League of Legends’ world championships moved from China to Europe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="League of Legends – 2020 Worlds - Finals" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXWfiWHD95YxHUuREgJrGhC1u5Y=/0x2:5200x3469/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69768108/1283224780.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by David Lee/Riot Games/Riot Games Inc. via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AnBQ6n"&gt;The 2021&lt;em&gt; League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;’ World Championship, the end-of-year tournament for arguably the biggest esport in the world, has been moved from China to a currently undisclosed location in Europe, Riot Games announced. The move happens just weeks before the competition is set to begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYLKRu"&gt;In a video, John Needham, global head of esports at Riot, said that travel restrictions and COVID protocols made it a challenge to hold the event in China. The move was &lt;a href="https://www.upcomer.com/sources-worlds-2021-moving-from-china-to-europe/"&gt;first reported Monday by &lt;em&gt;Upcomer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNpLXq"&gt;“After considering all potential options, we concluded that moving Worlds to Europe provided the best opportunity for the most teams and their best players to compete,” Needham explained. “We’re not ready to announce where in Europe Worlds will be held this year, but accessibility for the highest number of teams and their best players will be the key deciding factor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D6MX9u"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ku5r8LEqqn0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a3HgQd"&gt;This will be the second major &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;tournament to take place in Europe this year, following May’s Mid-Season Invitational &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22303379/league-of-legends-iceland-lol-mid-season-invitational-valorant-champions-riot-games"&gt;hosted in Reykjavik, Iceland&lt;/a&gt;. Worlds is typically a big annual showcase for Riot, with past events including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959206/league-of-legends-worlds-2019-opening-ceremony-holograms-holonet"&gt;an opening ceremony powered by holograms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21529317/league-of-legends-world-championship-high-tech-stage-riot-mandalorian"&gt;a mixed reality stage&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear if the shift in location will impact next year’s iteration of Worlds, which is slated to take place in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONC4xI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;’s world championship isn’t the only esports event to have been moved in recent months. &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt;’s The International, which kicks off in October, was first scheduled to happen in Stockholm, Sweden but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567520/dota-2-the-international-bucharest-romania-sweden-october-location-date"&gt;was moved to Bucharest, Romania&lt;/a&gt; because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545319/dota-2-the-international-valve-sweden-europe"&gt;restrictions on esports events&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6lzKga"&gt;Some of the biggest Gamescom 2021 announcements are likely to happen during the Xbox stream. The stream will be a 90-minute blast that, according to Microsoft, will focus on “previously announced games” from its internal Xbox Studios and outside partners, as well as new titles coming to Xbox Game Pass. It’s possible that we’ll hear more about &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinit&lt;/em&gt;e, &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;, and more. I’m personally crossing my fingers for more &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNsoAJ"&gt;The stream will be presented in 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second, &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/08/23/how-to-watch-the-gamescom-2021-xbox-stream/"&gt;according to the Xbox blog&lt;/a&gt;, so don’t fret if things aren’t looking their best during the debut. Though, if you’d rather wait until a higher-res video is available, a 4K / 60 frames per second video will be released post-stream on the Xbox YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VuUlqb"&gt;When will the Xbox Gamescom event begin?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lJHj7E"&gt;Tune in on Tuesday, August 24th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT / 6PM BST to watch the Xbox Gamescom 2021 event live. As previously mentioned, a stream will be uploaded to YouTube later in case you miss out on the events as they happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOhui3"&gt;Team Xbox made this handy guide to timing that might help you figure out when it’ll be streaming in your region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QmKXa4"&gt;Where can I watch the Xbox Gamescom event?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AQphM1"&gt;The Xbox stream will be presented live on &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/xbox"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xbox/hub"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (embedded above), &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/xbox/"&gt;Facebook Gaming&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.twitter.com/xbox/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. It will be streamed simultaneously on Bilibili in China and VK in Russia. Xbox says it will be captioning the video in 30 languages, but they may not all be available during the livestream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVFmUk"&gt;The Xbox US YouTube page will host &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHwtF_xFiTk"&gt;a version of the stream with American Sign Language&lt;/a&gt; in English and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4kTMJnZaAw"&gt;one with audio descriptions&lt;/a&gt;, or in German Sign Language on the &lt;a href="http://YouTube.com/XboxDACH"&gt;Xbox Germany YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Movies Anywhere adds new, AI-powered list feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9MwKIpl-7H5yQgKCuSEskoxYeSA=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69767959/My_Lists_Signed_In_Hero_16x9_Copy_10.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0wzbbd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/13/16464000/how-to-use-movies-anywhere-app-features"&gt;Movies Anywhere&lt;/a&gt; is best known as the service that syncs together purchased movies across different retailers (so that you can, say, watch movies you bought on iTunes through Google Play, or vice versa). But the service also has a fairly robust app of its own, which is getting a new machine learning-powered list feature to automatically generate lists that sort your library based on what movies you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBYnE2"&gt;The feature, aptly named “My Lists,” offers two options: automatically generated lists — like gathering all the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; movies together or creating a list of the romantic comedies you own — and standard user-created lists. Users will be able to edit the automatic playlists (to add or remove movies that they feel fit the collection), and those lists will update over time when new purchased movies are added to your library.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AI4OCNlLKT8xvQRIN2DyH9E60Gg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801409/Screen_Shot_2021_08_23_at_5.45.26_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ieG4Ry"&gt;The way it works is simple: Movies Anywhere has already created thousands of those automatic playlists (my library offered me “Period Pieces,” “High-Energy Action Movies,” and “Whimsical Fantasies,” among others). It then scans users’ libraries of purchased movies, and using both the titles that a user owns and their watch history, selects what it thinks are the most relevant playlists to show (which is where the machine learning comes in).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4NlE9"&gt;The new feature is the latest addition to a series of updates that the company has added to its app, following other additions like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21182425/movies-anywhere-screen-pass-feature-share-loan-digital-movies-friends"&gt;Screen Pass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345413/movies-anywhere-viewing-party-feature-watch-together-screen-pass-lending-app"&gt;Watch Together&lt;/a&gt;, to try to convince customers to spend more time in it. But the My Lists feature also highlights the limitations of the service: namely, that it only works within the Movies Anywhere app. The playlists created there won’t sync to other services, nor can they draw on watch data on other platforms to help the algorithm decide which playlists to surface for customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtA0AX"&gt;The new My Lists feature should be rolling out to Movies Anywhere users starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
