    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Chromebook Go is available now for $299</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OkDtMFY1fNY2D4v8pTblXqRiSkQ=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586416/01_galaxy_chromebook_go_wifi_silver_front_open.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5t2znu"&gt;Samsung’s new entry-level Chrome OS laptop, the $299 Galaxy Chromebook Go, is available to purchase now &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/chromebooks/12-14/galaxy-chromebook-go-14---silver--wifi--xe340xda-ka1us/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Samsung’s website&lt;/a&gt; and other retailers. While only the Wi-Fi model is available Thursday, Samsung plans to offer an LTE model in the coming weeks, which should be a nice extra perk for web browsing on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biXaV4"&gt;The Galaxy Chromebook Go’s modest price seems to be reflected in its features. It’s got a 14-inch 1366 x 768 HD display, a definite step down from the 4K OLED panel that shipped on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/28/22305763/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-now-available-best-buy-price-specs-features"&gt;the $549 Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also working with an Intel Celeron N4500 processor and 4GB of RAM, which probably won’t set the world on fire, but should be enough for casual Chrome use.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J3cnYOdbecnHSkqcVRz6uXKwwas=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719584/13_galaxy_chromebook_go_wifi_sivler_dynamic1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Chromebook Go features USB-C ports and a USB-A 3.2 port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Gxl6eZ"&gt;Samsung claims the Galaxy Chromebook Go’s 5480mAh battery should last 12 hours on a single charge, which in comparison to the Chromebook 2’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;around seven-hour battery life&lt;/a&gt; (in our tests) is great, but also is probably related to the differences in display and processors between the two models. Internal storage comes in at 32GB (expandable if you’ve got a microSD card handy) and the Chromebook Go includes one USB-A 3.2 port, two USB-C ports, a headphone jack, and a microSD card reader.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve’s gaming handheld is called the Steam Deck and it’s shipping in December</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SDGR1DAtGtjFDWRWvDOQwCVUOOo=/0x77:1831x1298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586299/Image_from_iOS.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5OBXhG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/"&gt;Valve just announced the Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453584/valve-portable-gaming-pc-switch-rumor-report"&gt;long-rumored&lt;/a&gt; Switch-like handheld gaming device. It will &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck"&gt;begin shipping in December&lt;/a&gt; and reservations open July 16th at 1PM ET. It starts at $399, and you can buy it in $529 and $649 models as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nOVBpo"&gt;The device has an AMD APU containing a quad-core Zen 2 CPU with eight threads and 8 compute units’ worth of AMD RDNA 2 graphics, alongside 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM. There are three different types of storage: 64GB eMMC storage, 256GB NVMe SSD storage, and 512GB of high-speed NVME SSD storage, according to Valve. You can also expand the available storage using the available high-speed microSD card slot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SaLNiQ5p6O2eYAFo41flFzd2Eo0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719673/Image_from_iOS__5_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rear view of the devices showing off its four grip buttons, triggers, bumpers, vents and Switch-esque design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YNcm9k"&gt;The Steam Deck has a huge number of control options. There are two thumbsticks, two small trackpads beneath the thumbsticks, ABXY buttons, a D-pad, and a 7-inch touchscreen. The device also has a gyroscope for motion controls. Like the Switch, it has two shoulder triggers on each side, and there are four back buttons (two on each side) as well. Here’s a legend to all of the Deck’s ports and controls:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EusVpU4mQh_E3yd8IwSZ7b9vTck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719692/steam_deck_ports_controls.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Steam Deck’s external hardware features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6rEHc"&gt;As for the battery, “Steam Deck’s onboard 40 watt-hour battery provides several hours of play time for most games,” Valve says. “For lighter use cases like game streaming, smaller 2D games, or web browsing, you can expect to get the maximum battery life of approximately 7-8 hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TFliW"&gt;On the software side of things, the Steam Deck runs what Valve is calling “a new version of SteamOS,” that its optimized for the handheld’s mobile form factor. But the actual OS is based on Linux, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_(software)"&gt;will utilize Proton&lt;/a&gt; as a compatibility layer to allow Windows-based games to run without requiring that developers specifically port them for the Steam Deck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRCPU4"&gt;Ultimately, though, the Steam Deck is still a full fledged Linux computer, meaning that more technical users will be able to jump out to the regular Linux desktop, too. Valve notes that you’ll be able to plug in a mouse, keyboard and monitor, and install other game stores, regular PC software, browse the web, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbrAYY"&gt;Valve notes that the Steam Deck’s features are designed to emulate the regular Steam app on desktop, complete with chat, notifications, cloud save support, and all of your library, collections, and favorites all kept in sync. And if you want more power, you’ll be able to stream games to the Steam Deck directly from your gaming PC using Valve’s Remote Play feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="STG26n"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vf0ZQa"&gt;When reservations for all three versions &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck"&gt;open on Friday afternoon&lt;/a&gt;, they’ll initially be available only to accounts with purchases on Steam before June 2021, in a bid to keep reseller bots at bay. There’s also a refundable reservation fee, and one reservation per person. Your reservation isn’t exactly a pre-order, but it does put you in line to pre-order the system once there’s inventory available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpvpfD"&gt;In December, the first units will be available in the United States, Canada, the European Union, and the United Kingdom, with other areas following in 2022. The pre-order invitations are supposed to go out before December, and if you miss your window on the invite, your reservation fee will be refunded to your Steam Wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8zEOK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-hands-on-impressions-details-valve-handheld-gaming-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; got an early, exclusi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/valve-announces-the-steam-deck-a-400-handheld-gaming-pc"&gt;ve hands-on&lt;/a&gt; with the Steam Deck, which you can watch below:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Record high tide flooding hit coastal communities last year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Washington’s Tidal Basins Sea Walls Crumble Due To Rising Sea Levels" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iuT46Kf9SaYmWGdRVW8WKJQrAqk=/0x121:5013x3463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586234/1159645477.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A walkway at the Tidal Basin leads to a flooded sidewalk from the rising high tide on July 2nd, 2019, in Washington, DC. The Tidal Basin’s crumbling seawall and sidewalks are routinely under water due to the rising sea levels high tides and threatening some Cherry Blossom Trees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Mark Wilson / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jWWNR5"&gt;High tide flooding hit record levels in the US last year and is only expected to get worse, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/us-high-tide-flooding-breaks-records"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Coastal communities experienced twice as many days with high tide flooding last year than they did 20 years ago. Records were either matched or broken in 14 places across the Southeast Atlantic and Gulf coastlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqTExA"&gt;Nationally, coastal communities were hit with a median of four days of high tide flooding in the past year — although some places suffered through more than quadruple that number. NOAA’s outlook for the rest of the year until April 2022 rises to three to seven days of flooding. But because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18511662/coastal-cities-sea-level-rise-cost-new-york-resiliency"&gt;sea-level rise&lt;/a&gt; tied to climate change, the long-term forecast is more alarming: 2030 could see seven to 15 days of flooding. And 2050 could bring on a whopping 25 to 75 days of high tide flooding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tBwD2l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“For the first time in human history, the infrastructure we build must be designed and constructed with future conditions in mind”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YBsocG"&gt;That could harm&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;roads, waste, and stormwater systems, NOAA warned. With high tide flooding becoming much more frequent, cities and neighborhoods will need to adapt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MiAcXO"&gt;“For the first time in human history, the infrastructure we build must be designed and constructed with future conditions in mind along the coast,” said Nicole LeBoeuf, director of NOAA’s National Ocean Service, on a press call yesterday. “These data that we provide help communities plan where to put their buildings and how to keep people safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6Pd4P"&gt;High tide flooding, also called “nuisance” or “sunny-day” flooding, inundates streets and homes with water levels that reach up to two feet higher than the average high tide. While low and high tides are &lt;a href="https://scijinks.gov/tides/"&gt;caused by the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, this nuisance flooding is driven by additional factors.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;As average global temperatures rise, oceans expand and push seawater even further ashore. The situation for coastal residents gets worse in places where land is subsiding or natural coastal barriers are eroding. Things will get even&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;trickier in the mid-2030s when a &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/study-projects-a-surge-in-coastal-flooding-starting-in-2030s"&gt;regular wobble in the Moon’s orbit&lt;/a&gt; will combine with sea level rise to cause higher tides, a new analysis by NASA found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozDLWQ"&gt;Real estate valued at &lt;a href="https://toolkit.climate.gov/topics/coastal-flood-risk"&gt;$1 trillion&lt;/a&gt; is vulnerable to coastal flooding — and we’re not just talking about summer beach homes. By 2050, the number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747466/rising-sea-levels-flood-affordable-housing-2050"&gt;affordable housing units&lt;/a&gt; vulnerable to flooding could triple as a result of climate change, according to one study published last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="wNh6Py"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In some places, the change has been extremely swift&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZupP0"&gt;Costly floods that in the past might have only posed a threat during a storm, might now be triggered by merely a change in prevailing winds or currents or even a full Moon, according to NOAA. The agency tracks 97 tide gauges across the US, and it looked at May 2020 to April 2021 for its new report. Eighty percent of the places where it collects data along the Southeast Atlantic and Gulf coasts saw an uptick in flood days. (The West Coast was spared some flooding because of a La Nina last year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gr7I4C"&gt;In some places, the change has been extremely swift. People living along the western Gulf of Mexico saw 17 flood days last year — an astonishing 1,100 percent increase from what they experienced in 2000. Residents along the eastern Gulf had nine flood days, a 600 percent jump over the past two decades. The Southeast Atlantic coast got eight flood days, a 400 percent rise from 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bIihf"&gt;“We’re seeing a dramatic change in just two decades, and the conditions are changing not just in a few locations,” LeBoeuf said. This change isn’t confined to the US.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Coastlines around the planet are at risk for more frequent and extreme flooding. The frequency of severe flooding in the tropics, for instance, could get 25 times worse by 2030, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/18/15658342/flooding-sea-level-rice-melting-ice-climate-change-extreme"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; has found. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Meet is getting a wider rollout on Google Glass</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Woman using Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FrQlxf2lOO9fALSFBiJQL7Mo1V0=/85x0:1023x625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586218/header_2880x1200.max_1500x1500.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;googleglass,glassenterprise,google glass enterprise&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YPLxEh"&gt;Google Meet videoconferencing is adding fuller support for Google Glass, the company’s frequently overlooked augmented reality headset. Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/open-beta-now-available-to-all-workspace-customers"&gt;Google announced&lt;/a&gt; an open beta of “Meet on Glass” for the Glass Enterprise Edition 2. Users with Google Workspace can sign up to test the service following &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/google-meet/introducing-google-meet-for-glass-enterprise-edition-2"&gt;a closed beta&lt;/a&gt; announced last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyfoVW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21516402/google-glass-meet-beta-enterprise-edition-remote-work-skype-microsoft-hololens"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;Sean Hollister&lt;/a&gt; laid out last year, Meet on Glass works differently from normal online videoconferencing. When a Google Glass wearer connects, other participants get a first-person view from the headset camera. Google pitches it as a collaborative remote troubleshooting tool for the business-focused Glass Enterprise Edition, replacing less hands-free options like capturing a video with your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A render of Google Meet running on Google Glass" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1L0q_BYB0cnu4iRMmKSP8uSt3l4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719538/meet_glass_3.max_1600x1600.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ucDBkQ"&gt;Glass failed as a consumer product, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21121472/google-glass-2-enterprise-edition-for-sale-directly-online"&gt;it found new life&lt;/a&gt; as a $999 enterprise headset that serves a similar niche to Microsoft HoloLens and (as of last year) Magic Leap headsets. Microsoft promotes a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fhololens%2Fapps%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DnOD%2FrLJHOac%26ranSiteID%3DnOD_rLJHOac-ofGlDuYCcO.zMYaHbydpfw%26epi%3DnOD_rLJHOac-ofGlDuYCcO.zMYaHbydpfw%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2200057_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__ipxesw3rjokfqn0kkk0sohznbv2xudrp3o3hpyrz00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%2528nOD_rLJHOac-ofGlDuYCcO.zMYaHbydpfw%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_ipxesw3rjokfqn0kkk0sohznbv2xudrp3o3hpyrz00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;paid HoloLens remote assistance tool&lt;/a&gt; that works similar to Meet with Glass.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook Messenger’s new sound emoji let you hear Fast and Furious quotes in your chats</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fhIkeOocq_JSq7PxH-Fe5DZRrgI=/69x0:821x501/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586197/Soundmoji_Still_3_Up_FB_Newsroom_en_US.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nDT2sw"&gt;Facebook is adding emoji with sound to Facebook Messenger. The name for them, of course, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/introducing-soundmojis-on-messenger-for-emoji-day/"&gt;is Soundmojis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsIPT8"&gt;To access Soundmojis, tap the emoji button while you’re in a Messenger conversation, tap on the sound icon on the far right, and then scroll through the list of available options. Just tap on an emoji to preview the accompanying sound and then hit the “send” button to drop it into your conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FGBYpd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are expected sound effects and some surprising ones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yQf3Vx"&gt;Some of the sounds are expected: the goat emoji utters a bleat, while the clapping hands emoji plays an applause sound effect, for example. But some are musical, such as the hourglass, which plays Drake’s “you only live once, that’s the motto” lyric, and the sun, which plays a clip from Kanye West’s “Good Morning.” And some of the emoji play clips from TV shows and movies: the right-facing fist bump emoji plays Dominic Toretto’s famous “I don’t have friends, I got family” line from &lt;em&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Furious 7&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URCREx"&gt;Be sure to keep checking the list of emoji as time goes on. Facebook says it will update it “regularly” with new sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnwnXB"&gt;The news arrives ahead of World Emoji Day, which happens &lt;a href="https://worldemojiday.com/"&gt;every July 17th&lt;/a&gt;. And if you want a preview of new emoji that might be hitting your devices soon, check out the draft candidates &lt;a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/new-emojis-in-2021-2022/"&gt;for Emoji 14.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new website makes it really easy to turn Twitch clips into TikToks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jqOCUappzfezdkJ_T26j7lhR7wE=/0x205:2252x1706/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69585922/Screen_Shot_2021_07_14_at_4.40.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crossclip’s interface.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Streamlabs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mKqmlW"&gt;Logitech-owned Streamlabs, maker of the popular livestreaming app Streamlabs OBS, is releasing a new tool today called Crossclip that lets you take your favorite Twitch clips and turn them into social videos formatted for platforms like TikTok, YouTube, or Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpgM9E"&gt;The tool is free for anyone to use on the &lt;a href="https://crossclip.com/"&gt;Crossclip website&lt;/a&gt;. It has some smart features that let you quickly generate a shareable video that highlights both the streamer and the game they’re playing. A video for TikTok, for example, might show the streamer on top and their game cropped beneath them in a vertical format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U57B0S"&gt;I’ve been playing around with Crossclip for a couple of days, and I’ve found it really easy to use. It could be a very useful tool that lets streamers quickly turn a big moment on their stream into something they can share on other platforms — an important tool for expanding their audience beyond Twitch. Since anybody can use it based on any clip, though, that also means a casual viewer could make a video of a streamer that goes viral on their own social media, which the streamer themself may not want.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ny3QhbT3-NYp9ry7TbPk5GnzrsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22718432/Screen_Shot_2021_07_14_at_4.49.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Streamlabs&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some presets layouts in Crossclip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="avA1Yc"&gt;You can start making a video by submitting a link to a clip on Twitch or uploading a file from your computer. You’re then taken to an editing interface (seen in the image at the top of this post), where you’re able to choose different focus areas from your Twitch clip to be output in a vertical video for TikTok, a widescreen video for YouTube, or a square for Instagram. There are also some additional options like different preset layouts for your video like a picture-in-picture mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llkGT1"&gt;The app is free to use, but Streamlabs offers more editing options with a premium &lt;a href="https://crossclip.com/pro"&gt;Crossclip Pro subscription&lt;/a&gt;, which costs $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year. It includes the ability to remove Crossclip’s watermark and outro that are baked into each video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrfRIa"&gt;Once you’re happy with your clip, hit the compile button. With the free version, the video compiles at 30fps and 720p, but with a Pro subscription, you can compile it at 60fps and 1080p. When the video is ready, Crossclip will send you an email so you can download the video and share it on social media. And if you download the Crossclip app on iOS and log in, your created clips will show up in the app, and you can share them to social networks from there if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMqGEZ"&gt;As streamers continue to work to expand beyond just what they can share on Twitch so they can get noticed, Crossclip could be a valuable tool to take a highlight and more easily share it with the world with just a couple of minutes of work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The game makers and artists pushing Roblox to its limits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4OCcArNNyhTGFTOjLzu9w_XMSRs=/231x0:1670x959/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69585780/Screenshot__757_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Climb The Giant Man Obby.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Creators are putting their own spin on the virtual realm&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="77pGAl"&gt;Like so many &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; players, digital artist Everest Pipkin has their own abandoned birthday world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWebjP"&gt;Last year, when the pandemic made in-person gatherings impossible, Pipkin downloaded Roblox Studio, the platform’s game creation software, to construct a digital space to host their own party. It’s still &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F5839500553%2Fbirthday-zone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577600%2Froblox-game-developers-artists" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;publicly accessible&lt;/a&gt;, a giant mountainous landscape packed full of hang-out spots and, befitting the celebratory occasion, a balloon dispenser. Friends rolled through virtually over the course of six hours, an event Pipkin describes as “goofy,” “strange,” and, above all, “lovely.” In fact, Pipkin was so taken with the platform that they decided to use it to build a new project entirely within it. The so-called &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F5987685753%2FRoblox-Dream-Diary-wip&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577600%2Froblox-game-developers-artists" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dream Diary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a little different from the &lt;em&gt;birthday zone&lt;/em&gt;; it allows players to peek into the most intimate recesses of its creator’s nocturnal mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WuZIQJ"&gt;Log on to any of the worlds in &lt;em&gt;Dream Diary,&lt;/em&gt; and you might first notice the ways it differs from others in &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;. The harsh, bright lines that have come to define the platform’s blocky aesthetic make way for softer gradations of light; colors, too, are muted in tone. This gentler visual approach extends to the audio; in “Herons,” one of the diaries accessible from the hub, you’ll hear the quiet chirruping of birds amid bright dawn sun. Be warned, though: the floor eventually disappears sending the player into infinite freefall — the stuff of classic nightmares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="awfWNa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Roblox, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22457264/roblox-explainer-game-app-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RulQxN"&gt;Pipkin, whose work includes everything from &lt;a href="https://everest-pipkin.com/#games/junk.html"&gt;DIY board games&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://everest-pipkin.com/#games/mirrorlake.html"&gt;delicate interactive art&lt;/a&gt;  to &lt;a href="https://anticapitalist.software/"&gt;anti-capitalist software licenses&lt;/a&gt;, is part of a crop of game makers and digital artists whose heads have turned toward &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; throughout the pandemic. Pipkin started exploring the platform alongside game maker and curator &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/v21"&gt;V Buckenham&lt;/a&gt;, which is precisely what Ricky Haggett, maker of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the recent heartfelt puzzler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506636/i-am-dead-review-pc-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Am Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, did with an international group of pals, including Australian game designer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GhostTownGoldie"&gt;Marigold Bartlett&lt;/a&gt;. Digital artist &lt;a href="https://maxbittker.com/"&gt;Max Bittker&lt;/a&gt; has started his own &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F7019688123%2FSheep-Dog-Simulator&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577600%2Froblox-game-developers-artists" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recent experiments&lt;/a&gt;, and then there’s the &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; works by Terry Cavanagh, whose past commercial games include the critically lauded &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/8/3300423/play-this-super-hexagon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Hexagon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/8/15/20807408/dicey-dungeons-review-terry-cavanaugh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dicey Dungeons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; game, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F6574475351%2FClimb-the-Giant-Man-Obby&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577600%2Froblox-game-developers-artists" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Climb the Giant Man Obby&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is a fiendishly difficult platformer brimming with his signature sense of humor and charm. (If you’re wondering, the obby in its title is &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; parlance for “obstacle course.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nJkD5"&gt;One of the most notable things about &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is how instantaneous it is. Rather than booting it up like you would a regular video game, its worlds are accessed from a webpage on your internet browser. You search a term or, more likely, scroll through what’s popular at any given moment, pick a world depending on its thumbnail, and, whoosh, you’re in. It feels closer to navigating a social media app, which, of course, is also kind of what &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is — every creator and player has a profile and friend lists. Because avatars and controls remain the same across nearly every game (newly labeled “experiences” following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt;), there’s nothing new to learn besides rules. “You’re just in this new space fending for yourself,” says Pipkin, “and the immediacy of these micro-games is a delight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9l9Ts"&gt;Immediacy extends to Roblox Studio itself, which is like a refined version of 3D game engines Unreal and Unity. However, there are two big differences, according to Pipkin. The first is the tool’s multiplayer component, which means numerous people can jump into the same project remotely. One person can be terraforming the landscape, sculpting vast mountains and deep river beds, while another imports 3D objects — a third could be scripting events. It is, says Pipkin, “remarkable... possibly more fun than actually playing &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; games.” The second is the Toolbox, an online repository of 3D objects reminiscent of asset stores that exist for other &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fassetstore.unity.com%2Fsummer-sale%3Fgclid%3DCjwKCAjwuIWHBhBDEiwACXQYsUDvJpbpxsbuBKJQj1ISdkZNHrmQW9XbvBhOhvgw8Jb6s3ZC2eHWORoC0o8QAvD_BwE&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577600%2Froblox-game-developers-artists" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;game engines&lt;/a&gt;. However, the models, meshes, and sky boxes available to download are often half-finished or long out of date and likely given strange, random names by the under-16s who primarily create and upload them. For Pipkin, this “chaotic nature” is all part of the charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FRXl82GtpqxPWuMshMefJIN6fHw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717872/Breezy_Bay_2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breezy Bay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lPkYPN"&gt;Having been updated incrementally over the years, Roblox Studio has become a robust piece of software in its own right, stacked with enough features for Pipkin to render these whimsical nighttime visions. They’re explicitly poetic, a tonal far cry from Cavanagh’s &lt;em&gt;Climb the Giant Man Obby,&lt;/em&gt; which leans into the silliness found on much of the platform. Pipkin’s “It’s Time” is about conversing with a hand-drawn mythological creature in a garden overgrown with pink cherry blossoms. It turns out that you and this creature are in a relationship and that your partner doesn’t have much longer to live; the game involves spending a final few minutes together. Pipkin explains that achieving the pencil aesthetic wasn’t all that difficult — illustrations can be imported straightforwardly enough — but creating a dialogue tree to fit the aesthetic was more challenging. The dialogue UI &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;comes with is locked so the artist had to hardcode their own. Pipkin describes this as one of Roblox Studio’s “weird edges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AGS9bu"&gt;What’s lovely about “It’s Time,” as well as the rest of &lt;em&gt;Dream Diary&lt;/em&gt;, is how it makes no demands on you, unlike the platform more generally, which is sustained by microtransactions. It’s certainly not unique in this respect; one can look to many other uncommercialized worlds, such as the similarly beautiful &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F3158922185%2FToyokawa-Inari-Shrine-Showcase%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577600%2Froblox-game-developers-artists" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toyokawa Inari Shrine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe it’s the scope, or perhaps it’s Pipkin’s own ideological convictions, but this sensibility feels central to &lt;em&gt;Dream Diary&lt;/em&gt;. You explore &lt;em&gt;Dream Diary’s &lt;/em&gt;connected, haiku-like worlds for a few minutes — an industrial labyrinth, a humid forest, a grand spherical palace — before moving on with your day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zrzkim"&gt;The upcoming &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F6593038276%2FBreezy-Bay&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577600%2Froblox-game-developers-artists" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breezy Bay&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sits at what could be considered the opposite end of the creative spectrum. Its developer, Tailwind, one of the growing number of professional &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; studios, describes the game as “&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Runescape&lt;/em&gt; for the TikTok generation,” which sounds exactly like a meta-tag written by someone in pursuit of the platform’s next big hit. In reality, this means it’s a social sandbox RPG centered on gathering resources and decorating an island (so far, so &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;) with a plethora of in-app purchases. However, the UK-based Tailwind, backed by &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-06-29-talewinds-plan-to-become-the-supercell-of-roblox"&gt;£800,000&lt;/a&gt; in venture capital money, has a few trip tricks up its sleeve, which co-founder Mike Allender says could help &lt;em&gt;Breezy Bay&lt;/em&gt; stand out not just in &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; but the wider world of video games when it’s released this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40oXTI"&gt;Each island has elemental deities (earth, water, fire, etc.), and depending on your behavior, you’ll either please or anger them. As this happens, the island transforms topographically. Some will end up as Mordor-like archipelagos filled with lava and smitheries; others will become lush waterfall-filled spaces. There’s a planned social element, too. If players on a server work together and decide to venerate one deity, this could trigger server-wide bonuses; groups loyal to the water god could enjoy the company of a giant oceanic monster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U6OWiiyh4S26MS8oJpWIDAGMk0g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717880/13unknown.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dream Diary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XWvteH"&gt;Formed in January this year, Tailwind currently has eight full-time employees and is pursuing what Allender calls a “hybrid” studio approach, incorporating traditional game developers and “&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;-native talent.” Their latest hire is an 18-year-old &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; developer who Allender says is “running circles around” older members of the team. However, Tailwind is still primarily made up of traditional developers, and Allender, who cut his teeth on &lt;em&gt;Runescape&lt;/em&gt; before moving to Jagex, is all too aware of the risks involved in approaching &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; as an outsider. “You can’t come in thinking you’re better than anyone else on the platform because you’ve made games for 15 years,” he says. “You’ve got to stay humble and respect what’s working.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xhsyeE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’ve got to stay humble and respect what’s working.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4O4Wx9"&gt;Of course, &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just being pushed to its limits by newcomers to the platformer; it has its own thriving scene of cutting-edge games. Some of my recent favorites belong to the burgeoning genre of “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hmpwG_DzaY"&gt;vibe&lt;/a&gt;” games where players simply hang out in aesthetically striking spaces. (Many are reminiscent of Pipkin’s work, but more socially oriented and with a greater fondness for vaporwave.) There are even experiences that resemble the art video games of the 2010s. One of these is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F378223328%2FCONE%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577600%2Froblox-game-developers-artists" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a surreal platform-puzzle game that puts you in the role of a sentient traffic cone who embarks on a journey across a series of beautifully rendered spaces. It’s slow, meditative, and strikingly different to anything else I’ve played on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I99aph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cone’s &lt;/em&gt;maker, Josh Sheldon, known on &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;as &lt;a href="https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Community:Defaultio"&gt;Defaultio&lt;/a&gt;, has been developing games for the platform since 2007 when he was 12 years old. He describes the game as a strange project, and not just because of the bizarre premise. It’s both the most conventional video game he could have made — a narrative-driven, single-player title — and a distinctly unconventional experience for the always-online &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Cone &lt;/em&gt;actually&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;represents something of a break from Sheldon’s usual work, which tends toward the more established &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; genres. His biggest hit,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F13822889%2FLumber-Tycoon-2%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577600%2Froblox-game-developers-artists" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lumber Tycoon 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has racked up 802 million visits from players keen to deforest their virtual surroundings. However, it’s Sheldon’s latest game, secretly referred to as “Test2’’ and “Projoot” on the internet, that’s most tantalizing — essentially an entire MMO built within &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; that operates at a scale to match the genre’s big hitters, in &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;or otherwise. Oh, and it’s got a boating mechanic that seems to capture the spirit of the Nintendo classic, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP42wusaHJI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xf7NAC"&gt;Sheldon says he’s attempting something many have thought about with &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; but no one’s yet achieved (to the best of his knowledge). His “large-scale, cross-server game” allows players to simultaneously “teleport into servers” as they traverse the vast in-game space. What this means is that players sailing across the ocean load into new, persistent servers naturally. The meat of the game is open-ended but focuses on players gathering resources and building abodes, either on their own or communally. Entire towns have sprouted up organically, each with fluctuating property dynamics. (Sheldon says one has been “gentrified.”) Some have even organized their own political election. These are all outcomes of Sheldon’s design philosophy that hinges on simply giving players enough tools to engage with the game in a rich way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aGhU9ODurCl9rdODod1gDIBvfMo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717881/Cone2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TBFu0N"&gt;When I ask Sheldon how he feels about outsiders migrating to the platform, he describes it as “awesome” and “absolutely inevitable” because of both the strength of the platform’s tools and the opportunities that increasingly exist on it. But for those game makers looking to professionalize their work, there’s one big caveat: &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; remunerates developers at the inverse rate of how video game stores tend to operate. Rather than taking home 70 percent of each transaction as they might on Steam, content creators actually see just 27 percent. There’s also the fact that &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, despite being publicly listed on the stock exchange with a valuation of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/03/11/roblox-ipo/"&gt;$41 billion&lt;/a&gt; in March this year, isn’t yet profitable. It reported a net loss of $253 million in 2020 alongside further losses of $97.2 million and $86 million in 2018 and 2019, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBFqCw"&gt;While outsider game makers migrating to the platform won’t likely impact the fortunes of the company in the long run (unless, say, Hideo Kojima joins the party), such curiosity could yet spark interesting results that reverberate beyond it. One only need listen to Ricky Haggett, whose credits include cult video game hits &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/15/20861155/wilmots-warehouse-review-puzzle-game-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wilmot’s Warehouse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/12/5991741/hohokum-ghostly-international"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hohokum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in addition to &lt;em&gt;I Am Dead&lt;/em&gt;, for one possible peek at the ways &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;’s seamless multiplayer components might impact video games more broadly. “Our new game has definitely been influenced by playing a lot of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “It’s been such a good expression of faff-free hanging out with friends in a pandemic. There’s almost no barriers to entry — &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;feels frictionless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SYIkv7"&gt;This is perhaps &lt;em&gt;Roblox’s&lt;/em&gt; most enticing offer to game makers: online infrastructure that can accommodate either many players or just a handful, in games that encompass everything from gigantic commercial projects to small, meditative titles. For Pipkin, it’s precisely these social elements that make the platform special. “Regardless of the fact that &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; itself is a company whose goals sit somewhere between laudable and questionable, people find a way to make meaningful spaces and interactions with one another inside of it, and they do so with vigor and abundance,” says Pipkin. “It’s compelling to be a part of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fights over COVID-19 vaccines are spilling over to other types of shots  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="HPV Vaccines In Corpus Christi Texas" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bqdzITupgWxnRt4X9xJ2WoK5Mr8=/0x2:4000x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69585755/542730796.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Matthew Busch for The Washington Post via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="brg0hT"&gt;The Tennessee Department of Health is suspending outreach for all types of childhood and adolescent vaccinations, the &lt;a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2021/07/13/tennessee-halts-all-vaccine-outreach-minors-not-just-covid-19/7928701002/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tennessean&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; this week. Along with stopping COVID-19 vaccine events at schools, the department will no longer do outreach for the HPV vaccine, isn’t planning for flu shot clinics at schools, and is taking the department’s logo off of back-to-school vaccination information sheets. The shift in policy came after Republican lawmakers in the state got upset that the department was promoting COVID-19 shots for teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gaZ04O"&gt;It’s a strong signal that the politicization and backlash around the COVID-19 shots, driven by conservative politicians and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/11/business/media/vaccines-fox-news-hosts.html"&gt;right-wing commentators&lt;/a&gt;, is spilling over to other types of vaccinations. It’s not the first time politics has impacted unrelated public health work during the pandemic — over a dozen states have proposed &lt;a href="https://www.naccho.org/uploads/downloadable-resources/Proposed-Limits-on-Public-Health-Authority-Dangerous-for-Public-Health-FINAL-5.24.21pm.pdf"&gt;limiting public health powers&lt;/a&gt; as part of backlash to pandemic-related restrictions. But it’s the first time the target has been standard vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O7e7pF"&gt;“It’s insane,” says Seth Kalichman, a professor of psychology at the University of Connecticut who’s studied anti-vaxxers. “It’s exactly the kind of overgeneralization that can occur with misinformation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EGZ7fZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s insane.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WhrLjn"&gt;The initial trouble in Tennessee started when conservative lawmakers criticized Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey for recommending COVID-19 vaccines to teenagers. The health department also &lt;a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2021/07/12/covid-19-tennessee-fired-vaccine-official-michelle-fiscus-fears-state/7945291002/"&gt;fired Michelle Fiscus&lt;/a&gt;, the state’s top vaccine official, after she circulated a memo to doctors explaining a state law that allows minors to get medical care without parental consent. Fiscus &lt;a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2021/07/12/covid-19-tennessee-fired-vaccine-official-michelle-fiscus-fears-state/7945291002/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; she was a scapegoat, fired to mollify the angry lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXUnmt"&gt;Around the same time that Fiscus was fired, the department also stopped all vaccine outreach targeting teens or children. Health department spokesperson Sarah Tanksley &lt;a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2021/07/13/tennessee-halts-all-vaccine-outreach-minors-not-just-covid-19/7928701002/"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Tennessean&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the state has high childhood vaccination rates. “We are simply mindful of how certain tactics could hurt that progress.” She said the department is planning to research vaccine hesitancy and that the changes are in response to “an intense national conversation that is affecting how many families evaluate vaccinations in general.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A1uCq5"&gt;The jump from COVID-19-specific rollbacks to generalized rollbacks concerns Adriane Casalotti, chief of public and government affairs at the National Association of County and City Health Officials. “This is a very clear case of COVID-19 vaccination policy impacting other vaccinations,” she says. “We’re really concerned about the news that’s coming out of Tennessee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfoxKQ"&gt;Carryover from concerns around one vaccine to others has happened before, particularly with the HPV vaccine, Kalichman says. There’s &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/09/studies-say-hpv-vaccine-refusal-misinformation-common"&gt;widespread misinformation&lt;/a&gt; around the cancer-preventing shot, and parents turn it down for their kids at high rates. “The vaccine for HPV was politicized, and the politicization and misinformation absolutely undermined vaccine confidence for a new segment of people who were not necessarily vaccine hesitant before,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UU6UGg"&gt;The situation in Tennessee isn’t unique. At least 15 state legislatures are considering or have passed laws to restrict public health powers, according to &lt;a href="https://www.naccho.org/uploads/downloadable-resources/Proposed-Limits-on-Public-Health-Authority-Dangerous-for-Public-Health-FINAL-5.24.21pm.pdf"&gt;an analysis&lt;/a&gt; from the National Association of County and City Health Officials. In Kansas, a new law would prevent the governor from closing businesses during a public health emergency. In Ohio, the legislature would be able to override any actions by the state health department taken to control infectious diseases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ath7il"&gt;“The fact that traditional, day-to-day public health activities have been impacted in such a blunt way squarely due to politics is really concerning,” Casalotti says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoL6LK"&gt;In Tennessee, at least, the law hasn’t changed: the state still has &lt;a href="https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/immunization-program/ip/immunization-requirements.html"&gt;laws&lt;/a&gt; requiring that kids get vaccinated before school. Instead, the policy changes could make it harder for families to get the information they need to keep track of vaccine schedules and make sure their kids are ready for school in the fall, says Jennifer Reich, a sociologist who studies vaccine hesitancy at the University of Colorado. “Right now I just see a chilling climate for public health officers who are trying to do their best to inform people of how to stay safe during the pandemic, and also how to protect their children from life threatening and disabling illnesses,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uGPCnZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Right now I just see a chilling climate for public health officers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="22hfxv"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic isn’t the first time lawmakers have tried to limit public health authority or challenge things like vaccine mandates. Those proposals usually don’t go far, says Casalotti. “The real difference that we’re seeing recently is this traction that so many of them are getting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpuAdK"&gt;It shows that the messaging and misinformation from anti-vaxxers and others on that spectrum are having more of an impact. “The most frightening thing to people like me, and people in public health is when the denialists, the anti-vaxxers, and the anti-science people get the ear of the highest levels of government,” Kalichman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYP1EA"&gt;Kalichman says he wouldn’t be surprised to see what happened in Tennessee happen in other states, particularly in places with heavy resistance to COVID-19 vaccination. It’s easy to predict what could happen next: if state health departments stop promoting or helping people get childhood vaccinations, those vaccination rates could drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqNWDD"&gt;“You’re going to have outbreaks. It’s inevitable that there will be outbreaks of measles, rubella, whatever else if vaccines take a dip,” he says. “It’s just how it works.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="clABhe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvL7V6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjAGMX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Aston Martin Valhalla is a dramatic 937-horsepower hybrid supercar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zZV9qfgwcnZ5bI1PGsU8GyOMiFU=/0x1:2400x1601/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69585713/Aston_Martin_Valhalla_05.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Aston Martin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0jXZFp"&gt;Two years after Aston Martin debuted the striking but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18250642/aston-martin-003-hypecar-geneva-motor-show-2019"&gt;clumsily titled AM-RB 003 concept&lt;/a&gt;, the final production version has arrived with a much simpler name: Valhalla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FksM2T"&gt;The automaker revealed the hybrid supercar on Thursday ahead of this weekend’s British Grand Prix, where Aston Martin will compete as a manufacturer for the first time in over 60 years. Aston Martin returned to F1 this year with a team that’s co-sponsored by Cognizant, the professional services firm at the center of Casey Newton’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa"&gt;multipart&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Facebook’s content &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20940956/cognizant-facebook-content-moderation-exit-business-conditions-investigation"&gt;moderation problem&lt;/a&gt;. In 2020, the company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21116675/aston-martin-electric-rapide-lagonda-delay-stroll-investment"&gt;taken over by Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll&lt;/a&gt;, the de facto villain from the third season of Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Drive to Survive &lt;/em&gt;series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28VRS1"&gt;Stroll walked away with Aston Martin after a dramatic showdown with Geely (China’s largest private automaker), which had submitted a competing bid for the ailing luxury automaker. Stroll’s first move was to delay &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21116675/aston-martin-electric-rapide-lagonda-delay-stroll-investment"&gt;some of Aston Martin’s electric vehicle projects&lt;/a&gt;. So the fact that the Valhalla project survived the turbulence is its own little miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="URuapB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10653337"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zgyH1R"&gt;Anyway... to the car! It’s a 937-horsepower hybrid beast, with a top speed of 217 miles per hour and the ability to go from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour (62mph) in under 2.5 seconds. It does this by pairing a 740-horsepower twin-turbo V8 engine with a pair of electric motors (one on each axle) and by leveraging active aerodynamics at the front of the car and with the rear spoiler as well as tunnels underneath the car that can direct the air — tricks Aston Martin developed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/9/14871874/aston-martin-valkyrie-photos-geneva-auto-show-2017"&gt;on the Valhalla’s predecessor, the Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6dHx7S"&gt;A mostly carbon fiber body keeps things light enough at 1,550 kilograms (3,417 pounds), though there are more nooks and crannies in the design than can be found in the ultra-smooth Valkyrie. Aston Martin says that, inside, there’s a new infotainment system running on a central touchscreen that also supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto — meaning the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18250642/aston-martin-003-hypecar-geneva-motor-show-2019"&gt;smartphone-mounted system from the AM-RB 003 concept&lt;/a&gt; has been mercifully discarded. (The company unfortunately didn’t release any images of the cockpit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkqCsn"&gt;All told, the Valhalla seems like it matches up well with some other hybrid supercars like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645508/ferrari-sf90-stradale-plug-in-hybrid-electric-car-range-specs-features"&gt;Ferrari’s SF90 Stradale&lt;/a&gt;, for whatever that’s worth. Very few will be made, and they will cost an astronomical amount. For most of us, it’s just something to ogle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gnLL7v"&gt;Considering Aston Martin’s recent history, though, it may not surprise you that there’s one last bit of intrigue with this car. The internal combustion engine comes from Mercedes-Benz, which provides the overall power unit to Aston Martin’s F1 team. Makes me wonder &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-racing-point-f1-drama-is-the-gift-that-keeps-on-giv-1844664786"&gt;what the brake ducts look like&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read how Pepper was a very bad robot</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NmKC7V"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554566/softbank-pepper-robot-production-layoffs-robotics"&gt;SoftBank’s Pepper robot is dead&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; is dancing upon its grave with a thorough account of how the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/5/5781628/softbank-announces-pepper-robot"&gt;emotional robot&lt;/a&gt;” failed to live up to the hype. Expectations were so inflated back in 2014 that the first batch of 1,000 robots sold out in a minute, despite being priced close to $2,000.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yw4p28"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/humanoid-robot-softbank-jobs-pepper-olympics-11626187461"&gt;entire article&lt;/a&gt; is well worth a read as a reminder that tech is hard, and predicting its impact on society is even harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ilR22"&gt;Although SoftBank certainly overhyped Pepper, saying its launch would be remembered “100, 200, or 300 years” into the future, humans are also to blame for getting sucked in by the bot’s doe-eyed demeanor, despite &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; article titled “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/19/5820080/meeting-softbank-pepper-robot"&gt;I met an emotional robot and felt nothing&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mbgHU"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; report does credit the robot, which also required monthly subscriptions starting at $550, with being able to take temperatures about as well as a $1 thermometer. It could also function as a rudimentary hotel concierge. Otherwise, Pepper failed at almost every other task assigned and ended up being roughly as sophisticated as the smart speakers that were appearing around the same time. Its failures include such improbable jobs as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/24/16196752/robot-buddhist-priest-funeral-softbank"&gt;Buddhist priest&lt;/a&gt; and exercise coach for the elderly. But it also failed at tasks like home companionship for which it seemed ideally suited, as recounted by tech journalist Tsutsumu Ishikawa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vsvlz7"&gt;After arriving at the Ishikawa home, however, Pepper couldn’t recognize the faces of family members or carry on a proper conversation, said Mr. Ishikawa. The robot, connected to the cloud, is supposed to remember the family even after a breakdown, Mr. Ishikawa says, but when Pepper returned home after the repair of a sensor, Pepper greeted him, “Nice to meet you!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3kpIR"&gt;He shipped the robot back to SoftBank in 2018 after spending at least $9,000 over the three-year life of his subscription services agreement; he wasn’t eligible for any form of refund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3PvHr"&gt;“It was such a waste of money. I still regret it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="SB8jlx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fOlhsoldBSE?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=17&amp;amp;start=17" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H1Brvq"&gt;Pepper was also a terrible cheerleader, dispatched by the 100s to raise enthusiasm for SoftBank’s professional baseball team during the COVID lockdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="m4MW4v"&gt;Commenters said the scene reminded them of a dystopia. Hirofumi Miyato, 56, of Tokyo, was watching a game on television and saw the Pepper group in team uniforms moving their arms in unison. He wasn’t inspired to cheer along. “It reminded me of a military parade in North Korea or China,” Mr. Miyato said. “It felt creepy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
