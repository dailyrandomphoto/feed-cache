    <title>Microsoft’s Xbox Game Streaming app for Windows includes touch controls, gyro, and more</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J24j0lghN4ZZJ9u6fmWtLDJhHpo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68885240/acastro_180604_1777_xbox_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nb0i3t"&gt;Microsoft is finalizing its Xbox Game Streaming app for Windows PCs, which includes access to streaming games from the company’s xCloud service. We’ve managed to get access to the latest version of the Xbox Game Streaming app for Windows, an unannounced and unreleased app. Once released, the app will let Windows users stream games from their Xbox Series S / X consoles, and from xCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebYKjL"&gt;Currently, you can’t stream games from the new Xbox consoles to Windows PCs, as this is unsupported in the existing Xbox Console Companion app. This new app will solve that, and also bring xCloud streaming to Windows PCs for the first time. We first got a look at this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22283739/microsoft-xcloud-web-screenshots-cloud-gaming-streaming-browser-features"&gt;xCloud app for Windows last year&lt;/a&gt;, and it has improved a lot since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QIDTML"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;scoop: here's a look at Microsoft's unreleased xCloud app for Windows. This app lets you stream Xbox games from an Xbox Series X / S console, or from xCloud. Full details here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/ymyjQDmaeH"&gt;https://t.co/ymyjQDmaeH&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/V3U3PXe7LO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/V3U3PXe7LO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1365731532376317963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7SaR93"&gt;The Xbox remote play feature, for connecting to Xbox consoles, works similarly to how the existing Console Companion does. You can remotely wake an Xbox console, sign in, and play games wherever you are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="je8b5J"&gt;There is now full touch support, allowing Surface or other touchscreen devices to play Xbox games without a controller. Microsoft also appears to be readying some form of gyro support here, too. There’s an option to enable this, but it doesn’t appear to be fully functional yet. This is an internal beta application, so it’s still unfinished.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MGV3gpzp0ZuGNZyINt-ERTLYGkI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22333440/VlCW8k5.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s unreleased Xbox Game Streaming app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IWMHkx"&gt;Microsoft also appears to be readying 1080p streams for xCloud, instead of the 720p that exists today. This would obviously improve the experience on Windows PCs, ahead of higher resolutions once Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295326/microsoft-project-xcloud-xbox-series-x-servers-hardware-2021"&gt;upgraded its xCloud servers to include Xbox Series X hardware&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQaU3o"&gt;It’s still not clear exactly when this app will be made available more broadly. Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thurrott/status/1365308039725735936"&gt;rumored to be planning&lt;/a&gt; a “what’s new for gaming” event for next month, so it’s possible we’ll hear a lot more about the company’s xCloud plans (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22283739/microsoft-xcloud-web-screenshots-cloud-gaming-streaming-browser-features"&gt;for the web and iOS&lt;/a&gt;, too) very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge approves $650 million Facebook privacy settlement over facial recognition feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLev8oIHMvhfAzsoUQnqRWiptS8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68885045/acastro_180522_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IFxSiV"&gt;A federal judge on Friday &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22333300/In_re_Facebook_Biometric_Information_Privacy_Litigation_final_order.pdf"&gt;gave final approval&lt;/a&gt; to a $650 million Facebook class action privacy settlement and ordered the 1.6 million members of the class in Illinois who submitted claims to be paid “as expeditiously as possible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsrAsC"&gt;Chicago attorney Jay Edelson sued Facebook in Cook County Circuit Court back in 2015, alleging that the platform’s use of facial recognition tagging was not allowed under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. The lawsuit claimed that Facebook’s Tag Suggestions tool, which scanned faces in users’ photos and offered suggestions about who the person might be, stored biometric data without users’ consent in violation of the Illinois law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FxNNey"&gt;The case became &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/17/17246222/facebook-bipa-fines-penalty-tag-suggestions-facial-recognition"&gt;a class action lawsuit in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20847650/facebook-facial-recognition-setting-default-opt-in"&gt;made facial recognition on the platform opt-in only&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcCjtS"&gt;The three named plaintiffs in the suit will each receive $5,000 and others in the class will get at least $345 each, according to the order by Judge James Donato of the Northern District of California. Donato said the settlement was a “landmark result” and a “major win for consumers in the hotly contested area of digital privacy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9xWev"&gt;“We are pleased to have reached a settlement so we can move past this matter, which is in the best interest of our community and our shareholders,” Facebook &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-san-francisco-chicago-lawsuits-af6b42212e43be1b63b5c290eb5bfd85"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RG2jKs"&gt;“It’s a big deal,” Edelson told &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-facebook-privacy-settlement-approval-20210227-okljqhsiargl7ijvzzfcotpyby-story.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It sends a pretty clear message that in Illinois, biometric privacy rights are here to stay.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>So you want to start reading comics? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMtSUS3F2n2sjRyHDJpjZ4qrfdk=/57x0:732x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68884741/so_capmeme.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HQEatj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s first season is just about to end, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/21591343/falcon-winter-soldier-premiere-date-disney-plus-sebastian-stan-anthony-mackie-august"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/21591175/black-widow-theatrical-release-streaming-disney-plus-hbo-max"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299343/loki-premiere-date-disney-plus-marvel-tom-hiddleston-wandavision-black-widow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/14/22278944/zack-snyder-justice-league-official-premiere-trailer-hbo-max"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21377415/suicide-squad-2-james-gunn-fandome-characters-introduction-dc-comics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21377631/the-batman-teaser-trailer-robert-pattinson-matt-reeves-dc-fandome"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202992/dc-films-multiverse-batman-wonder-woman-aquaman-hbo-max-dceu-marvel-disney-plus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GCPD, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;are just around the corner — and that doesn’t account for other series outside of the main Marvel and DC Universes like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301774/hulu-modok-marvel-tv-show-trailer-robot-chicken"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MODOK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Titans, &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Harley Quinn&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vq42FD"&gt;There are more superhero TV series and films debuting in 2021 than seemingly ever before, and it might have some people wanting to dive into comics. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303068/wandavision-episode-8-explainer-recap-scarlet-witch-white-vision-post-credits"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has led a few people on staff to dig into past Vision and Wanda Maximoff-centered storylines, for example. I’ve started reading Kieron Gillen’s &lt;em&gt;Eternals &lt;/em&gt;run leading up to Marvel Studios’ film. Whatever reason people may have for wanting to begin reading comics, there are a few different ways to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKXcgy"&gt;Comics can be a costly hobby. New issues are typically $3.99 each, and if someone is reading eight or nine different series at any one time, those fees can add up week after week. Don’t think of this guide as a recommendation for which series to dig into. If you’re looking for that, Susana Polo, the comics editor at our sister site, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/21545982/best-new-comics-of-the-week"&gt;runs a weekly rundown of books&lt;/a&gt; she’s reading and recommends. (It’s an essential part of my week, and it helps me figure out any single issues I want to pick up or start a series I might enjoy.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUNr1J"&gt;Instead, this is a guide to the different subscription methods that are available for people who want to consume a number of comics at once and do it in a cost-effective manner. These aren’t the only options, but they’re some of the easiest. There are three primary comics subscription services:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jqLINY"&gt;Comixology Unlimited ($6 a month) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SXtulj"&gt;Marvel Unlimited ($10 a month or $70 a year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zj2DTj"&gt;DC Universe Infinite ($8 a month of $75 a year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2kXs3RjuQaV4q13hT9ZWRykOBjg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331849/comixology.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gmLWow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comixology Unlimited&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5Evojz"&gt;It’s a really, &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;good time for people to start getting into comics because of the subscription models that exist. If you’re just getting started, I recommend &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.comixology.com%2Funlimited&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22303444%2Fcomics-buying-guide-subscription-comixology-marvel-unlimited-dc-universe-infinite" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Comixology Unlimited&lt;/a&gt; because it has the most diverse options as well as plenty of the big mainstream stuff. (Comixology is available as an add-on through your Amazon Prime account.) There are more than 25,000 comics available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFNaBe"&gt;There are opportunities to read fantastic series from publishers like Vertigo (&lt;em&gt;Sex Criminals, Sweet Tooth, The Invisibles&lt;/em&gt;) or Image Comics (&lt;em&gt;The Fade Out, Blackbird, Fatale, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Kick-Ass&lt;/em&gt;), alongside top Marvel (Captain America, Iron Man, Immortal Hulk, Hawkeye, etc.) and DC series (Batman, Teen Titans, Wonder Woman, Justice League Dark, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="beXdHp"&gt;What I love most about Comixology Unlimited is being able to explore any type of book. I will often click on a publisher, like Valiant or Dark Horse, and search through what’s offered via the Unlimited subscription. At this point, if there’s a trade paperback available (this is a term that refers to a number of single print issues, between four and 12 issues, but usually six) for someone to read. For example, if someone wanted to read Matt Fraction’s &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;, they can do so by reading through different volumes that collect a number of single print issues. It’s the best way to find older gems that people may not have heard of before, especially if they’re new to comics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9m0b3"&gt;One downside to Comixology Unlimited is the Marvel and DC Comics offerings may feel less than ideal for dedicated fans. When I was trying to read a number of back issues for &lt;em&gt;WandaVision, &lt;/em&gt;specifically (and after I saw a Tumblr post about an old &lt;em&gt;Incredible Hulk &lt;/em&gt;arc from the ‘80s I wanted to check out), I realized I was still going to have to buy a bunch of it. While there was plenty I could read for free — all of &lt;em&gt;House of M &lt;/em&gt;is part of Unlimited, for example — to read the entire history, I was going to have to use Marvel Unlimited. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9EKvq-GYY5rJVfXU0h8iJbloInw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331850/marvel_unlimited.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9v3gHa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marvel Unlimited&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c82oW6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/help/category/8"&gt;Marvel Unlimited&lt;/a&gt; has more than 27,000 digital comics for people to read. You can download up to 12 comics to carry with them at any given time, and Marvel’s team (alongside recommendation algorithms) will curate a series of books that surface when looking for something to read. It’s a great app to dig into classic tales, and some of the best runs for popular characters like Iron Man and Captain America. There’s also the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars &lt;/em&gt;universe for people to explore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CquZj2"&gt;The biggest downside affects new single issues. Currently, new issues in ongoing arcs like &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Spider-Man &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;The Eternals&lt;/em&gt; get uploaded to Marvel Unlimited three months after they first come out. So roughly after the first three issues of a current run are available, they’ll start popping up in Marvel Unlimited. That’s not great news for anyone who’s trying to stay current with a number of Marvel titles. (These issues can also be purchased on Comixology for $3.99 or $3.39 with the Comixology Unlimited discount.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmHC9G"&gt;I’d say that Marvel Unlimited is best for anyone who really wants to dive deep into reading nearly every single comic Marvel has released over the years. If your goal is to get through all of the various Spider-Man comics that have been released since 1962, Marvel Unlimited is your best bet at doing it for the cheapest price.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MjBXjvfjzusKHLOpsYVQ-Ben5Ms=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331852/dc_universe_infinite.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zLJux0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DC Universe Infinite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3GG61e"&gt;The same is mostly true for &lt;a href="https://www.dcuniverseinfinite.com/"&gt;DC Universe Infinite&lt;/a&gt;. This used to be DC Universe, a service that had some comics but also a couple of TV shows (&lt;em&gt;Harley Quinn, Teen Titans&lt;/em&gt;) and some older DC movies. When &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278287/hbo-max-international-launch-june-2021-latin-america-europe-warnermedia-streaming"&gt;HBO Max launched&lt;/a&gt;, the TV shows and films moved over to the WarnerMedia streaming platform, and DC Universe relaunched as a comics-only platform called DC Universe Infinite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UeChU"&gt;In an effort to make DC Universe Infinite feel a little special, DC Comics did a couple of new things. The company committed to carrying back catalog titles from “Vertigo, Black Label, and Milestone comics imprints,” &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/21/22241337/dc-universe-infinite-app-new-download-problems"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There will also be exclusive DC Comics titles that live exclusively on DC Universe Infinite. The platform currently offers more than 24,000 comics. Like Marvel Unlimited, new releases are not available right away. They’ll hit DC Universe Infinite six months after being released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSmKjn"&gt;Again, both Marvel Unlimited and DC Universe Unlimited are great for people who want to read as many past comics featuring their favorite superheroes for a cheap monthly price. They’re not great for anyone who’s looking to only read the newest stuff. Your best bet is using a digital retailer — or supporting your local comic bookshop if physical prints are more your thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4aPecB"&gt;What seems wholly inevitable is that both Marvel Unlimited and DC Universe Unlimited will be offered in a bundle with &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1002380/9358?subId1=VergeTheBestWaytoReadComicBooks022621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=TheBestWayToReadComicBooks022621"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. The entertainment conglomerates that own all of these properties want people to stay in their worlds — hence all the new movies and TV shows on streaming services. When that happens, it’ll be way easier for people to watch an episode of something like &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;and then dive into the character’s history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpbODn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vaccine centers embrace stickers and selfie stations   </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-VACCINE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4B-8tiF1WU9DpEQdiIxME2_D_3Q=/0x86:4000x2753/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68884565/1231398723.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by JOSEPH PREZIOSO/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QYQH8H"&gt;The best picture I’ve seen this week was a selfie from my father-in-law who just got his first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Along with the shot, they gave him a sticker that says “I got vaccinated!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gsgcb1"&gt;As the vaccine rollout continues, clinics and distribution centers across the country are embracing things like stickers and even selfie stations decked out with colorful backgrounds to help people celebrate getting the shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVGseY"&gt;The selfie stations are set up as colorful backgrounds, often with pro-vaccine messaging &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Seidel_Z/status/1364369817449492482"&gt;tiled with the name of the healthcare provider&lt;/a&gt;. It’s good branding. And hey, if social media-friendly backgrounds helped make some trendy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/20/16000552/instagram-restaurant-interior-design-photo-friendly-media-noche"&gt;restaurants&lt;/a&gt; popular, there’s no reason they couldn’t work for vaccine sites too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n52go8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is a real thing that exists at an NJ mass vaccination site. &lt;a href="https://t.co/CWWLVEBKJo"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CWWLVEBKJo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NoahCRothman/status/1364946181055516673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MpKvwk"&gt;Added bonus — if the vaccines are being given in a healthcare setting, it gives people a designated space to take pictures without compromising other patients’ privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8K8Nqj"&gt;Vaccine stickers and selfies can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/vaccinate-with-confidence.html"&gt;increase confidence in vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. Just like “I voted” stickers were &lt;a href="https://time.com/4541760/i-voted-sticker-history-origins/"&gt;designed to remind people&lt;/a&gt; about Election Day, “I got vaccinated” stickers are designed to help people &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/15/us/covid-vaccine-stickers-trnd/index.html"&gt;see the vaccination efforts&lt;/a&gt; unfolding in their own community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NKKlG"&gt;Back in December, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed stickers for healthcare workers to wear after they got vaccinated. Since they were some of the first people in the country to get vaccinated, the stickers were an easy way for workers to start conversations about the vaccines with their patients and colleagues — some of whom &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22214210/covid-vaccine-health-care-workers-safety-fears"&gt;might be reluctant to get the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="hyIPBE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0LxbZs"&gt;The ready-made vaccination celebrations are also a way to dissuade people from sharing their vaccine cards on social media. Those can contain personal information, and posting photos of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/6/22270400/coronavirus-vaccine-card-selfie-social-media"&gt;can help scammers scam&lt;/a&gt;. A photo of your vaccinated self sporting a sticker, on the other hand, does not pose nearly as much of a privacy risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6zvFm"&gt;Stickers can serve the same purpose outside of the healthcare industry too. But also; they’re super fun. Slapping on a sticker is a chance to visually celebrate in a time when there’s been so little for us to enjoy. So is taking a selfie to share with the world. Sure, there are &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/01/vaccine-photography/617678/"&gt;public health benefits&lt;/a&gt; to making vaccination visible. It’s also &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/covid-vaccine-joy-hope/2021/02/24/62b10432-7184-11eb-85fa-e0ccb3660358_story.html"&gt;pure joy&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AnrvZ9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;How do we say thank you to the health workers and scientists for their sacrifice and service? Receive the vaccine as soon as one can to lessen their load and keep wearing a mask to protect fellow citizens. In my 80th year, I am grateful and hopeful for better days ahead. &lt;a href="https://t.co/emGDlnYL2E"&gt;pic.twitter.com/emGDlnYL2E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Patrick Stewart (@SirPatStew) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SirPatStew/status/1352718696297484289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NYNZtC"&gt;I’m not eligible to receive the vaccine yet where I am, and I probably won’t be for a long time. But after seeing so much death and suffering during the past year, it brings me nothing but hope and happiness to see the relief in people’s eyes after they get their shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySyAvN"&gt;Other people have been taking their vaccine celebrations into their own hands. Not content with the official offerings, they’re &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/elderly-people-are-getting-dressed-up-to-have-the-vaccine-and-thats-the-energy-we-need_uk_6012a163c5b6b8719d8a1bab"&gt;dressing in their best&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashlieatkinson/status/1364289562734960641"&gt;donning sequins&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/01/vaccine-photography/617678/"&gt;bringing fun bandages&lt;/a&gt; to patch themselves up after the shot. Vaccinated people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300783/covid-vaccine-guidelines-cdc-safety-normal-life"&gt;can’t throw a big maskless party yet&lt;/a&gt; — but they can celebrate a small, momentous victory. It’s fantastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0DrgJ"&gt;There are still too few people vaccinated, here in the US and around the world. The rollout has been &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22213208/covid-19-vaccine-rollout-coronavirus-distribution"&gt;messy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22279023/covid-19-vaccine-appointment-how-to"&gt;frustrating&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287123/covid-vaccination-death-inequity-race-maps"&gt;inequitable&lt;/a&gt;. It still is. Governments can still do &lt;em&gt;much &lt;/em&gt;better. But more people are getting the shot every day. In fact, Friday set vaccination records in the US and EU. &lt;/p&gt;

And all authorized vaccines do a great job at keeping people out of the hospital and alive. But the big clinical trials weren’t designed to look at how well they can keep people from passing the disease from one person to another. It’s a big question, and one that researchers (and everyone else) is eager to uncover. (Kelsey Piper / &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CjNJQD"&gt;In every volunteer opportunity I’d ever been a part of, you made camp friends, formed quick alliances. To do so that day, when you even didn’t know who had been vaccinated and who hadn’t, felt aggressive and dangerous. Even holding the door open for the person behind you on the orientation tour could violate the required distance. I couldn’t discreetly murmur to my shift buddy about who was trying to cut and who was about to get out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Sony’s PlayStation Network experiencing outage Saturday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PlayStation controllers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4VWGtPF3ocYat744ztWuSliD_UU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68884441/vpavic_191127_untitled_0059_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qAjehf"&gt;An outage of Sony’s PlayStation Network that began Friday afternoon appeared to be persisting on Saturday morning. According to an &lt;a href="https://status.playstation.com/"&gt;update on the status page&lt;/a&gt; timestamped 6:33PM (not clear what time zone that is) on February 26th, the affected platforms are PS Vita, PS3, PS4, and PS5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZKN9e"&gt;“You might have difficulty launching games, apps, or network features. We’re working to resolve the issue as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience,” the update reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwO4MO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/psn-is-down-ps4-ps5-022654065.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the outage may be affecting some games but not others; &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; appeared to be accessible but &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; were not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3iaWD"&gt;The PlayStation Network outage began a day after Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301763/xbox-live-down-sign-in-issues-microsoft-support"&gt;Xbox Live service suffered a global outage&lt;/a&gt; for five hours. On February 10th, the PlayStation Network &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277439/sony-playstation-network-global-outage"&gt;was down worldwide&lt;/a&gt; for about an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyqHFh"&gt;We’ve reached out to Sony for details about what’s causing the outage, how widespread it is, and when it may be resolved, and will update when we learn more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAdqqM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are this week’s best gadget deals all in one place</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ml73VgVNXPJGXMpiCWJMbElq9nI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68884376/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REMAKE_E3_2019_screenshot_6.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P4HP5U"&gt;This week’s batch of deals runs the gamut of gadgets and games. Whether you’re a music fan who’s looking to outfit their tech repertoire with new headphones or a big, powerful Bluetooth speaker, or a gamer, this roundup is for you. There still aren’t any deals on hard-to-find graphics cards, but the good news is at least AMD’s powerful Zen 3 processors are in stock right now (but perhaps not for long). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mT0YM"&gt;If you aren’t finding what you’re looking for in today’s roundup, keep a lock on our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; Deals coverage&lt;/a&gt; throughout the week and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VergeDeals"&gt;follow us on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for the moment-to-moment deal alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="RuLbSh"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OdOtr0"&gt;Get the best-ever price on Beats Solo Pro on-ear headphones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sgpO1I"&gt;Beats Solo Pro noise-canceling headphones are still available for $150 through Woot. You can get either the dark blue or light blue colors. Since they’re new, the one-year manufacturer warranty is directly through Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2Te9oC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625639"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ihWUiw"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="byhs2x"&gt;Ultimate Ears Hyperboom brings the noise, and it’s $59 off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6cqmqe"&gt;Ultimate Ears makes good Bluetooth speakers. Its latest model is its biggest yet: the Hyperboom. It’s waterproof and portable with its built-in strap. You can connect up to two Bluetooth devices to it, and its digital optical port means it can serve as a home theater system in a pinch. This is a pricey speaker, but it’s a versatile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vqZyXJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10359731"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vbcNB9"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XXk6hf"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; for PS4 / PS5 is half off its usual price&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="p6esZ3"&gt;Sony announced Friday that &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302776/finalfantasy-7-remake-free-playstation-plus-march-2021"&gt;will be available as a free download&lt;/a&gt; for PS Plus members in June. This seems like perfect news, given Square Enix just revealed that the PS4 version can be upgraded to the PS5 version for no extra cost later in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;June 2021&lt;/a&gt;. But, there’s a catch: this complimentary version can’t receive the free upgrade. Only by purchasing the game on disc or through the PS Store digitally can you earn the upgrade when you move to PS5. (Confusing, no?) In that case, this $30 deal for the disc-based version is a good price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mGqYRF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546364"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="JLGLZ6"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yCKvDP"&gt;AMD’s high-end Zen 3 processor is back in stock&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pjCPbV"&gt;If you’ve been a-swingin’ and a-missin’ on every opportunity to get some new PC components, including a processor, check this out. Several retailers have AMD’s latest Ryzen 7 5800X eight-core processor. It’s based on Zen 3 architecture, and it’s about as next-gen as processors come at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5Uj31E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10363165"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="QknE2X"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

  &lt;p id="OiAaun"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/health/n95-masks-facebook-sale-amazon.html?smtyp=cur&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimes"&gt;A new report from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times’&lt;/em&gt; Andrew Jacobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;digs into how mask policies on tech platforms that have allowed novelty masks like scrunchie masks to flourish while some mask-makers making high-filtration masks have had trouble selling their wares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ho563T"&gt;Even if you’re vaccinated, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/dr-fauci-on-why-its-important-to-wear-a-mask-after-getting-your-covid-vaccine-.html"&gt;wearing a mask is still recommended&lt;/a&gt;. It seems like a problem, then, that many masks widely advertised on Facebook, Instagram, and Amazon are novelty varieties that might be less safe than medical-grade N95s. Facebook and Amazon say they are following guidelines from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6MPLJ0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/7/21169109/facebook-instagram-bans-ads-face-masks-coronavirus"&gt;Facebook prevented mask sellers&lt;/a&gt; from advertising and selling masks to the masses early in the pandemic, when they were in short supply. The idea was to reserve N95s for medical professionals instead. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21286724/facebook-cloth-face-mask-ad-ban-lifted-supply-workers"&gt;That policy eventually changed&lt;/a&gt; so that non-medical masks, face coverings, and plastic shields could be advertised. Some mask-makers who manufacture their own medical-grade masks told Jacobs they aren’t able to advertise on the platform, while fabric masks that can fold pocket squares or transform into scrunchies are. Which might not be a problem if these sellers where reaching hospitals directly. Many told Jacobs they’re not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9DjPXa"&gt;“I’d be happy to sell my masks to health care workers, but right now hospitals aren’t exactly banging down my door,” said Brian Wolin, the chief executive of Protective Health Gear, a year-old company in Paterson, N.J., that has a half million unsold N95 masks at its factory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Ix7nrQ"&gt;Amazon’s policies pose a different problem, according to Jacobs’ report. Large manufacturers have an easier time reaching customers on Amazon because the company buys their products in bulk to ship from its own warehouses, Jacobs’ writes. But the company’s policy around selling masks and the algorithms that govern how they appear in search are difficult for smaller companies to navigate. Less safe alternatives like KN95 masks are readily surfaced in search, while other manufacturers offering N95s on Amazon’s storefront have been buried by the algorithm, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1Suqy"&gt;In the end, Jacobs’ piece illustrates a disappointing arrangement: online platforms are frequently the safest way to purchase PPE, but they don’t always provide the safest product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QCEDYE"&gt;Check out Jacobs’ report on &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/health/n95-masks-facebook-sale-amazon.html?smtyp=cur&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times’ &lt;/em&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the full picture.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stadia version of Terraria is back in production after developer reconciles with Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qIfw1oiKMhz8KQIMFJNMWU9zbDQ=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68882686/ss_ae168a00ab08104ba266dc30232654d4b3c919e5.1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Re-Logic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UmvDnk"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;em&gt;Terraria &lt;/em&gt;co-creator Andrew Spinks announced that his studio Re-Logic would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272502/terraria-google-stadia-port-canceled-deceloper-locked-out"&gt;cancel a Google Stadia port&lt;/a&gt;. However, the developer announced today that the Stadia port is now back in development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HsPaM"&gt; ”As you may have noticed, we had a ton of issues to kick off the year stemming from the locking-down of Redigit’s entire Google account in early January,” Re-Logic said in a &lt;a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-state-of-the-game-february-2021.103428/"&gt;recent &lt;em&gt;Terraria &lt;/em&gt;forum post&lt;/a&gt;. “After a month of pushing (and with the immense support of our fans), Google finally reached out and was able to provide a lot of transparency around the situation and to restore access to all of our accounts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQoNTg"&gt;After publication, a Google spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that a Stadia port for &lt;em&gt;Terraria&lt;/em&gt; was currently in development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t46quC"&gt;On February 8th, Spinks fired off a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Demilogic/status/1358661840402845696?s=20"&gt;series of tweets&lt;/a&gt; expressing frustration that he was locked out of his Google accounts for weeks, which included losing access to his Gmail and Google Play account. Spinks first noted that he lost access to his accounts on or around January 16th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DO3Us3"&gt;Re-Logic has yet to announced when &lt;em&gt;Terraria&lt;/em&gt; will launch on Google Stadia, but the game being back in development is good news for fans of Google’s cloud gaming service. On Friday, two reports from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/google-video-game-unit-stadia-struggled-to-be-googley-enough"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-stadia-games-entertainment-collapse/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shed light on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303496/google-stadia-struggle-wired-bloomberg-reports-studios"&gt;some of Google’s failures in building Stadia&lt;/a&gt;. And earlier this month, Google announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;closing its in-house&lt;/a&gt; development studio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUD1lA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 26th, 7:32PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Included information from Google confirming that a Stadia port of &lt;/em&gt;Terraria&lt;em&gt; is in development.   &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This TikTok Tom Cruise impersonator is using deepfake tech to impressive ends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QCe2t_Rd-Fwy9kFz_iw1DvWl3rU=/13x91:898x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68882612/Screen_Shot_2021_02_26_at_2.24.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not pictured: Tom Cruise&lt;/em&gt; | Image: @deeptomcruise on TikTok&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="df7yVy"&gt;What’s better than an ultra-high-tech, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1Y4CubBi60"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible&lt;/em&gt;-style mask&lt;/a&gt;? The deepfake technology this TikToker is using to impersonate Tom Cruise, apparently (&lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/shockingly-real-tom-cruise-deepfakes-are-invading-tiktok?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@deeptomcruise"&gt;deeptomcruise account&lt;/a&gt; appears to feature someone who’s pretending to be the famous actor, and the impression isn’t just jaw-dropping because of how well the person replicates Cruise’s famous laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nEgEWR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@deeptomcruise/video/6932166297996233989" data-video-id="6932166297996233989" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@deeptomcruise" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@deeptomcruise"&gt;@deeptomcruise&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sports!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Tom" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6932166350203357957"&gt;♬ original sound - Tom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M5ZnkY"&gt;How can you tell it’s not actually Tom Cruise using some sort of strange Twitter name? First, his voice is close, but it’s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; there, especially since the lip-syncing is a tiny bit off at some points. You can hear what the real Cruise sounds like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1wsCworwWk"&gt;in this video&lt;/a&gt; (unless, of course, James Corden also deepfaked him in).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQ0f6K"&gt;Second, while the tracking and lighting on the face are darn near immaculate — especially&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;when the actor passes something in front of his face — there are still a couple of telling glitches, notably in &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@deeptomcruise/video/6932166297996233989"&gt;the golf one&lt;/a&gt; where the sunglasses disappear and his mouth morphs for a frame or two. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_6WCa-EnHql3t-exNNS7V2z3EHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22332191/NotCruiseHQ.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not perfect, but it’s close.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QFeXqF"&gt;Even with these minor blips, the effect is still spooky. I’m not going to yell from the rooftops that deepfakes will be ruinous to society, but the fact that someone is posing, almost believably, as a famous actor on TikTok (and gaining 236,000 followers in the process) shows that it’s still hard to track deepfakes. While the account pretty clearly indicates that it’s a fake by using “deep” in its name, the next one to pop up might not. TikTok didn’t immediately respond to an email from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asking whether this type of account is allowed under its terms of service, but its TOS explicitly call out impersonations as forbidden:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="xH768Y"&gt;You may not: [...]&lt;br&gt;impersonate any person or entity, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent you or your affiliation with any person or entity, including giving the impression that any content you upload, post, transmit, distribute or otherwise make available emanates from the Services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FcBSPj"&gt;That said, this account does seem to be a bit of relatively harmless fun. If you’re reading this, person who runs deeptomcruise (or the real Tom Cruise), please show us if this tech can keep up with your best Tom Cruise run, or if it can handle you &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2UVsyVLLcE"&gt;dancing and lip-syncing to Bob Seger&lt;/a&gt;. Just whatever you do, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Slrfkruvnk8"&gt;leave Oprah, deepfaked or not, out of it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Persona 5 Strikers is a perfect excuse to reunite with the Phantom Thieves</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NJwmEthDHWA6-LNqRcflhkn9jhY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68882493/ss_8ab45ed170a4f44838dbd3fa4a8978c3a2313e62.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h4SHdY"&gt;Atlus is a master of weird spinoffs. In the past, the developer has revamped its RPG series &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt; as dungeon crawlers, brawlers, and rhythm games. Heroes have bounded through space and time for fanfiction-worthy team-ups, all in service of giving players a reason to see their favorite characters again. &lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers&lt;/em&gt; goes one step further, turning an action-heavy adventure into a road trip that feels right at home with the original game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwjauG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers&lt;/em&gt; is a direct sequel to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15098458/persona-5-review-ps4-ps3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, set months after the Phantom Thieves hung up their masks. The gang reunites for a long-overdue vacation, only to have it interrupted by the appearance of Jails — warped versions of reality where one person rules, not unlike the Palaces they encountered in the original game. To solve the mystery of these jails, the Phantom Thieves get an RV and take their investigation across Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ek8Uts"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strikers&lt;/em&gt; is an action-RPG take on the game in the vein of Omega Force’s other spinoffs of popular series, like Hyrule Warriors. It trades in the careful turn-based strategy of the original for button-mashing through mobs. Players are no longer confined to controlling only the game’s hero, Joker, and can swap between party members like Makoto or Ann at will. In addition to elemental abilities specific to their personas, like nuclear or wind attacks, each has special physical attacks to help you through battle. Characters I barely used in the original &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;, like Ryuji, became my go-to for mobs I wanted to melee; I rarely needed Morgana’s magic but loved his ability to turn into a car and mow down shadows. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F8l-4oIoOJLBrNd4qPvBIMIn7c4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22332030/ss_71b63fbbd55221007aabf84fd4c150a6125329da.1920x1080.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xOaeF5"&gt;Despite being able to swap between characters, the game’s mash-heavy gameplay can become monotonous at times. On a good streak, I would string together combos, pile on follow-up and all-out attacks, and zap enemies with magic attacks — but mostly, I just spent a lot of time frantically hitting buttons. The amount happening on-screen can sometimes be dizzying if not tough to follow, between characters talking during battle and zipping around a screen smashing enemies in the face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1OS8u"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t offer as robust an experience as the original game — there are no personality traits to improve, and relationships are distilled down to a single “Bond” metric that applies to your entire team — but it offers a solid array of ways to break up your playtime. New cities mean sidequests, shops to visit, and recipes to find for you to cook with; party members often want to visit special restaurants and attractions. The constraints of a deadline are gone as well. You can pop in and out of jails as often as you wish to go hang with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Kqx1R"&gt;The experience feels like a streamlined version of &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt;, the video game equivalent of a summer vacation. It’s a way to spend extra time with a world I fell in love with over the course of dozens of hours, and a welcome expansion to the game’s mythos. Where &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;’s Palaces were desires pushed to their extreme and corrupted, Jails revolve around trauma. In order to defeat the monarchs of each jail, you’ll need to first uncover and understand the pain that birthed them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oZzchCMAWTSi674NC0iwn4eW9Hc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22332031/ss_473822957f4077b28c5a81bfeb74e5b5cacba8ca.1920x1080.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SkRept"&gt;It’s a welcome change, a turn that makes people’s cruelty more interesting. &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;’s examinations of people at their darkest sometimes ran up against the cartoonish villainy of it all. The rulers you faced were so exaggeratedly evil that taking them down needed no justification. But &lt;em&gt;Strikers &lt;/em&gt;offers a more complex alternative: that hurt people hurt people. The monarchs have manipulated and deceived, yet they’re still a path for them to learn and grow from their mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ey92nC"&gt;As a sequel, &lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t offer much in the way of big revelations — but it doesn’t have to. Like the series’s many other spinoffs, the allure is the opportunity to play in their world a little longer. Clearing a jail is fun, but it still can’t compare to a night out with your friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDS80s"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt; is available on Nintendo Switch, PC, and PlayStation 4.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKHONs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xyPqVh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
