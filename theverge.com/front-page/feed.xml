    <title>Light sensors on wearables struggle with dark skin and obesity</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rPTfh3"&gt;Light sensors used to track heart rate in wearable devices like the Apple Watch Series 5 and the Fitbit Versa 2 don’t work as well on darker skin or people with obesity, according to modeling done in a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8713672/"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdXiIo"&gt;That’s a problem for features currently built into devices — but it’s also a bad sign for efforts to use light sensors for new applications in wearables, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677381/smartwatch-blood-pressure-samsung-fitbit-apple"&gt;monitoring blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, says study author Jessica Ramella-Roman, an associate professor studying bioimaging sensors at Florida International University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2QBbg"&gt;“The architecture of the device has to change,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LmWqd"&gt;The study looked at the photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, a technique that uses changes in how light is reflected to measure blood flow, on three wearable devices: the Apple Watch Series 5, Fitbit Versa 2, and Polar M600. The research team used a model that simulates how light moves through tissue to show how the sensors on those devices would behave with different skin properties. Darker skin has higher melanin and absorbs more light, while skin from people with obesity tends to be thicker, have less water, and have less blood flow than skin from people who are not obese. While previous research on accuracy and bias in wearables has focused on skin tone, Ramella-Roman says that many studies haven’t included a lot of people with obesity despite these physiological differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qbx7kq"&gt;“That’s why we think it’s necessary to focus there,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LsrOn"&gt;The PPG signal didn’t change much as skin tone changed, the researchers’ model found: it varied less than 10 percent across the devices. But modeling obesity, both alone and together with skin tone, caused up to a 60 percent variation in the signal. Signal loss appeared to be because of the changes in skin thickness in people with obesity, the authors said in the study. There were changes in the peak of the PPG signal, which is used to calculate heart rate but whose signal strength should not change based on the heart rate value. There were also changes in the shape of the signal — which different groups are using as a way to track blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9aYqpZ"&gt;“As we increased the BMI level and increased the skin tone, the signal diminished, and then other features started disappearing as well,” she says. The Fitbit, which had fewer sensors, had a more dramatic loss of signal than the Apple Watch, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ItVTsZ"&gt;This study only modeled how these wearable devices would detect signals in the lab, Ramella-Roman stressed. The team still has to check the devices on actual people in order to confirm the findings. They’re in the process of doing that study now and have enrolled around 100 people so far, she says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZB5fg"&gt;But the problems revealed by analyses like this complicate projects looking to use wearables to track cardiovascular health for underserved groups, Ramella-Roman says. The new study indicates researchers have to be careful using PPG, particularly for projects aiming to use the devices to help monitor people at higher risk of cardiovascular issues — which includes people with obesity. “The holy grail in this context is looking at blood pressure,” she says. “But many, many studies looking at blood pressure use some combination of PPG and other modalities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxSlul"&gt;The findings also suggest that other devices that use light sensors and PPG, like the blood oxygen measures in hospitals or doctors’ offices, might not work as well for people with obesity. There are very few studies that evaluate the devices in those groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yRH6uT"&gt;The good news is it should be possible to adjust devices (like by moving around the spacing of the sensors) so that they are more accurate on people with darker skin or with obesity without compromising accuracy for other groups, Ramella-Roman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qtXEVg"&gt;“The way the systems were designed initially maybe didn’t account for these individuals, but they could definitely make changes,” she says. “I don’t see anything that would limit that.”  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kyocera DuraSport 5G UW review: tough choices</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The DuraSport 5G is one of the few rugged options available&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="XH6g5P"&gt;After releasing the tank-like $899.99 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446490/kyocera-duraforce-ultra-5g-uw-review-price-specs-screen-camera"&gt;DuraForce Ultra 5G UW in April 2021&lt;/a&gt;, Kyocera is back with a more subtly rugged (and more affordable) phone — the $579.99 DuraSport 5G UW. If you want a sub-$600 rugged phone that works on Verizon’s millimeter wave (mmWave) 5G network, the DuraSport 5G UW is really your only choice. Roughly the size of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A with 5G&lt;/a&gt;, the DuraSport is small but strong: it’s dust, sand, and waterproof in up to 6.5 ft of water for 30 minutes (IP68), as well as MIL 810H-certified to survive five-foot drops onto concrete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fyRyM"&gt;Underneath that toughness, the DuraSport is a sub-$300 phone at heart. It shares similar specs as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;$239.99 OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt;: they both use the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of internal storage. But the DuraSport has a smaller 4,500mAh battery and comes with some unique outdoor apps and camera features. This leads to the obvious question: is a budget rugged phone worth the premium, or are you better off getting a cheap 5G phone and adding a very protective case around it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mQRyhj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10954621"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Irpu2G5AQ1fM2aqWOGvUvsuIYeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100512/gsin_190401_4934_0001_cropped.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FceIkL"&gt;DuraSport 5G UW Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="87ab7q"&gt;At a time when every new budget phone seems to be over 6.5 inches tall, the DuraSport is surprisingly compact. It’s similar to the Google Pixel 5A with 5G but thicker and slightly more narrow (6.09 x 2.78 x 0.39-inch or 154.7 x 70.7 x 9.9mm). They even look alike, with the same rounded corners and fingerprint sensor on the back — handy for unlocking the phone when you’re wearing a mask. This phone fits nicely in my small hands, and I can stuff it into most pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6x0Q5"&gt;For a phone built to survive the rigorous military-grade tests for dust, sand, water, and drop protection, the DuraSport’s design doesn’t scream rugged. Unlike its more expensive sibling, the DuraSport has normal dimensions and proportions. But it still obviates the need for a separate case: not only is its screen protected by Gorilla Glass 6, but it has reinforced corners, water-tight seams around its buttons, and a Dragontrail Glass over its rear cameras. Despite its extra bits of engineering, the Kyocera weighs about the same as the Pixel 5A. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/szgt5xhgFStySime-UT16E5-eCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100514/gsin_190401_4934_0004_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The DuraSport has some texture on its sides to help with grip, but it’s not very comfortable to hold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9A00JY"&gt;While the DuraSport’s hard plastic shell can withstand a lot of abuse, it’s not the most comfortable to hold. Kyocera added some light texture to its back cover and along the sides, but they don’t provide much substantial grip to the device. Not that this phone needs the extra protection, but a case would make the phone easier to hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwU83e"&gt;Among the many ways you can customize this phone, the most obvious is the programmable button on the left side. You can set it to open the exact camera mode you need in a hurry (underwater shutter button) or open a particular app if you double-press the button. I kept hitting the programmable button by accident because that’s where my thumb lands when I hold the phone; the actual power button is a bit too low for my liking. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/goH2npYLIBiyfmDpLl-sLeG10_g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100518/gsin_190401_4934_0012_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The included suite of outdoor apps can provide useful information, but they require constant access to your location, even when you’re not using them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7FSjlj"&gt;DuraSport 5G UW Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8pyQG8"&gt;Despite its mid-range price tag, the DuraSport has low-end internal components. Its processor is the budget-tier Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 with 4GB of RAM, which makes the DuraSport just a beat slower to open a webpage or switch between portrait and landscape mode when watching a YouTube video. This was particularly evident when playing a round of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;, where the middle of a battle slowed to such a crawl that I couldn’t move my Pokémon out of the way to dodge an attack. While a sub-$300 phone can get away with just 64GB of storage, it’s mismatched to the DuraSport’s nearly $600 price tag, even if it has a microSD card slot for expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGZaCB"&gt;The DuraSport somewhat redeems itself with a 6.1-inch 1080p IPS LCD display that is quite bright (500 nits), making it possible to use the screen at just 60 percent brightness in direct sunlight. When you look at high-res photos like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22829680/2021-art-illustrations-photography-verge-roundup"&gt;The Verge’s 2021: A Year in Art&lt;/a&gt;, the images look smooth and detailed even when you pixel-peep, thanks to this screen’s over 400PPI pixel density. Best of all, the touchscreen is functional when I’m wearing gloves or there is water on the screen, which is a huge help during winter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnFy7I"&gt;This phone is preloaded with apps for outdoor enthusiasts: an Outdoor Portal, Compass, Barometer, Sun&amp;amp;Moon, Weather, Tide (if you fish or have a boat), and Solunar (if you want to meet or avoid certain animals). In my case, I skate on an outdoor rink in the winter but am extremely picky about when I do so: the temperature needs to be at least 32 degrees or below the night before and throughout the day, with minimal wind, and after sunset so the ice has a chance to harden. I used the Outdoor Portal to monitor my local weather and sunset / sunrise data rather than cycle between multiple apps. While I appreciate the convenience of having these apps on my phone, I was not impressed that I had to give the apps non-stop access to my location, even though they said I could just limit the data collection to when I use the apps. If you don’t care to use these apps at all, you don’t have to worry about the location tracking, but they are a big part of the DuraSport’s selling points.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Za_0PTHZr5E8GrE4FGg5EUTFO3k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100513/gsin_190401_4934_0003_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The included outdoor apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WugW9L"&gt;Beyond these outdoor apps, the DuraSport essentially runs an unmodified version of Android 11. As one of the phones selected for the &lt;a href="https://androidenterprisepartners.withgoogle.com/device/#!/Atw0zjuq92nTHyfuwwaC"&gt;Android Enterprise Recommended&lt;/a&gt; program, Kyocera is already committed to providing quarterly security updates to the DuraSport until November 2023. This, along with the fact Kyocera provides two years of warranty, compared to the industry standard of just one year, means this phone should last you a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLv26q"&gt;The DuraSport’s 4,500mAh battery is actually quite energy-efficient and able to go without a charge after two days of use — and that’s from using mostly 4G LTE. After listening to a couple of hour-long podcasts, taking some photos and videos, posting and scrolling through social media, and reading various articles, I got about 15.5 hours of screen time out of the DuraSport over two days. Using the included charger, I was able to recharge the phone within 2.5 hours, which isn’t particularly fast. Kyocera says the DuraSport supports faster charging, but a fast charger is not included in the box. Like the DuraSport Ultra 5G, the lower tier model also supports wireless charging for more convenient topping up.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ge9x8YJkswhw_6oWgX2d-TQLTtc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100516/gsin_190401_4934_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The DuraSport’s camera is budget-level, despite its mid-range price tag.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GcaNqZ"&gt;DuraSport 5G UW Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NdYqvf"&gt;Let’s get this out of the way: if you’re serious about photography, then you won’t like the cameras on the DuraSport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwh9GB"&gt;The phone has two cameras on the back, a 48-megapixel main and a 16-megapixel ultrawide, as well as an 8-megapixel front camera. The cameras take perfectly fine photos in good lighting conditions, but they’re not designed for anything challenging like low-light or action photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="14riyf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10988512"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NP3CMo"&gt;Its cameras share the same problems that plague other sub-$300 phones. Not only do the colors differ between the main and ultrawide camera, but the main camera also sometimes has trouble focusing and separating the subject from the background in portrait mode. I’ve also noticed that photos from low-light environments look as if there is vignetting around the edges — whether they were captured with the main, ultrawide, or selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyd2wN"&gt;The DuraSport tries to make up for its technical deficiencies with some unique video interfaces like the Action Overlay and beauty filters. (I did not have access to ANT Plus compatible fitness sensors, so I could not test the Action Overlay being linked to my fitness data in real-time.) Ultimately, it’s let down by a camera app that is slow at switching between cameras and will randomly close for no reason, which makes it frustrating to take photos with it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/txzVUzQNArBSUldpMHGKeU1EaBk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121642/gsin_190410_4934_0023.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kyocera DuraSport 5G UW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k0eOIY"&gt;There is no doubt you’re paying a premium for the rugged design of the $579.99 DuraSport 5G UW — despite the fact it has cheap components that are more common in sub-$300 budget phones. It’s a shame it doesn’t use a faster processor or feature better cameras for a phone that is almost $600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvqoKv"&gt;There are plenty of other, better phones in this price range, including Google’s own Pixel 6. But if you’re looking for a rugged phone and want to use Verizon’s faster mmWave 5G network, the DuraSport is really the only budget rugged 5G phone available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsci4J"&gt;If having excellent cameras on your phone is more important to you, and you are willing to accept a water-resistant (IP67) rather than a waterproof one (IP68), then the $449 Pixel 5A with 5G would be a better choice. After all, they look and feel almost identical to each other, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okGCOQ"&gt;The peace of mind of having a phone that can handle serious spills and drops without needing to be replaced within a few years, thanks to Kyocera’s two-year warranty, is worthwhile, but most of us are better off just investing in a durable case for another phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="XCHVNL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10988492"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S0pRvT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, 1:30PM ET, January 21st, 2022:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this review stated the DuraForce 5G UW does not support wireless charging. That is incorrect, the phone includes support for Qi charging. Also added information about optional wired fast charging. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>1Password has plans to get companies to actually use one password</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tBHvW8XyJFdQ253O1VBuSs1Ggyo=/256x0:3009x1835/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70417116/Screen_Shot_2022_01_20_at_8.06.18_PM.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n8QNZ4"&gt;Digital password manager company 1Password announced this week intentions to expand the login features of its services — starting with something the company calls Universal Sign On that it says can make logging into different websites or services even easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcBpqa"&gt;1Password already sells subscription services to small and large businesses looking to control and secure access to various passwords amongst staff — and now it looks to make Universal Sign On work alongside multi-factor authentication products like Duo and single sign-on (SSO) products like Okta (depending on what the enterprise needs are).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aP7ewW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Protecting you online — it’s in our DNA.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, we announce our Series C and our vision for the future of 1Password, to bring human-centric security to everyone: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ql0LxQ0LCF"&gt;https://t.co/Ql0LxQ0LCF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 1Password (@1Password) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/1Password/status/1483802922660122627?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 19, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XlGC2z"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://blog.1password.com/future-of-1password/"&gt;announcing&lt;/a&gt; a new funding round valuing the company at $6.8 billion, 1Password launched a “vision of the future” &lt;a href="https://www.future.1password.com"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; presenting a simplified idea on how 1Password can help make logins easier by remembering what single sign-on method was used on what site and ride it through for you (thereby, continuing the tradition of only needing the namesake “one password”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLp35I"&gt;Tom Warren with&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; joined 1Password CEO and founders on a Twitter Space talk on Wednesday, asking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="SEQqjC"&gt;“How will 1Password try to solve the challenges of universal log on and, in particular, whether you’re trying to compete with Okta, Active Directory and others in this space?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3uMwdB"&gt;1Password’s CFO Jeannie De Guzman responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QRhhNt"&gt;“We actually partner with Okta and we are an Okta shop at 1Password. When I think about competing with Okta... we don’t view them as a direct competitor. When you use Okta inside a company, it’s often times a lot of enterprise level software that you have enterprise-wide deployments... there's a huge proliferation of SaaS apps going out that are being used by all of us at work right now. Those onesies and twosies that go to one person or to a small group of people... those don’t necessarily get caught in Okta”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HJpavW"&gt;Guzman explains the issue of “shadow IT,” where people can still have access to things not governed by Okta SSO or have accounts for work that IT does not know about — and that is where Guzman says 1Password can cooperate with Okta (or other SSOs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPFjWA"&gt;“We capture all those logins that don’t get captured enterprise-wide.” Guzman gave an example of this as someone who has worked finance in various companies: finance departments could give access to bank accounts with a single sign-on solution using 1Password, even if they’re not configured for Okta-style SSO access. Guzman further expanded that many companies could have a finance department employee who just left and, yet, still knows the bank account password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="319Lhc"&gt;Today, the company &lt;a href="https://blog.1password.com/how-sso-fits-enterprise-security-framework/"&gt;posted on its blog&lt;/a&gt; to further explain how 1Password will work alongside SSO solutions and why companies really should use its product:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JzcUA4"&gt;It’s important to note that SSO doesn’t solve all your security problems, just a subset of them. For instance, if a service isn’t integrated into your SSO platform, employees can create an account on their own, bypassing SSO altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UyNEpE"&gt;You can also check out the full 1Password Twitter Space recording below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s the best student laptop? We asked students</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BVcaADlGztrbR5iNL_kFd3rebG0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67232292/akrales_200421_3975_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tsQK0e"&gt;Shopping for a laptop can be stressful — doubly stressful if you or your children will be learning online for the first time. Kids of different ages have a range of different laptop use cases and different needs. And as the choices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; evolve, so do students’ needs. So I spoke to some experts on the subject: students themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9ZW8b"&gt;My recommendations here are meant to accommodate a variety of preferences and price ranges. But they’re a jumping-off point rather than an exhaustive list: every student is different. Before making a decision, you’ll want to make sure you read reviews and try out devices yourself if you can. I’ll do my best to keep this article up to date with items that are in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Best laptop for students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;aside id="7m4BUq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"},{"title":"The best Chromebooks to buy in 2022","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4lsvuf2NE7Upsw5uiVfjINO_Jhk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19315989/vpavic_191023_3755_0159.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixelbook Go has solid battery life and a rippled base that’s easy to grip, making it a good choice for kids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uaaUWw"&gt;Best laptop for elementary school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wdF0Hl"&gt;For younger students, a touchscreen device is easier to use than a keyboard and touchpad, says Michelle Glogovac. Glogovac’s five-year-old son uses an iPad for Webex meetings with his kindergarten class. He’s gotten the hang of it; Glogovac says he’s already learned how to mute and unmute himself, “a skill that many adults aren’t familiar with.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEF087"&gt;That said, it may be worth investing in a keyboard case if you go the tablet route. Glogovac has to type her son’s meeting codes and passwords for him, which can be cumbersome on the iPad’s flat screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxdcbE"&gt;As kids get older, their best laptop choice will vary depending on their needs. As a parent, it’s important that you and your child are in sync about how they intend to use it and the size of the programs they want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sTP9p"&gt;Kristin Wallace purchased a budget HP laptop for her daughter, Bella, but didn’t realize how quickly the nine-year-old would fill up 32GB of storage. “It is really slow and has no space for games. I need a computer with more storage space,” said Bella, who uses the laptop to Zoom with friends and take virtual guitar lessons and math enrichment classes. Wallace plans to buy Bella a better device in the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwTXVL"&gt;Audio quality is an important consideration for kids’ laptops. Lisa Mitchell, an elementary library media specialist, says her students use their devices to watch YouTube videos in addition to their online classes. Battery life is also a plus, even for distance learners who may not be far from a wall outlet. Bella likes to use her laptop all around the house and doesn’t want to bring the cord with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaeV8B"&gt;Durability is also worth paying for, according to Mitchell. If you’re using a tablet, get a protective case. “If a reasonably-priced insurance or replacement policy is available, it’s usually worth the extra expense.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is just $289, but it can run plenty of tabs and apps with no problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dE2ANJ"&gt;Best laptop for middle school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="r5kOKS"&gt;The middle school students I spoke to don’t use their laptops for much more than web-based schoolwork and browsing. Don’t be too concerned about power — prioritize a machine that’s comfortable and easy for your child to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9OvOd"&gt;“We just got the most basic Chromebook and it is totally perfect,” says Gabrielle Hartley, an &lt;a href="http://gabriellehartley.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;attorney&lt;/a&gt; and mother of three children. “The most basic Chromebook serves all the needs of the basic middle schooler.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user types on the Acer Chromebook Spin 713." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0hMEh9WTjBjXAQF5Bh8xq8l2ng0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21698818/mchin_181029_4126_0017.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chromebooks, like this one from Acer, are a good choice for students who use Google Classroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fP2U74"&gt;Hartley’s son Max, who is in eighth grade, agrees. “I would really like a gaming PC or gaming laptop that can plug into a monitor and run video games with 120fps, but I really don’t need that,” Max says. “Most eighth graders aren’t going to be running any video games on their laptops or any software that requires a lot of power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpOfaD"&gt;Max mostly uses his laptop for Google Classroom applications, including Gmail, Slides, Google Docs, and Google Sheets. They’re very easy to use on his device, which he describes as “a run-of-the-mill Samsung Chromebook.” That said, if your child is starting middle school this year, it could be worth checking with their teachers to see what operating system is most compatible with their workflow. Caspian Fischer Odén, a ninth grader from Sweden, told me he has trouble with his Chromebook because his school has blocked downloading apps from the Google Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eUtDq"&gt;Even kids with more demanding hobbies think a budget device can get the job done. Sam Hickman, an eighth grader from the UK who uses his laptop for photo and video editing, says, “For most middle schoolers, any processor developed within the last two years will be able to handle any tasks they can throw at it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4fFLe"&gt;So, what &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;worth paying for? A comfortable keyboard, several students told me. Many middle school kids aren’t used to typing for long periods of time. You should also look for a device that’s compact and easy for them to carry around, particularly if they’re preparing for in-person school. Shoot for an 11- to 13-inch model — certainly nothing larger than 15 inches. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Laptop 4 is a capable, no-nonsense laptop — just what many high schoolers want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SKuVFA"&gt;Best laptop for high school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OHE9ce"&gt;High schoolers’ laptop needs can vary based on their interests, but most don’t need powerful machines with lots of bells and whistles — especially if they come with glitches or serious downsides that could interfere with schoolwork. Miles Riehle, a student at Laguna Beach High School, has a high-end Surface Pro 7 but finds it overwhelming. “There is so much other stuff that I don’t use very often,” he said. “Something simpler might be a little more straightforward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toVK5y"&gt;The best operating system may depend on what your child is used to. Aryan Nambiar, a student at Barrington High School in Illinois, has an iMac at home and enjoys using an iPad for his schoolwork. Riehle says he would prefer a Chromebook because he has an Android phone and often uses Google services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taD6O0"&gt;But almost every student I spoke to agreed that the most important feature of a high school laptop is portability. Kids attending in-person classes may be carrying their device around for much of the day with a stack of other books. Look for a 13- or 14-inch screen, or a lighter 15- to 17-inch model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9koeX"&gt;Students also recommend something sturdy. “Most high schoolers I’ve seen will throw their laptop in their bag without too much care,” says Moses Buckwalter, a student at Penn Manor High School. Backpacks can be jostled in the hallway as well. Kids can also run into trouble at home. “Anything can happen,” says Aadit Agrawal, a high school student from India. “My own brother scratched my laptop with his nails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wo7j0d"&gt;Battery life is another key feature. “It can be a real struggle to find a place to charge while in class,” says Cas Heemskerk, a sophomore from the Netherlands. Unlike college students, many high schoolers don’t have frequent breaks to juice up their devices, so try to find something that can last a full day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMbdD6"&gt;Many students recommend a touchscreen with stylus support. Nambiar uses the feature for his biology class, where he does a lot of visual modeling. “The touchscreen is always a bonus for drawing diagrams, whereas if you’re using a laptop it’d be a whole process to submit a diagram you drew,” Nambiar says. Riehle uses a Surface Pen to fill out school forms and annotate PDFs. Agrawal finds it useful to take notes on the same screen as his online lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7t3Wu"&gt;Depending on the broadband situation in your area, you may also want a laptop with multiple connectivity options. Agrawal’s online classes are sometimes interrupted by powercuts, so he recommends an LTE model. Matej Plavevski, a junior at Yahya Kemal College in North Macedonia, recommends looking for an Ethernet port in case slower connections disrupt meetings. That’s hard to find on smaller laptops, but there’s a slew of affordable dongles and docks to consider. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For college students seeking an affordable laptop, HP’s Envy x360 performs just as well as some expensive competitors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QKVW4e"&gt;Best laptop for college &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sqoQtB"&gt;College kids are justified in spending a bit more money than other age groups. Some (especially in STEM courses) can expect to do some fairly demanding work. Assad Abid, an electrical engineering undergrad from Pakistan, needs to run simulation software for his assignments. Aakash Chandra, a student at New Horizon College of Engineering in India, does a lot of coding, in addition to creative work in Premiere Pro and Photoshop, and gaming. Students also noted that it’s worthwhile to pay for a laptop that will last for a few years after graduation. That means you won’t have to worry about finding and financing your next device until you’re (hopefully) settled into a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNtiDo"&gt;But among high-end, capable devices there’s still a wide range of options. Students stressed that a college laptop should be light. Expect to bring it between classes, meals, meetings, the library, and other locations on campus. “It’s a boon that I can carry my laptop as well as some notebooks without feeling like I’m carrying too much for six hours a day,” says Haseeb Waseem, a senior at Villanova University. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ntrjko32oDlmo53mASwptA-kbCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19897864/mchin_200413_3971_0010.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 has a variety of configurations. Students with light workloads may prefer the base model, while gamers and creatives can add a GPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gsQLLb"&gt;Another universally-lauded feature: battery life. Waseem, who uses an HP Spectre, says the all-day juice gives him “the flexibility to study in a bunch of different locations, and even outside.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PevA8"&gt;Speakers and webcams are often overlooked, even in top-end devices. But students say it’s worth looking for good ones if you’re starting college this year. Though many college students are now back to in-person classes, some will still be meeting with clubs and attending events online. Waseem isn’t satisfied with his laptop’s audio and picture quality, which he says has made it difficult to pay attention in class and to engage with other students.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqglEH"&gt;Many students will need to invest more in areas tailored to their interests and schoolwork needs. Chandra’s dream laptop would include a stylus and touchscreen for his creative work as well as a high-end GPU. Waseem, who uses his laptop for a hodgepodge of activities, including streaming, coding, social media, video chatting, and Microsoft Office work, would prefer to prioritize a large screen to keep track of his multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xbox Series S is on sale at Woot for its lowest price ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1C9hVgB1FGjM8EYll7petwp8lr4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70416960/vpavic_201103_4275_0234.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today only (or while supplies last), you can pick up Microsoft’s next-gen console for just $279.99.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BGsaOQ"&gt;While nabbing an Xbox Series S isn’t as difficult as getting your hands on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X these days, Microsoft’s pearly white console is still in high demand. Currently, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDealsRoundup012122/https://www.woot.com/offers/microsoft-xbox-series-s-512gb-3?ref=w_cnt_wp_0_13" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot is hosting a deal on the Xbox Series S&lt;/a&gt;, reducing its regular $299.99 price tag to $279.99. This isn’t a massive discount by any means but it matches the best price we’ve ever seen for this console. The Series S isn’t quite as powerful as the Series X with some of the key distinctions being a lack of a physical disc drive, less storage space, and a less powerful processor. However, the console is still home to fantastic first-party titles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769985/forza-horizon-5-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and is compatible with a massive library of last-gen titles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2022/1/20/22892969/xbox-games-360-original-backward-compatible-digital-sale-deal-microsoft"&gt;many of which are currently on sale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BCriBu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="G6Hwfq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Is Microsoft building a gaming monopoly?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22889435/microsoft-activision-blizzard-game-pass-cloud-gaming-monopoly-ftc-questions"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kGw3an"&gt;If you’re a PC gamer, one of MSI’s best gaming monitors is now on sale at Walmart. The MSI Optix MAG321CQR normally retails $449.99 but is &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMSI-Optix-31-5-16-9-QHD-RGB-LED-Non-Glare-Super-Narrow-Bezel-1ms-2560-x-1440-144Hz-Refresh-Rate-Free-Sync-Height-Adjustable-Curved-Gaming-Monitor-Bla%2F866580873%3Fathcpid%3D866580873%26athpgid%3DAthenaItempage%26athcgid%3Dnull%26athznid%3Dsi%26athieid%3Dv0%26athstid%3DCS004%26athguid%3DETq9k2xgFeUvULajDCcvVFd9f8WBYvi8ca8L%26athancid%3Dnull%26athena%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $289.99 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. This 32-inch curved gaming panel comes equipped with all the bells and whistles you need to elevate your gaming setup. The Optix lands in a sweet spot by combining a 144Hz refresh rate with 1440p resolution, striking a solid balance between performance and visual fidelity. In addition to the expected HDMI and DisplayPort inputs, the monitor also features a pair of USB-A ports for power and a single port for data. The included stand is height and tilt adjustable, too, and the monitor is compatible with VESA mounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e7ojG2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10871048"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition is on sale right now for $79.99, a healthy $50 off the usual price tag. This isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen, but it’s a decent value for anyone in the market for a TKL model. Just like other TKL keyboards, the Tournament Edition ditches the number pad and dedicated media playback buttons for a slimmer design that presents you with the essentials you need for gaming, in addition to the handy function row and navigation keys. It also uses Razer’s proprietary linear optical switches for smooth and rapid key presses, as well as a standardized keycap layout that allows you to swap out custom keycaps for a more personal touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aeIloN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10721765"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WwN5hz"&gt;Whether you need something to help keep your floors tidy or just a robotic chariot for your resident feline, the iRobot Roomba j7 is a solid option. Normally $649.99, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/iRobot-Roomba-Wi-Fi-Connected-Vacuum/dp/B094NW318F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has recently discounted this model to $399.99&lt;/a&gt;. One of the smartest automated cleaning solutions for your home, the j7 can clean on a schedule or handle messes immediately with the help of the Roomba app or Alexa and Google voice assistants. This model also features integrated obstacle avoidance, which allows it to easily navigate furniture and other large objects, but also ensures that it won’t accidentally choke on an errant iPhone charger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aorc8r"&gt;Perhaps most importantly, however, the j7 features good battery life and is capable of avoiding poop and other pet messes it can’t handle effectively. One small caveat to this otherwise well-rounded robovac is that, unlike the more expensive iRobot Roomba j7 Plus, it lacks an auto-empty base, meaning you will need to empty the bin manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vJogxi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10989422"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Currently, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ROCCAT-Vulcan-Optical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08J4HQGZ2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grab this unique keyboard for $129.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a substantial drop from its usual price of $199.99 and the lowest price we’ve seen for this keyboard to date. The Vulcan Pro features a full-size layout with dedicated media playback buttons and a remarkably slim chassis. The slim style extends to the keycap design, which rests on top of the switches rather than around them, giving the keyboard the aesthetic of a sci-fi typewriter and providing a more prominent display for the RGB backlighting. One final feature that makes this keyboard unique is the software. The Roccat Neon software (formerly swarm) allows you to add custom typing sounds to your keyboard if you’re feeling nostalgic for that classic clicky sound.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I had to see these Hello Kitty gaming accessories, so now you do, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer’s Hello Kitty headset on a pink table with a pink keyboard, mousepad, and monitor in the background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w4EvuJXsmdKZrKrGMUgXhDvCpwk=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70416958/HeadsetFocus_OnDesk.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are cat ears on the headset. I wish I was joking.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tYIIEb"&gt;Razer is known for making some of the best, flashiest gaming gear on the market, from the category-topping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22650400/razer-basilisk-v3-chroma-rgb-scroll-wheel-price-features"&gt;Basilisk V3&lt;/a&gt; to the mind-blowingly powerful and portable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548663/razer-blade-14-review-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-5900hx-nvidia-rtx-3070"&gt;Razer Blade 14&lt;/a&gt;. Today, it’s announcing something, well, slightly different. The company has partnered with Sanrio to release a line of Hello Kitty-themed gaming accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrltpt"&gt;You may think I’m making this up, but alas, I am not. Take a look: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer’s Hello Kitty chair in front of a black background. On the chair are the Hello Kitty lumbar cushion, headset, mousepad and mouse." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9gR-lZCibzyHD3nli3wVyghVyEw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23184801/FamilyShot.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The gang is all here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AUNvLw"&gt;There’s a lot to unpack here. As you can see, we’ve got a mouse, a mousepad, Bluetooth headphones, a chair, and a lumbar cushion. It’s not just the kitty herself featured throughout — other franchise characters, including two who, I’m told, are named Badtz-maru and Keroppi, also make appearances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IM7DGz"&gt;You know what? I was prepared to roll my eyes at these, but they’re kind of adorable. If you have one of the various hot pink laptops that Razer has released over the years, I think these should go great with it. Just make sure you don’t wear bright red anywhere near this setup because it’s going to hurt my eyes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4FWdug"&gt;If you want to purchase any of these (they’re sold separately, so you don’t need to buy everything), you can get the &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-chairs%2Frazer-iskur%2FRZ38-02840200-R3U1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;chair for $499&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Fhello-kitty-and-friends-edition-razer-deathadder-essential-goliathus%2FRZ83-03850100-B3M1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;mouse and pad for $64.99&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-headsets%2Frazer-kraken-bt-kitty-edition%2FRZ04-03520300-R3M1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;headphones for $119.99&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-chairs-accessories%2Frazer-lumbar-cushion%2FRC81-03830201-R3M1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;lumbar cushion for $59.99&lt;/a&gt;. If you care about boring stuff like specs, the chair is an &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming%2Fchairs%2Frazer-iskur-x&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;Iskur X&lt;/a&gt; with a synthetic leather cover, the mouse &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-deathadder-essential%2FRZ01-03850100-R3M1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;is a DeathAdder Ess&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-deathadder-essential%2FRZ01-03850100-R3M1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ential&lt;/a&gt; with a 6,400 DPI optical sensor, and the headphones are from the Razer Kraken BT line (there’s a regular &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-headsets%2FRazer-Kraken-BT-Kitty-Edition%2FRZ04-03520100-R3U1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;“Kitty Edition,”&lt;/a&gt; sans Hello, as well). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQxvoG"&gt;These are all a bit more expensive than their non-Hello Kitty counterparts, so certainly aren’t the best value for your money — but can you really put a price on the meme potential of filling your gaming setup with anthropomorphic cats? Now, excuse me while I try to convince my employer to let me expense a kitty-themed home office. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Chromebook for 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Chromebook 2022: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HDV4yWEUjQt1tPQn1vixjNoG1V4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976144/mchin_181029_4126_0011.0.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best Chromebook laptop or two-in-one for every Chrome OS fan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="wvBJQw"&gt;The best Chromebooks aren’t just laptops that run a few Google apps anymore. Chromebooks can cover a wide variety of computing needs now, and a good Chrome OS laptop or two-in-one can be more useful than a mediocre &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21231636/windows-10-pc-user-guide-how-to-microsoft"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281530/macos-mac-imac-user-guide-how-to-os-tips"&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt; laptop. That’s why our pick for the best Chromebook of 2022 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;, which does just about everything right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnwyna"&gt;The best Chromebooks are known to deliver good value. The message that many people actually want &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;Chromebooks — rather than just cheap ones — has gotten through to manufacturers. Many are around $500 or $600, though there are good options in the higher and lower ranges as well. The extra money goes a long way toward getting something you’ll be happy with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUTNYw"&gt;For the first time, the quality of the best Chromebooks in this range has been consistent. There are so many similarities between the offerings from Asus, Lenovo, Google, HP, Dell, and Samsung that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they’re all sourcing their components from the same factory. That’s great news if you’re comparison shopping; the majority of this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount. They can even rival some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21528540/budget-windows-10-chromebook-systems-acer-lenovo-cheap"&gt;best budget laptops&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptops&lt;/a&gt; on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMCGia"&gt;Our pick for the best Chromebook is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and we’ve selected the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; for shoppers on a budget. Other picks for the best Chromebooks of 2021 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776850/asus-chromebook-flip-cx5-review-the-15-inch-chromebook-to-beat"&gt;Asus Chromebook Flip CX5&lt;/a&gt;, the HP Chromebook x360, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch4TuU"&gt;What most buyers want in the best Chromebook are likely the same things they want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want. More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but these are the ones that rise above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the best Chromebook of 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KQRVus"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BfZy92"&gt;Best Chromebook of 2022&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LpXHDz"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is, hands-down, the best Chromebook you can buy. With a gorgeous 3:2 screen that rivals some more expensive competitors, you’ll have a ton of extra vertical space for your work and multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarhIJ"&gt;The keyboard is excellent with a comfortable, quiet feel, and nice backlighting. There’s even an HDMI port, which you don’t see on a thin Chromebook every day. And (most importantly) the 11th-Gen Intel processors can handle a heavy load of tabs with no problem. The Spin’s speakers aren’t great, and there’s no biometric login, but those are reasonable sacrifices to make for a laptop of this quality at this low of a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX2USx"&gt;In a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Acer sets itself apart by making an affordable laptop that’s excellent in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For students or anyone looking for a small secondary device, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great affordable pick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1hHuvs"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P8MGAD"&gt;Best Chromebook on a budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xJq778"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable device for on-the-go work, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet delivers excellent value for its low price. It’s an ultra-portable 10.1-inch 2-in-1 device with a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfnBmb"&gt;The Duet contains a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage, and it performs well if you’re just browsing and don’t plan on using a super heavy load. It also uses a version of Chrome OS that’s made for its convertible form factor, including the first version of Chrome that’s optimized for tablet use. When detached from its keyboard, the Duet supports an Android-esque gesture navigation system that makes switching between apps a breeze. But the most impressive feature is battery life; I got close to 11.5 hours of fairly heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93jX9I"&gt;Of course, there are drawbacks. The touchpad and keyboard are quite small, there’s no headphone jack (and only one USB-C port), and the 16:10 screen is a bit dim. But those are reasonable trade-offs to make for such an affordable price. It makes a great secondary device for schoolwork or on-the-go browsing.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a larger device with more power, one of the best Chromebooks you can buy is the HP Chromebook x360 14.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C2SoIE"&gt;3. HP Chromebook x360 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rtrWbQ"&gt;Powerful Chromebook with a sleek design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rGvI"&gt;If you’re looking to get more power and you don’t mind getting a slightly larger laptop, the HP Chromebook x360 14 is a great choice. HP has several configurations that fall under this name, but we suggest the model we tested with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage to go along with the i3 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUDxQ"&gt;While we picked the Asus because of its elegant design, there isn’t much to complain about on the slightly larger HP. It has the same ports, RAM, and storage. The keyboard is great, and it also sounds slightly better because the speakers are up on the keyboard deck instead of on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the Chomebook Duet isn’t enough, the Chromebook Detachable CM3 brings some new perks to the detachable form factor, for an extra cost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FxguZ6"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CrrPVI"&gt;Best detachable Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="canZPK"&gt;The Chromebook Detachable CM3 is Asus’s attempt to compete with Lenovo’s highly praised Chromebook Duet. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch, 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, a kickstand, and a keyboard that pops on and off. It’s a bit more expensive than the Duet, but also has a few extra features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNgQvV"&gt;One unique perk is that the kickstand folds multiple ways: You can fold it the long way to stand the tablet up like a laptop, or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. We’re not sure how practical this functionality actually is, but it’s there if you have a use case in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlTu0z"&gt;The CM3 also comes with a built-in USI stylus, and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. But the thing we found most impressive was the battery life: We averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work on the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11a1Pz"&gt;The CM3 won’t be the best Chromebook for everyone: It only has two ports (one USB-C and one audio jack) and its MediaTek processor was a bit sluggish compared to more expensive offerings. But if you’re looking for a convertible Chrome OS device and find that the Duet doesn’t quite suit your needs, you’re likely the CM3’s target audience. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus Chromebook CX5 is the best Chromebook with a 15-inch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VMPUxM"&gt;Best Chromebook with a 15-inch screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qu3aaz"&gt;Folks may understandably balk at the Chromebook Flip CX5’s price, but it really is that good. It’s sturdy enough to withstand all kinds of jolts and jostles in a backpack or briefcase, and has a unique velvety texture that’s very pleasant to hold. Add a wide port selection, a smooth and comfortable keyboard, and a vivid display, and you’ve got a chassis that can hold its own against plenty of midrange Windows laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RcLGGd"&gt;The CX5’s performance is equally impressive. We never once heard its fan in our testing, even when pushing a workload that slows most devices down. Battery life is quite satisfactory and easily lasted us all day. And the CX5 delivered some of the loudest audio we’ve ever heard from a Chromebook. While the CX5 isn’t a perfect device, it’s a solid performer all around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yloceu"&gt;Best midrange Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="IqMUru"&gt;Samsung’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; shot for the moon, with a $1,000 price tag, an OLED display, a packaged stylus, and a premium build. The Galaxy Chromebook 2 isn’t so much a sequel to that device as it is a pared-down, more affordable alternative. There’s no fingerprint sensor, no stylus, and no OLED — but it’s quite functional, and with a sub-$600 starting price it’s a much more reasonable purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMshkm"&gt;The Chromebook 2’s highlight feature is its finish: It comes in a bright “fiesta red” that will certainly stand out wherever you’re using it. (There’s a gray option as well, if you’d prefer something subtle.) It’s also the first Chromebook ever to feature one of Samsung’s QLED panels. QLED isn’t OLED — it’s just a fancier LED — but it still makes for one of the most gorgeous displays I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91mDFz"&gt;Nice screens sometimes wreck battery life, but that’s not the case here. I averaged about seven hours and 21 minutes of continuous work on the Chromebook 2, which means you shouldn’t need to plug it in &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;too often. And while the Core i3 processor isn’t the most powerful chip you can get in a Chromebook, it’s just fine for everyday work use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s4tmgA"&gt;Best Google Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WMItcT"&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop that weighs just 2.3 pounds. It has a sturdy magnesium chassis, and a ridged grip on the bottom to keep itself from slipping on slanted surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M72CDq"&gt;Not only is the Pixelbook Go portable and stylish, but it delivers solid performance, and supports fast charging through either of its USB-C ports. Battery life is also impressive. The Go lasted over eight hours in our testing, and it should get you through a full workday with no problem. But its standout feature is the keyboard, which is quiet with good travel and a springy feel. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Dieter Bohn found it to be his “favorite thing to type on by a long shot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCvQ3C"&gt;The Go is an expensive product, as Chromebooks go, and it doesn’t top our list because the Chromebook Flip C434 offers similar specs and features for a slightly lower price. But we think plenty of shoppers who value long battery life and lightweight build might prefer to spend a bit more on this device instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="U2ykf7"&gt;Best premium Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nT7MLq"&gt;Many modern Chromebooks are oriented towards kids and students, but not this one. The C13 Yoga Chromebook is a sturdy, pricey, convertible Chromebook for grown-ups. It’s part of Lenovo’s renowned ThinkPad business line, and has all kinds of ThinkPad perks including a red Trackpoint, discrete touchpad clickers, a fingerprint sensor, a webcam shutter, and an aluminum design. Put this Chromebook next to any number of Windows ThinkPads, and we might not be able to pick it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLVSSi"&gt;The C13 is also unique in that it’s the first Chromebook to include AMD’s Ryzen 3000 Mobile C-series processors, which are marketed specifically for Chromebooks. The chips run all kinds of programs — even mobile games — quite smoothly. We do wish the battery life was a bit better — we only averaged just over six hours on one charge. We averaged seven and a half hours from our top pick, the Chromebook Spin 713, and plenty of the devices here break eight hours with no problem&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google denies Facebook collusion claims in new court filing and blog post</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SXBdURUe4gguSbPjzy7fXSY6JEo=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70416801/acastro_181130_1777_google_bias_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google denies colluding with Facebook in new court filing | Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wg7Xr3"&gt;Google has filed a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23184858/Google_MTD_1_21_2022.pdf"&gt;motion to dismiss&lt;/a&gt; the antitrust complaint filed last week, which alleges it colluded with Facebook to manipulate programmatic ad markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdG0Hp"&gt;“State Plaintiffs’ complaint — cheered on by a handful of Google’s rivals who have failed to invest properly, compete successfully, or innovate consistently — might serve the narrow interests of those rivals,” Google argues in the motion, “but it also threatens to stifle the dynamism that drives Google and other firms to deliver the products on which businesses and consumers depend every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IDI9EX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The complaint misrepresents our business, products, and motives”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe6alL"&gt;Originally filed in November, the antitrust suit has been led by Texas attorney general Ken Paxton of Texas and has gradually revealed more allegations through a series of revised complaints. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22883987/mark-zuckerberg-sundar-pichai-ad-collusion-tx-ag-paxton-complaint"&gt;complaint filed last week&lt;/a&gt; provided particularly specific details about Google’s alleged collusion with Facebook, including a project nicknamed “Jedi Blue” that the suit says intended to limit ad header bidding practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpRyTo"&gt;The new complaint relies on internal emails that show the Jedi Blue deal was reviewed with input from Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta / Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Sheryl Sandberg. But Google has denied that the deal involved any anticompetitive behavior and says it was approved without Pichai’s direct approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idnHGI"&gt;Adam Cohen, director of economic policy at Google, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/ag-paxtons-false-claims-still-dont-add-up/"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; accompanying the new response that the allegations are “more heat than light” and that Google doesn’t think they meet the legal standard to bring the case to trial. “The complaint misrepresents our business, products and motives, and we are moving to dismiss it based on its failure to offer plausible antitrust claims,” he wrote in the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z2q0uI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“courts are rightly skeptical of challenges to how a company designs its own products”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OEI2Fz"&gt;At the heart of the lawsuit is the allegation that publishers are forced to use Google’s ad server to access its ad exchange. But Google says this claim is incorrect, “and AG Paxton offers no evidence to prove otherwise.” The company also disputes allegations that it has held back rivals from using its Open Bidding program and that it rigged ad auctions to favor Facebook. In addition, Cohen says, the lawsuit is based on outdated information “that bears no correlation to our current products or business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKm3cp"&gt;The new complaint quoted a 2015 email in which “Google employees expressed fear that Google’s exchange might ‘actually have to compete’ with other exchanges at some point in the future.” A newly unredacted section of the complaint also alleges that Google made concessions to Facebook as part of Jedi Blue, which gave Facebook an advantage in auctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVaMdD"&gt;In its motion to dismiss, Google argues that the lawsuit does not illustrate any anticompetitive conduct. “Despite amassing a lengthy collection of grievances, each one comes down to a plea for Google to share its data or to design its products in ways that would help its rivals,” the motion states. “The Sherman Act requires no such thing. None of the conduct alleged in the [complaint] falls into the narrow exception to the general rule that any firm may choose with whom it will deal, and courts are rightly skeptical of challenges to how a company designs its own products, especially when innovation creates more choices for consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ts2WR4"&gt;Google also disputes Paxton’s claim that the company secretly colluded with the Facebook Audience Network via its Open Bidding agreement, with Cohen noting that the agreement is not exclusive and that it “&lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/admob/latest-admob-updates-making-more-money-mobile-app-ads/?fbclid=IwAR3dY0kup3tTR1O_1dAHDaKecUUS-aduWQb_W_MNF-7VZVV3n0E55Ryaovc"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; FAN’s participation as one of over 25 partners in our Open Bidding program, all of whom have signed their own agreements to participate.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hNIA2"&gt;Cohen added that Facebook participating in the agreement benefits advertisers and publishers. “In fact, if FAN &lt;em&gt;weren’t&lt;/em&gt; a part of Open Bidding, AG Paxton may have claimed we were preventing a rival from accessing our products and depriving publishers of additional revenue,” he wrote in the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3QZbX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Employees at Activision studio Raven Software formally organize union</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Call of Duty Warzone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Laq8ITfLgdxzQjW_A5GTM6F05iQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70416791/04C_IN_GAME_MODES_BR_TOUT.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Activision&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TVCmCm"&gt;After five weeks of striking, the QA testers at Raven Software, a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard, have formed one of the first unions in a AAA game publisher. The union, known as the &lt;a href="https://gameworkersalliance.com/"&gt;Game Workers Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, was formed in association with the&lt;a href="https://cwa-union.org/"&gt; Communications Workers of America (CWA)&lt;/a&gt;, a labor union that represents telecommunications and digital media workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7PJhN"&gt;Back in December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816827/raven-software-qa-contractor-layoff-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty"&gt;12 QA workers were laid off&lt;/a&gt;, sparking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820549/activision-blizzard-raven-software-layoffs-walkout-call-of-duty"&gt;a walkout&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; support studio. Since then, some members of the QA department engaged in a sustained strike at Raven Software, prompting the creation of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826129/activision-blizzard-employees-create-strike-fund-while-taking-steps-toward-unionization"&gt;GoFundMe to support the striking members&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szatzy"&gt;“We formed the Game Workers Alliance (CWA) because my colleagues and I want to have our voices heard,” said Brent Reel, a QA lead at Raven, in a CWA press release. The union is asking for formal recognition from parent company Activision Blizzard, who, in recent SEC filings related to the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch"&gt;pending acquisition by Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2022-01-19-activision-blizzard-tells-sec-its-unaware-of-employee-strike"&gt;failed to acknowledge&lt;/a&gt; that a strike was taking place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUij2o"&gt;Activision Blizzard has also been engaged in alleged union-busting activities, with executives imploring workers to “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828146/activision-blizzard-exec-brain-bulatao-anti-unionization-letter"&gt;consider the consequences&lt;/a&gt;” of signing union authorization cards. Elsewhere in Activision Blizzard, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; developer Treyarch recently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1467936015071559683"&gt;converted all contract employees to full-time positions&lt;/a&gt;, prompting questions as to why Raven Software could not do similarly. The formation of the union comes a week before the formal termination of the laid-off workers was to take place on January 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nly4oe"&gt;Rich George, senior director of game communications at Activision Blizzard, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ld1cT4"&gt;“Activision Blizzard is carefully reviewing the request for voluntary recognition from the CWA, which seeks to organize around three dozen of the company’s nearly 10,000 employees. While we believe that a direct relationship between the company and its team members delivers the strongest workforce opportunities, we deeply respect the rights of all employees under the law to make their own decisions about whether or not to join a union.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpE185"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK"&gt;A Better ABK&lt;/a&gt;, an Activision Blizzard employee advocacy group, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1484563155464462342"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “We are so incredibly excited for our allies at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WeAreGWA"&gt;@WeAreGWA&lt;/a&gt;. It has taken months of meticulous planning and careful work to get where we are today, but we couldn’t have done it without each other. Thank you to everyone who has publicly supported us and stay tuned. We’re not done yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTt0eY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4EjyC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkKxsA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGdPx6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PdzOjp"&gt;With the rise of the Omicron variant, we’ve been urged to use COVID-19 rapid antigen tests to make sure that we don’t spread the virus to friends and family. However, it’s been very difficult to follow that suggestion, what with long lines at COVID testing stations and high prices for home kits — when you can find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euZO1K"&gt;To try to alleviate this situation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889571/free-covid-19-tests-usps-website"&gt;the US federal government has created a website&lt;/a&gt; where you can order four free rapid test kits per month per household. While the site was scheduled to officially open Wednesday, January 19th, it started taking names and addresses a day early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRPiGo"&gt;It’s extremely simple to put in your order. You will not need to submit a credit card or any other financial information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HeKtVl"&gt;Go to &lt;a href="http://covidtests.gov/"&gt;COVIDTests.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KSN8FP"&gt;Tap on the button reading “Order Free At-Home Tests.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1XuoG7"&gt;If you don’t see the button for any reason, you can go directly to the USPS site (which is where the button would send you anyway) at &lt;a href="https://special.usps.com/testkits"&gt;special.usps.com/testkits&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DLzP1J"&gt;Fill in your name, email address (if you want to receive notifications), and shipping address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="egN7Sd"&gt;Click on the green “Check Out Now” button — and you’re done!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The USPS form for ordering free rapid tests is very simple." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vWK2i6OSwH_RhFwxKvSiPp2A0Gs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23177189/Screen_Shot_2022_01_18_at_1.34.45_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USPS form for ordering free rapid tests is very simple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MNKDCC"&gt;So far, we haven’t had any reports of problems with the site itself, although (as can be imagined), it’s highly popular. (According to the site &lt;a href="http://analytics.usa.gov"&gt;analytics.usa.gov&lt;/a&gt;, as of 2PM on Tuesday, January 18th, over 700,000 people had already visited the website.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a05RJ0"&gt;There is now also a phone number if you have difficulty accessing the internet or have any problems placing an order: 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 1-888-720-7489).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQEAia"&gt;The kits are supposed to ship within 7–12 days, starting in late January. Until then, as far as rapid tests are concerned, we’re still on our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQTbBP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: &lt;/strong&gt;Some apartment dwellers are reporting problems with putting in an order if somebody else in their building already did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BLXfsZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Houston, we have a problem!  People at same street address but different apartment numbers are being refused free COVID test kits at &lt;a href="https://t.co/Rm7vj6zgKS"&gt;https://t.co/Rm7vj6zgKS&lt;/a&gt; if another apartment dweller ordered first.  This happened to me and I’m not the only one. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/USPS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#USPS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CovidTesting?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CovidTesting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZllXT7m6jq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZllXT7m6jq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nicky Sundt (@NickySundt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NickySundt/status/1483521702315405315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KBv29U"&gt;There have been a number of solutions suggested if this happens to you, including putting your apartment number on the same line as your street address, putting your apartment number on the second address line, or using a word (such as “suite” or “apartment”) rather than a hash sign. None of these have been verified; we’ll let you know if we hear anything further. Meanwhile, if you’re having problems, you can try the 800 number mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
