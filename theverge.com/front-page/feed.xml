    <title>Tencent is buying British game studio Sumo for $1.27 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ccCh6s"&gt;Tencent has announced plans to buy British video game company Sumo Group for $1.27 billion. The Chinese tech giant already has an 8.75-percent stake in the developer, as &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-07-19-tencent-to-buy-crackdown-and-sackboy-developer-sumo-in-usd1-3bn-deal"&gt;Gamesindustry.biz reports&lt;/a&gt;, and the offer represents a 43-percent premium on Sumo’s current valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkUogs"&gt;Based in Sheffield, England, Sumo’s well-regarded core studio Sumo Digital has carried out contract work for many of the biggest names in gaming. It developed Sony’s PlayStation 5 launch title &lt;em&gt;Sackboy: A Big Adventure&lt;/em&gt; and was the primary studio behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224550/crackdown-3-review-xbox-one-pc"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;em&gt;Crackdown 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for Xbox consoles and PC. In 2017 Sumo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/13/15283820/snake-pass-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;released &lt;em&gt;Snake Pass&lt;/em&gt; for multiple platforms&lt;/a&gt;, its first foray into original IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AuiyWc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Crackdown 3 review: the Netflix Original of games","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224550/crackdown-3-review-xbox-one-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sqbVAV"&gt;“The three founders of Sumo, who work in the business, Paul Porter, Darren Mills and I are passionate about what we do and are fully committed to continuing in our roles,” says Sumo CEO Carl Cavers in a statement. “The opportunity to work with Tencent is one we just couldn’t miss. It would bring another dimension to Sumo, presenting opportunities for us to truly stamp our mark on this amazing industry, in ways which have previously been out-of-reach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esP0b3"&gt;Cavers says Tencent has “demonstrated its commitment to backing” Sumo’s client work, as well as its own original IP, so things are unlikely to change too quickly. The buyout does, however, give Tencent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358252/tencent-wechat-ban-trump-executive-order-consequences"&gt;yet another foothold&lt;/a&gt; in the international gaming industry, following prominent investments in companies like Epic, Riot, Activision, and Ubisoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4uTWBD"&gt;“Tencent intends to bring its expertise and resources to accelerate the growth of Sumo both in the UK and abroad, supporting Sumo in the market for top-notch creative talent, and the UK as a hub for game innovation,” says Tencent’s chief strategy officer James Mitchell. “We believe the proposed transaction benefits all stakeholders, delivers compelling value for Sumo shareholders, while enhancing the Sumo business for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GY4Mbr"&gt;This would be the second billion-dollar deal involving a British game developer this year — EA completed its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173732/ea-codemasters-buyout-agreed-price-need-for-speed-dirt"&gt;acquisition of racing game specialists Codemasters&lt;/a&gt; for a similar price in February.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo denies report that OLED Switch will have higher profit margin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5njCRdzwYqRyblwZn_taRJpaOUE=/0x0:2160x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69599370/switch_oled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t67PNS"&gt;Nintendo has issued an unusual statement denying a report that said the upcoming OLED version of the Switch would have higher profit margins than the regular model. The report in question was published &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/nintendo-switch-s-big-price-hike-takes-gamers-into-new-territory"&gt;by Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; last week and speculated that the higher-end components in the OLED Switch could total around an extra $10 per unit, based on analyst estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQ9Ocl"&gt;“A news report on July 15, 2021(JST) claimed that the profit margin of the Nintendo Switch (OLED Model) would increase compared to the Nintendo Switch,” Nintendo’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1416986986464776196"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; reads. “To ensure correct understanding among our investors and customers, we want to make clear that the claim is incorrect.” Nintendo didn’t provide any information about the profit margins of either Switch console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vgkPkr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo’s OLED Switch: all of the news about the console upgrade","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565307/nintendo-oled-switch-screen-news-updates"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TD3N2r"&gt;The OLED Switch costs $349.99, $50 more than the standard model. Aside from the 7-inch 720p OLED screen, it also doubles the internal storage to 64GB, adds an ethernet port to the dock, and includes a more flexible kickstand. If the estimates cited by Bloomberg were accurate, it’d mean that Nintendo could be making up to $40 more on each model sold, but the company now says this isn’t the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7lyLN"&gt;Nintendo also said in its statement that it has “no plans for launching any other model at this time.” Bloomberg had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346041/oled-nintendo-switch-dlss-nvidia-chip-report"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that a new version of the Switch would come not only with an OLED screen, but more powerful internals and the ability to output 4K resolution by making use of Nvidia’s DLSS technology.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Sweet Girl, Reservation Dogs, Flee, What We Do in the Shadows, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8hPXq1tTLlxktjatTyXBgTzNGgM=/128x0:1126x665/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69598601/jason_momoa1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jason Momoa stars in Sweet Girl | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiFuJV2GLkY&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sUneiG"&gt;Season one of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; is a wrap and while I know not everyone loved the finale, the show is my favorite of the Marvel/Disney streaming series so far. That’s due mostly to Tom Hiddleston’s fascinating performance as the title character, once a villain who’s evolved into... someone else, not quite sure who yet. Plenty of storylines to pick up in &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; season two (yay). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jjw27a"&gt;And a reminder it’s &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; week; season two arrives on Apple TV Plus July 23rd. In the media buzz leading up to the new season, there has been some evidence that Ted and creator Jason Sudeikis are kinda the same person: At the show’s world premiere, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brfootball/status/1415887128588869633"&gt;Sudeikis wore a shirt&lt;/a&gt; with the names of three England footballers who were subjected to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22574082/black-players-england-italy-football-soccer-racist-instagram-twitter-telegram"&gt;racist vitriol on social media&lt;/a&gt;, to show his support. And &lt;em&gt;Uproxx &lt;/em&gt;entertainment writer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mikeryan/status/1415730436798619655"&gt;Mike Ryan shared a story about Sudeikis&lt;/a&gt; from a few years ago that gives further credence to the Ted/Sudeikis theory.  Love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Jfw9l"&gt;This week’s trailers include a couple of comedies, and a Jason Momoa Netflix movie filmed in Pittsburgh whose title confuses me somewhat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IjRS8m"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NiFuJV2GLkY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EOFtlI"&gt;Sweet Girl &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="vdrUG3"&gt;Jason Momoa stars as Ray Cooper, whose cancer-stricken wife dies after she’s unable to get a drug she needs. Why? Because the pharmaceutical company took it off the market to drive up its price. Ray’s out for revenge/justice, and his daughter Rachel (played by Isabel Merced, presumably the sweet girl of the title), is along for the quest. &lt;em&gt;Sweet Girl’&lt;/em&gt;s trailer makes excellent use of Pittsburgh’s Golden Triangle area, many bridges, and even our light rail line as dramatic backdrops for punching, stabbing, and throwing bad guys through windows. &lt;em&gt;Sweet Girl&lt;/em&gt; comes to Netflix August 20th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WumlU9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RoHewFAkrWU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VPv9RS"&gt;Reservation Dogs &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="m8VlRN"&gt;This new half-hour comedy series from Taika Waititi and Sterlin Harjo is about a gang of Indigenous teenagers in Oklahoma whose criminal activities (they steal a chip delivery truck in the trailer), are part of their larger plan to raise money to get to California. &lt;em&gt;Reservation Dogs &lt;/em&gt;has strong Indigenous representation at every level of production and if the trailer is any indication, it’s a wickedly funny show that pokes holes in stereotypes of Indigenous people. D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Devery Jacobs, Paulina Alexis, and Lane Factor star in &lt;em&gt;Reservation Dogs&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to FX on Hulu August 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FVMO1t"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LjKiM-Hz4Qs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TU0z9I"&gt;What We Do in the Shadows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="On6664"&gt;Season three of this ridiculously funny show about goofy vampires is finally almost here, and we have this teaser that shows Nandor walking around ... in the sunlight!? He’s not going to burst into flames, don’t worry; he’s just wearing a VR headset. This is a good binge show and everyone has been telling you how funny it is, so try to find time to catch up before season three hits FX on September 2nd (and Hulu a day later). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4WGMs0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ttU1iKSpdA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QlUePc"&gt;TItans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zKrrpn"&gt;We got a short teaser for season three of &lt;em&gt;Titans&lt;/em&gt; last month, but we get a lot more in this first official trailer, including a look at Red Hood, Vincent Kartheiser’s Scarecrow, and Gotham, the setting for this season. &lt;em&gt;Titans&lt;/em&gt; comes to HBO Max for its third season August 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pVtKvv"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2aRfHsMgfdg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="M9tW50"&gt;Flee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1QsqKY"&gt;This animated documentary film doesn’t have a release date, but won the Sundance Jury Prize and is already generating Oscar buzz, says Zack Sharf &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2021/07/flee-trailer-animated-doc-best-films-2021-1234651173/"&gt;at &lt;em&gt;Indiewire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;It tells the story of a man, Amin Nawabi, who was a child refugee from Afghanistan, and fled to Moscow with his family. The trailer is just fascinating, using pieces of an audio interview with Nawabi as the voiceover. Riz Ahmed and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau are executive producers on&lt;em&gt; Flee&lt;/em&gt;, directed by Jonas Poher Rasmussen. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Steam Deck reservations now showing ‘expected order availability’ in Q2 and Q3 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_u78r5KshOHYYbkxAsIQ7sTXiCI=/0x116:3684x2572/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69598360/Steam_Deck_case.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Steam Deck will start shipping in December 2021 | Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSCCqs"&gt;If you’re looking to reserve a Steam Deck and haven’t managed to secure a reservation yet, it looks like you’ll be waiting a while to actually get your device. According to Steam’s store site on Sunday, the $399 64GB Steam Deck and the $529 256GB version both have “expected order availability” dates of of Q2 2022, meaning sometime next spring. The 512GB $649 model is even later; it’s showing expected availability in Q3 of next year, which is sometime between July and September 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="igPMbC"&gt;According to Steam’s website, it plans to &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck"&gt;send order invitations&lt;/a&gt; by December of this year. Steam will then convert reservations to orders. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BtVdRbSINDGXBsplHcufyMnF4y4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22724907/choose_your_steam_deck.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;As of July 18th, the wait time for the top-of-the-line Steam Deck is Q3 of 2022. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8mYqZN"&gt;Steam’s official Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Steam/status/1416811315985666051?s=20"&gt;posted Sunday&lt;/a&gt; that reservations for Steam Deck were open to new Steam accounts as well as existing accounts. Valve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;only revealed&lt;/a&gt; its handheld PC gaming device on Thursday, but when it opened up to reservations on Friday afternoon, many people got repeated error messages. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/html-holes-provide-a-glimpse-of-steam-decks-initial-preorder-numbers/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Valve got more than 110,000 reservations for the 256GB and 512GB devices in the first 90 minutes after orders opened. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Latest leaks indicate new iPhones may have always-on displays like Apple’s Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mf_L1zV7IAzv_m4dcuHJ_uI_jM0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69598039/jbareham_170916_2000_0057.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R1XMX5"&gt;A new report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman says the 2021 iPhone may have an always-on display &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20869098/apple-watch-series-5-always-on-screen-features-price-best-smartwatch"&gt;similar to Apple’s Watch&lt;/a&gt;, and which Android phones have had for some time. Gurman wrote in his &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on"&gt;Power On newsletter&lt;/a&gt; that the phones will have improved battery life, a smaller notch on the screen, better video recording, a 120Hz refresh rate, and a faster A15 chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7WmVs"&gt;It isn’t the first time a leak has suggested Apple is working on always-on screens for upcoming iPhones. Leaker Max Weinbach hinted &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqOujNnuHBg&amp;amp;ab_channel=EverythingAppleProEAP"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that Apple may use the same kind of low temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) panels that its Watches have on future iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYvGYi"&gt;That’s in keeping with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s previous reporting that “at least one” of the four new iPhones will include an LTPO display. The technology dynamically adjusts Watches’ screen refresh rates to conserve battery life. Analyst &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;Ming-Chi Kuo&lt;/a&gt; also said earlier this year that the Pro iPhones coming this year would have LTPO displays and 120Hz refresh rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EIFGFl"&gt;In addition to the possibility of always-on iPhone screens, Gurman reported that Apple will likely announce new MacBook Pros this fall, “between September and November at the latest.” The computers will begin production in the third quarter, he adds. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W5P0OF"&gt;A sweeping investigation by 17 media outlets found that NSO Group’s Pegasus software was used in hacking attempts on 37 smartphones belonging to human rights activists and journalists, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/?itid=hp_alert"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/a&gt; The phones were on a leaked list of numbers discovered by Paris journalism nonprofit Hidden Stories and human rights group Amnesty International, according to the Post. The numbers on the list were singled out for possible surveillance by countries who are clients of NSO, the report states, which markets its spyware to governments to track potential terrorists and criminals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVnXwL"&gt;Pegasus can extract all of a mobile device’s data, and activate the device’s microphone to listen in on conversations surreptitiously, as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/18/ft-editor-roula-khalaf-among-180-journalists-targeted-nso-spywarer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;notes. The list of journalists dates back to 2016, the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; reports, and includes reporters from the &lt;em&gt;Post, CNN&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Voice of America,&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Le Monde&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUl5zO"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday, an NSO spokesperson denied the claims in the report, saying it was “full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories that raise serious doubts about the reliability and interests of the sources,” and questioned the sources that supplied the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cfhet"&gt;“After checking their claims, we firmly deny the false allegations made in their report,” the statement continues. The company is considering a defamation lawsuit according to its statement, because it says “these allegations are so outrageous and far from reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBdhTP"&gt;It’s not the first time NSO’s Pegasus spyware has been accused of being part of a larger surveillance campaign. Between July and August 2020, research organization &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22192922/al-jazeera-journalists-hack-nso-group-hack-ios-imessage-zero-click-day"&gt;Citizen Lab found that 36 phones belonging to Al Jazeera journalists&lt;/a&gt; had been hacked using Pegasus technology, possibly by hackers working for governments in the Middle East. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20938676/whatsapp-nso-group-spyware-hack-encrypted-chat-lawsuit"&gt;WhatsApp sued NSO&lt;/a&gt;, claiming Pegasus was used to hack users of WhatsApp’s encrypted chat service. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook pushes back against Biden remarks on COVID-19 misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hnOzlsd01mnbvPa0prbsSyyJNj0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69596112/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fI3bse"&gt;Facebook continued its pushback Saturday against President Biden’s comment that social media &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580620/biden-facebook-vaccine-misinformation-platforms"&gt;platforms were “killing people”&lt;/a&gt; with COVID-19 misinformation, in a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/support-for-covid-19-vaccines-is-high-on-facebook-and-growing/"&gt;blog post from its vice president of integrity Guy Rosen&lt;/a&gt;. The post states that the “facts tell a very different story to the one promoted by the administration in recent days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWrarp"&gt;“At a time when COVID-19 cases are rising in America, the Biden administration has chosen to blame a handful of American social media companies,” Rosen wrote. “While social media plays an important role in society, it is clear that we need a whole of society approach to end this pandemic. And facts — not allegations — should help inform that effort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyDP8V"&gt;(The post was titled “Moving Past the Finger Pointing: Support for COVID-19 vaccines is high on Facebook and growing.”) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZPEeB"&gt;On Friday, &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; reporter Peter Alexander asked Biden what his message was “to platforms like Facebook.” The president replied: “they’re killing people ...  the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated, and they’re killing people.” See the exchange below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bDOvKq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;NBC's &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeterAlexander?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@PeterAlexander&lt;/a&gt;: "What's your message to platforms like Facebook [regarding COVID misinformation]?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Biden: "They're killing people." &lt;a href="https://t.co/TIaoeESMdk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TIaoeESMdk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— The Recount (@therecount) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1416118730904510467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rZOqO7"&gt;According to Rosen’s post, Facebook has worked with Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the University of Maryland on a &lt;a href="https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/surveys/"&gt;global survey &lt;/a&gt;on COVID-19 symptoms, testing, and vaccination rates. The results, Rosen writes, show 85 percent of Facebook users in the US have or want to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. “President Biden’s goal was for 70% of Americans to be vaccinated by July 4. Facebook is not the reason this goal was missed,” Rosen added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKLSi9"&gt;Biden’s comment came amid growing pressure from the White House toward Facebook and other social platforms to better stem the flow of coronavirus vaccine misinformation on their sites. A Thursday report &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578431/white-house-surgeon-general-facebook-youtube-twitter-covid-19-misinformation-vaccines"&gt;from Surgeon General Vivek Murthy&lt;/a&gt; on “confronting health information,” included recommendations for different stakeholders, including tech platforms, individuals, educators, health professionals, funders, researchers, journalists, and governments. The recommendations for the platforms included suggestions to “strengthen the monitoring of misinformation,” and “amplify communications from trusted messengers and subject matter experts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNR5Af"&gt;In Saturday’s post, Rosen argued that Facebook had already taken action on &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-misinformation-advisory.pdf"&gt;Murthy’s recommendations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42FxY6"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson said Friday that the “accusations” weren’t supported by the facts. Several Republicans also expressed concern about the White House’s efforts; Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) said the White House was “colluding with Facebook to censor Americans.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sf8S1q"&gt;In response to a request for comment, a White House spokesperson pointed to Murthy’s &lt;a href="https://video.foxnews.com/v/6264177467001#sp=show-clips"&gt;comments on &lt;em&gt;Fox News Sunday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;This isn’t about me or about a specific social media company, this is about the health of Americans. And the reality is that misinformation is still spreading like wildfire in our country, aided and abetted by technology platforms,” Murthy said, acknowledging that some technology companies have “taken positive steps,” but it’s not enough. “Despite some of the actions they have taken, we’re still seeing significant spreading of misinformation,” on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTtP0o"&gt;“I’m asking these companies to step up and take responsibility for what’s happening on their sites,” Murthy added. “I’m asking them to look out for the people all across this country whose lives depend on having access to accurate information. And that’s what I’m going to continue to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hO8mmW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 18th 11:59AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds Sunday comments from Vivek Murthy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robot collision at Ocado warehouse near London sparks fire, delaying customer orders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IrTYWaH8Mhc57aexSbPmQDT1hO0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69597620/jvincent_180501_2547_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Exm3I3"&gt;Online-only British supermarket Ocado has had to cancel some customers’ delivery orders after a Friday robot collision at one of its warehouses caused a fire, &lt;a href="https://www.ocadogroup.com/response-to-fire-at-erith"&gt;the company said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFYc48"&gt;The fire at the company’s Erith warehouse east of London “appears to have been caused by the collision of three bots on the grid,” the company said in a statement on Sunday. No one was injured, and the damage was limited to less than 1 percent of its grid, according to Ocado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H77UFb"&gt;The grocer’s warehouses are populated with washing machine-sized robots that move products around on a grid system. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s James Vincent wrote about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17331250/automated-warehouses-jobs-ocado-andover-amazon"&gt;Ocado’s plans in a 2018 feature&lt;/a&gt; story. He described the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="o6LiSQ"&gt;Deliveries are unpacked into crates; crates are placed onto conveyors; and conveyors carry the crates to shelves, where human “pickers” take what they need to fill customers’ orders. The new paradigm, though, is all about using space as efficiently as possible. Items are still placed in crates, but those crates are now stored in huge stacks, up to 17 boxes high. Their position in this stack seems to be at random — a box of razors next to cod fillets, for example — but it’s algorithmically decided; with frequently accessed items placed on the top and rarer purchases near the bottom. On top of this hoard, the robots do their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="ZCU2Vm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="This is an automated warehouse for groceries|38290" data-volume-uuid="cd275e54f" data-volume-id="38290" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-829" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;Robots at Ocado’s warehouses operate on grids. Three of the robots collided at its Erith warehouse on July 16th, causing a fire that has disrupted operations.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T7UDc0"&gt;The company said Sunday that the Erith plant, which processes some 150,000 orders a week &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/aaddf4b1-a78b-4289-b42f-fd3f5cd7f176"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, should restart operations in the next few days. “While we expect some disruption to operations, we are working to restore normal service as soon as possible,” the company said. “We expect the facility to begin operating within the coming week and thank customers whose orders are affected for their patience.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why the Steam Deck won’t flop like Valve’s Steam Machines</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rO0ya_tzfUSzL0F84ZKOm3nPb5E=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69597325/steam_deck_hades.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ELWr7O"&gt;You’re not having deja vu. Six years after launching a line of Linux game consoles that went down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019"&gt;as one of the biggest tech flops of the past decade&lt;/a&gt;, Valve is trying once again. Only this time, its Steam Machine dreams and unusual touchpads have been rolled into a 7-inch handheld PC that looks and works like a Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4RczI"&gt;It’s called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;the Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;, and you can read all about its specs, extensive controls and TV docking station &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vO2c2z"&gt;I’m not deluding myself into thinking it’s a Switch-killer. (Even if the Steam Deck’s $399 starting price might seem close to Nintendo’s $350 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;Switch with OLED screen&lt;/a&gt;, you’re not getting Mario, Zelda and Metroid on a Steam Deck.) But having watched Valve closely over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/2/2840932/exclusive-valve-steam-box-gaming-console"&gt;past nine years&lt;/a&gt;, I don’t believe it will flop like the Steam Machines either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRaAxn"&gt;Here are six reasons why this isn’t Steam Machines all over again — and, a few brand-new reasons to be skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="G8dGvV"&gt;1: Valve is building the hardware itself&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="JnSyiy"&gt;There are plenty of reasons why Valve’s Steam Machines failed, but one towers over the rest: Valve was never in control of its own hardware destiny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LF44U"&gt;When we exclusively revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3852144/gabe-newell-interview-steam-box-future-of-gaming"&gt;Gabe Newell’s plans for the “Steam Box” in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, he originally explained that Valve would sell its own Linux-based living room PC, while simultaneously creating an ecosystem where partners would deliver a wide array of good/better/best boxes as well, creating an entire new category of gaming PC. &lt;br&gt;But Valve’s own box didn’t make it to market. It never broadly sold &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5063760/we-try-the-steam-machine-valves-video-game-console-of-the-future"&gt;the impressive prototype it demonstrated for us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in November 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gallery Photo: Steam Controller and Steam Machine press pictures" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nHVvCQWVZhrnvZ3dfy2FNxGPOuo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12803513/STEAM_M_console_controller_hero.1419980053.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You couldn’t really buy the original Steam Machine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ySqryz"&gt;Somewhere along the line, Valve decided to leave the vast majority of the hardware to existing PC manufacturers, whose Steam OS offerings were a mess, running the gamut from “it’s our Windows box, but with fewer games because it’s running Linux” to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/11/4089864/xi3-piston-steam-box-pre-orders-open"&gt;dubious designs Valve wound up disavowing&lt;/a&gt;. Alienware was one of the few &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5281824/steam-machines-are-here-how-alienware-is-realizing-valve-console-dream"&gt;to build a bespoke Steam Machine&lt;/a&gt;, but it wound up running Windows first instead — because Valve and its hodgepodge collection of partners didn’t manage to launch the Steam Machines initiative &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/10/9705234/valve-steam-machines-controller-link-launch"&gt;until November 2015&lt;/a&gt;. By then, that Alienware Alpha had been on sale for nearly a year already.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NzYBnk"&gt;But with the new Steam Deck, Valve is in control once again. We’re not getting a vague time frame for a grand plan to reshape the PC industry, but instead a specific piece of hardware with a specific release window in December 2021. And we have some faith in Valve’s hardware prowess, too, because the company has built up a reputation for excellence. While niche, the Steam Controller and Steam Link wireless box were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price"&gt;incredibly smart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/19/18103672/valve-discontinues-steam-link-streaming-set-top-box"&gt;well-designed products&lt;/a&gt; that deserved better than their eventual fire sales, and Valve set a extremely high bar for PC-tethered virtual reality headsets with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19102584/valve-index-steamvr-headset-review-shipping-today"&gt;the Valve Index&lt;/a&gt; and the co-developed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/5/11358618/htc-vive-vr-review"&gt;HTC Vive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="JF0DuU"&gt;2: Linux is no longer a death sentence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="BooAvm"&gt;In 2015, after years of reporting on their promises and possibilities, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/5/8733139/valve-steam-machine-half-baked"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;warned our readers not to preorder a Steam Machine&lt;/a&gt;. The reason had little to do with how long they’d been delayed, and everything to do with how Linux simply didn’t have enough games. We put together a chart of the top 50 games on Steam that made that clear — no &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V, Fallout or Skyrim, DayZ&lt;/em&gt; or any games that weren’t on Steam. Meanwhile, the PS4, Xbox One, and even Windows controller support were looking better and better all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zefr30"&gt;Today, it’s still the case that fewer than 15 percent of all Steam titles officially support SteamOS, but thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/16/3652756/valve-big-picture-mode-steam-os-linux-game-console"&gt;seeds that Valve planted&lt;/a&gt; with Linux nearly a decade ago, the company no longer has to convince developers to port their games from scratch. Many of the officially recognized 8,000 SteamOS titles work thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.protondb.com/"&gt;a Proton compatibility layer&lt;/a&gt; that lets Windows games run on Linux. Huge competitive shooters like &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends, Destiny 2, PUBG &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; might soon be possible since Valve is working to get &lt;a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/faq"&gt;their anti-cheat software working ahead of launch&lt;/a&gt;. If that happens, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/stats/"&gt;most of the top games on Steam&lt;/a&gt; should be playable on SteamOS, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c5CyR9C9Qm6UrHitttZ4oBzj9Ao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719886/Steam_Deck_touchscreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UDNlLu"&gt;Perhaps just as importantly, the Steam Deck isn’t chained to Linux. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578879/valve-steam-deck-handheld-pc-windows-support"&gt;Valve says you can install Windows if you like&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other publishers’ stores. And because it’s a PC, you could also fill in the gaming gaps with an array of streaming services like Microsoft xCloud, Google Stadia, Nvidia GeForce Now, Amazon Luna and others if you’re willing to pay, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/18/18274498/game-streaming-services-pc-mac-ps4-android-cloud-google-stadia"&gt;or stream games over your home network&lt;/a&gt; from your PlayStation, Xbox or another gaming PC. Good luck doing any of that on Nintendo’s portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="N27Hwm"&gt;3: Handheld gaming PCs are neat, and Deck might be the best yet&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="F8Okbv"&gt;With Steam Machines, it sometimes felt like Valve was trying to reinvent the wheel. That’s not the case here. Even though most everyone has a smartphone in their pocket these days, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578902/video-game-handhelds-steam-deck-switch-playdate-analogue-pocket"&gt;video game handhelds are resurgent&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to the Nintendo Switch and an array of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/6/21048262/alienware-concept-ufo-prototype-gaming-pc-nintendo-switch-ces-2020"&gt;inspiring concepts&lt;/a&gt; that followed in its wake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIZerW"&gt;The Steam Deck isn’t even the first gaming PC to get Switch-ified: we wrote about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/18/22237379/aya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison"&gt;how we’re getting closer to a Nintendo Switch-sized gaming PC&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, and for the past few months I’ve been playing with one of them, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22320306/aya-neo-handheld-gaming-pc-indiegogo-price-release-date-nintendo-switch"&gt;the crowdfunded Aya Neo&lt;/a&gt;. It’s similar to the Steam Deck in that it’s also AMD-powered with joysticks and buttons on both sides of a 7-inch, 1280 x 800 touchscreen. While it’s not powerful enough to competently run demanding games and the software’s a little janky, I played through the majority of &lt;em&gt;Persona 4 Golden&lt;/em&gt; and some &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt; on the go, and chatted with buddies on Discord while exploring the deadly plains of Valheim — where the handheld’s AMD Vega 6 graphics did tend to bog down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nAXJA9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JkCIILzfhmA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XCqZ7c"&gt;As YouTube gaming handheld expert Taki Udon &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkCIILzfhmA"&gt;will tell you&lt;/a&gt;, the build quality and ergonomics on these crowdfunded handhelds isn’t always that great, and that’s an opportunity for Valve to flex. Plus, existing handhelds typically cost $700 to $1000. Valve’s asking hundreds of dollars less for the Steam Deck, and with a newer GPU that might bring more games within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="UTCpoN"&gt;4: Valve is a game company again&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="lHasBY"&gt;In 2020, thirteen years after the most infamous cliffhanger in video game history, &lt;em&gt;Half-Life &lt;/em&gt;made its triumphant return with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20976066/half-life-alyx-trailer-release-date-news-steam-vr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a full-length VR-exclusive that quickly shot to the top of “best VR game” lists and reportedly gave the Valve Index headset a huge boost in sales. Ever since, Valve employees have repeatedly hinted that &lt;em&gt;Alyx &lt;/em&gt;made them excited about building single-player games again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8XjAnMagr6hnw5u6hVlLDIkqu3E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19395801/half_life_alyx_vr_007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="USmKQ4"&gt;Valve’s David Speyer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in 2019 that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20976012/half-life-alyx-valve-series-future"&gt;would “love to continue pushing forward”&lt;/a&gt; on new &lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt; games, and Gabe Newell &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/22/22244057/valve-gabe-newell-half-life-new-zealand-game-development"&gt;told New Zealand’s &lt;em&gt;1 News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in January that it has new single-player games in development. “It’s fun to ship games,” he said, adding that &lt;em&gt;Alyx&lt;/em&gt; “created a lot of momentum inside of the company to do more of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A08OJw"&gt;With the Steam Deck, Valve may now have an opportunity to use one of those games to jumpstart a platform yet again. If you’ll recall, that’s how the Steam platform made it off the ground in 2004 to begin with — it was the only place to play &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/em&gt; and Valve’s subsequent games. But with Steam Machines, the company opted not to do it, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5063760/we-try-the-steam-machine-valves-video-game-console-of-the-future"&gt;telling me in 2013&lt;/a&gt; that “It’s against our philosophy to put a game in jail and say it only works on Steam Machines.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mG5VOL"&gt;That left Valve at the mercy of other developers for games, during an era when it didn’t make many new games of its own. It did bring the then-two-year-old &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, &lt;/em&gt;three-year-old &lt;em&gt;Portal 2&lt;/em&gt; and four-year-old &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead 2&lt;/em&gt; to Linux in time for the platform’s debut, but there was no good gaming reason to pick a SteamOS box over Windows once the Steam Machines came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oIkwhS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Steam Deck is one and a HALF times wider than the Switch, has a battery LIFE of 2-8 hours, and sells for THREE hundred and ninety nine dollars.&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Bailey (@IBasteEvenly) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IBasteEvenly/status/1416098661738627077?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5zfbxT"&gt;But Valve’s philosophy may have evolved. With virtual reality, Valve realized it needed to kickstart the platform, building an incredible showcase &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/htc-vive-valve-the-lab-steamvr-desktop-theater-mode-gdc-2016/"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;The Lab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and then adding system seller &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx &lt;/em&gt;last year, a game it justified keeping VR-exclusive because it was designed explicitly for VR immersion and controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yiCNue"&gt;I wouldn’t exactly bet on it, but I wouldn’t bet against the idea that Valve could make a similar argument for games that use the Deck’s precision touchpad, touchscreen, touch-sensitive thumbsticks, gyro and rear buttons to emulate the sensation of hands moving around and grabbing things. Valve could build a &lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt; exclusive to portables like this, if not exclusive to the Steam Deck itself. Most PCs certainly don’t have quite this array of input, and it might be a shame if the Deck’s extensive controls were limited to the kind of homegrown controller schemes that Steam Controller fans pump out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="91oMBf"&gt;5: Gaming dollars are burning a hole in people’s pockets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="I8Q3Mp"&gt;Valve’s Steam Deck might be right on time. Due to the global pandemic, the world’s gamers are acutely aware of who they are. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536084/video-games-ps4-ps5-xbox-series-x-among-us-animal-crossing"&gt;There’s never been a better time to play video games&lt;/a&gt;, and demand has never been higher, with US consumers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233003/us-npd-group-video-game-spending-2020-record-nintendo-switch-call-of-duty-animal-crossing-ps5-ps4"&gt;spending more in 2020&lt;/a&gt; than ever before. And while the PS5, Xbox Series X and an array of new PC gaming graphics cards are here, the global chip shortage means you still can’t easily buy them even now, as some of the world is coming out of that pandemic and thinking about leaving the house. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OHCNCVFPUuaL8wIo6q1rIVjIWJU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21867820/twarren_200909_4184_0016.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PLx1oJ"&gt;If you’ve held onto dollars earmarked for those consoles and graphics cards (either because you can’t get one, or are still unconvinced), you might now consider spending that money on a handheld that can accompany you out of the house. There, Nintendo is ready to tempt you with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;the shiny new OLED-equipped Switch&lt;/a&gt; that went on pre-order this past week, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565469/nintendo-switch-pro-oled-timing-chip-shortages-cpu-nvidia-tegra"&gt;it didn’t announce a Switch Pro&lt;/a&gt;. That’s an opportunity for Valve to swoop in: forgetting the Nintendo games, the Steam Deck is about as pro a Switch as you’re liable to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="oI1UOY"&gt;6: Valve can afford a hobby or two&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="hAH8bg"&gt;But even if the Steam Deck doesn’t attract gamers away from next-gen consoles or graphics cards, that doesn’t mean it’ll flop. So far, every piece of hardware Valve’s built is a gadget its own engineers wanted to see in the world, not a piece of mass-market kit. But if the Steam Deck winds up being a niche product that barely sells, it might still be a success for the company and fans. Some have grown to appreciate what Valve was trying to do with the Steam Controller, for instance, which has a loyal community pumping out custom control schemes for new games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price"&gt;last I checked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qSFHk"&gt;The other important thing above Valve building its own hardware is that it can only hurt itself if it fails, and Valve can likely take the pain. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22413196/valve-steam-lawsuit-wolfire-games-humble-bundle-app-store-cut-epic-apple"&gt;According to a recent lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, Valve rakes in an estimated $6 billion in annual revenue from Steam commissions alone, incredible for a company its size, working out to something like $15 million per year per Valve employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vleWQ5"&gt;Besides, Valve seems to be taking a more cautious approach, with buyers putting down $5 deposits to reserve a device, limit 1 per customer, and Valve fulfilling those orders when they’re ready instead of letting a product “sell out.” (It’s incredible that Valve’s the first to try the common-sense approach to preorders &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;we’ve been begging the game industry to adopt for many months&lt;/a&gt; with consoles and GPUs.) It might also allow Valve to fulfill orders in small batches instead of investing in a mountain of devices it might have to put on fire sale down the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="VmiZy5"&gt;Why the Deck might still get dunked on&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="zDwwFj"&gt;I highly doubt the Steam Deck will be a public flop, but I can imagine a few reasons the PC gaming community won’t wind up embracing it anyhow. For instance, it’s largely &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578917/valve-steam-deck-nintendo-switch-xbox-series-x-ps5-spec-comparison"&gt;priced like a next-gen console with only a fraction of the performance&lt;/a&gt;, even if it winds up being more powerful than other handheld PCs on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVKDm1"&gt;The $399 base model only comes with 64GB of eMMC flash, too, in an era when a single game can sometimes require more space than that, and when PS5 and Xbox Series X games are beginning to take advantage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551165/sony-ps5-playstation-5-no-m2-ssd-expansion-launch"&gt;the faster load times that speedy NVMe solid state storage can afford&lt;/a&gt;. While you can add a microSD card to any model to expand your storage, the &lt;em&gt;speed&lt;/em&gt; of your storage might hold the system back some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9c4oyD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10656185"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9YbQWV"&gt;Lastly, I’ve got to agree with some of my colleagues with more taste: this is not a &lt;em&gt;particularly &lt;/em&gt;good looking machine. It reminds me of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/7/3963056/wikipad-survives-reincarnated-as-7-inch-gaming-tablet-for-249-99"&gt;the bulbous Wikipad&lt;/a&gt; far more than it does a Nintendo Switch, with those thumbsticks mounted high like antennae sticking out of its head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caxcrD"&gt;But I tried the Wikipad, and there’s a reason it was shaped like that: it was designed to be comfortable to hold, not necessarily pleasing for the eyes. I wonder if that’s the idea behind the Deck, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aM9YIo"&gt;In case you’re wondering, I ordered one. We’ll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Focus modes for notifications on iOS 15</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LpwHJOG0qh5NeRuIONYyBV-oDcs=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69597234/focus2.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lilxvH"&gt;One of the most powerful new features in iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey, is Focus mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYYfJM"&gt;At its core, a Focus mode is a more customizable version of Apple’s existing Do Not Disturb and is accessed from the same menu on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. But Focus modes are far more customizable, allowing for more granular triggers for when you’re filtering out notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Pn8SJy"&gt;To set up a Focus, head over to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Focus” and hit the plus button to add a new Focus. You’ll also be able to see existing Focus modes that you’ve set up and edit them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="byicVU"&gt;Apple offers a variety of preset Focus modes to start with, including Personal, Work, Fitness, Gaming, Reading, and more.  You’re not limited to Apple’s preset suggestions, though some of the presets — like the Driving, Fitness, or Gaming ones — offer additional features and triggers that aren’t available to user-created ones. Apple’s Fitness Focus mode, for example, can be automatically triggered when you start a Fitness Plus workout on your Apple Watch, while the Gaming mode can turn on whenever you connect a Bluetooth controller. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XSdC6b"&gt;You can create a custom Focus by selecting Custom, which will let you select a name, icon, and color for that specific focus. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L0rJ922zkJK1HYgkTYRVlTUEmOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722624/IMG_2971.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setting allowed contacts on a Focus mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BWlkT3UZMVR9mthWICQ3aFHl_fU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722625/IMG_2972.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Selecting which apps can send notifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RbG2hC"&gt;Next, you’ll be asked to choose which of your contacts (if any) you’d like to be able to message you when that Focus mode is activated — similar to how Do Not Disturb works. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ObuqH7"&gt;The following screen will ask you to select which apps (if any) you want to allow to send notifications when that Focus is active. For example, if you’re making a “Work” Focus, you might only want your email and Slack apps to be able to send you pings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zRv3Ws"&gt;Lastly, Apple will ask if you’d like to be able to receive special “Time Sensitive Notifications” — a new category of extra-important notifications that apps will be able to send that might not be able to wait until later. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/68bOT1HEw2UNEI4aqXAgv3iyaiI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722626/IMG_2973.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The toggle to permit time-sensitive notifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hclipC1UmvcD8JJV2ma-rf14H2I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722627/IMG_2967.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The main Focus setting menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V6MgwY"&gt;Once you’ve finished setting up your Focus, you’ll end up on the Focus mode’s setting menu, where there are a few additional things you’ll be able to configure. You can also get back here at any time by heading to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Focus,” then selecting the Focus mode you want to edit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="51dh4u"&gt;The Focus Status menu will let you decide whether contacts will see a notice if you’re in an active Focus mode and their messages are muted. (Although right now, the only app that supports the feature is Apple’s Messages.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nui0Ov"&gt;The Home Screen menu allows you to hide specific home screens on your iPad or iPhone when you’re in a Focus mode. Combined with iOS 15’s App Library and the new ability to create multiple copies of an app icon, you can use this feature to customize what your phone looks like in different situations. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="R131dW"&gt;The Lock Screen menu offers the option to show or hide silenced notifications on the lock screen or to dim the lock screen when the Focus mode is active.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RtJkCFe6sjUa3VlDU2CZcQ0E1Bg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722631/Apple_iPadPro_iPadOS15_springboard_focus_060721.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Focus modes on iPadOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="83ZphP"&gt;Finally, there’s the actual activation of a Focus mode. Apple offers two ways to turn on a Focus mode: you can either manually select it from the moon icon in Control Center or schedule it automatically (settings for which can be found in the Focus menu).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="akxno0"&gt;The simplest option is “Smart Activation,” which has your device automatically toggle a Focus on its own. But you can also add more granular manual controls, activating a Focus for specific times, when you’re at a specific location, or when you’re using specific apps. &lt;/p&gt;
