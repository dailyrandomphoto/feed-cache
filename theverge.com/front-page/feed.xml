    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3r0BJf"&gt;When a pop-cultural icon like Ozzy Osbourne announces an NFT collection, you can count on the project getting publicity. The launch of the “CryptoBatz” collection, a series of 9,666 digital bats, received coverage in outlets like &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/ozzy-osbourne-nfts-cryptobatz-collection-1235014292/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/exclusive-ozzy-osbourne-announces-nfts-cryptobatz-collection-1276535/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-nft-cryptobatz-collection-preview-video-watch-3135108"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NME&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://hypebeast.com/2021/12/ozzy-ozbourne-cryptobatz-nft-project-info"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypebeast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/ozzy-osbourne-nft-collection-cryptobatz-market-concert-1982-tokens-crypto-2021-12"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6l8Q7"&gt;But just two days after the tokens were minted, supporters are being targeted by a phishing scam that drains cryptocurrency from their wallets, playing off a bad link shared by the project’s official Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORQRMp"&gt;Like the majority of NFT projects, CryptoBatz uses Discord as a place to organize its community. The official CryptoBatz Discord is now accessed through the short link &lt;a href="https://t.co/c8bUinn1LN"&gt;discord.gg/cryptobatz&lt;/a&gt;. But previously, the project used a slightly different vanity URL at discord.gg/cryptobatznft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYLOl9"&gt;When the project switched to the new URL, scammers set up a fake Discord server at the old one. But neither CryptoBatz nor Ozzy Osbourne took the precaution of deleting tweets referencing the previous URL, meaning that old tweets from Osbourne himself were left directing followers to a server now controlled by scammers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ozzy Osbourne tweet containing link to a scam Discord" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9DS7fG2QgZjZ94QWRwxRv2EbybY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23185024/Osbourne_tweet.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HgCmeA"&gt;One tweet from CryptoBatz, posted on December 31st, 2021, received more than 4,000 retweets and hundreds of replies. The tweet was only removed on January 21st after CryptoBatz was contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Cryptobatz tweet containing link to a scam Discord" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5rKGTUmjVGiOa0t8kQqpJ8xia0k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23185029/cryptobatz_tweet.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tOnZFC"&gt;On clicking the scam link, the invite panel for the fake Discord showed the total number of members as 1,330, an indication of the number of people who could potentially have been fooled by the scam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LF6C35"&gt;Inside the server, a bot spoofing community management service Collab Land asked users to verify their crypto assets to participate in the server — but directed users to a phishing site where they were prompted to connect their cryptocurrency wallets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tY91Ky"&gt;A representative of Collab Land declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Fake Collab Land bot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LB5IFndoKg55MIA9Rmt9dMY24Ms=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23185140/scam_bot.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D2rK2G"&gt;Tim Silman, a nonprofit employee, is one person who lost money through the scam. Silman estimates that around $300–400 in ETH was drained from his wallet after he visited the fake Discord server through a link posted on the CryptoBatz website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGv7by"&gt;“I’ve seen at least a dozen people on Twitter voicing this same issue,” Silman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If you look at the transactions on Etherscan, others lost a lot more than me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hj6mgB"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xdfbd08a29967f13cc2c143f0e8b71aea6dec3ecb"&gt;Ethereum wallet address&lt;/a&gt; Silman indicated was linked to the scammers had received a series of incoming transactions totaling 14.6 ETH ($40,895) on January 20th and sent it onwards to a wallet containing more than $150,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T34cji"&gt;The project had been slow to remove the bad links, even when informed, Silman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lQCBk"&gt;“I tagged them a few times in various tweets, as have a few other people, but no response,” he said. “This is an expensive lesson, I suppose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pilF2B"&gt;Even as the fake link remained present in a prominent tweet, the CryptoBatz project continued to hype the public token mint. As of January 21st, CryptoBatz NFTs were being &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/collection/cryptobatz-by-ozzy-osbourne"&gt;resold on OpenSea&lt;/a&gt; for around 1.8 ETH ($5,046).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K0XNWu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is an expensive lesson I suppose”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ivFQfY"&gt;Asked whether the project should accept responsibility for leaving the old link online, Sutter Systems, developers of the CryptoBatz NFT, laid blame for the scam squarely with Discord. In an email statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Sutter Systems co-founder “Jepeggi” emphasized that the compromise was only possible because of the easy setup and maintenance of the scam Discord instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuiRPa"&gt;“Although we feel very sorry for the people that have fallen prey to these scams, we cannot take responsibility for the actions of scammers exploiting Discord — a platform that we have absolutely no control over,” Jepeggi said. “In our opinion this situation and hundreds of others that have taken place across other projects in the NFT space could have easily been prevented if Discord just had a better response/support/fraud team in place to help big projects like ours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1ocR8"&gt;Discord said that it was aware of the incident and in contact with the affected team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GatYgw"&gt;“Our Trust &amp;amp; Safety team is in touch with the server owners and are investigating the incident,” said Peter Day, senior manager for corporate communications at Discord. “Our team takes action when we become aware of attacks like this one, including banning users and shutting down servers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Picard’s first season 2 trailer has Guinan going for it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Whoopi Goldberg as Guinan and Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dDq8XxZn54V1_RVPIgDS5ruKG1w=/126x0:1799x1115/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70417593/e183b15c7b0688ce905e81597631bc6e.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dNRwAo"&gt;Just when it seemed like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/4/17651884/patrick-stewart-jean-luc-picard-star-trek-cbs-all-access-new-series"&gt;Patrick Stewart’s Jean-Luc Picard&lt;/a&gt; might have been ready to bid the galaxy farewell, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21079004/star-trek-picard-review-cbs-all-access-patrick-stewart"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Picard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;gave the legendary space explorer a second shot at life that raised some questions about just who and what he is now. While first trailer for &lt;a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/482924/175360/3065?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2Fshows%2Fstar-trek-picard%2F&amp;amp;subid1=VergePicard012122"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Picard&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;/a&gt;second season doesn’t directly answer any of them, it brings back one of the few characters perfectly suited to help guide Picard and his allies through this next chapter of their journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GznznJ"&gt;Beyond getting the recently resurrected Jean-Luc and his fellow explorers back aboard &lt;em&gt;La Sirena &lt;/em&gt;and in the depths of space they long for&lt;em&gt;, Star Trek: Picard&lt;/em&gt;’s second season is also about to send its heroes into the existential deep in as they embark upon a journey spanning across time and space, and seemingly multiple realities that have all been fractured somehow. As disorienting as Picard is when he wakes up in what appears to be the past, it’s the sort of turn of events that Whoopi Goldberg’s Guinan likely sees coming long before her old friend even thinks to come looking for her El-Aurian wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uP0HXF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OyuddrlFajs"&gt;https://youtu.be/OyuddrlFajs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTdUtO"&gt;Along with Guinan, &lt;em&gt;Picard&lt;/em&gt;’s second season will also see John Delancie’s Q and Annie Wersching as the Borg Queen in the mix, and the show’s decision to lean heavily on familiar characters from &lt;em&gt;Next Generation &lt;/em&gt;makes sense given how this arc’s poised to focus on key moments from the franchise’s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5EfXa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Picard’s &lt;/em&gt;second season hits Paramount+ on March 3th, and premieres internationally on Prime Video from March 4th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to protect your PC from ransomware using Windows’ built-in protection</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of a laptop with three locks, a key, an at sign, a key and colorful pixels all randomly placed around the image." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RRgsb9jYPOE44pbnwQhmerfLH3M=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70417398/VRG_4614_0_Overview.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Maria Chimishkyan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8nHoix"&gt;Ransomware — malware that prevents you from accessing your files unless you pay the hacker that infected your computer — has been an issue plaguing computer users and businesses for years. Given its prevalence and the fact that a ransomware infection can lead to the loss of valuable files like documents or family pictures, it’s a good idea to make sure you’re protected. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/29/15892658/microsoft-windows-10-controlled-folders-feature"&gt;Starting with Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft has added features to its built-in Windows Security software that can help keep your computer safe from ransomware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQQe5e"&gt;As far as ransomware is concerned, there are two levels to Windows Security. The first consists of malware scans, which are on by default, and which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22705042/how-to-scan-microsoft-windows-pc-malware-security-antivirus-defender"&gt;you can learn more about here&lt;/a&gt;. While this will work to keep ransomware from being installed on your computer, if a piece of malware &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; manage to slip by, the scans won’t be able to protect your files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wazhbC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Winning the war on ransomware","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22822884/us-government-department-of-justice-ransomware-digital-extortion-task-force-report-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wCROiA"&gt;The second level is Windows’ ransomware protection, which you have to turn on manually. However, before you do, it is worth noting that this feature is not on by default for a reason. It works by only letting approved apps make changes to your files — which, in theory, prevents ransomware from encrypting them and locking them away. This, however, can cause some problems with apps that aren’t expecting it, so you may have to do some occasional trouble-shooting if you’ve got ransomware protection turned on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUMYBk"&gt;As a result, as we go over how to enable ransomware protection, it’s worth keeping in mind that there will probably be some tinkering involved with this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uRvozJ"&gt;How to turn on ransomware protection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="seP7Wy"&gt;Windows’ built-in ransomware protection is included in its security app. To get to it, either search “Windows Security” from the start menu or go to “Settings”&amp;gt; “Privacy &amp;amp; Security”&amp;gt; “Windows Security.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uM00HoGU4fWrH_-TH8GyEfuRRS0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183213/2022_01_20_14_46_12_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once you’re in Windows Security, go to “Virus &amp;amp; threat protection,” either by clicking the tile or the button in the sidebar on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SU4BmU"&gt;To turn on ransomware protection, go to “Virus and threat protection” and click “Manage ransomware protection.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kWN32CnI5bDMNJzsz_NPOTOb8-0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183233/2022_01_20_14_46_43_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on the “Manage ransomware protection” link to get to the Ransomware protection page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hgyq7f"&gt;From there, you can turn on a feature called “Controlled folder access,” which will make it so that unapproved apps won’t be able to make changes to your documents, pictures, videos, or music folders. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6aMHrlKuOUyaEKG4eQLVOXfN6Ok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183270/2022_01_20_14_47_08_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Switching on the “Controlled folder access” feature ensures that unauthorized apps can’t make changes to files in certain protected folders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cOgUmu"&gt;How to adjust Controlled folder access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mYSkkj"&gt;Once you switch Controlled folder access on, you’ll see three more control panes: “Block history,” “Protected folders,” and “Allow an app through Controlled folder access.” By default, Controlled folder access will only allow a list of approved apps to make any changes to files in the Documents, Pictures, Videos, and Music folders on your computer. These apps let you tweak how the system works.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIcTcT"&gt;You can, for example, add other folders that you want to protect using the “Protected folders” screen and manage which apps are allowed to make changes to protected folders using the “Allow an app through Controlled folder access” screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMKZ3M"&gt;Here’s what you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tPcZ-qfAise9-fFDNVrLywsFb4o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183278/2022_01_20_15_31_53_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Ransomware protection” panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="21K0lk"&gt;Block history&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Kzaqlv"&gt;According to a statement in one Windows security page, apps “determined by Microsoft as friendly” will always be allowed to make changes to your protected folders, but that doesn’t mean that every app you’ll want to use will be allowed by default. If you see a weird error popping up after turning on Controlled folder access (one common error I found during testing was getting a “This file cannot be found” message when trying to save a file), you may want to check “Block history” to see if Windows Security has been keeping that app from making changes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nfoVqfNGHmV3gKhoJUya9qlBqKM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183194/2022_01_20_15_16_01_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The block history screen shows you which apps have tried to write to protected folders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uTuaMr"&gt;“Block history” lets you see what app was blocked and what folder it was trying to write to. If it’s the app you’ve been having issues with, you’ll want to add it to the list of programs that can make changes. (We’ll go over how to do that in a moment.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ek20dpfNBcGQuFNUauZiDGLyxls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183170/2022_01_20_15_02_19_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the types of errors you may encounter: FireFox’s download screen said the file I was trying to save could not be found.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8UoKgI"&gt;Protected folders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zBTAaq"&gt;If you want to protect additional folders from ransomware, like your Desktop folder (which isn’t protected by default), you can select “Protected folders” and click the “Add a protected folder” button.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BQemG2EBYG3oDRjm5HvML6AAV-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183203/2022_01_20_14_50_14_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adding a folder to the protected folder list will keep apps from writing to it without permission.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sJg4HO"&gt;From there, you can navigate to the folder you want to protect and click the “Select Folder” button.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pSQR6cMoAPb8vFDtD2ClB6185JU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183202/2022_01_20_14_51_33_Greenshot.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chose the folder you want to protect, then click the “Select Folder” button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tIciSK"&gt;You can remove protection from custom-added folders (but not the default ones) by going back to the “Protected folders” screen, clicking on the folder you added, and clicking the Remove button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="D47dzS"&gt;Allow an app through controlled folder access&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9GxWct"&gt;If you’re having problems using an app and want to add it to the allowed list of apps, go back to the “Ransomware protection” page and select “Allow an app through Controlled folder access.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FiljGU"&gt;After clicking on the “Add an allowed app” button, you can click “Recently blocked apps” to see a list of the apps that have recently tried to write to your protected folders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AXqikyVWbjyt9C5UHjfDC8WUxvQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183172/2022_01_20_15_03_28_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clicking “Recently blocked apps” gets you a list of the apps that have tried and failed to make changes to your files.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kG7UweNSg8kyhgQXj4soRDMWSB0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183173/2022_01_20_15_03_37_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clicking the plus button next to an app’s name will let it make changes to files in your protected folders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="82QKwA"&gt;While you should only have to do this process once per app, it can be frustrating. You can turn off Ransomware Protection at any time, but if you believe that you’re at high risk for infection and don’t have backups, you should think carefully before doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TMLbUS"&gt;Additional ways to protect yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar09rE"&gt;While Windows’ ransomware protection is a powerful built-in tool, it’s probably not a good idea to rely on it as your only defense — as with all anti-malware systems, it should be treated as a safety net rather than your first line of defense. Here are some of the things you can do to avoid getting a ransomware infection in the first place and to make sure that your data is safe even if the worst were to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="l7FgvZ"&gt;Be careful online&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="F9pzxb"&gt;As with any malware, ransomware can spread through a variety of ways, such as being attached to phishing emails, exploiting security holes in out-of-date software, or masquerading as an actually useful program. When you’re online, it’s important to stay vigilant — if someone is trying to get you to download a program from an untrusted source that seems too good to be true, proceed with extreme caution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyeTkr"&gt;It’s also important to check the extensions of files you’re sent. If someone claims an attachment is a document, but it has a .exe or .msi extension, that file is likely dangerous. If you can’t already see the file’s extension, you can right-click on it, then click “Properties.” Windows will tell you what kind of file it is next to the “Type of file” heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srMlkU"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/protect-your-pc-from-ransomware-08ed68a7-939f-726c-7e84-a72ba92c01c3"&gt;guide to protecting yourself from ransomware&lt;/a&gt; lists some of the things that can lead to your computer being infected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="11tTnG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• &lt;/strong&gt;Visiting unsafe, suspicious, or fake websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9Nc9q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• &lt;/strong&gt;Opening file attachments that you weren’t expecting or from people you don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4oBIQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• &lt;/strong&gt;Opening malicious or bad links in emails, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media posts, or in instant messenger or SMS chats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="z8b33C"&gt;Keep your software updated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Br8z5b"&gt;It’s also important to make sure that your operating system and any software you use regularly have the latest security patches. Most browsers will update themselves automatically, and Windows usually also installs updates as they become available. To manually check for updates, go to “Settings”&amp;gt; “Windows Update” and click the “Check for updates” button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAjqsC"&gt;You can update any apps installed through Windows’ built-in store by going to the Microsoft Store app, clicking the “Library” button in the lower left-hand corner, and then clicking the “Get Updates” button to find any available updates. You can also click the “Update” button on individual apps or the “Update all” button at the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1Fnfyx"&gt;Make sure to have backups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="82qIPA"&gt;While using ransomware protection and having safe browsing habits can help keep you safe, no system is perfect. It’s important to have a backup of your computer’s files so that if you do end up infected by ransomware, you don’t lose your most valuable photos, videos, or documents. Backups can also keep you from losing data if your computer is physically damaged, lost, or stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npwd50"&gt;You can read our guide on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/1/16240630/how-to-back-up-your-computer-time-machine-file-history-windows-mac-external-drive"&gt;how to back up your computer here&lt;/a&gt;. If possible, it’s best to have two different forms of backup: one local and one in the cloud. However, having any kind of backup is much better than not having anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fm3B6W"&gt;What to do if your computer is infected with ransomware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="W48q9L"&gt;If all your protections have failed, and you discover that your computer is infected with ransomware, there are three important steps to take:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="8XvaKN"&gt;Disconnect your computer from Wi-Fi or ethernet — some ransomware can spread to other computers connected to your network, and it’s important to limit the damage. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="deJhOH"&gt;Don’t pay the ransom — doing so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685930/treasury-sanctions-cryptocurrency-exchange-ransomware-colonial-pipeline"&gt;could be illegal&lt;/a&gt;, depending on where the hackers trying to extort you are located, and paying does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; guarantee that you’ll actually get access to your files back. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DuGULa"&gt;Don’t plug in your backups if you have them — the ransomware will very likely attempt to destroy those files as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="jVCZsC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/protect-your-pc-from-ransomware-08ed68a7-939f-726c-7e84-a72ba92c01c3"&gt;Microsoft recommends&lt;/a&gt; attempting to do &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/virus-threat-protection-in-windows-security-1362f4cd-d71a-b52a-0b66-c2820032b65e"&gt;a full scan of your computer using Windows Security&lt;/a&gt;. (Another good app to try is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.malwarebytes.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22889631%2Fwindows-10-11-ransomware-defense-security-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Malwarebytes&lt;/a&gt;, which is well-known for its ability to scrub a computer of malware and is free for personal use.) If neither of those work, you may need to &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/recovery-options-in-windows-31ce2444-7de3-818c-d626-e3b5a3024da5#bkmk_win11_reset_pc"&gt;fully reset your PC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMoB6p"&gt;Finally, if you don’t feel confident that you can remove the ransomware yourself, take your computer to a professional — it’s best to make sure that it’s fully clean before trying to recover your backups. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nike’s accessible ACG Gaiadome FlyEase Boot will be for athletes only</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/okdBbH6q9FJgtLZnkqUsbXK9kWU=/0x1934:4480x4921/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70417294/Gaiadome_Boot_Side_original.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nike’s ACG Gaiadome FlyEase Boot feature toggle laces and a zippered back entry.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nike&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jFh8CJ"&gt;For the upcoming Beijing Winter Olympics, Nike announced Friday that it’s designed inclusive and accessible gear for Team USA Olympians and Paralympians to wear on the medal stand. That includes the new ACG Gaiadome FlyEase Boot, which can be slipped on and secured one-handed. The only issue is it seems to have inherited the FlyEase’s limited availability as well. While the rest of the ‘fit will be available for purchase, the Gaiadome boot will be an athlete exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzKk36"&gt;“For the official Team USA Medal Stand look in Beijing, we worked closely with the disability community, including current and former winter and summer Paralympians, in our design and testing process, and used inclusive design principles and methods to create gear that ensures every athlete who competes feels support in style from start to finish,” Nike said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvWSMK"&gt;Overall, this translates to an outfit that can be easily worn by those with limited dexterity. For example, the jackets include magnetic closures, oversized zipper pulls, and fish-trap pockets. Meanwhile, the ACG Dri-Fit ADV Trail Pants have a quick-release magnetic buckle. For the ACG Gaiadome Boot, the design features a zippered back entry and toggle laces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVqJIn"&gt;The Gaiadome FlyEase Boot has a similar design philosophy to the $120 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/2/1/22260179/nike-go-flyease-shoes-hands-free-pricing-release-day"&gt;Go FlyEase&lt;/a&gt;, which Nike introduced last year. Those sneakers featured a “bistable hinge” that allowed a person to put on and take off the shoe hands-free. While the FlyEase’s accessible design was widely praised, Nike was heavily criticized over how it handled the launch. Limited stock and hype created a resale market around the shoes resulting in prices shooting upwards of $400. The problem &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LeoInLaurent/status/1388739788522627072?s=20"&gt;went viral&lt;/a&gt; on social media, and some accused Nike of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/28/981197687/nike-accused-of-using-disability-to-hype-new-hands-free-sneaker"&gt;using disability as a marketing scheme&lt;/a&gt; without assuring access to those who would most benefit from the sneakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="CYH9dV"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Nike ACG Gaiadome FlyEase Boot|105647" data-volume-uuid="06ae71a8b" data-volume-id="105647" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-213" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EDFAOa"&gt;It’s curious, then, that Nike has decided to make the Gaiadome FlyEase Boot an athlete exclusive. This isn’t the first time Nike has made accessible footwear for Olympic athletes that then became available for consumers. For the Tokyo Summer Games last year, Nike introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/design/2021/7/1/22560002/nike-glide-flyease-olympics-sneakers"&gt;Glide FlyEase&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of the innovative hinge, they featured a flexible heel that would snap into place once a person stepped into the shoe. Both the Go FlyEase and Glide FlyEase are available for retail. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked Nike why the Gaiadome FlyEase Boot will be an athlete exclusive but didn’t immediately receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9B1rUt"&gt;In an ideal world, accessible design would be the default, &lt;a href="https://accessibility.umn.edu/importance-accessibility/benefits-accessible-design"&gt;as it benefits everyone&lt;/a&gt;. Boots are oftentimes difficult for even able-bodied people with full use of their hands. It’s understandable that Nike may be keen to avoid further controversy, but hopefully, we’ll see the Gaiadome FlyEase Boot’s design incorporated on future shoes that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; available to the public — and not in limited quantities. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Light sensors on wearables struggle with dark skin and obesity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Watch Series 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iQB5TbbRGFw6Y-5YpbwbAHIvIOM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70417202/akrales_171113_2119_0074.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Watch | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rPTfh3"&gt;Light sensors used to track heart rate in wearable devices like the Apple Watch Series 5 and the Fitbit Versa 2 don’t work as well on darker skin or people with obesity, according to modeling done in a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8713672/"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdXiIo"&gt;That’s a problem for features currently built into devices — but it’s also a bad sign for efforts to use light sensors for new applications in wearables, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677381/smartwatch-blood-pressure-samsung-fitbit-apple"&gt;monitoring blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, says study author Jessica Ramella-Roman, an associate professor studying bioimaging sensors at Florida International University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2QBbg"&gt;“The architecture of the device has to change,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LmWqd"&gt;The study looked at the photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, a technique that uses changes in how light is reflected to measure blood flow, on three wearable devices: the Apple Watch Series 5, Fitbit Versa 2, and Polar M600. The research team used a model that simulates how light moves through tissue to show how the sensors on those devices would behave with different skin properties. Darker skin has higher melanin and absorbs more light, while skin from people with obesity tends to be thicker, have less water, and have less blood flow than skin from people who are not obese. While previous research on accuracy and bias in wearables has focused on skin tone, Ramella-Roman says that many studies haven’t included a lot of people with obesity despite these physiological differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qbx7kq"&gt;“That’s why we think it’s necessary to focus there,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LsrOn"&gt;The PPG signal didn’t change much as skin tone changed, the researchers’ model found: it varied less than 10 percent across the devices. But modeling obesity, both alone and together with skin tone, caused up to a 60 percent variation in the signal. Signal loss appeared to be because of the changes in skin thickness in people with obesity, the authors said in the study. There were changes in the peak of the PPG signal, which is used to calculate heart rate but whose signal strength should not change based on the heart rate value. There were also changes in the shape of the signal — which different groups are using as a way to track blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9aYqpZ"&gt;“As we increased the BMI level and increased the skin tone, the signal diminished, and then other features started disappearing as well,” she says. The Fitbit, which had fewer sensors, had a more dramatic loss of signal than the Apple Watch, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ItVTsZ"&gt;This study only modeled how these wearable devices would detect signals in the lab, Ramella-Roman stressed. The team still has to check the devices on actual people in order to confirm the findings. They’re in the process of doing that study now and have enrolled around 100 people so far, she says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZB5fg"&gt;But the problems revealed by analyses like this complicate projects looking to use wearables to track cardiovascular health for underserved groups, Ramella-Roman says. The new study indicates researchers have to be careful using PPG, particularly for projects aiming to use the devices to help monitor people at higher risk of cardiovascular issues — which includes people with obesity. “The holy grail in this context is looking at blood pressure,” she says. “But many, many studies looking at blood pressure use some combination of PPG and other modalities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxSlul"&gt;The findings also suggest that other devices that use light sensors and PPG, like the blood oxygen measures in hospitals or doctors’ offices, might not work as well for people with obesity. There are very few studies that evaluate the devices in those groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yRH6uT"&gt;The good news is it should be possible to adjust devices (like by moving around the spacing of the sensors) so that they are more accurate on people with darker skin or with obesity without compromising accuracy for other groups, Ramella-Roman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qtXEVg"&gt;“The way the systems were designed initially maybe didn’t account for these individuals, but they could definitely make changes,” she says. “I don’t see anything that would limit that.”  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kyocera DuraSport 5G UW review: tough choices</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The DuraSport 5G is one of the few rugged options available&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="XH6g5P"&gt;After releasing the tank-like $899.99 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446490/kyocera-duraforce-ultra-5g-uw-review-price-specs-screen-camera"&gt;DuraForce Ultra 5G UW in April 2021&lt;/a&gt;, Kyocera is back with a more subtly rugged (and more affordable) phone — the $579.99 DuraSport 5G UW. If you want a sub-$600 rugged phone that works on Verizon’s millimeter wave (mmWave) 5G network, the DuraSport 5G UW is really your only choice. Roughly the size of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A with 5G&lt;/a&gt;, the DuraSport is small but strong: it’s dust, sand, and waterproof in up to 6.5 ft of water for 30 minutes (IP68), as well as MIL 810H-certified to survive five-foot drops onto concrete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fyRyM"&gt;Underneath that toughness, the DuraSport is a sub-$300 phone at heart. It shares similar specs as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;$239.99 OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt;: they both use the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of internal storage. But the DuraSport has a smaller 4,500mAh battery and comes with some unique outdoor apps and camera features. This leads to the obvious question: is a budget rugged phone worth the premium, or are you better off getting a cheap 5G phone and adding a very protective case around it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mQRyhj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10954621"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Irpu2G5AQ1fM2aqWOGvUvsuIYeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100512/gsin_190401_4934_0001_cropped.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FceIkL"&gt;DuraSport 5G UW Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="87ab7q"&gt;At a time when every new budget phone seems to be over 6.5 inches tall, the DuraSport is surprisingly compact. It’s similar to the Google Pixel 5A with 5G but thicker and slightly more narrow (6.09 x 2.78 x 0.39-inch or 154.7 x 70.7 x 9.9mm). They even look alike, with the same rounded corners and fingerprint sensor on the back — handy for unlocking the phone when you’re wearing a mask. This phone fits nicely in my small hands, and I can stuff it into most pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6x0Q5"&gt;For a phone built to survive the rigorous military-grade tests for dust, sand, water, and drop protection, the DuraSport’s design doesn’t scream rugged. Unlike its more expensive sibling, the DuraSport has normal dimensions and proportions. But it still obviates the need for a separate case: not only is its screen protected by Gorilla Glass 6, but it has reinforced corners, water-tight seams around its buttons, and a Dragontrail Glass over its rear cameras. Despite its extra bits of engineering, the Kyocera weighs about the same as the Pixel 5A. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/szgt5xhgFStySime-UT16E5-eCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100514/gsin_190401_4934_0004_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The DuraSport has some texture on its sides to help with grip, but it’s not very comfortable to hold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9A00JY"&gt;While the DuraSport’s hard plastic shell can withstand a lot of abuse, it’s not the most comfortable to hold. Kyocera added some light texture to its back cover and along the sides, but they don’t provide much substantial grip to the device. Not that this phone needs the extra protection, but a case would make the phone easier to hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwU83e"&gt;Among the many ways you can customize this phone, the most obvious is the programmable button on the left side. You can set it to open the exact camera mode you need in a hurry (underwater shutter button) or open a particular app if you double-press the button. I kept hitting the programmable button by accident because that’s where my thumb lands when I hold the phone; the actual power button is a bit too low for my liking. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/goH2npYLIBiyfmDpLl-sLeG10_g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100518/gsin_190401_4934_0012_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The included suite of outdoor apps can provide useful information, but they require constant access to your location, even when you’re not using them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7FSjlj"&gt;DuraSport 5G UW Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8pyQG8"&gt;Despite its mid-range price tag, the DuraSport has low-end internal components. Its processor is the budget-tier Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 with 4GB of RAM, which makes the DuraSport just a beat slower to open a webpage or switch between portrait and landscape mode when watching a YouTube video. This was particularly evident when playing a round of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;, where the middle of a battle slowed to such a crawl that I couldn’t move my Pokémon out of the way to dodge an attack. While a sub-$300 phone can get away with just 64GB of storage, it’s mismatched to the DuraSport’s nearly $600 price tag, even if it has a microSD card slot for expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGZaCB"&gt;The DuraSport somewhat redeems itself with a 6.1-inch 1080p IPS LCD display that is quite bright (500 nits), making it possible to use the screen at just 60 percent brightness in direct sunlight. When you look at high-res photos like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22829680/2021-art-illustrations-photography-verge-roundup"&gt;The Verge’s 2021: A Year in Art&lt;/a&gt;, the images look smooth and detailed even when you pixel-peep, thanks to this screen’s over 400PPI pixel density. Best of all, the touchscreen is functional when I’m wearing gloves or there is water on the screen, which is a huge help during winter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnFy7I"&gt;This phone is preloaded with apps for outdoor enthusiasts: an Outdoor Portal, Compass, Barometer, Sun&amp;amp;Moon, Weather, Tide (if you fish or have a boat), and Solunar (if you want to meet or avoid certain animals). In my case, I skate on an outdoor rink in the winter but am extremely picky about when I do so: the temperature needs to be at least 32 degrees or below the night before and throughout the day, with minimal wind, and after sunset so the ice has a chance to harden. I used the Outdoor Portal to monitor my local weather and sunset / sunrise data rather than cycle between multiple apps. While I appreciate the convenience of having these apps on my phone, I was not impressed that I had to give the apps non-stop access to my location, even though they said I could just limit the data collection to when I use the apps. If you don’t care to use these apps at all, you don’t have to worry about the location tracking, but they are a big part of the DuraSport’s selling points.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Za_0PTHZr5E8GrE4FGg5EUTFO3k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100513/gsin_190401_4934_0003_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The included outdoor apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WugW9L"&gt;Beyond these outdoor apps, the DuraSport essentially runs an unmodified version of Android 11. As one of the phones selected for the &lt;a href="https://androidenterprisepartners.withgoogle.com/device/#!/Atw0zjuq92nTHyfuwwaC"&gt;Android Enterprise Recommended&lt;/a&gt; program, Kyocera is already committed to providing quarterly security updates to the DuraSport until November 2023. This, along with the fact Kyocera provides two years of warranty, compared to the industry standard of just one year, means this phone should last you a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLv26q"&gt;The DuraSport’s 4,500mAh battery is actually quite energy-efficient and able to go without a charge after two days of use — and that’s from using mostly 4G LTE. After listening to a couple of hour-long podcasts, taking some photos and videos, posting and scrolling through social media, and reading various articles, I got about 15.5 hours of screen time out of the DuraSport over two days. Using the included charger, I was able to recharge the phone within 2.5 hours, which isn’t particularly fast. Kyocera says the DuraSport supports faster charging, but a fast charger is not included in the box. Like the DuraSport Ultra 5G, the lower tier model also supports wireless charging for more convenient topping up.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ge9x8YJkswhw_6oWgX2d-TQLTtc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100516/gsin_190401_4934_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The DuraSport’s camera is budget-level, despite its mid-range price tag.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GcaNqZ"&gt;DuraSport 5G UW Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NdYqvf"&gt;Let’s get this out of the way: if you’re serious about photography, then you won’t like the cameras on the DuraSport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwh9GB"&gt;The phone has two cameras on the back, a 48-megapixel main and a 16-megapixel ultrawide, as well as an 8-megapixel front camera. The cameras take perfectly fine photos in good lighting conditions, but they’re not designed for anything challenging like low-light or action photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="14riyf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10988512"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NP3CMo"&gt;Its cameras share the same problems that plague other sub-$300 phones. Not only do the colors differ between the main and ultrawide camera, but the main camera also sometimes has trouble focusing and separating the subject from the background in portrait mode. I’ve also noticed that photos from low-light environments look as if there is vignetting around the edges — whether they were captured with the main, ultrawide, or selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyd2wN"&gt;The DuraSport tries to make up for its technical deficiencies with some unique video interfaces like the Action Overlay and beauty filters. (I did not have access to ANT Plus compatible fitness sensors, so I could not test the Action Overlay being linked to my fitness data in real-time.) Ultimately, it’s let down by a camera app that is slow at switching between cameras and will randomly close for no reason, which makes it frustrating to take photos with it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/txzVUzQNArBSUldpMHGKeU1EaBk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121642/gsin_190410_4934_0023.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kyocera DuraSport 5G UW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k0eOIY"&gt;There is no doubt you’re paying a premium for the rugged design of the $579.99 DuraSport 5G UW — despite the fact it has cheap components that are more common in sub-$300 budget phones. It’s a shame it doesn’t use a faster processor or feature better cameras for a phone that is almost $600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvqoKv"&gt;There are plenty of other, better phones in this price range, including Google’s own Pixel 6. But if you’re looking for a rugged phone and want to use Verizon’s faster mmWave 5G network, the DuraSport is really the only budget rugged 5G phone available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsci4J"&gt;If having excellent cameras on your phone is more important to you, and you are willing to accept a water-resistant (IP67) rather than a waterproof one (IP68), then the $449 Pixel 5A with 5G would be a better choice. After all, they look and feel almost identical to each other, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okGCOQ"&gt;The peace of mind of having a phone that can handle serious spills and drops without needing to be replaced within a few years, thanks to Kyocera’s two-year warranty, is worthwhile, but most of us are better off just investing in a durable case for another phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="XCHVNL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10988492"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S0pRvT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, 1:30PM ET, January 21st, 2022:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this review stated the DuraForce 5G UW does not support wireless charging. That is incorrect, the phone includes support for Qi charging. Also added information about optional wired fast charging. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>1Password has plans to get companies to actually use one password</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tBHvW8XyJFdQ253O1VBuSs1Ggyo=/256x0:3009x1835/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70417116/Screen_Shot_2022_01_20_at_8.06.18_PM.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n8QNZ4"&gt;Digital password manager company 1Password announced this week intentions to expand the login features of its services — starting with something the company calls Universal Sign On that it says can make logging into different websites or services even easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcBpqa"&gt;1Password already sells subscription services to small and large businesses looking to control and secure access to various passwords amongst staff — and now it looks to make Universal Sign On work alongside multi-factor authentication products like Duo and single sign-on (SSO) products like Okta (depending on what the enterprise needs are).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aP7ewW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Protecting you online — it’s in our DNA.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, we announce our Series C and our vision for the future of 1Password, to bring human-centric security to everyone: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ql0LxQ0LCF"&gt;https://t.co/Ql0LxQ0LCF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 1Password (@1Password) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/1Password/status/1483802922660122627?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 19, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XlGC2z"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://blog.1password.com/future-of-1password/"&gt;announcing&lt;/a&gt; a new funding round valuing the company at $6.8 billion, 1Password launched a “vision of the future” &lt;a href="https://www.future.1password.com"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; presenting a simplified idea on how 1Password can help make logins easier by remembering what single sign-on method was used on what site and ride it through for you (thereby, continuing the tradition of only needing the namesake “one password”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLp35I"&gt;Tom Warren with&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; joined 1Password CEO and founders on a Twitter Space talk on Wednesday, asking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="SEQqjC"&gt;“How will 1Password try to solve the challenges of universal log on and, in particular, whether you’re trying to compete with Okta, Active Directory and others in this space?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3uMwdB"&gt;1Password’s CFO Jeannie De Guzman responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QRhhNt"&gt;“We actually partner with Okta and we are an Okta shop at 1Password. When I think about competing with Okta... we don’t view them as a direct competitor. When you use Okta inside a company, it’s often times a lot of enterprise level software that you have enterprise-wide deployments... there's a huge proliferation of SaaS apps going out that are being used by all of us at work right now. Those onesies and twosies that go to one person or to a small group of people... those don’t necessarily get caught in Okta”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HJpavW"&gt;Guzman explains the issue of “shadow IT,” where people can still have access to things not governed by Okta SSO or have accounts for work that IT does not know about — and that is where Guzman says 1Password can cooperate with Okta (or other SSOs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPFjWA"&gt;“We capture all those logins that don’t get captured enterprise-wide.” Guzman gave an example of this as someone who has worked finance in various companies: finance departments could give access to bank accounts with a single sign-on solution using 1Password, even if they’re not configured for Okta-style SSO access. Guzman further expanded that many companies could have a finance department employee who just left and, yet, still knows the bank account password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="319Lhc"&gt;Today, the company &lt;a href="https://blog.1password.com/how-sso-fits-enterprise-security-framework/"&gt;posted on its blog&lt;/a&gt; to further explain how 1Password will work alongside SSO solutions and why companies really should use its product:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JzcUA4"&gt;It’s important to note that SSO doesn’t solve all your security problems, just a subset of them. For instance, if a service isn’t integrated into your SSO platform, employees can create an account on their own, bypassing SSO altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UyNEpE"&gt;You can also check out the full 1Password Twitter Space recording below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T8RRno"&gt;

    <title>What’s the best student laptop? We asked students</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BVcaADlGztrbR5iNL_kFd3rebG0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67232292/akrales_200421_3975_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops for high school and college students.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tsQK0e"&gt;Shopping for a laptop can be stressful — doubly stressful if you or your children will be learning online for the first time. Kids of different ages have a range of different laptop use cases and different needs. And as the choices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; evolve, so do students’ needs. So I spoke to some experts on the subject: students themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9ZW8b"&gt;My recommendations here are meant to accommodate a variety of preferences and price ranges. But they’re a jumping-off point rather than an exhaustive list: every student is different. Before making a decision, you’ll want to make sure you read reviews and try out devices yourself if you can. I’ll do my best to keep this article up to date with items that are in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Best laptop for students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;aside id="7m4BUq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"},{"title":"The best Chromebooks to buy in 2022","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4lsvuf2NE7Upsw5uiVfjINO_Jhk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19315989/vpavic_191023_3755_0159.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixelbook Go has solid battery life and a rippled base that’s easy to grip, making it a good choice for kids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uaaUWw"&gt;Best laptop for elementary school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wdF0Hl"&gt;For younger students, a touchscreen device is easier to use than a keyboard and touchpad, says Michelle Glogovac. Glogovac’s five-year-old son uses an iPad for Webex meetings with his kindergarten class. He’s gotten the hang of it; Glogovac says he’s already learned how to mute and unmute himself, “a skill that many adults aren’t familiar with.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEF087"&gt;That said, it may be worth investing in a keyboard case if you go the tablet route. Glogovac has to type her son’s meeting codes and passwords for him, which can be cumbersome on the iPad’s flat screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxdcbE"&gt;As kids get older, their best laptop choice will vary depending on their needs. As a parent, it’s important that you and your child are in sync about how they intend to use it and the size of the programs they want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sTP9p"&gt;Kristin Wallace purchased a budget HP laptop for her daughter, Bella, but didn’t realize how quickly the nine-year-old would fill up 32GB of storage. “It is really slow and has no space for games. I need a computer with more storage space,” said Bella, who uses the laptop to Zoom with friends and take virtual guitar lessons and math enrichment classes. Wallace plans to buy Bella a better device in the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwTXVL"&gt;Audio quality is an important consideration for kids’ laptops. Lisa Mitchell, an elementary library media specialist, says her students use their devices to watch YouTube videos in addition to their online classes. Battery life is also a plus, even for distance learners who may not be far from a wall outlet. Bella likes to use her laptop all around the house and doesn’t want to bring the cord with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaeV8B"&gt;Durability is also worth paying for, according to Mitchell. If you’re using a tablet, get a protective case. “If a reasonably-priced insurance or replacement policy is available, it’s usually worth the extra expense.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is just $289, but it can run plenty of tabs and apps with no problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dE2ANJ"&gt;Best laptop for middle school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="r5kOKS"&gt;The middle school students I spoke to don’t use their laptops for much more than web-based schoolwork and browsing. Don’t be too concerned about power — prioritize a machine that’s comfortable and easy for your child to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9OvOd"&gt;“We just got the most basic Chromebook and it is totally perfect,” says Gabrielle Hartley, an &lt;a href="http://gabriellehartley.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;attorney&lt;/a&gt; and mother of three children. “The most basic Chromebook serves all the needs of the basic middle schooler.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user types on the Acer Chromebook Spin 713." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0hMEh9WTjBjXAQF5Bh8xq8l2ng0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21698818/mchin_181029_4126_0017.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chromebooks, like this one from Acer, are a good choice for students who use Google Classroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fP2U74"&gt;Hartley’s son Max, who is in eighth grade, agrees. “I would really like a gaming PC or gaming laptop that can plug into a monitor and run video games with 120fps, but I really don’t need that,” Max says. “Most eighth graders aren’t going to be running any video games on their laptops or any software that requires a lot of power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpOfaD"&gt;Max mostly uses his laptop for Google Classroom applications, including Gmail, Slides, Google Docs, and Google Sheets. They’re very easy to use on his device, which he describes as “a run-of-the-mill Samsung Chromebook.” That said, if your child is starting middle school this year, it could be worth checking with their teachers to see what operating system is most compatible with their workflow. Caspian Fischer Odén, a ninth grader from Sweden, told me he has trouble with his Chromebook because his school has blocked downloading apps from the Google Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eUtDq"&gt;Even kids with more demanding hobbies think a budget device can get the job done. Sam Hickman, an eighth grader from the UK who uses his laptop for photo and video editing, says, “For most middle schoolers, any processor developed within the last two years will be able to handle any tasks they can throw at it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4fFLe"&gt;So, what &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;worth paying for? A comfortable keyboard, several students told me. Many middle school kids aren’t used to typing for long periods of time. You should also look for a device that’s compact and easy for them to carry around, particularly if they’re preparing for in-person school. Shoot for an 11- to 13-inch model — certainly nothing larger than 15 inches. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Laptop 4 is a capable, no-nonsense laptop — just what many high schoolers want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SKuVFA"&gt;Best laptop for high school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OHE9ce"&gt;High schoolers’ laptop needs can vary based on their interests, but most don’t need powerful machines with lots of bells and whistles — especially if they come with glitches or serious downsides that could interfere with schoolwork. Miles Riehle, a student at Laguna Beach High School, has a high-end Surface Pro 7 but finds it overwhelming. “There is so much other stuff that I don’t use very often,” he said. “Something simpler might be a little more straightforward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toVK5y"&gt;The best operating system may depend on what your child is used to. Aryan Nambiar, a student at Barrington High School in Illinois, has an iMac at home and enjoys using an iPad for his schoolwork. Riehle says he would prefer a Chromebook because he has an Android phone and often uses Google services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taD6O0"&gt;But almost every student I spoke to agreed that the most important feature of a high school laptop is portability. Kids attending in-person classes may be carrying their device around for much of the day with a stack of other books. Look for a 13- or 14-inch screen, or a lighter 15- to 17-inch model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9koeX"&gt;Students also recommend something sturdy. “Most high schoolers I’ve seen will throw their laptop in their bag without too much care,” says Moses Buckwalter, a student at Penn Manor High School. Backpacks can be jostled in the hallway as well. Kids can also run into trouble at home. “Anything can happen,” says Aadit Agrawal, a high school student from India. “My own brother scratched my laptop with his nails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wo7j0d"&gt;Battery life is another key feature. “It can be a real struggle to find a place to charge while in class,” says Cas Heemskerk, a sophomore from the Netherlands. Unlike college students, many high schoolers don’t have frequent breaks to juice up their devices, so try to find something that can last a full day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMbdD6"&gt;Many students recommend a touchscreen with stylus support. Nambiar uses the feature for his biology class, where he does a lot of visual modeling. “The touchscreen is always a bonus for drawing diagrams, whereas if you’re using a laptop it’d be a whole process to submit a diagram you drew,” Nambiar says. Riehle uses a Surface Pen to fill out school forms and annotate PDFs. Agrawal finds it useful to take notes on the same screen as his online lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7t3Wu"&gt;Depending on the broadband situation in your area, you may also want a laptop with multiple connectivity options. Agrawal’s online classes are sometimes interrupted by powercuts, so he recommends an LTE model. Matej Plavevski, a junior at Yahya Kemal College in North Macedonia, recommends looking for an Ethernet port in case slower connections disrupt meetings. That’s hard to find on smaller laptops, but there’s a slew of affordable dongles and docks to consider. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For college students seeking an affordable laptop, HP’s Envy x360 performs just as well as some expensive competitors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QKVW4e"&gt;Best laptop for college &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sqoQtB"&gt;College kids are justified in spending a bit more money than other age groups. Some (especially in STEM courses) can expect to do some fairly demanding work. Assad Abid, an electrical engineering undergrad from Pakistan, needs to run simulation software for his assignments. Aakash Chandra, a student at New Horizon College of Engineering in India, does a lot of coding, in addition to creative work in Premiere Pro and Photoshop, and gaming. Students also noted that it’s worthwhile to pay for a laptop that will last for a few years after graduation. That means you won’t have to worry about finding and financing your next device until you’re (hopefully) settled into a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNtiDo"&gt;But among high-end, capable devices there’s still a wide range of options. Students stressed that a college laptop should be light. Expect to bring it between classes, meals, meetings, the library, and other locations on campus. “It’s a boon that I can carry my laptop as well as some notebooks without feeling like I’m carrying too much for six hours a day,” says Haseeb Waseem, a senior at Villanova University. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ntrjko32oDlmo53mASwptA-kbCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19897864/mchin_200413_3971_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 has a variety of configurations. Students with light workloads may prefer the base model, while gamers and creatives can add a GPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gsQLLb"&gt;Another universally-lauded feature: battery life. Waseem, who uses an HP Spectre, says the all-day juice gives him “the flexibility to study in a bunch of different locations, and even outside.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PevA8"&gt;Speakers and webcams are often overlooked, even in top-end devices. But students say it’s worth looking for good ones if you’re starting college this year. Though many college students are now back to in-person classes, some will still be meeting with clubs and attending events online. Waseem isn’t satisfied with his laptop’s audio and picture quality, which he says has made it difficult to pay attention in class and to engage with other students.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqglEH"&gt;Many students will need to invest more in areas tailored to their interests and schoolwork needs. Chandra’s dream laptop would include a stylus and touchscreen for his creative work as well as a high-end GPU. Waseem, who uses his laptop for a hodgepodge of activities, including streaming, coding, social media, video chatting, and Microsoft Office work, would prefer to prioritize a large screen to keep track of his multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xbox Series S is on sale at Woot for its lowest price ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1C9hVgB1FGjM8EYll7petwp8lr4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70416960/vpavic_201103_4275_0234.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today only (or while supplies last), you can pick up Microsoft’s next-gen console for just $279.99.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BGsaOQ"&gt;While nabbing an Xbox Series S isn’t as difficult as getting your hands on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X these days, Microsoft’s pearly white console is still in high demand. Currently, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDealsRoundup012122/https://www.woot.com/offers/microsoft-xbox-series-s-512gb-3?ref=w_cnt_wp_0_13" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot is hosting a deal on the Xbox Series S&lt;/a&gt;, reducing its regular $299.99 price tag to $279.99. This isn’t a massive discount by any means but it matches the best price we’ve ever seen for this console. The Series S isn’t quite as powerful as the Series X with some of the key distinctions being a lack of a physical disc drive, less storage space, and a less powerful processor. However, the console is still home to fantastic first-party titles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769985/forza-horizon-5-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and is compatible with a massive library of last-gen titles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2022/1/20/22892969/xbox-games-360-original-backward-compatible-digital-sale-deal-microsoft"&gt;many of which are currently on sale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The MSI Optix MAG321CQR normally retails $449.99 but is &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMSI-Optix-31-5-16-9-QHD-RGB-LED-Non-Glare-Super-Narrow-Bezel-1ms-2560-x-1440-144Hz-Refresh-Rate-Free-Sync-Height-Adjustable-Curved-Gaming-Monitor-Bla%2F866580873%3Fathcpid%3D866580873%26athpgid%3DAthenaItempage%26athcgid%3Dnull%26athznid%3Dsi%26athieid%3Dv0%26athstid%3DCS004%26athguid%3DETq9k2xgFeUvULajDCcvVFd9f8WBYvi8ca8L%26athancid%3Dnull%26athena%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $289.99 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. This 32-inch curved gaming panel comes equipped with all the bells and whistles you need to elevate your gaming setup. The Optix lands in a sweet spot by combining a 144Hz refresh rate with 1440p resolution, striking a solid balance between performance and visual fidelity. In addition to the expected HDMI and DisplayPort inputs, the monitor also features a pair of USB-A ports for power and a single port for data. The included stand is height and tilt adjustable, too, and the monitor is compatible with VESA mounts.&lt;/p&gt;

The Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition is on sale right now for $79.99, a healthy $50 off the usual price tag. This isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen, but it’s a decent value for anyone in the market for a TKL model. Just like other TKL keyboards, the Tournament Edition ditches the number pad and dedicated media playback buttons for a slimmer design that presents you with the essentials you need for gaming, in addition to the handy function row and navigation keys. It also uses Razer’s proprietary linear optical switches for smooth and rapid key presses, as well as a standardized keycap layout that allows you to swap out custom keycaps for a more personal touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aeIloN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10721765"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WwN5hz"&gt;Whether you need something to help keep your floors tidy or just a robotic chariot for your resident feline, the iRobot Roomba j7 is a solid option. Normally $649.99, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/iRobot-Roomba-Wi-Fi-Connected-Vacuum/dp/B094NW318F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has recently discounted this model to $399.99&lt;/a&gt;. One of the smartest automated cleaning solutions for your home, the j7 can clean on a schedule or handle messes immediately with the help of the Roomba app or Alexa and Google voice assistants. This model also features integrated obstacle avoidance, which allows it to easily navigate furniture and other large objects, but also ensures that it won’t accidentally choke on an errant iPhone charger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aorc8r"&gt;Perhaps most importantly, however, the j7 features good battery life and is capable of avoiding poop and other pet messes it can’t handle effectively. One small caveat to this otherwise well-rounded robovac is that, unlike the more expensive iRobot Roomba j7 Plus, it lacks an auto-empty base, meaning you will need to empty the bin manually.&lt;/p&gt;

The Vulcan Pro features a full-size layout with dedicated media playback buttons and a remarkably slim chassis. The slim style extends to the keycap design, which rests on top of the switches rather than around them, giving the keyboard the aesthetic of a sci-fi typewriter and providing a more prominent display for the RGB backlighting. One final feature that makes this keyboard unique is the software. The Roccat Neon software (formerly swarm) allows you to add custom typing sounds to your keyboard if you’re feeling nostalgic for that classic clicky sound.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I had to see these Hello Kitty gaming accessories, so now you do, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer’s Hello Kitty headset on a pink table with a pink keyboard, mousepad, and monitor in the background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w4EvuJXsmdKZrKrGMUgXhDvCpwk=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70416958/HeadsetFocus_OnDesk.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are cat ears on the headset. I wish I was joking.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tYIIEb"&gt;Razer is known for making some of the best, flashiest gaming gear on the market, from the category-topping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22650400/razer-basilisk-v3-chroma-rgb-scroll-wheel-price-features"&gt;Basilisk V3&lt;/a&gt; to the mind-blowingly powerful and portable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548663/razer-blade-14-review-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-5900hx-nvidia-rtx-3070"&gt;Razer Blade 14&lt;/a&gt;. Today, it’s announcing something, well, slightly different. The company has partnered with Sanrio to release a line of Hello Kitty-themed gaming accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrltpt"&gt;You may think I’m making this up, but alas, I am not. Take a look: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer’s Hello Kitty chair in front of a black background. On the chair are the Hello Kitty lumbar cushion, headset, mousepad and mouse." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9gR-lZCibzyHD3nli3wVyghVyEw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23184801/FamilyShot.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The gang is all here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AUNvLw"&gt;There’s a lot to unpack here. As you can see, we’ve got a mouse, a mousepad, Bluetooth headphones, a chair, and a lumbar cushion. It’s not just the kitty herself featured throughout — other franchise characters, including two who, I’m told, are named Badtz-maru and Keroppi, also make appearances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IM7DGz"&gt;You know what? I was prepared to roll my eyes at these, but they’re kind of adorable. If you have one of the various hot pink laptops that Razer has released over the years, I think these should go great with it. Just make sure you don’t wear bright red anywhere near this setup because it’s going to hurt my eyes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4FWdug"&gt;If you want to purchase any of these (they’re sold separately, so you don’t need to buy everything), you can get the &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-chairs%2Frazer-iskur%2FRZ38-02840200-R3U1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;chair for $499&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Fhello-kitty-and-friends-edition-razer-deathadder-essential-goliathus%2FRZ83-03850100-B3M1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;mouse and pad for $64.99&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-headsets%2Frazer-kraken-bt-kitty-edition%2FRZ04-03520300-R3M1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;headphones for $119.99&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-chairs-accessories%2Frazer-lumbar-cushion%2FRC81-03830201-R3M1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;lumbar cushion for $59.99&lt;/a&gt;. If you care about boring stuff like specs, the chair is an &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming%2Fchairs%2Frazer-iskur-x&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;Iskur X&lt;/a&gt; with a synthetic leather cover, the mouse &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-deathadder-essential%2FRZ01-03850100-R3M1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;is a DeathAdder Ess&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-deathadder-essential%2FRZ01-03850100-R3M1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ential&lt;/a&gt; with a 6,400 DPI optical sensor, and the headphones are from the Razer Kraken BT line (there’s a regular &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-headsets%2FRazer-Kraken-BT-Kitty-Edition%2FRZ04-03520100-R3U1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;“Kitty Edition,”&lt;/a&gt; sans Hello, as well). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQxvoG"&gt;These are all a bit more expensive than their non-Hello Kitty counterparts, so certainly aren’t the best value for your money — but can you really put a price on the meme potential of filling your gaming setup with anthropomorphic cats? Now, excuse me while I try to convince my employer to let me expense a kitty-themed home office. &lt;/p&gt;
