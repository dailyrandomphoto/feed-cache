    <title>House lawmakers introduce five bipartisan bills to unwind tech monopolies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qFoUOaPpANoVE-soa2qL07Bow5s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69441138/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NMGfr4"&gt;On Friday, House Democrats introduced five new bills meant to chip away at the power of big tech companies, targeting a variety of practices that antitrust advocates say are stifling competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZVRWK"&gt;These measures are the House Judiciary Committee’s historic, 16-month long investigation into the business tactics of companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google. With this new slate of bills, Congress is getting ready to legislate based on the concerns raised by that investigation — and the move could reshape the tech industry as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bYQVBr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Right now, unregulated tech monopolies have too much power over our economy”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zbQdoB"&gt;“Right now, unregulated tech monopolies have too much power over our economy. They are in a unique position to pick winners and losers, destroy small businesses, raise prices on consumers, and put folks out of work,” Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) said in a statement Friday. “Our agenda will level the playing field and ensure the wealthiest, most powerful tech monopolies play by the same rules as the rest of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LpFpvp"&gt;The package unveiled Friday includes five measures targeting the different ways in which tech companies maintain market dominance. One bill would empower the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission to break up tech firms by forcing them to sell off parts of their business that could create a conflict of interest — potentially forcing Amazon to carve off house brands like Amazon Basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tenz8K"&gt;Another bill would bar companies from giving their own services preference over their rivals, like Google boosting its own products in search results over competitors. Yet another bill would block companies like Facebook from buying up nascent competitors like in the 2012 acquisition of Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNP5ao"&gt;The last two bills are less controversial. Last week, the Senate already passed a measure put out by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) that would boost merger filing fees for large companies, giving antitrust enforcers more money to take on cases. A bill mirroring that legislation was introduced Wednesday. The last bill would force platforms to make the data they collect interoperable in order to make it easier for users to jump from one service to another. Both Republicans and Democrats seem eager to move forward on data portability legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNGQif"&gt;The House’s tech investigation was a bipartisan endeavor, and while both parties agree on many of the probe’s findings, they disagree on some of the solutions. The probe culminated into an over 400-page report from Democratic staff detailing its findings. Rep. Ken Buck (CO), the committee’s top Republican, issued his own report focusing on the ways large platforms allegedly censor conservative speech and encouraging other Republicans to support competition reform as a means of addressing the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XaBR2c"&gt;It’s unclear how lawmakers plan to move forward on the legislation, but the multi-pronged approach could make it easier to enact some changes over the coming Term. More measured approaches like Klobuchar’s to boost regulatory funding could find broad support in the House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNhFrU"&gt;At least one Republican and one Democrat signed on to each of Friday’s measures. Still it’s unclear if all members support each bill. On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/murdoch-pushes-republicans-support-antitrust-bills-471e7868-4dd3-4b3b-a8af-62cf25582fe7.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that lobbyists for Rupert Murdoch’s media companies, like Fox Corp. and News Corp., were urging House Republicans to support the measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hk3sNM"&gt;“These companies have maintained monopoly power in the online marketplace by using a variety of anticompetitive behaviors to stifle competition,” Buck said in a statement Friday. “Doing nothing is not an option, we must act now.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China’s Zhurong rover sends a selfie from Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The rover sits in the center of the photo, which is angled upward from the red martian surface. To its right is the landing platform.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6FB5ts"&gt;China has released new images from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436072/china-tianwen-1-mars-landing-zhurong-rover"&gt;Zhurong rover&lt;/a&gt;, which began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/22/22448781/china-drives-rover-mars-nasa-space"&gt;wheeling its way around Mars&lt;/a&gt; in late May. One of the photos is a lovely selfie of Zhurong posed next to its landing platform. The “touring group photo,” as the China National Space Administration calls it &lt;a href="http://www.cnsa.gov.cn/n6759533/c6812126/content.html"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, was taken with a small wireless camera that the rover placed on the surface before scooting back to line up for the shot like an excited parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaVjlc"&gt;Zhurong also took a photo of the landing platform by itself, showing the ramp the rover drove down, the Chinese flag, and if you look closely to the left of the flag, the mascots for the Beijing Winter Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A landing platform with a ramp coming down from it sits among a red-orange landscape." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eAvoYk-motHUdvdiSiPLZf3A0ys=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652883/zhurong_lander.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zhurong’s landing platform.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WjZ823"&gt;There are more photos in the Twitter thread below, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AJ_FI/status/1403224177218359303"&gt;linked here&lt;/a&gt;, including a panorama that shows the Red Planet’s horizon in the distance beyond the rover, along with marks on the surface from propellant expulsion during landing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hjCeke"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Cool panorama here from Zhurong, showing the fascinating horizon but also areas affected by the passivation of the landing platform (expelling remaining propellant to prevent explosion), to the north and south (also seen in the shots from Tianwen-1 &amp;amp; MRO from orbit). &lt;a href="https://t.co/M3HbkGS6P0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/M3HbkGS6P0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Andrew Jones (@AJ_FI) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AJ_FI/status/1403228155935182848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xMNNRW"&gt;Zhurong joined &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316093/nasas-perseverance-rover-first-drive-mars"&gt;NASA’s Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; on Mars last month (though the rovers are over a thousand miles apart), making China the second country to land and operate a rover on the planet. It’s expected to keep exploring for about 90 days, and it will capture more images while it analyzes the Martian climate and geology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dPmTmp"&gt;Perseverance also sent along some &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/say-cheese-on-mars-perseverance-s-selfie-with-ingenuity"&gt;glamour shots of its own&lt;/a&gt; in April, though it used a robotic arm (a selfie stick, if you will) rather than setting a camera down and backing away from it. This one is a family photo of both the rover and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424821/nasa-ingenuity-mars-perseverance-video-audio-helicopter"&gt;little helicopter companion&lt;/a&gt;, Ingenuity. NASA details how the selfie was made in &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8631/nasas-curiosity-mars-rover-takes-a-new-selfie-before-record-climb/"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; with videos.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Razer’s $100 Opus X headphones bring noise cancellation and a low-latency gaming mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Opus X" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pCh_cVKQSO4WeCV-xt2qW45fkBI=/0x0:5583x3722/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69440735/razer_opus_x_hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s new Opus X comes in three divisive colors&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ambd1H"&gt;Razer announced the Opus X, a new set of over-ear wireless headphones that offer active noise cancellation for just $100. Based on the small amount of differences and seemingly no major compromises compared to the pricier Opus headphones it launched last year, these could be a solid option if you have a little less money to spend on wireless headphones. &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-headsets%2FRazer-Opus-X%2FRZ04-03760300-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;It’s available to purchase now on Razer’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFjLBG"&gt;Overall, the design appears to be similar to the Opus. It’s tough to tell from images how build quality or materials might have changed given the price reduction. This model comes in one of three new colors — green, pink, and white — which are a bit louder and more divisive than the black or midnight blue colors of the standard Opus. The button layout has been crammed onto the rim of the right ear cup instead of splitting functions across both the left and right sides. The Opus X’s power button now handles cycling through active noise cancellation and the “Quick Attention” mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Opus X" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yWOo6gLcX6TxRzuu5jzyB669Acc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652861/opusx.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The polar opposite of going stealth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sd4V9o"&gt;The Opus X have rotating ear cups so you can rest them comfortably around your neck if you need to take them off. Though, this more affordable model lacks the feature that automatically pauses or plays your content upon removing or putting them back on. That’s one of the biggest omissions. As for what else hit the cutting room floor, there’s no 3.5mm jack — just a USB-C port — so you’ll need to connect these solely over Bluetooth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOkokg"&gt;There’s actually one feature that’s exclusive to the Opus X: Razer’s low-latency “Gaming Mode” that reduces the latency over Bluetooth to 60 milliseconds. We’ve seen this feature in other wireless headphones from Razer, like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22272549/razer-hammerhead-true-wireless-pro-review-specs-price"&gt;Hammerhead True Wireless Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmvswQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262459/razer-opus-review-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones-thx-over-ear-price-specs"&gt;I reviewed the Opus last year&lt;/a&gt; and they exceeded my expectations considering their original $200 price. They had surprisingly good sound quality, and the active noise cancellation is a perk you don’t often find at this price point (even better, they’ve fallen in price considerably since launch). They also impressed me in terms of battery life, and I was able to use them for an entire work week without recharging. The new Razer Opus X claim to have even better longevity with up to 40 hours of battery with noise cancellation off, or up to 30 hours with it on. If the Opus X sound nearly as good as the Opus, they could be a real winner.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Two Far Cry animated shows are coming to Netflix</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T1uGn4"&gt;Ubisoft and Netflix on Friday shared a first look at a new series based on &lt;em&gt;Far Cry&lt;/em&gt; and announced that &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; is set to debut on the streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdVg4l"&gt;One &lt;em&gt;Far Cry&lt;/em&gt; series is an anime based on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/30/4285712/far-cry-3-blood-dragon-hands-on"&gt;cyberpunk-themed &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;em&gt;Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/far-cry-anime-series-netflix-captain-laserhawk-a-blood-dragon-remix-1234994383/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; describes the show as&lt;/a&gt; “an original anime featuring alter egos of Ubisoft characters in a highly-referenced homage to the early 80s.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgHNl0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix&lt;/em&gt; has been given a six-episode order, according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;. You can get a look at it in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adishankarbrand/status/1403387378874601472"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adishankarbrand/status/1403387541978599429"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt; from creator and executive producer Adi Shankar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="lLoItm"&gt;In addition, Netflix announced that &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Far Cry&lt;/em&gt; series is in the works but didn’t share any details beyond the fact that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1403389020143505410"&gt;it’s in development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's your first look at the Splinter Cell animated series, an adaptation of the bestselling &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Ubisoft&lt;/a&gt; game. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Derek Kolstad, creator of the John Wick franchise, is onboard to write the series. &lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeekedWeek?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GeekedWeek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/c3vjJV0wfR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/c3vjJV0wfR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1403385940031254532?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="eXAsjS"&gt;The updates on Ubisoft and Netflix’s shows hit as part of Netflix’s Geeked Week event, which also included teasers of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22466235/netflix-the-cuphead-show-geeked-week-teaser-wayne-brady-king-dice"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cuphead Show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22515435/arcane-league-of-legends-show-trailer-netflix-geeked"&gt;animated &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;show &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. One thing Netflix and Ubisoft didn’t talk about was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536079/netflix-assassins-creed-live-action-series"&gt;upcoming live-action &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt;. Seems we’ll have to wait for more details on that show.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple admits why its own Files app was ranked first when users searched for competitor Dropbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GS-K3T8YZ5YQPqrOFrucrnVG1Xk=/0x0:1947x1298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69440655/apple_app_store_wwdc_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qdrjqi"&gt;In 2019, facing down extensive investigations &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-dominates-app-store-search-results-thwarting-competitors-11563897221?shareToken=st44e68b42ce5f45f5bd573dae5f8f0f5c"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/09/technology/apple-app-store-competition.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that showed Apple’s App Store clearly and consistently ranking its own apps ahead of competitors, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20707323/apple-app-store-apps-favor-own-competitors-search-results-deny"&gt;claimed it had done nothing wrong&lt;/a&gt; — a secret algorithm containing 42 different variables was working as intended, top executives told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, insisting that Apple doesn’t manually alter search results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0Q5kC"&gt;Why do I bring this up? An intriguing email chain has surfaced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt; where it sure looks like Apple did the exact opposite — seemingly admitting it manually boosted the ranking of its own Files app ahead of the competition for 11 entire months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z1mj2y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Who green lit putting the Files app above Dropbox in organic search results?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XUC3pE"&gt;“We are removing the manual boost and the search results should be more relevant now,” wrote Apple app search lead Debankur Naskar, after the company was confronted by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney over Apple’s Files app showing up first when searching for Dropbox. “Dropbox wasn’t even visible on the first page [of search results],” Sweeney wrote. You can read the whole email chain embedded a little ways below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0x5c0n"&gt;As you’ll see, Naskar suggested that Files had been &lt;em&gt;intentionally&lt;/em&gt; boosted for that exact search result during the “last WWDC.” That would have been WWDC 2017, nearly a year earlier, when the Files apps first debuted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUbFBh"&gt;The email chain actually reflects fairly well on Apple overall. Apple’s Matt Fischer (VP of the App Store) clearly objects to the idea at first. “[W]ho green lit putting the Files app above Dropbox in organic search results? I didn’t know we did that, and I don’t think we should,” he says. But he does end the conversation with “In the future, I want any similar requests to come to me for review/approval,” suggesting that he’s not entirely ruling out manual overrides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5WMd4u"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20805886-epic-v-apple-internal-email-chain-re-tim-sweeney-and-app-store-search/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="Epic v. Apple internal email chain re: Tim Sweeney and App Store search (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="990" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b9z2fE"&gt;But Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that what we think we’re seeing in these emails isn’t quite accurate. While Apple didn’t challenge the idea that Files was unfairly ranked over Dropbox, the company says the reality was a simple mistake: the Files app had a Dropbox integration, so Apple put “Dropbox” into the app’s metadata, and it was automatically ranked higher for “Dropbox” searches as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BE236b"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple manually boosts its first-party apps in search results? Funny, I feel like somebody testified under oath that that never happens &lt;a href="https://t.co/mTgnw8d8CK"&gt;https://t.co/mTgnw8d8CK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Troughton-Smith (@stroughtonsmith) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1401905981085343749?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CLrqtE"&gt;I’m slightly skeptical of that explanation — partially because it doesn’t line up with what Naskar suggests in the email, partially because Apple &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; told me it immediately fixed the error (despite it apparently continuing to exist for 11 months, hardly immediate), and partially because the company repeatedly ignored my questions about whether this has ever happened with other apps before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJqqIF"&gt;The most Apple would tell me is that it didn’t &lt;em&gt;manually&lt;/em&gt; boost Files over competitors, and that “we do not advantage our apps over those of any developer or competitor” as a general rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="220iuT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Best case, Apple didn’t notice it was giving itself an unfair advantage until another CEO pointed it out&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CbOYWR"&gt;But honestly, it may not matter whether Apple &lt;em&gt;manually&lt;/em&gt; boosted its own apps or not. What matters is the result: for 11 months, Apple’s new Files app owned exact searches for its competitor Dropbox, a company &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-once-vowed-to-kill-dropbox-now-its-worth-2013-11"&gt;Steve Jobs reportedly swore he would kill off&lt;/a&gt;, and it took the CEO of a prominent Apple partner emailing the company before Apple did something about it. And based on &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s investigation, Apple may not have done much: the Files app still ranked #1 in the App Store for cloud storage in June 2018, a month after this email chain was resolved, according to an infographic that accompanied &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-dominates-app-store-search-results-thwarting-competitors-11563897221?shareToken=st44e68b42ce5f45f5bd573dae5f8f0f5c"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJYQuX"&gt;Besides, the distinction between a “manual” boost and any other kind of boost may be purely academic. Algorithms are written by people, after all. If Apple can build a 42-factor algorithm that gives its own apps favorable results, why would it need to override that algorithm and risk its emails getting caught up in a lawsuit years from now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqVtQu"&gt;It could just tweak that algorithm at will — which is exactly what it did to resolve the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; NYT&lt;/em&gt;’s scrutiny two years ago. It only took a single engineer to change the algorithm in July 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/09/technology/apple-app-store-competition.html"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple’s own apps immediately fell in App Store rankings. But that time, executives said the previous formula wasn’t a mistake. Apple simply wanted to make it look less like its own apps were getting special treatment. So it “improved” the algorithm to achieve the new result it wanted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHf6Te"&gt;Apple provided this statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Vr2d2K"&gt;We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for all developers. App Store Search has only one goal — to get customers what they are looking for. We do that in a way that is fair to all developers and we do not advantage our apps over those of any developer or competitor. Today, developers have many options for distributing their apps and that’s why we work hard to make it easy, fair and a great opportunity for them to develop apps for our customers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>McDonald’s suffers data breach in the US, South Korea, and Taiwan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="INDONESIA-SKOREA-FOOD" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k5ER0XCeH1VBGNS52Mz5cn88Jp0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69440605/1233351203.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KJxIZB"&gt;The fast food mega chain McDonald’s is the latest company to have private data stolen by a third party, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcdonalds-hit-by-data-breach-in-south-korea-taiwan-11623412800?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other recent attacks on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446388/cna-insurance-ransomware-attack-40-million-dollar-ransom"&gt;CNA Financial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;the Colonial Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, McDonald’s claims it isn’t dealing with ransomware, but store information in the US was taken, along with some customer information in South Korea and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DACLL"&gt;The company discovered the data breach after hiring consultants to “investigate unauthorized activity on an internal security system” McDonald’s tells the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;. In the US, the data accessed included business contact information for franchises, the seating capacity of stores, and the square footage of play areas. The South Korean and Taiwanese arms of McDonald’s “had customer personal data accessed” and the company “will be taking steps to notify regulators and customers listed in these files,” the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;McDonald’s stressed that “no customer payment information was contained in these files.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QClik"&gt;McDonald’s says business operations were not interrupted by the data breach and “in the coming days, a few additional markets will take steps to address files that contained employee personal data.” &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;writes these other markets include South Africa and Russia, which were both flagged in the security consultants’ initial investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56eR2Y"&gt;A breach of non-payment data from a restaurant chain like McDonald’s is not as catastrophic as someone swiping credit cards or shutting down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463621/jbs-cyberattack-russia-largest-meat-supplier"&gt;one of the world’s largest beef suppliers&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s yet another example of how large corporations also make large, frequently easy targets for hackers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s an incredibly brief first tease of The Witcher season 2 on Netflix</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Witcher" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g0H3iHXjTu9BZXUKNbvzJICXmGY=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69440495/Witcher_108_Unit_03151_RT.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YmEjzO"&gt;Geralt of Rivia is coming back, and you can get the first look at &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;’s second season in the incredibly brief clip below. It’s focused primarily on Ciri, though it appears there are some secrets hidden in the teaser. You may want to watch it a few times to catch everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8ZNBU3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Lost in the woods no more. Meet Ciri in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheWitcher?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TheWitcher&lt;/a&gt; Season 2. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeekedWeek?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GeekedWeek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/zIweEHxtYw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zIweEHxtYw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1403389722857132038?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kjfzRi"&gt;Based on the novels by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;the first season of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; proved to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075927/netflix-the-witcher-viewer-numbers-length-metrics-q4-2019-earnings"&gt;one of Netflix’s biggest hits&lt;/a&gt; when it released at the end of 2019. (It also helped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21043014/netflix-the-witcher-3-henry-cavill-game-steam-twitch"&gt;reinvigorate the &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; video game&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21076980/toss-a-coin-to-your-witcher-stream-spotify-apple-music-netflix-soundtrack"&gt;spawned a viral song&lt;/a&gt;.) Since then, the streaming service has gone about expanding the fantasy universe. In addition to a second season of the main show, there’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21340050/netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-live-action-prequel-announced"&gt;a live-action spinoff set 1,200 years before Geralt’s time&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21077253/witcher-netflix-anime-korean-studio-mir-henry-cavill-live-action-show"&gt;an upcoming anime called &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3CvPU"&gt;Filming of season 2 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/witchernetflix/status/1377971770964242435"&gt;wrapped up in April&lt;/a&gt;. The news was announced as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22448313/netflix-geeked-week-event-the-witcher-sandman-cuphead-resident-evil"&gt;the first week-long Netflix Geeked event&lt;/a&gt;. More info on the show is coming July 9th at an event called Witchercon, helmed by both Netflix and developer CD Projekt Red.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the first teaser for Netflix’s gorgeous Cuphead show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vPDs2QWM2PH4Nwz4GxrGAC57vJE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69440344/Screen_Shot_2021_06_11_at_9.09.41_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;King Dice, voiced by Wayne Brady, in&lt;/em&gt; The Cuphead Show. | Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9rhiP2"&gt;Netflix showed off a brief teaser of its upcoming show based on the game &lt;em&gt;Cuphead &lt;/em&gt;at its Geeked Week event on Friday&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; and just as you’d expect, the game’s old-school animation style looks to translate perfectly into an animated series. Netflix also announced that Wayne Brady will voice the dastardly King Dice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcSnxl"&gt;You can check out the clip, which features Brady’s King Dice, in the video above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0xScZ"&gt;Studio MDHR, developer of the &lt;em&gt;Cuphead&lt;/em&gt; game, first announced that &lt;em&gt;The Cuphead Show&lt;/em&gt; was in the works nearly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687439/cuphead-netflix-cartoon-studio-mdhr-animation"&gt;two years ago&lt;/a&gt;. “Witness the wondrous Inkwell Isles as you’ve never seen them before in an original series inspired by classic animation styles of the 1930s,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StudioMDHR/status/1148577617873920000"&gt;Studio MDHR said in a tweet at the time&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvojbu"&gt;The animation in this teaser looks fantastic, and I think that Brady will be a perfect fit for the role of King Dice. We still don’t know when the show is coming out, but after this clip and the reveal of Brady’s casting, I’m even more excited than I was before. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dhKDV9"&gt;The sprawling fantasy realm of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; is expanding in a big way. At its Netflix Geeked Week, the streaming service showed off a new two-minute clip for &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;, the first animated series set in the world of Riot’s popular strategy game. The show has been in the works for some time: it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915338/league-of-legends-animated-series-fighting-game-cards-arcane-runeterra-project-l-trailers"&gt;first revealed in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417254/league-of-legends-animated-series-arcane-netflix"&gt;earlier this year, Netflix confirmed its partnership with Riot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVjVE8"&gt;According to Riot, the new show is “set in the utopian region of Piltover and the oppressed underground of Zaun, the story follows the origins of two iconic &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; champions-and the power that will tear them apart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXJDYF"&gt;While this is Riot’s first foray into television, &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; is part of a bigger plan to turn &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; into an MCU-style behemoth spanning multiple mediums. There are the games, of course (in addition to the main &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, there’s also a card-collecting spinoff, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358213/league-of-legends-wild-rift-iphone-android-preview"&gt;a recently launched mobile iteration called &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22187980/riot-games-league-of-legends-mmo-greg-street"&gt;a much-anticipated MMO&lt;/a&gt;), along with comic books, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408504/league-of-legends-tellstones-board-game-spinoff"&gt;board games&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336218/league-of-legends-yone-anime-cinematic-riot-games"&gt;shorter cinematics&lt;/a&gt; to introduce new characters or story elements.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tpTQ4Y"&gt;EA released a free next-gen update for&lt;em&gt; Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/em&gt; on Friday, and the announcement comes with good news for people who own a physical copy of the game but have a discless next-gen console: EA will let you convert your physical copy to a digital one so you can take advantage of the upgrade, &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi-fallen-order/news/next-gen-release-details"&gt;the company says in an FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOtDhP"&gt;If you want to upgrade your disc version to digital, &lt;a href="https://help.ea.com/en/contact-us/?product=star-wars-jedi-fallen-order"&gt;click this link to EA’s support website&lt;/a&gt;. If you click on the Digital Edition PS5 or Xbox Series S icons, then “Codes and promotions,” then “Replace disc with code,” then “Select Contact Option,” you’ll be taken to a form to fill out to request your digital code. The form says an EA support representative will email you within 72 hours after you fill it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zw9Pxo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're proud to announce that the next-gen upgrade of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StarWarsJediFallenOrder?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StarWarsJediFallenOrder&lt;/a&gt; is available starting today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get it now on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Already own a copy of the game on console? Your next-gen upgrade is free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Full details: &lt;a href="https://t.co/5dr52XgSvO"&gt;https://t.co/5dr52XgSvO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/sTRJGy2zu9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/sTRJGy2zu9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Respawn (@Respawn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1403353463443034116?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hy44kF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/em&gt;’s next-gen update adds 4K / HDR resolution, improved 60fps performance, and “significantly faster” loading speeds, according to EA. It also adds a performance mode on PS5 and Xbox Series X that runs at a 1440p resolution and 60fps — when turned off, the game runs at a 4K resolution at 30fps. Those options might be disappointing for players who were hoping for a way to play in 4K &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; 60fps on next-gen consoles. And Xbox Series S players won’t be able to pick from either mode; the Series S version of the game will be capped at 1080p / 60fps, EA says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GC3QZq"&gt;You’ll also be able to transfer your saves, and if you do that, unlocked trophies and achievements will carry over, too. &lt;/p&gt;
