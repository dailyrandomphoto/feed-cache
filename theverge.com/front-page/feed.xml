    <title>Some Halo Infinite players have to use dev kits at first major tournament</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bmh97L"&gt;Microsoft is apparently having just as much trouble procuring Xbox consoles as everyone else, as some of the players at the first major &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; tournament in Raleigh, North Carolina are forced to play on Xbox Series X development kits (via &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/continued-xbox-shortages-force-microsoft-to-use-dev-kit-1848240181"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Game dev kits consist of hardware that developers use to create games and typically aren’t available to the public, let alone used at official gaming tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LChZ3C"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Heads up open bracket players - you'll be playing this weekend on Series X development consoles. They're functionally identical and will be operating in "Retail" mode so it's the exact same experience, they just look a little different.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why? Global supply chain shortage is real.&lt;/p&gt;— Tashi (@Tashi343i) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tashi343i/status/1471183177620373511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2uTzui"&gt;Tahir Hasandjekic, the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; esports and viewership lead at 343 Industries sent out a tweet before the start of the tournament, warning some players that they’ll have to play on Xbox Series X dev kits instead of the real thing. He notes that the dev kits are “functionally identical and will be operating in ‘Retail’ mode.” Players will still get the “exact same experience” as others playing on the standard console, but the hardware will obviously look a lot different. As for the reason behind the use of dev kits, Hasandjekic bluntly explains that the “global supply chain shortage is real.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kfzKAZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;The chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; has made it difficult to find everything from PC parts, gaming consoles, vehicles, and even household appliances. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/12/13/22833362/apple-eddy-cue-xbox-help-twitter-stock-alerts"&gt;Xbox boss Phil Spencer said&lt;/a&gt; that supply chain constraints could last well into next year. It’s gotten so bad that not only is Microsoft struggling to get enough of its own consoles, but even Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services, can’t seem to get his hands on a new Xbox either. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/12/13/22833362/apple-eddy-cue-xbox-help-twitter-stock-alerts"&gt;Cue resorted to following @XboxStockAlerts&lt;/a&gt;, a Twitter account that posts about Xbox console restocks, proving that even having the highest of connections can’t guarantee you access to the console.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AI Dungeon’s creators are launching an experimental AI-powered game platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Medieval Problems, one of Voyage’s games" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/siYbCD-DU0y-4errQcAIHOR9Tag=/0x84:2346x1648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70293888/Latitude___Midieval_Problems.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Latitude&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1sNzY3"&gt;Latitude, the startup behind text game &lt;em&gt;AI Dungeon&lt;/em&gt;, is expanding into a new artificial intelligence-powered game platform called Voyage. The company announced the closed beta on Friday, &lt;a href="https://voyage.latitude.io/"&gt;opening a waitlist&lt;/a&gt; for current &lt;em&gt;AI Dungeon&lt;/em&gt; users. It’s the next step for a company that began with a university hackathon project, but that ultimately hopes to help other people create their own games using trained AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKLdYY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI Dungeon, &lt;/em&gt;which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/12/6/20998993/ai-dungeon-2-choose-your-own-adventure-game-text-nick-walton-gpt-machine-learning"&gt;launched as &lt;em&gt;AI Dungeon 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, is powered by OpenAI’s GPT-2 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential"&gt;GPT-3 text generation algorithms&lt;/a&gt;. To start, you generate some introductory text or write your own adventure setup. Then you can enter any command you want and a &lt;em&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&lt;/em&gt;-style virtual game master will improvise some text describing the outcome. It’s very weird and a lot of fun, but it’s light on traditional game mechanics — more like an interactive fiction engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zuOeDA"&gt;Voyage features more structured games. There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12585648/reigns-smartphone-rpg-iphone-android-tinder"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reigns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-inspired experiment called &lt;em&gt;Medieval Problems&lt;/em&gt;, where you’re the ruler of a kingdom and enter freeform text commands for your advisors, then see the outcome reflected in success ratings. It’s still a lot like &lt;em&gt;AI Dungeon&lt;/em&gt;, but with a clearer framing for what you’re supposed to do and a system for evaluating success — although after playing with the game, that system seems pretty forgiving and more than a bit random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An image from the party game Pixel This" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fv0kAnhvv6rsPMrpZlEqspDCreI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23112781/pixel_this.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;An image from the party game Pixel This&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A2GOlJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixel This&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, is a party game where one person enters a phrase, the AI generates a pixelated picture of it, and that image slowly increases in resolution until another player guesses it. It’s a bit like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820106/ai-art-app-dream-synthetic-media-wombo"&gt;the art app &lt;em&gt;Dream&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; paired with a &lt;em&gt;Pictionary&lt;/em&gt;-style mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5E1cb"&gt;Latitude CEO Nick Walton describes Voyage as a natural evolution for Latitude. For the company, “AI games are kind of restarting at the beginning” — with text adventures reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Colossal Cave Adventure. &lt;/em&gt;“Now we’re moving into 2D images where you’ve got some level of visuals in.” &lt;em&gt;AI Dungeon, &lt;/em&gt;which is included in Voyage, recently &lt;a href="https://latitude.io/blog/ai-dungeon-2d"&gt;added AI-produced pictures&lt;/a&gt; created with the &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2021/12/01/the-incredible-pixray-will-draw-whatever-you-tell-it-to/?sh=38d7b23e237d"&gt;Pixray image generator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFTti5"&gt;The eventual goal is to add game creation tools, not just games, to Voyage. “Our long-term vision is enabling creators to make things that are dynamic and alive in a way that existing experiences aren’t, and also be able to create things that would have taken studios of a hundred people in the past,” says Walton. There’s no precise roadmap, but Latitude plans to spend the first half of next year working on the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k8Xp9L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Latitude hopes to add game creation tools, not just more games&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n11NyM"&gt;Creative tools could help Voyage find a long-term business plan. &lt;em&gt;AI Dungeon&lt;/em&gt; is currently free for a set of features powered by GPT-2 and subscription-based for access to the higher-quality GPT-3 algorithm. Following the Voyage beta, Latitude plans to introduce a subscription for it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UdCZKG"&gt;But Voyage’s new games don’t yet have the versatility or replayability of &lt;em&gt;AI Dungeon — &lt;/em&gt;they’re still clearly the products of a company trying to crack games based on machine learning. “This approach is one of the things that I think is going to be really beneficial in terms of being able to iterate and find out what experiences people enjoy,” Walton says. “With traditional games, you can kind of take existing models and create a game that you’re pretty sure people will enjoy. But this space is so different, and it’s hard to necessarily know.” The question is how much people will want to pay to be part of that process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2VRiz"&gt;As Latitude’s mission expands, it will likely need to exercise caution with OpenAI’s application programming interface (API). The organization approves GPT-3 projects on an individual basis, and projects must adhere to content guidelines intended to prevent misuse. Latitude has struggled with these restrictions in the past, since &lt;em&gt;AI Dungeon&lt;/em&gt; gives users a lot of freedom to shape their own stories — resulting in &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-fueled-dungeon-game-got-much-darker/"&gt;some users creating&lt;/a&gt; disturbing sexual scenarios that alarmed OpenAI. (It’s also dealt with &lt;a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2021/09/ai-dungeon-latitude-data-breach/"&gt;security issues&lt;/a&gt; around user commands.) The startup spent months working on filter systems that accidentally blocked more innocuous fictional content before striking a deal where &lt;a href="https://latitude.io/blog/a-new-story-experience"&gt;some user commands would be sent&lt;/a&gt; to a non-OpenAI algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="5MC0jN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you try and make something super serious with AI ... it’s going to have a hard time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L8yoCb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixel This&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Medieval Problems&lt;/em&gt; are more closed systems with fewer obvious moderation risks, but introducing creative tools risks chipping away at OpenAI’s control of GPT-3, which may pose its own set of issues. Walton says that over time, Latitude hopes to shift more of its games onto other algorithms. “We will have some more structure and systems so that it’s not just directly consuming the [OpenAI] API in the same way. And at the same time, I think most of our models will probably be ones that we host ourselves,” he says. That includes models based on emerging open source projects — which have had trouble competing with OpenAI’s work but have advanced since their early days. “I don’t think that gap will be around that long,” says Walton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rm5pY9"&gt;Lots of games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22807568/procedural-storytelling-video-games-dwarf-fortress-wildermyth-blaseball"&gt;use procedural generation&lt;/a&gt; that remixes developer-created building blocks to create huge quantities of content, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/6/18222203/video-game-ai-future-procedural-generation-deep-learning"&gt;most video game “AI”&lt;/a&gt; is a comparatively simple set of instructions. A company like Latitude&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;by contrast, uses algorithms that are trained to produce text or images fitting a pattern from a data set. (Think of them as super-advanced autocomplete systems.) Right now that can make the resulting experiences highly unpredictable, and their absurdity is often part of their charm — outside gaming, other companies like NovelAI have also harnessed text generation for creative work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="of54DA"&gt;But Latitude is still figuring out how to make systems where players can expect fair and consistent outcomes. Text generation algorithms don’t have any built-in sense of whether an action succeeds or fails, for instance, and systems for making those judgments may not agree with normal human intuition. Image generation algorithms are great for producing weird art, but in a game like &lt;em&gt;Pixel This&lt;/em&gt;, players can’t necessarily predict how recognizable a given picture will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwVmPy"&gt;For now, Latitude’s solution is to lean into the chaos. “If you try and make something super serious with AI where people are going to expect to have a high level of coherence, it’s going to have a hard time, at least until the technology gets better,” Walton says. “But if you kind of embrace that aspect of it and kind of let it be crazier and wacky, then I think you make a fun experience and people get delighted by those surprises.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s new RTX 2050 laptop GPU could potentially power more affordable laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FJiGfWM-MXDmWEC0hUJnstj3Iqc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70292246/acastro_180529_1777_nvidia_0001.0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZfgfsM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fgeforce-rtx-laptop-new-options%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F18%2F22844091%2Fnvidia-rtx-2050-laptop-gpu-chip-shortage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nvidia’s upcoming RTX 2050&lt;/a&gt; laptop GPUs don’t sound “new” at all, considering that the company already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423474/nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-60fps-gaming-laptops-features-specs-performance-price"&gt;released the RTX 3050 and 3050 Ti GPUs&lt;/a&gt; for laptops earlier this year (via &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-introduces-geforce-rtx-2050-mx570-and-m550-laptop-gpus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VideoCardz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). But it’s clear that Nvidia isn’t ready to retire its 20 series GPUs just yet — Nvidia says that the RTX 2050 will be available in laptops starting in the spring of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zRqVjY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The RTX 2050 is based on Ampere GA107 architecture, not Turing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uOLWhB"&gt;The RTX 2050 isn’t just a piece of old hardware brought back from the dead. Unlike other 20 series chips, the RTX 2050 is based on Ampere GA107 architecture, not Turing. Ampere is the same architecture that the RTX 3050 (and all other 30 series cards) is powered by, and packaging it within a 20-series card could potentially offer some of the same ray-tracing improvements at a cheaper price. The RTX 2050 comes with the same 2,048 CUDA cores and 4GB of GDDR6 memory that the RTX 3050 has. However, it offers a 64-bit memory bus when compared to the RTX 3050’s 128-bit, potentially leading to a bit of a downgrade in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Gjvex"&gt;While it’s possible that Nvidia is releasing a GPU that doesn’t belong to the latest and greatest 30 series due to the ongoing chip shortage, the move may also come as a way to provide a middle ground between the RTX 3050 and the RTX 1650. Nvidia might want a mid-range GPU that offers a boost in performance over the RTX 1650, but is still more affordable when compared to devices that carry the RTX 3050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LlgRB9"&gt;In addition to the RTX 2050, Nvidia also announced the entry-level MX550 and MX570 laptop chips, but the company hasn’t provided many details about their specs. Nvidia vaguely mentions “more CUDA Cores” and “faster memory speeds” with no solid numbers to back it up just yet. All this comes about two weeks after Nvidia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812618/nvidia-new-rtx-2060-12gb-vram-graphics-card-gpu-release-date-price"&gt;released a new version of the RTX 2060&lt;/a&gt; —which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/7/18171616/nvidia-rtx-2060-gpu-349-ray-tracing-budget-entry-level-ces-2019"&gt;originally launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; — that offers an upgrade of 12GB of video RAM when compared to the 6GB of VRAM that the standard model comes with.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Appstore update is supposed to fix issues with Android 12</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h6DQ6Li6F-1mU3tdaL-OVAwHcHE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70291801/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wYqMbA"&gt;Amazon has finally rolled out an update for its Appstore, and it’s supposed to fix the issues that have been plaguing Android 12 users for over a month (via &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fixes-android-12-appstore-231954404.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). After users downloaded Android 12, they noticed that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811710/amazon-android-12-appstore-drm-issues"&gt;Amazon Appstore wasn’t functioning correctly&lt;/a&gt;, an issue likely caused by the lack of compatibility between Amazon’s built-in DRM and the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PL45mh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The fix doesn’t seem to solve the problem for everyone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YAvaTO"&gt;In an update on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D56Q000087E2wvSAC/amazon-appstore-not-working-after-android-12-update"&gt;Amazon support forum&lt;/a&gt; where the issue first came to light, an Amazon staff member notes that the technical team has issued an update to address the issue between the Appstore and Android 12. He says that you can download the update from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/get-appstore/android"&gt;Amazon’s website&lt;/a&gt;, and that you should sign out and sign in of the Appstore after installing the update. You’ll then have to update any apps that you’ve downloaded by opening the Amazon Appstore, heading to “My Apps,” and then hitting “Updates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VSWOy0"&gt;However, this fix doesn’t seem to solve the problem for everyone. Some users on the forum say that they are still experiencing issues following the update. While a couple of different users complain that all of their apps still aren’t appearing on the store, another user reports that they’re getting compatibility errors when trying to open a single app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="diLw3e"&gt;“We are contacting customers with steps to update their Appstore experience,” said Amazon spokesperson Troy Edwards in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We are sorry for any disruption this has caused.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uA4bKW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 18th 6:45PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to add a statement from an Amazon spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM starts delivering electric Hummer pickup trucks to customers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pwovvWKUymwYJ2RUb53obNlZlJE=/168x88:1112x717/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70291570/gm_hummer_ev_pickup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jeffrey Sauger for General Motor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rbmOLe"&gt;GM has officially started sending its Hummer EV Edition 1 pickup trucks out of the factory and into the driveways of customers, according to a &lt;a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/dec/1217-electric.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s website. Built on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;Ultium platform&lt;/a&gt;, the Hummer EV Edition 1 model comes with a hefty $110,295 price tag, along with up to 1,000 horsepower, 11,500 lb-ft of torque, and an estimated 329-mile range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBqIcF"&gt;Features unique to the vehicle include “CrabWalk,” a mode that enables the truck to drive diagonally at low speeds by pivoting the rear and front wheels at the same angle. Another feature increases the height of the truck’s suspension by six inches, potentially allowing the truck to clear large rocks or water when off-roading — in the fine print, &lt;a href="https://media.gmc.com/media/us/en/gmc/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/dec/1217-hummer.html"&gt;GM says&lt;/a&gt; that this feature won’t come with 2022 Edition 1 models, but it will be available via a free software update and will come standard in any models produced in 2023 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ff8kLd"&gt;The Hummer EV Edition 1 also has a performance setting that lets you harness the electric propulsion system’s full power, which GM claims can send the vehicle from zero to 60 in about three seconds. It comes with Super Cruise as well, giving you a hands-free driving experience and enabling automatic lane changing on compatible roads. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701086/cadillac-super-cruise-2022-escalade-semiconductor-shortage"&gt;Super Cruise was temporarily discontinued&lt;/a&gt; on the 2022 Cadillac Escalade due to the chip shortage, but it doesn’t appear that the Edition 1 is affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZmLeU"&gt;The Hummer EV Edition 1 model has since been sold out, but there are other trims still available for preorder. The Hummer EV 3X is set to become available in the fall of next year, and will cost $99,995. It will come with an estimated range of over 300 miles and three motors producing 830HP and up to 11,500 lb-ft of torque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8atEq"&gt;Meanwhile, the 625HP Hummer EV 2X will cost $89,995, comes with two motors, and will be available in the spring of 2023. It will last an estimated 300 miles on a single charge, and will produce 7,400 lb-ft of torque. Finally, the cheapest of the bunch — the Hummer EV 2 — also has two motors and produces the same 625HP and 7,400 lb-ft of torque. GM plans to release it for $79,995 in the spring of 2024, with a range of over 250 miles on a full charge. You can view the full rundown of trims &lt;a href="https://www.gmc.com/electric/hummer-ev/pickup-trucks"&gt;on GM’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The first of its kind was &lt;a href="https://www.gmc.com/electric/hummer-ev/insider/barrett-jackson-auction"&gt;auctioned off for $2.5 million during an auction in March&lt;/a&gt;, with all of the proceeds going towards the Tunnel to Towers Foundation, a charity that helps wounded veterans. GM also announced that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22839470/fedex-gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-van-ev600"&gt;started shipping out the BrightDrop EV600&lt;/a&gt; to FedEx, a commercial delivery vehicle that’s built on the Ultium platform as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can save $10 on any game over $15 during Epic Games’ Winter Sale</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bmEZlu34gR5UOWY0_E119Gua6Ug=/0x23:1270x870/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70291393/Screenshot_2021_12_17_152300.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now through January 6th, Epic Games is slashing prices on titles new and old.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CabhAX"&gt;This weekend, you can be sure that much of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff will be adding to their pile of PC shame. &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/"&gt;The Epic Games Store has officially kicked off its annual Winter Sale&lt;/a&gt;, bringing sizable discounts on fresh titles like &lt;em&gt;Jurassic World Evolution 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;. What’s really cool though, is that Epic is discounting any title that’s more than $14.99 by an additional $10. And don’t sweat it too much if you’re having a tough time figuring out what to buy, as the sale will be running until January 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NkWFK9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Still need a Christmas gift? We’ve rounded up a few digital options to consider","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22834542/digital-holiday-gift-ideas-last-minute-online-subscriptions-2021"},{"title":"Here are 65 last-minute gifts that will arrive in time for the holidays","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22840189/christmas-gifts-best-last-minute-tech-gaming-gadgets-shipping"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="tax8IJ"&gt;Regularly $49.99, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B086PJKVVT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can currently grab&lt;/a&gt; the Logitech G305 Lightspeed in a variety of colors at Amazon for $29.99. This discount isn’t out of the ordinary, but it's pretty difficult to find a wireless gaming mouse with these specs for this price. In addition to a standard black or white model, the Logitech G305 is also available in purple, blue, green, or teal, making it easy to coordinate colors with the rest of your setup. Weighing just 99 grams and powered by a single AA battery, the G305 can reportedly last for up to 240 hours. It also pairs a 12K DPI sensor with six programmable buttons, allowing for excellent gaming performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DWZcGx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10821865"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bSGpzY"&gt;If you’re looking to ramp up your home theater system, Polk Audio’s MagniFi Max features a pair of wireless satellite speakers and a dedicated subwoofer that might do the trick. Typically $599.99, the 5.1 system is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-Surround-Performance-Subwoofer/dp/B0753ZLK2H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently discounted at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgd5GhM3ND7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy to just shy of $500&lt;/a&gt;, one of its lowest prices to date. This 43-inch soundbar is a solid option for anyone with several consoles or other HDMI-compatible devices, thanks to its trio of HDMI ports and support for HDMI ARC. This model also features Bluetooth connectivity — as well as a 3.5mm port and an optical connection — along with a built-in Chromecast and support for Google Assistant, allowing you to pair it with other Google-compatible devices in your home and control it using voice commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FlNVaB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10936678"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ezDyQe"&gt;Normally $149.99, Amazon is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YPC3BQC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering the Razer Viper Ultimate and its RGB charging dock for just $92.97&lt;/a&gt;. This isn’t quite the lowest price we’ve seen for this ambidextrous gaming mouse going for, but it’s still a solid deal if you’re in need of a wireless mouse. The Viper Ultimate comes equipped with a 20K DPI sensor and eight programmable buttons. It can also last up to 70 hours between charges and the charging dock is compatible with other wireless Razer mice, including the Basilisk Ultimate and DeathAdder V2 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MdUjcs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10456097"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The base model comes equipped with an Intel Core i5, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, and while it would normally cost $1,099, it's currently discounted to just $899.99. This is a solid deal on what reviewer Monica Chin called “the best Surface Pro we’ve seen in years.” Just note that while all the current configurations of the Surface Pro 8 are discounted, some models are only receiving a price cut of $100 or $150. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22709876/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KT2K4m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10771697"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pqxtgK"&gt;The Corsair K60 RGB Pro is a keyboard with everything you need, and nothing you don’t. Normally, you’d expect to pay $89.99 for this solid bit of kit, but you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Key/dp/B08L61WLW7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently find it at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1221034/2092?subId1=VergeDailyDealPost121821&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fcorsair-k60-rgb-pro-gaming-keyboard-for-pc%2F-%2FA-80110499%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target for $69.99&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The K60 features per-key RGB lighting and linear switches but omits the dedicated volume and media controls often found on other Corsair models to help save space. Amazon’s $20 discount also currently applies to the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Key/dp/B08N5DTKDW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$79.99 K60 RGB Pro SE&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a magnetic wrist rest and PBT double-shot keycaps to cut down on fingerprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E3r1r1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10936897"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>WSJ’s deep dive into eating disorder rabbit holes on TikTok explains a sudden policy change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4-0XGlX8nQgHa0YYdID1OLGr4WA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70291285/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tKFPaC"&gt;A troubling report from the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-tiktok-inundates-teens-with-eating-disorder-videos-11639754848"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; digs into the personal experiences of young girls who were sent down rabbit holes of extreme weight loss challenges, purging techniques, and deadly diets through TikTok, contributing to the development of eating disorders, or making existing ones worse. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; did its own experiment to see how TikTok’s algorithm can potentially promote this kind of harmful content — its findings may explain TikTok’s sudden decision to alter the way its video recommendation system operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNn6ve"&gt;As detailed in the report, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; created over 100 accounts “that browsed the app with little human intervention,” 12 of which were bots registered to 13-year-olds that spent time on videos surrounding weight loss, alcohol, and gambling. A chart included in the report shows that as soon as one of the bots abruptly stopped watching gambling-related videos and began spending time on videos about weight loss instead, TikTok’s algorithm adjusted itself accordingly; it quickly increased the number of weight loss videos that the bot saw to account for this shift in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iR9cKJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“While this experiment does not reflect the experience most people have on TikTok, even one person having that experience is one too many”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mLz4L5"&gt;By the end of its experiment, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;found that of the 255,000 videos that the bots watched in total, 32,700 of those contained a description or metadata that matched a list of hundreds of keywords pertaining to weight loss. 11,615 videos had text descriptions that matched keywords relevant to eating disorders, while 4,402 had a combination of keywords that indicated the normalization of eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fX0m49"&gt;A number of these videos were reportedly using different spellings for eating disorder-related keywords to avoid getting flagged by TikTok. After the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; alerted the platform to a sample of 2,960 eating disorder-related videos, 1,778 were removed — the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; says it’s unclear whether it was taken down by TikTok or the creators themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krAGQE"&gt;Just one day before the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s report dropped, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/an-update-on-our-work-to-safeguard-and-diversify-recommendations"&gt;TikTok announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s working on new ways to stop these dangerous rabbit holes from forming. This change also occurred just days after the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; says it contacted TikTok for a statement about its upcoming story, so it’s possible that TikTok preemptively rolled out the update before the report was published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFuc4D"&gt;In its post, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22839453/tiktok-for-you-recommendations-harmful-content-fyp"&gt;TikTok acknowledges&lt;/a&gt; that it isn’t always healthy to view certain kinds of content over and over again, including videos related to extreme dieting and fitness. It’s now working on a way to recognize whether its recommendation system is unintentionally serving up videos that may not break TikTok’s policies, but could be harmful if consumed excessively. The platform also says it’s testing a tool that will let users stop videos containing certain words or hashtags from showing up on their For You page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pzLmB"&gt;“While this experiment does not reflect the experience most people have on TikTok, even one person having that experience is one too many,” said TikTok spokesperson, Jamie Favazza, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We allow educational or recovery-oriented content because we understand it can help people see there’s hope, but content that promotes, normalizes, or glorifies disordered eating, is prohibited.” The spokesperson also pointed out that TikTok provides access to the National Eating Disorder Association Hotline within the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="amxJ8C"&gt;If this situation seems familiar to you, it’s because Instagram has already been through it (and is still dealing with it). After whistleblower &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity"&gt;Francis Haugen leaked the Facebook Papers&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of revealing internal Facebook documents, Instagram worked quickly to patch the holes in its sinking ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv8HG9"&gt;The papers show that Facebook did its own research on Instagram’s impact on teens, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;found that the app could wreak havoc on teens’ mental health&lt;/a&gt;, and also made young girls’ body image worse. About a month later, Instagram announced its plans to introduce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/10/22719545/instagram-introduce-take-a-break-nudge-teens-harmful-content-facebook"&gt;a feature that will “nudge” teens away&lt;/a&gt; from viewing potentially harmful content. It also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774827/instagram-take-a-break-feature-test-meta-facebook"&gt;rolled out a “take a break” feature&lt;/a&gt; that prompts users to close the app if they’ve spent a set amount of time on the platform, ranging from 10, 20, or 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BfObp9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"TikTok reveals some of the secrets, and blind spots, of its recommendation algorithm ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296044/tiktok-for-you-page-algorithm-sides-engagement-data-creators-trends-sounds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Ye’s Stem Player has soft skin and all of the lights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QrvpC4qjWQeqB8xZL1Pn9jimQUE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70290714/jpeters_211215_4935_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ye’s Stem Player was made in partnership with Kano Computing.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It’s a powerful and unconventional music device&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QJMGEJ"&gt;At one point in development, Kano Computing’s new music creation device was going to have finger holes. “‘God created man; man is God’s greatest technology,’” explained Ye, the artist &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-58965500"&gt;formerly known as Kanye West&lt;/a&gt;, as Kano CEO and co-founder Alex Klein remembers it. “So when we make technology, maybe it needs to be formed in our image.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjgMjV"&gt;The final product, the Stem Player, which Kano made in partnership with Ye, doesn’t have finger holes. But it is unconventional. It’s a weird music gadget that lets you listen to music and manipulate it in real-time — and even though the holes didn’t come to be, it does fit easily in one of your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K8ajRp"&gt;Kano’s device has no screen, meaning you listen and mess with music using a few buttons and four touch-sensitive “stems” on the device. Together, they can be used to manipulate the “stems” (different aspects of a track like the vocals or the drums) from songs off Ye’s album &lt;em&gt;Donda, &lt;/em&gt;which is pre-loaded on the device. Or, thanks to machine learning, it can pull off the same trick with any album you put on it.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These buttons on one edge have a satisfying give.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This small speaker gets surprisingly loud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tQsw25"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.stemplayer.com/"&gt;Stem Player&lt;/a&gt; came together over a few years. Klein says he and Ye first started working together ahead of the release of &lt;em&gt;Jesus is King&lt;/em&gt;, which came out in 2019. They apparently hammered out the idea of “what was then called an album device” in Ye’s Lamborghini one day. (Ye saw Klein on a walk to get falafel and told him to get in the car.) Things coalesced around the release of &lt;em&gt;Donda&lt;/em&gt; so that they could launch it alongside the album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYuotk"&gt;Turn the Stem Player on, and you’re greeted with a gentle vibration and four colored lights appearing on each of the stems. Press the button in the middle to play music — when I did so while writing this, the drum beats on “Hurricane” and The Weeknd’s soaring vocals filled my office. But if I want to hear &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; The Weeknd, all I have to do is “slide” the lights down three of the stems like I’m pushing sliders on a soundboard to fade out the other aspects of the song. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PGhhh0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’re not limited to manipulating one stem at a time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lwvjEx"&gt;You’re not limited to manipulating one stem at a time, either. I’ve used four fingers to adjust all of the stems simultaneously, and the Stem Player kept up with everything I did. (Though I definitely made the song sound much worse.) You can also make loops and add effects in real-time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5Q36P"&gt;The device is nice to hold and fun to play with. It’s also soft to the touch, which makes it stand out from the many other metal and plastic gadgets I interact with every day. Klein tells me the exterior is a “unique blend” made of “many different polymers,” and I believe him — the Stem Player doesn’t feel like anything I’ve ever held. (More than once, I’ve found myself idly playing with it in one hand while at my desk.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPzTCH"&gt;Since everything is in reach of your fingers, it’s easy to mess around with songs as you’re listening to them. Adding effects and making loops is less intuitive — I had to look up a tutorial on how. But messing with the stems is entertaining enough on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5pNgN"&gt;“We wanted it to be a device that you pick up, you feel it, you see the lights, you feel the vibrations, and it will give you this sense of well being and control, which I think is missing from a lot of screen-based devices today,” Klein said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpZYd2"&gt;That said, I haven’t felt pulled to listen to an entire album with the Stem Player in hand. Music for me is largely a background activity; I’ll often put on music while doing chores or while on a run, which aren’t exactly ideal times to also be messing with the Stem Player. But I would never claim to be a music producer — my music-playing experience consists largely of years of &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/cy0gmKbine8?t=55"&gt;marching band&lt;/a&gt; — so for someone who likes to make their own music, the Stem Player could be a mind-blowingly awesome tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="1Scb4U"&gt;“At the end of the day, there were so many directions it could go, and one thing that Ye always prizes and almost coaches me on, gives me good direction on, is to get things finished,” Klein said. “Finish things, put them out. There’s always things you can do to tweak and change them. A great work of art is never finished. Really, it’s abandoned.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV loses ESPN, other Disney networks after failing to reach new deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Disney Store In London" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KRQSZ8rsOJRkLGrBM4H92Yf8idM=/0x0:5123x3415/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70290174/1236794676.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IIpNoJ"&gt;YouTube TV has failed to reach an eleventh-hour deal with Disney to keep more than a dozen Disney-owned channels on the live TV streaming service. As of December 18th, popular networks including ESPN and ABC have been removed from the service. As promised, YouTube TV has dropped its subscription to $50 per month as a direct result of the lost programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RmJt1"&gt;Disney said in a statement late Friday that after ongoing negotiations with YouTube TV, “they have declined to reach a fair deal with us based on market terms and conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59idpb"&gt;“As a result, their subscribers have lost access to our unrivaled portfolio of networks including live sports and news plus kids, family and general entertainment programming from ABC, the ESPN networks, the Disney channels, Freeform, the FX networks and the National Geographic channels,” the company added. “We stand ready to reach an equitable agreement with Google as quickly as possible in order to minimize the inconvenience to YouTube TV viewers by restoring our networks. We hope Google will join us in that effort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yybvk"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-disney-programming-update/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube TV said it would “continue conversations with Disney to advocate on your behalf in hopes of restoring their content on YouTube TV.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SL1MYp"&gt;“We’ve held good faith negotiations with Disney for several months,” YouTube TV said. “Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we’ve been unable to reach an equitable agreement before our existing one expired, and their channels are no longer available on YouTube TV.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEBkGZ"&gt;The announcement follows a notice shared with subscribers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22833849/youtube-tv-disney-carrier-dispute-abc-news-espn-december-17"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; that the channels could vanish from YouTube TV on Friday, December 17th if a deal was not reached between the two companies. Should negotiations have failed, YouTube TV said it would lower its price by $15 a month from its normal price of $65 per month to compensate for the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68xPDf"&gt;Earlier this week, a positive resolution to the service loss seemed likely. For one, the service told subscribers in an email on Monday that the House of Mouse “is an important partner for us,” adding that it hoped to negotiate a deal with Disney “provided we can reach equitable terms.” But the companies failed to reach a deal as their current agreement lapsed after December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAjBqy"&gt;The loss of over a dozen channels doesn’t exactly help YouTube TV remain competitive against other internet cable services like Hulu with Live TV or Fubo TV. Not only are a dozen-plus channels getting wiped from service, but the list of Disney-owned properties that would be axed is extensive, including not only Disney channels but FX, ESPN, and National Geographic channels as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mt6lX8"&gt;The full list of channels that left because a deal was not reached include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="kSVKDl"&gt;Your local ABC channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gFaE4O"&gt;ABC News Live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="72HTNZ"&gt;Disney Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ewvx48"&gt;Disney Junior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pZSi1J"&gt;Disney XD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iqBij3"&gt;Freeform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8KgIcc"&gt;FX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U7e16Q"&gt;FXX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5zOJgq"&gt;FXM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XlAuvW"&gt;National Geographic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vWgOJw"&gt;National Geographic Wild&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eHN7rI"&gt;ESPN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="38eRKt"&gt;ESPN2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cgi7xm"&gt;ESPN3 (by authentication to the ESPN app)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="I7dODa"&gt;ESPNU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XwESS1"&gt;ESPNEWS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1o3Azw"&gt;SEC Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SKLTHR"&gt;ACC Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Kw6GWW"&gt;Carriage disputes are frustratingly common in our new streaming landscape, and they often play out publicly before a resolution is reached — as was the case recently with YouTube TV and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22701682/youtube-tv-reaches-deal-nbcuniversal-carriage-channels"&gt;NBCUniversal-owned channels&lt;/a&gt;. Less frequently, two parties &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495642/youtube-tv-fox-regional-sports-networks-streaming-sinclair-mlb-nhl-nba"&gt;fail to reach a deal&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s the consumer who winds up paying the price by having to shop around for a new provider if they want support for their favorite programming.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s new flagship soundbar shoots voices up in the air so you can hear</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZwFXRCFQPqTEb2RB9xSi_B1gnfY=/201x0:2360x1439/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70290131/LG_Soundbar_01_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q4EGjE"&gt;LG has &lt;a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/12/new-premium-soundbar-from-lg-delivers-next-level-audio-for-todays-at-home-lifestyle/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new 9.1.5-channel Dolby Atmos and DTS:X soundbar featuring a novel upward firing center speaker that bounces dialogue off the celling and to your ears so you can hear clearly. While up-firing drivers are a big part of how soundbars produce surround sound in general — it’s one of five here — LG claims the up-firing center is a world-first. The soundbar also includes a pair of wireless rear speakers that can now additionally send audio to the side walls of the room, which could also increase the audio immersion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htKUdc"&gt;It’s important to note that the new up-firing center speaker is still the same channel as the regular center, but adds to the clarity of dialogue. Same goes for the two extra side-firing drivers of the rear speaker pair; it’s the same channel as the side speakers of the soundbar. LG claims its AI Room Calibration can auto configure the timings of each speaker and sync up everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twPfQw"&gt;This new LG soundbar (model S95QR), its rear speakers, and the included wireless subwoofer collectively have a power output of 810W. With both Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, the LG S95QR is positioned as a premium soundbar and a successor to the 7.1.4-channel LG SP11RA soundbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwytbA"&gt;Unfortunately, the new soundbar — like its predecessor — still does not support passthrough for 4K 120Hz with HDR. If you have a newer 4K HDR TV and a Series X or PS5, you might not want to plug your game console directly into the bar. You should still get the benefit of Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) support, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5wYI3_XusYjSkKM1Sj105R5c2LE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23110301/Screen_Shot_2021_12_17_at_5.45.37_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A visual representation of LG’s 7.1.4-channel soundbar configuration. To get to 9.1.5, imagine a third wave firing up from the soundbar (center) and two waves shooting from the rear speakers to the left/right walls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SXarET"&gt;The soundbar also supports Auto Low-Latency Mode (ALLM) and can be controlled using smart devices with Google Assistant, Alexa, and “other AI assistants”. The older LG SP11RA soundbar had AirPlay 2 support and could be controlled using Siri, but it’s not clear from LG’s press release if the new soundbar also features it (but we’re hopeful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGcPyK"&gt;LG also says there’s support for its Wowcast Wi-Fi audio dongle, which was originally released this past fall, and is available on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fuk%2Fspeakers-sound-systems%2Flg-wtp3%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F17%2F22841919%2Flg-s95qr-soundbar-ces-2022-with-upward-firing-center-channel" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s UK page&lt;/a&gt;. The Wowcast is a device that makes the soundbar wireless, for situations where running a cable between the TV and the soundbar would be difficult. It mounts behind your TV and can stream an HDMI eARC connection between it and the soundbar. LG says the Wowcast will be sold separately, so we expect a US release alongside the new soundbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAQwLP"&gt;LG did not share a price or release date for the new LG S95QR, though. The soundbar will be among the first of the company’s products being announced and displayed in its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fglobal%2Fces2022&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F17%2F22841919%2Flg-s95qr-soundbar-ces-2022-with-upward-firing-center-channel" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;virtual CES 2022 booth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
