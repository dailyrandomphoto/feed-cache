    <title>Ikea’s gaming range launches globally next month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4EzSX10Yc9oy3OLuU4UjYERrGEo=/0x1:4773x3183/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69870948/PH180876.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ikea’s gaming range consists of over 30 products.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ikea&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YDfp4l"&gt;Ikea’s lineup of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276020/ikea-gaming-lineup-asus-rog-mouse-mat-gaming-hand-accessories-holder-chair-desk"&gt;gaming-themed furniture and accessories&lt;/a&gt; now has official pricing and a global release date: &lt;a href="https://about.ikea.com/en/newsroom/2021/09/14/gaming-collection"&gt;October&lt;/a&gt;. The lineup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276020/ikea-gaming-lineup-asus-rog-mouse-mat-gaming-hand-accessories-holder-chair-desk"&gt;first came to China earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; as a collaboration with Asus and its Republic of Gamers (ROG) brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPcye1"&gt;Pricing for the lineup ranges from cheap desk accessories like a $10 cup holder or $12.99 mouse bungee, all the way up to gaming chairs costing between $69 and $349, and a $599 standing desk. Oh, and that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276020/ikea-gaming-lineup-asus-rog-mouse-mat-gaming-hand-accessories-holder-chair-desk"&gt;wooden hand&lt;/a&gt; designed to gently cradle your headphones and other accessories? That’ll set you back $24.99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LByHN88t_SyrR_Pt1a2ph2c23pU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857292/PH180804.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A mouse bungee to tidy away your mouse’s cabling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z_wQFOdMDMB0YJJeG1UVNgVH1dc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857294/PH180844.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A ring light to keep you lit, plus a phone holder to keep you in frame.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UxirKv"&gt;There are more than 30 Ikea gaming products in total, arranged across six product families. However, only one of these product families, Uppspel, contains products designed in collaboration with Asus. The rest are Ikea originals with designs “based on the insights and knowledge gained from the collaboration to meet the various needs of gamers,” the retailer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svTllE"&gt;Much of the range just looks like normal Ikea furniture given an aggressive black makeover, but Ikea has a good track record of making affordable generic versions of expensive products that could make certain accessories like the $34.99 Lånespelare Ring Light worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo shows off new ColorOS 12 following OnePlus merger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L5l0v5noQYXZNExABezXYdFqHlI=/0x1:1440x961/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69870883/New_UI_Design_2.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="00FTRV"&gt;Oppo has announced ColorOS 12, the latest version of its Android-based operating system. The update will come to OnePlus phones as well as Oppo’s own phones in China, where OnePlus has used ColorOS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344054/oneplus-9-oppo-coloros-in-china-hydrogenos"&gt;since early this year&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would be combining the codebase of its OxygenOS with ColorOS due to the two companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543184/oppo-oneplus-merger-brand-pete-lau-bbk-memo"&gt;merging several operations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPTVrI"&gt;ColorOS 12 doesn’t look hugely different to 11, but it makes more use of contrasting colors and white space, with lower information density across many screens. Icons have been subtly redesigned to make more use of depth and texture. Oppo says it’s improved more than 300 animations throughout the UI while also making use of an AI engine to reduce lag and stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E4rYXrbNSJZcM-juHwxvwB1H_5w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857281/Omoji_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wWMgvI"&gt;ColorOS 12 is based on Android 12 and adopts its upgraded privacy tools, like adding a notification in the status bar when apps activate the camera or microphone. As for new features, Oppo is adding the ability to operate its phones through a Windows 10 or 11 laptop, more tools to the sidebar that can be swiped in from the edge of the screen, and a strangely familiar 3D avatar feature called... Omoji. Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mWGmJ9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Oppo Find X3 Pro review: the Chinese phone to beat","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22411538/oppo-find-x3-pro-review"},{"title":"Leaked memo confirms OnePlus will become an Oppo sub-brand","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543184/oppo-oneplus-merger-brand-pete-lau-bbk-memo"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="UQdiPD"&gt;ColorOS 12 will first be available on a new “Photographer Edition” of Oppo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22411538/oppo-find-x3-pro-review"&gt;excellent Find X3 Pro flagship phone&lt;/a&gt;. In October, there’ll be a limited public beta in China for the Find X3 series and the OnePlus 9 series, expanding to earlier models in November and December. Overall, Oppo says that more than 110 models of phone and 150 million users worldwide will be able to upgrade to ColorOS 12.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPad Mini doesn’t support mmWave 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pGWfi-7rfT3vKeFYmomSsjIqsYQ=/1x0:1960x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69870020/Apple_iPad_mini_touch_id_09142021_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pXwYQN"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;newly redesigned iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; was one of the most exciting announcements at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665413/apple-event-iphone-13-announcements-news-products"&gt;iPhone 13 event on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, but in the aftermath a limitation has been identified: As spotted by &lt;a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/09/a-few-extra-notes-about-apples-september-14-event/"&gt;Jason Snell from &lt;em&gt;Six Colors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the new iPad Mini doesn’t support mmWave 5G. There’s also a hint that its new A15 Bionic processor might be downclocked in comparison to the version that appears in the iPhone 13 line (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/16/ipad-mini-downclocked-a15-chip/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via&lt;em&gt; MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YycHZt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"&gt;Support for 5G&lt;/a&gt; on the cellular version of the iPad Mini was one of Apple’s major highlights, but &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/specs/#:~:text=Cellular%20and%20Wireless,eSIM6"&gt;looking at Apple’s tech specs&lt;/a&gt;, while it supports low- and mid-band 5G, it doesn’t offer mmWave. Apple first started playing into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21511946/5g-iphone-12-upgrade-speed-network-mmwave-hype"&gt;the 5G hype machine with the launch of the iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;, and continues to tout the faster download and upload speeds the tech can offer in 2021. You can see the cellular and wireless features Apple highlights for the iPad Mini below:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/99E7IPl1KKw5jgEzdgI3kaUbB-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22856329/Screenshot_2021_09_16_3.08.12_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s breakdown of the cellular components in the new iPad Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dHCZuL"&gt;Getting fast 5G speeds is dependent on coverage, which has improved in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;but isn’t always faster than LTE&lt;/a&gt;. Carriers like&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt; Verizon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325857/t-mobile-5g-coverage-ultra-capacity-extended-range"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; have big plans to improve 5G performance in 2021 — including increasing the availability of fast mmWave — but where coverage is limited, it might not be worth the trouble yet. In our experience &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;reviewing the iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, mmWave was finnicky. Here’s &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s editor-in-chief Nilay Patel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="fi7JWy"&gt;In a patch of 20 glorious square feet, I pulled over 2 gigabits per second down. (And 40 megabits per second up, which matched regular 5G.) If I walked 100 feet away, the signal dropped, and that was that. I hope you are not anticipating being very mobile with your 5G mobile phone if you have giant files to download.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="99G09n"&gt;Maybe not a huge loss for the Mini just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJ66b7"&gt;The same might be said for the iPad Mini’s processor. The GeekBench benchmarks &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/16/ipad-mini-downclocked-a15-chip/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; cites&lt;/a&gt; points to the Mini’s performance &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/9851750"&gt;coming in at 2.9 GHz&lt;/a&gt;, a bit slower than the 3.2 GHz the publication sourced for the iPhone 13. However, GeekBench is not the be-all-end-all for understanding the performance of a device. Without an iPad Mini to test in hand, there’s no way to be absolutely certain those numbers are accurate. It’s also not too difficult to fake a GeekBench score, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-4-xl-5g-fake/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; has proven&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yWwXm"&gt;If you’re looking for an actual verifiable difference between the new Mini and iPhones, look to graphics performance. The iPad Mini offers five graphics cores, one more than the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini’s 4-core GPU. There’s no way to tell what that looks like until we review it, but the mmWave-less iPad Mini might still be plenty capable.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Guillermo Del Toro’s next film Nightmare Alley is carnival meets noir in its first teaser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TO9yp1s-vCVd05eA7OrvqJmNA7s=/0x0:5751x3834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69870004/005_NA_01718_R2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Searchlight Pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0htu8X"&gt;Guillermo Del Toro’s next film &lt;em&gt;Nightmare Alley &lt;/em&gt;is a bit of departure for the director. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-qVV8zyVmI"&gt;The new teaser trailer&lt;/a&gt; released by Searchlight Pictures on Thursday sees the Oscar award-winning filmmaker trading in his fascination with the supernatural for an R-rated noir set in and around a carnival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rP6ERt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nightmare Alley&lt;/em&gt; stars Bradley Cooper as Stanton Carlisle, a nightclub mind reader who becomes tangled up with Cate Blanchett as Dr. Lilith Ritter, a psychiatrist out to debunk him as a fraud. The teaser trailer itself manages to be plenty tense without Del Toro’s usual monsters, featuring carnival sideshows, Willem Dafoe as some kind of ringleader, Blanchett as an obvious femme fatale, and what looks like a live electrocution. You can see for yourself in the teaser above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nSI3LW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Nightmare Alley&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Film by Guillermo del Toro&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only in Theaters December 17 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RealGDT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@RealGDT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/zfEU7aeGG9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zfEU7aeGG9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Searchlight Pictures (@searchlightpics) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/searchlightpics/status/1438140775385026563?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gncQO9"&gt; Del Toro’s very deliberately avoiding many of the tropes of noir cinema with &lt;em&gt;Nightmare Alley, a&lt;/em&gt;ccording to &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/09/nightmare-alley-guillermo-del-toro-awards-insider?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;amp;utm_brand=vf&amp;amp;utm_social-type=owned"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m not going to do the Venetian blinds, and voiceover, and detectives walking with fedoras in wet streets,” Del Toro told the magazine. That also extends to the director’s deliberate choice &lt;a href="https://collider.com/guillermo-del-toro-nightmare-alley-rating-details/"&gt;to not not include supernatural elements&lt;/a&gt; in his R-rated noir. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightmare_Alley_(novel)"&gt;The original 1946 novel of &lt;em&gt;Nightmare Alley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by William Lindsay Gresham is grounded in the horrible things people do — Cooper’s character is ultimately a fraud. Based off the trailer, the film seems like a natural evolution for the monster metaphors Del Toro has worked with since he started his career, only this time brought fully into the real, just as terrifying world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awfnwF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nightmare Alley&lt;/em&gt; will premiere on December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cameo Calls let you have a video meet-and-greet with a celebrity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZGeWMvt0iCCTsAo5YfSeuktqHIM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69869706/Screen_Shot_2021_09_16_at_3.29.19_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KHqHUp"&gt;Cameo is adding a new live calls feature into its app. Cameo is perhaps most well-known for letting you pay for pre-recorded video messages from celebrities, but the new feature, &lt;a href="https://cameoblog.medium.com/bringing-fans-and-talent-closer-together-with-cameo-calls-fb52f4a40dbc"&gt;called Cameo Calls&lt;/a&gt;, will let you have short video conversations that are designed to be like meet-and-greets. (The app even sets up a photo op at the end of the call.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsPBof"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://imp.i309903.net/c/482924/828354/11642?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cameo.com%2Fcameo-calls&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cameo Calls page&lt;/a&gt; has a full list of whose available for conversations and how much it costs for a certain amount of their time. Cameo says that calls can last up to 15 minutes and that the average price for a call is $31. When I looked, I saw that most people offer two or three minutes per call, and prices ranged dramatically. (The highest fee I saw was $225 for a 10-minute call with Vanessa Marcil, an actress who was on the show &lt;em&gt;General Hospital&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3MadPB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lk1wD0z91rE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E2EakM"&gt;I have to admit that I hardly know any of the people who are available for Cameo Calls, though. The biggest name I recognized was &lt;a href="https://imp.i309903.net/c/482924/828354/11642?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cameo.com%2Fcameo-calls%2F5ece9ff42ec20a0190a8ad1f%2F6142018a2d33ab001e03cdbc%3Fep%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Billy Dee Williams&lt;/a&gt;, known for his iconic portrayal of Lando Calrissian in the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; franchise. (You pay $100 to book three minutes of his time on Monday.) But the new feature could be a fun way to get to have a conversation with somebody you’re a fan of — assuming they’re offering time in via Cameo Calls, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXYkj1"&gt;This isn’t Cameo’s first live feature; in June 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21291381/cameo-zoom-call-live-launch-celebrity"&gt;it launched Cameo Live&lt;/a&gt;, which let you and up to four other people talk to a celebrity on a Zoom call.

    <title>Streaming service Locast permanently barred from operation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Locast NYC" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EY6Vnag3A9LI9aIlEVsRTPKPu2g=/0x21:1231x842/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69869433/Locast_nyc.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kJHN8A"&gt;Things looked bad for Locast before, and they just got even worse. A judge this week permanently prohibited streamer Locast from continuing operations of its business, a decision that follows a yearslong legal standoff between major broadcasters and the scrappy streaming provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vh8TZC"&gt;A permanent injunction order signed by Judge Louis L. Stanton this week stated that Locast founder David Goodfriend and his nonprofit Sports Fans Coalition NY, which operates the Locast service, “are permanently restrained and enjoined from operating” the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18236704/locast-review-streaming-free-local-programming-tv"&gt;free TV streaming service&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7k0Ki"&gt;The injunction follows a series of rapid-succession developments that have led to Locast’s apparent demise, after the big four broadcasters suing the company — ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC — secured a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652988/broadcaster-victory-locast-abc-nbc-fox-cbs"&gt;legal victory&lt;/a&gt; in early September in their fight against the streamer, after which Locast &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654047/locast-tv-streaming-over-the-air-court-ruling-shutdown"&gt;suspended its service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9GrdJU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Its owners are “permanently restrained and enjoined from operating Locust.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s7fDES"&gt;The major broadcasters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20748677/locast-streaming-tv-lawsuit-abc-cbs-fox-nbc"&gt;sued the live TV streamer&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 alleging that Locast’s business violated copyright law. Locast’s nonprofit business hinged on an exemption in copyright law that permits re-transmission of their broadcasts by nonprofits. Locast didn’t technically charge its users anything to access its service, however it did frequently prompt them for monthly donations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rq2Llp"&gt;Earlier this month, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652988/broadcaster-victory-locast-abc-nbc-fox-cbs"&gt;court sided&lt;/a&gt; with the big four by determining that fees that Locast was pulling in from these donations exceeded “the actual and reasonable costs of maintaining and operating the service,” a stipulation of the copyright exemption that the court determined Locast defied. Almost immediately, the service notified customers that it would suspend its services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZnE5G"&gt;“As a non-profit, Locast was designed from the very beginning to operate in accordance with the strict letter of the law, but in response to the court’s recent rulings, with which we respectfully disagree, we are hereby suspending operations, effective immediately,” the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654047/locast-tv-streaming-over-the-air-court-ruling-shutdown"&gt;company told customers&lt;/a&gt; in an email at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zbgaP"&gt;The order specifically notes that Goodfriend and his organization are not barred from applying for a stay of the permanent injunction, but also notes that it similarly does not bar the broadcasters themselves from opposing the stay. Representatives for the company did not immediately return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The bitter lawsuit hanging over the Apple Watch’s new swipe keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lf7t7XTCie4KES3CJ5bsAFEKnWQ=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69869170/3tX1ydZgxW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, Apple really did type “copy” into its own keyboard during the event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Apple allegedly offered to buy his app; instead, it’s being Sherlocked&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7J0PhN"&gt;In January 2019, Kosta Eleftheriou had every reason to believe Apple was about to make a deal, his lawsuit alleges. Apple’s head of keyboards &lt;em&gt;loved &lt;/em&gt;his FlickType keyboard app for the Apple Watch, gushing over how few mistakes it made. “Apple should buy this from you,” the man exclaimed, saying it “could be a key feature for the watch.” He demoed it for the Apple Watch team on January 24th, where a senior engineer allegedly gushed too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlJd8e"&gt;That evening, Eleftheriou received a message from Apple, but not the one he expected. In the course of one afternoon, the company had seemingly decided that Apple Watch keyboards were against the rules. “Specifically, the app is a keyboard for Apple Watch. For this reason, your app will be removed from sale on the App Store at this time,” Apple wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0RHrV"&gt;This Tuesday, Apple revealed its own swipe keyboard app alongside the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JmmCZf"&gt;Eleftheriou had been Sherlocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cN0A7V"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So now we know. See you in court, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/hJtPI2Z83J"&gt;https://t.co/hJtPI2Z83J&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/1s7MUSLTpc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1s7MUSLTpc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1437845736951992321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dvc5W8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sherlocked&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DS3fQr"&gt;He’s far from the first. Apple has a long history of looking to its own app developers for inspiration, copying their ideas, and integrating them into its own operating systems for free. (It’s called “Sherlocking” because Apple famously copied a lot of features from the third-party Watson app over to its Sherlock desktop search tool in 2002; here are some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18651190/apple-ios-13-mac-os-catalina-third-party-apps-products-copy-wwdc-2019"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/5/17428598/ios-12-apps-features-third-party-clones-bitmoji-houseparty"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133023/apple-bluemail-blix-restored-mac-app-store-sherlocking-patent-lawsuit"&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zfBkO"&gt;But this isn’t your typical case of whether a developer should be entitled to their income or whether users deserve the functionality for free — and not just &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1437899751496769541"&gt;because Apple’s making users pay for a new Watch to get it&lt;/a&gt;.  When Apple blocked his app two years ago and continued to tussle with him over updates, the company made an enemy of Eleftheriou. He’s become one of Apple’s most vocal critics, developing a reputation as a scam hunter. He continually and effectively points out that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;Apple is terrible at keeping out frauds&lt;/a&gt; which bilk ordinary users out of outrageous sums of money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BLa2oV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s $64 billion-a-year App Store isn’t catching the most egregious scams","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"},{"title":"Eight things Apple could do to prove it actually cares about App Store users","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TpIt0S"&gt;In March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;he filed a lawsuit against the company over his app&lt;/a&gt;, alleging that the company continued to reject and hold up his Apple Watch keyboard for months in an attempt to force him to sell it to Apple for cheap. “Evidently, Apple thought Plaintiff would simply give up and sell its application to Apple at a discount,” &lt;a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/499290311/Kpaw-LLC-v-Apple-Inc#from_embed&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22100421__t_w__r_google.com__d_D"&gt;the complaint reads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEjYab"&gt;Here’s the part where you might be thinking: “Wait, didn’t Apple ban every keyboard app for the Apple Watch back in 2019?” or “Didn’t Eleftheriou just tweet that rejection message and say ‘see you in court’ a couple days ago?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXLYTJ"&gt;The timeline’s a little confusing, it’s true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SL6Hu"&gt;Yes, Eleftheriou filed his suit nearly six full months before the Apple Watch Series 7 announcement. It’s not clear what impact the Sherlocking might have on the suit, and he won’t say. His lawyers are advising him against saying too much to journalists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MwCU4u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Let’s untangle the timeline&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0szggv"&gt;But no, Apple didn’t actually reject every Apple Watch keyboard app in 2019 — Eleftheriou believes his app was singled out for this treatment. &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shift-keyboard-swipe-type/id1452694750"&gt;Shift Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; had already arrived in February 2019, and even partner apps that included Eleftheriou’s keyboard tech (the complaint names Nano for Reddit, Chirp for Twitter and Lens for Instagram) allegedly made it through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkarpU"&gt;Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it changed its mind over time. Originally, the company didn’t think it was appropriate for a keyboard to take up the entirety of the Apple Watch’s small screen, but decided differently in 2019 after it saw the potential and says it’s encouraged Apple Watch keyboards ever since. The company basically admits that removing Eleftheriou’s app was a mistake, and claims it quickly corrected the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jM85i"&gt;But Eleftheriou disputes that last point, saying it took a year of appeals and resubmissions to get his keyboard back onto the store. “From [January 2019] on, I was simultaneously discussing a FlickType acquisition with them, while also being rejected,” he tells me. And Apple initially made it look like those appeals failed, too. “The App Review Board evaluated your app and determined that the original rejection feedback is valid. Please note that all appeal results are final,” reads Eleftheriou from a message he received in May 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJC81x"&gt;In the complaint, he alleges it wasn’t until January 2020, a year after the surprise takedown, that his Apple Watch keyboard extension was approved. When FlickType for Apple Watch did finally arrive, it became the number one paid app in the entire store, pulled in $130,000 in its first month, he claims, and was named &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/story/id1535572713/"&gt;one of Apple’s top paid apps of 2020&lt;/a&gt;. That’s what he’s using as grounds that he’s been financially harmed in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GnWbN"&gt;Not that he’s necessarily too worried about finances right now. “The FlickType income, yeah, I do expect it to eventually disappear given that the functionality will now be built-in,” he says, casually. “I don’t have a day job, but yeah this isn’t a big financial problem for me,” he adds when I ask. I wonder if he made good money &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pinterest-acquires-team-that-builtfleksy-inc-1466021492"&gt;when he sold his keyboard company Fleksy to Pinterest&lt;/a&gt; roughly five years ago. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/2/10900456/microsoft-swiftkey-acquisition-reported-250-million"&gt;Microsoft bought keyboard app SwiftKey for roughly $250 million&lt;/a&gt; just months earlier.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ll0yzt"&gt;Eleftheriou says FlickType has “mostly been a hobby,” but his other hobby — hunting down scam apps and calling out the App Store’s failings — stems from this whole situation, too. He was fed up watching competing apps thrive, including scams, after his own had been blocked by App Review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXy0HE"&gt;And last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627515/flicktype-ios-keyboard-discontinued-blind-visually-impaired"&gt;Eleftheriou publicly gave up on his popular iPhone keyboard extension for the blind&lt;/a&gt; after one too many rejections, due to what he describes as the latest misunderstanding by Apple’s App Review team of how his app (and the company’s own VoiceOver screen reader technology) are supposed to work.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q8n3rg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's with a heavy heart today that we're announcing the discontinuation of our award-winning iPhone keyboard for blind users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple has thrown us obstacle after obstacle for years while we try to provide an app to improve people's lives, and we can no longer endure their abuse. &lt;a href="https://t.co/cH1HCQzeP1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cH1HCQzeP1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FlickType Watch Keyboard (@FlickType) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlickType/status/1427292830523744257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CRdQ69"&gt;“Our rejection history already spans more than FOURTY [sic] pages filled with repeated, unwarranted, &amp;amp; unreasonable rejections that serve to frustrate &amp;amp; delay rather than benefit end-users. And dealing with App Review isn’t just time-consuming. It’s also very emotionally draining,” he wrote at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1BPQm"&gt;Apple effectively tells me this, too, was a mistake on its part. The company says it now realizes the keyboard does in fact comply with its guidelines, has explained that to Eleftheriou several times, and has repeatedly encouraged him to submit the app again. Apple would prefer that he doesn’t take it away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8H7idJ"&gt;But Eleftheriou says he’s had enough. Here’s the statement he sent me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="65BG7X"&gt;I will be delighted to bring back the accessible FlickType Keyboard for iPhone when Apple finally fixes their broken 3rd-party keyboard APIs on iOS and allows developers to fairly compete with Apple’s own keyboard. They must also ensure that every single reviewer has basic VoiceOver training - we keep getting rejections due to reviewers not knowing or even understanding how to use VoiceOver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMSeyl"&gt;I’ve already poured thousands of hours developing my app, working around countless keyboard API issues and dealing with app review, so I’m really looking forward to Apple’s improvements and will promptly re-submit the FlickType VoiceOver keyboard when sufficient progress has been made in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrE2Qb"&gt;As a separate note, I’m also calling on Apple to allow developers to access their own rejection history. Apple currently hides this from developers and even refuses to provide it upon request. It’s unacceptable that Apple will send us rejection messages that disappear shortly after, with no way to access them ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KGCtwr"&gt;He’s particularly annoyed with how Apple’s own keyboard has an unfair advantage since it doesn’t need to use its own APIs, and how those APIs are lacking features &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1430271507305881600"&gt;that Apple publicly promised years ago&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQepWa"&gt;Technically, Eleftheriou is the one making the iPhone keyboard extension disappear, not Apple. It still exists in the current version on the store. He submitted a new version that removes the extension, one that’s currently pending with Apple’s App Review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rdnJxC"&gt;For now, Eleftheriou is going to take his keyboard and go home. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hundreds of T-Mobile stores will be able to fix phones soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="T-Mobile Data Breach Affects 40 Million People" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/19ADhN7Y624a9A-3P9RN9ehAdP8=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69869166/1334909491.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="li5Bon"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fdevices%2Ft-mobile-adds-in-store-repairs-and-more-device-protection-benefits-for-customers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F16%2F22677969%2Ft-mobile-retail-store-repair-protection-program-increased-claims" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile announced&lt;/a&gt; that 500 of its retail stores would start offering repair services starting on November 1st. The company says technicians will provide same-day fixes using manufacturer-approved parts to customers who subscribe to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fdevices%2Fphone-protection-plans&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F16%2F22677969%2Ft-mobile-retail-store-repair-protection-program-increased-claims" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its Protection&amp;lt;360&amp;gt; service&lt;/a&gt;, which also includes device replacement in case of loss or theft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPKppu"&gt;T-Mobile is also improving that device protection plan by letting customers make five claims in a 12-month period, up from the previous limit of three. The claims are handled by Assurant and come with a deductible based on what kind of phone you have and what kind of claim you’re making. Still, it’s likely to be cheaper than buying five new phones if you wind up having &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/s-1WxfsJzPM?t=33"&gt;an 18-karat run of bad luck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZuvseH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Assurant technicians will be handling the in-store repairs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cSZCc0"&gt;Interestingly, this change has echoes of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587790/t-mobile-sprint-acquisition-dish-promises"&gt;contentious T-Mobile / Sprint merger&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="https://mytmoclaim.com/media/3234583/CL05179-0821-TMO_NW_Buckslip_Brochure.pdf"&gt;a brochure for Protection&amp;lt;360&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile pitches the changes as providing “the same key features you enjoyed under the Sprint Complete plan” and lists the five claims and walk-in repairs as benefits that were previously available. At one point, Sprint had around 1,300 repair centers according to a support document (though T-Mobile tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it currently has 450), making T-Mobile’s 500 stores a little less impressive. As of fall 2020, when the merger was completed, the carrier &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sprint.com%2Fen%2Flandings%2Fwelcome-to-your-new-experience%3Famp%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F16%2F22677969%2Ft-mobile-retail-store-repair-protection-program-increased-claims" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported having over 7,500 retail locations&lt;/a&gt;, so there’s room for expansion. T-Mobile says that its current repair locations will cover “nearly every major city” in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkYMLf"&gt;Still, it’s good to see that T-Mobile is at least looking to continue providing in-person repair services. While the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570826/president-joe-biden-executive-order-right-to-repair"&gt;battle for right-to-repair&lt;/a&gt; rages, a trend of the mobile industry making repairs more widely available is spreading. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18691649/best-buy-apple-iphone-mac-ipad-repairs-all-stores"&gt;Best Buy started offering authorized repairs&lt;/a&gt; for iPhones, and Apple has made progress on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357187/apple-independent-repair-program-in-over-200-countries"&gt;expanding its Independent Repair Provider program&lt;/a&gt; (though the program has gotten pushback for some of its requirements). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2a2uvd"&gt;If you’re looking to add T-Mobile’s protection plan to your service to take advantage of in-person repair, the restrictions are worth noting. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fprotectionandlt360andgt-and-device-protection%23heading5&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F16%2F22677969%2Ft-mobile-retail-store-repair-protection-program-increased-claims" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The company says&lt;/a&gt; you can only enroll within 30 days of a qualifying event, like buying a T-Mobile device or bringing your own device to the network. There may also be an inspection process to make sure your phone is working before it's covered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RT74Xw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 16th, 6:48PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added additional information on the number of Sprint and T-Mobile repair centers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Home Assistant Amber is a ready-to-use smart home platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B2B-HxMP6lVnKz5cNfPJNZXT7SI=/61x0:1860x1199/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69869006/naba_casa_square_v4.588.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Home Assistant Amber is a smart home hub for the free, open source home automation platform.&lt;/em&gt; | Nabu Casa&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6c8cH8"&gt;Home Assistant, the powerful-yet-prickly smart home automation platform, is finally moving toward the mainstream. Nabu Casa, the company behind the free, open-source software, has launched Home Assistant Amber, its first ready-to-use hub that can run Home Assistant software out of the box. Unlike with prior methods of using Home Assistant, there’s minimal programming required and no need to build your own computer when you have the Amber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIW32k"&gt;Debuting on the creators’ crowdfunding platform &lt;a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/nabu-casa/home-assistant-amber"&gt;Crowd Supply&lt;/a&gt; this week, the $149 box is designed for both beginners and experienced HA fans. Shipping is targeted for June 2022, provided the $140,000 funding goal is met (it’s about a third of the way there as of publish).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NbQXJVQJLreITM_EAWyTRO2tPWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22855857/home_assistant_amber_workbench_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nabu Casa&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Home Assistant Amber is designed to be user-upgradable, helping future-proof it in the fast-moving smart home space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pQkbuE"&gt;The brains of the device is a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4), and &lt;a href="https://www.mouser.com/new/silicon-labs/silicon-labs-mgm210p-mighty-gecko-lighting-module/"&gt;a built-in Silicon Labs Module&lt;/a&gt; powers the Zigbee 3.0 connection, the main Home Assistant communication protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="431p2O"&gt;With Zigbee on board, you can connect popular home automation products like Philips Hue lightbulbs and Ikea’s smart shades directly to the Amber hub (no need to use their own bridges) and then control them in the Home Assistant software on your smartphone, tablet, or computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTfdLI"&gt;The Silicon Labs chip also supports OpenThread, and it says it’s working on making it compatible with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt;, the open standard on a mission to simplify the smart home. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7U4EbTCTrXuWrMGOvBPUXeW3o0I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22855882/naba_casa_square_v4.628.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nabu Casa&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amber Hub comes pre-assembled in a custom enclosure with a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4) and a heatsink for silent operation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tDnOWq"&gt;Z-Wave compatibility can be added with a Z-Wave USB stick or via a connection to a third-party hub like Vera or SmartThings. The Amber hub also has an M.2 extension port so you can plug in an SSD hard drive for more storage, among other expansion capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6a9ni"&gt;Notably, there’s no Bluetooth or Wi-Fi built in, and the internet connection is over gigabit ethernet. Home Assistant founder Paulus Schoutsen says that’s because they “don’t want people to get the idea to connect the brains of their smart home via Wi-Fi. It needs a reliable connection.” The &lt;a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/nabu-casa/home-assistant-amber"&gt;full specs&lt;/a&gt; of the Amber line up with other Raspberry Pi 4-based systems, though there’s no video-out to plug in a display — you do all of the maintenance and setup through the Home Assistant mobile or desktop apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Feek6T"&gt;Home Assistant’s primary appeal lies in its local control (the ability to access your devices even when the internet is down); its secure, privacy-focused cloud offering; and that it’s completely platform agnostic. There are over a thousand compatible devices and integrations, including many that aren’t supported across other popular platforms such as Apple’s HomeKit, Samsung’s SmartThings, or Amazon’s Alexa. (A complete list of devices is published on the &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/#all"&gt;Home Assistant website&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C9FCF3VkSbDfdllIYU7NeZkB9sA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22855865/framed_lovelace_energy.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nabu Casa&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amber hub can be controlled by the Home Assistant app on a smartphone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="htILzo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qc67kO"&gt;As an open-source project (with over 8,000 contributors on GitHub just this year), Home Assistant’s capabilities are literally endless. However, they require a steeper-than-most-people-will-put-up-with learning curve. Get ready to do some light coding to get your lights to turn on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kw58gr"&gt;The eight-year-old platform is incredibly powerful and can do more than most mainstream options currently offer. The standard automations to turn your thermostat down and lock your doors at night are there, but it can also track energy use, energy production (if you have solar power or similar), and offer up a sustainability score for your home to help keep you on track. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87YpiK"&gt;To nab a Home Assistant Amber you need to be one of the first 500 backers as the company has only secured components for that many units due to the current global shortage. There’s also the option of an Amber Kit that you can assemble yourself and which has the added capability of Power over Ethernet. Those don’t ship with the CM4, though, and they’re not as user-friendly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1F60d8"&gt;The campaign ends October 27th, 2021, with production scheduled to begin in six months and units shipping June 30th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jryph2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why smartwatch-measured blood pressure still isn’t ‘ready for primetime’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A red blood pressure meter sits on a wooden desk, in the background, a doctor looks over papers. A patient’s arm is also visible on the desk. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YF7IN-0rkj6VZubN3LLDD72XDFw=/0x0:2916x1944/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69868792/151262809.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A traditional blood pressure meter lies on a doctor’s desk. | Photo by Adam Berry/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Cardiologists are looking forward to the future of blood pressure tech — but the field still needs to catch up&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="as9z79"&gt;It’s been over two years since Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18236373/samsung-galaxy-watch-blood-pressure-monitoring-health-fda"&gt;first announced&lt;/a&gt; that its Galaxy Watch would be able to measure people’s blood pressure. The feature is available in a number of countries, including South Korea, but not in the United States — the company is still awaiting Food and Drug Administration clearance. In the meantime, other smartwatch companies have started experimenting with blood pressure tech in a bid for monitors on their devices. Fitbit &lt;a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/fitbit-study-blood-pressure/"&gt;announced a study&lt;/a&gt; trialing a blood pressure monitor in April, and Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652120/apple-watch-blood-pressure-temperature-sleep-diabetes"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; working on its own version, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TCjjb"&gt;Adding a blood pressure monitor to smartwatches could arguably be more important for users’ cardiovascular health than the heart rate and rhythm monitors they have now, says says Ann Marie Navar, a cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. “Blood pressure measurement is something we need to do a lot more a lot of,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QxttbM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re not ready for primetime yet”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rB3WNm"&gt;But it’s still not clear how reliable smartwatch-measured blood pressure could be. Measuring blood pressure is much harder than tracking heart rate and rhythm, and getting it right is arguably even more important. “We’re not ready for primetime yet,” says Jordana Cohen, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania who studies hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ahlwoF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squeeze-free methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rBbhrS"&gt;Having more ways to easily take blood pressure measurements at home could be a big benefit to people with hypertension (high blood pressure) or other concerns. Pressure measurements taken exclusively in a doctor’s office are often unreliable: some people have higher blood pressure in-office because they’re anxious about the visit, while other people have masked hypertension — high blood pressure at home, but normal blood pressure at the doctor. “We don’t pick it up unless we have people check their blood pressures at home,” Navar says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMlcML"&gt;There are plenty of at-home blood pressure cuffs that take the standard approach: a cuff gets strapped onto a patient’s upper arm. Inflating the cuff cuts off blood flow, and the device measures the pressure blood is putting on vessel walls when blood starts flowing again as the compression is released. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A watch displaying blood pressure reading on a person’s wrist." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fL4YZRBaCQ7y9mqa1QgY_h8vNEw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22855694/1090712796.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Omron HeartGuide device has a built-in blood pressure cuff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SbciQc"&gt;Right now, there’s one wearable device cleared by the Food and Drug Administration to measure blood pressure: a device from medical equipment company Omron, which has an inflatable cuff inside the band that lets it take blood pressure measurements at the wrist using the traditional squeezing method. Unlike smartwatches that are hoping to add blood pressure to existing tech, Omron’s HeartGuide is extremely specialized. It’s even marketed as “a wearable blood pressure monitor in the innovative form of a wristwatch”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0P4Mj"&gt;Smartwatch companies like Samsung and Fitbit are taking another approach. They are using light sensors on the smartwatches to calculate blood pressure. It’s a big challenge, says Wendy Mendes, a psychophysiologist at the University of California San Francisco who works with Samsung on its tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ma3Gk2"&gt;Samsung’s approach is based on a measure called pulse transit time, which is the time between the contraction of the heart and when the pulse arrives at a particular body part, like the wrist. It’s correlated with blood pressure. “The faster that pulse transit time is, the more the vessels are tightening — that’s what’s making the pulse travel faster,” Mendes says. Optical sensors also check if vessels are tightening or widening. An algorithm then uses those two bits of information, along with heart rate, to estimate blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvomnI"&gt;Fitbit is a few steps further back in the process — it doesn’t have any blood pressure features available but has a handful of &lt;a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/fitbit-study-blood-pressure/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; underway looking at the relationship between the metrics already collected by its devices and blood pressure. They’re focusing on a measure called pulse arrival time. It’s similar to pulse transit time but measures the pulse at a slightly different time than Samsung does, says Eric Friedman, vice president of research at Fitbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A watch sits next to a phone in a photo illustration. The watch has an image of a heart, and text that says “your watch will start measuring automatically” The phone displays a photo of a person wearing a white shirt. One of the person’s arms has a watch, the other has a blood pressure cuff." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPoRBVrFnWmihZUEuogKCGcm-E0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22855654/Samsung_Health_Monitor_App_Blood_Pressure_dl2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A press image of Samsung’s Health Monitor Application with Blood Pressure Measurement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HTc5YB"&gt;There’s a limitation to both of these strategies: generally, they can only reliably measure &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; blood pressure. Mendes could strap a watch on and find out if someone’s blood pressure was higher in the morning than it was when they went to sleep the previous night, but wouldn’t be able to tell what the raw number it started at was without benchmarking the device off of a standard blood pressure cuff. “Almost all of these sensors are going to be good at changes,” she says. “But to get the level, you have to calibrate it.” Samsung suggests users recalibrate the blood pressure monitor on their smartwatches &lt;a href="https://www.wareable.com/samsung/how-to-take-blood-pressure-on-samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-8321#google_vignette"&gt;every four weeks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="op2V2I"&gt;Apple’s blood pressure feature is still in development and has not been formally announced. It would reportedly just give people information on trends in their blood pressure — if it’s increasing or decreasing — rather than a raw measure, which requires the calibration step used by Samsung, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-plans-blood-pressure-measure-wrist-thermometer-in-watch-11630501201"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a more realistic approach, Cohen says, because the techniques used in smartwatches are much more capable of detecting relative changes in blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QgRdsB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t have the hubris to view it as something that’s coming out any day now.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q3OCqv"&gt;The sensors currently common in smartwatches probably won’t be able to measure blood pressure without calibration against an outside cuff, Mendes says. “I do think it’s possible, but I don’t think the technology is there yet,” she says. It’s a herculean task, Friedman says. “There have been whole books written around why this is an impossible thing to solve,” he says. “I don’t have the hubris to view it as something that’s coming out any day now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GT6h5x"&gt;That’s why Fitbit is taking a broad approach and is considering all the ways it might be able to incorporate pulse arrival time and blood pressure into the data it offers users, Friedman says. Even if companies can’t directly measure blood pressure through a watch, they might be able to use metrics like pulse arrival time to give people information about &lt;em&gt;swings &lt;/em&gt;in their blood pressure (like Apple is reportedly pursuing) or their general fitness levels. “We’re ultimately looking at the maximal health impact we can achieve, and there are a lot of things that would also be quite satisfying,” Friedman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="20GzBr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validating the tech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YoRqfP"&gt;There’s more and more data available on non-cuff blood pressure monitors — movement in the right direction, Navar says. “There’s been a lot of progress in terms of trying to validate that technology against what we would consider more of a gold-standard blood pressure measurement,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWEAzu"&gt;Right now, the only way to access Samsung’s blood pressure feature in the US is through Mendes’ research program at the University of California San Francisco, &lt;a href="https://mybplab.com/"&gt;My BP Lab&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks stress and blood pressure. The team asked 123 participants to spend a week taking blood pressure readings using both a blood pressure cuff and a Samsung Note 9 phone (which includes the same sensor as the smartwatches). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FNrT8M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s so, so important that we get it right,”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hurdvY"&gt;The analysis, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8346904/"&gt;published in July&lt;/a&gt;, found that the blood pressures calculated by the Samsung device had “moderate to strong agreement” with pressures measured by an FDA-approved cuff. The results were about as close together as the results from two different FDA-approved cuffs were each other, Mendes says. The results held for people of varying skin tones and ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oy5FiS"&gt;Navar hopes to see public data on devices made by companies like Fitbit and Apple, as well. “We’ve seen companies really hold themselves to a higher standard, and I think the clinical research community is really demanding it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSNIEW"&gt;Still, Cohen says the data available so far isn’t enough to make her confident in blood pressure tracked through a smartwatch. “I wouldn’t recommend somebody use it to diagnose hypertension or for monitoring or treatment of high blood pressure. Not yet,” she says.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Fitbit Sense" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ItrQXnja0IvpfQnm2hCerg1ojA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21812132/sense2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fitbit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitbit wearables don’t measure blood pressure yet, but the company is studying whether it can use other metrics, like pulse arrival time, to measure people’s blood pressure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kdiN0Z"&gt;It’s important to get right — maybe more important than something like heart rate, Cohen says. “High blood pressure is such a major risk factor for stroke, major cardiac events, and kidney disease,” she says. “It’s so, so important that we get it right, because if devices are giving you an inaccurate reading, you can get very false reassurance that your blood pressure is normal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKOJKj"&gt;Cohen’s seen multiple patients with inaccurate data collected through blood pressure-monitoring wearables purchased overseas, or that don’t make the type of medical claims that would require clearance from the FDA. “I had one patient that had one of those watches that she got from overseas, and she was convinced her blood pressure was perfect,” she says. A monitoring test showed that it was actually 50 points higher than what the watch said. The patient was so reluctant to accept that determination that her care team had to run a second test. “She wouldn’t accept the values,” Cohen says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ll0EGc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have to be cautious”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="isoqp5"&gt;Clinicians will have to carefully examine any new device on the market to make sure it’s working well enough to trust in different groups of people, including people with high or abnormal blood pressure, Navar says. “It may work in someone with totally normal blood vessels, but does it work in an older person who may have stiffer blood vessels? We have to be cautious,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iH02GD"&gt;Blood pressure is relatively easy to double check with a medical-grade cuff at home or in the doctor’s office, Navar says. She’d want to use that as a backup for patients with smartwatches, at least at first. “I’d probably want to make sure that, if somebody is using one of these watches to measure their blood pressure, that we check it against a more standard measure,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="iWZ0yR"&gt;If smartwatches are able to run the validation gauntlet and prove that they can reliably track blood pressure, it could help expand the options people have to manage a health condition at home. “I love the idea of more people checking their blood pressure at home, and anything to help people do that is wonderful,” Cohen says. “But it needs to be accurate or it’s of no value.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTPfhe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjKVR4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
