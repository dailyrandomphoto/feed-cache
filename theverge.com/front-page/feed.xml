    <title>Google will soon switch on two-factor authentication by default</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hWm78hj2lPoo3qANGcE4I5RNOpE=/0x100:2100x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69246166/twostep.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lhFBFo"&gt;Google is about to take a pretty significant step that will help keep user accounts more secure: it’s going to enroll people in two-factor authentication by default. Today the company &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/a-simpler-and-safer-future-without-passwords/"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it will soon start enrolling customers in two-factor authentication (or “&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;two-step verification&lt;/a&gt;,” as Google calls it) if their accounts are “appropriately configured.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuNxkh"&gt;Once enabled, they’ll receive a prompt on their smartphone to verify that an attempted login with their Google account is legitimate. “Using their mobile device to sign in gives people a safer and more secure authentication experience than passwords alone,” said Google’s senior director of product management, Mark Risher. (On-phone alerts are more secure than SMS messages, which can be intercepted.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hc0LzB"&gt;If standard two-factor authentication doesn’t cut it for you, you can always use a physical security key like those from YubiKey, or Google’s own Titan, as another way to safeguard your account. Back in 2019, Google also added the option for Android smartphones to serve as a security key, and this has since &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-smart-lock/id1152066360"&gt;been extended to iPhones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lc3Tad"&gt;This is all part of Google’s push for “a future where one day you won’t need a password at all,” and the news comes on World Password Day. Distressingly, even after countless enormous hacks and password dumps, &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/a-simpler-and-safer-future-without-passwords/"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; 66 percent of Americans “still admit to using the same password across multiple sites, which makes all those accounts vulnerable if any one falls.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BKcQC"&gt;Google advises customers to go through the company’s quick security checkup to ensure their settings and account protections are where they should be.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best wired or wireless gaming mouse you can buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emGA8ro9D4lNLBPQkh0oh092_xQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66870539/acastro_200323_1777_gamingMouse_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whatever your budget or grip style is, we’ve found the best gaming mouse for you.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Multiple picks for all budgets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="IQp8AK"&gt;Finding the right gaming mouse amid all the options available can be a struggle. There are a lot of factors to consider, like how it looks, how it feels in the hand, the button selection and arrangement, the quality of its sensor, and whether you want a mouse that’s wireless or wired. These details, minor as they seem, can have a major impact on your experience with the mouse you choose to buy. On the other hand, sometimes mice have features that get overblown and don’t actually work as well as advertised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOD0oD"&gt;However your taste leans, you almost certainly want the best wireless gaming mouse that your budget allows for. We’re going to make this decision easy for you. The best gaming mouse is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18531144/logitech-g502-wireless-gaming-mouse-lightspeed-price-specs-features"&gt;Logitech’s G502 Lightspeed&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the most well-rounded choice if you want comfort, a long-lasting battery, and the best selection and arrangement of buttons. The model’s design accommodates multiple grip styles, and Logitech’s companion software is unobtrusive and a breeze to use. It also has rock-solid wireless connectivity so you don’t have to deal with a wire entangling your gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbAxZF"&gt;If you don’t want a wireless mouse and are looking for the best wired gaming mouse, look no further than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;Razer DeathAdder V2&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unbeatable in the ergonomics department, with a design that feels like a natural extension of your hand. And while this model has a fairly simple layout and button selection, it’s all just within reach and responsive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBKPjC"&gt;That’s not to say that several mice released more recently haven’t tested the throne, so to speak. Our latest update ropes in a few of the latest wireless and wired models from Logitech, Razer, SteelSeries, and other brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3lO4oA"&gt;The best wireless gaming mouse: Logitech G502 Lightspeed ($150)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best gaming mouse: Logitech G502 Lightspeed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KjQweePnmr6NqW900etrvOctA34=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16219644/akrales_190507_3407_0017.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GenFNF"&gt;The Logitech G502 Lightspeed is a great gaming mouse for discerning gamers who don’t want to compromise, as well as people who have no idea what they should look for in a mouse. It’s comfortable, feature-packed, and even though it’s wireless, it’s a fast and accurate performer that doesn’t feel at a disadvantage against opponents using wired mice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJdIHm"&gt;At $150 (though sometimes sold for around $100 these days), the best doesn’t come cheap. But if you’ve tossed around the idea of making an investment in a high-end wireless mouse, no other model that I tested for this buying guide justified its price so easily. The G502 Lightspeed has Logitech’s best features for its gaming and general-use mice rolled into one. The main buttons deliver a satisfying bounce response when you tap them, and unlike some other popular models, they click easily no matter how you grip your hand on the mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIq7sZ"&gt;This mouse also features a quick-release button, a feature borrowed from other Logitech consumer-focused and gaming mice. By default, the scroll wheel staggers down a webpage with each step, which is how you expect a scroll wheel to work. Tapping the button releases the mechanism gripping the wheel, allowing it to freely sail to the bottom of a long page. It’s a small feature, but one that gives the mouse more versatility in certain situations, like being able to quickly scroll through your inventory when in a game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G502 Lightspeed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tRLAe6Nq6SE9DoYoV5sxbZJTxrk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16219645/akrales_190507_3407_0026.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G502 Lightspeed may not have the most inviting design, but it’s incredibly comfortable to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1Q3DLU"&gt;Another nice feature is the inclusion of 16 grams of additional weights you can insert into the mouse to give it more resistance. A mouse’s weight comes down to personal preference, and that could vary from game to game. This mouse is among the few modern wireless devices to give you the flexibility to change up the weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2V6RE"&gt;The fact that the G502 Lightspeed is wireless makes it that much easier to bring along with you wherever you go. But if you just can’t swing the $150 price, I suggest that you check out the $50 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GBZ4Q68/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech G502 Hero&lt;/a&gt;, which is the wired version of this mouse. It has almost every feature that you’ll find in the wireless model — except, you know, wireless capability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UBe8su"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9550529"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SUnjee"&gt;Before moving on, it’s worth mentioning where Logitech’s lineup of wireless gaming mice fits in comparison. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21562618/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-wireless-gaming-mouse-release-date-price-features-weight"&gt;G Pro X Superlight&lt;/a&gt; is a $150 option made for people who want a very lightweight mouse. It has the same Hero 25K sensor, so the tracking is just as good as the G502 Lightspeed, but it doesn’t have any extra features. In addition to being far lighter, it’s more plainly designed, with far fewer buttons. In fact, it’s pricier and has fewer buttons than the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726261308666686391" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;G Pro Wireless&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjhWDI"&gt;You’ll likely know if this is something you’d want more than our top pick, but since it’s more expensive than our top pick and less ergonomic, we still recommend the G502 Lightspeed for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1K4jR3"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="I7xlEt"&gt;The runner-up: Corsair Dark Core RGB Pro SE ($90)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RSLoek"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A cheaper alternative to the best wireless gaming mouse &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Corsair Dark Core RGB Pro SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/34H4GpKR93Xz1ejL3_3XCarRxQw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19984098/cfaulkner_200513_4020_0001.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="elmLGV"&gt;Corsair’s Dark Core RGB Pro SE high-end wireless gaming mouse comes dangerously close to dethroning our top pick. It has a comfortable, ergonomic build with a high arch that makes it easy to relax with during long gameplay sessions or to power through work. Its design is less angular and sharp-looking than the G502 Lightspeed, so you might take to it more quickly based on looks alone. Though, when I’m not paying attention to how the two mice differ in appearance, they feel equally comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxusJS"&gt;It offers USB-C charging and supports Qi wireless charging if you have a wireless charger. This mouse can switch between 2.4GHz wireless mode via its included USB dongle (cleverly tucked under its removable, magnetic wing), or Bluetooth. Of course, you’ll get better results by using the dongle, but it’s great to have options. I found that the battery life, while decent, wasn’t quite as long-lasting as the G502 Lightspeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOpEA3"&gt;Some smaller, but equally welcome, features here come in the form of that removable magnetic wing I just mentioned, which snaps onto its right side to let me comfortably rest my ring and pinky fingers on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYHfoi"&gt;The Dark Core held up nearly just as well in-game as Logitech’s mouse above, though the omission of two features made me miss using the G502 Lightspeed. It doesn’t have a dedicated sniper button, and there were a few instances where the model that I tested had a squeaky left mouse button. I don’t think it made a noise more than once every few hundred clicks, and it was tough to replicate it when I tried. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKufKm"&gt;Outside of the price differences, these two play a game of teeter-totter with features. Depending on who you ask, the Dark Core might have one or two up on the G502 Lightspeed. But Logitech’s mouse edges it out with better build quality, extra buttons (not to mention the excellent scroll wheel), and optional weights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Kf7Lfe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221795"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="4N7EgV"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="SteelSeries Aerox 3 Wireless" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YuU0vB9iDARo3BEjlybhYFTMpiM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21996070/steelseriesaerox3hero.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SteelSeries&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bgfFJw"&gt;Other good wireless options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MfOTnc"&gt;The SteelSeries &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21538891/steelseries-aerox-3-gaming-mouse-wireless-lightweight-honeycomb-water-resistant-usb-c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Aerox 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; weighs significantly less than the top and runner-up picks at just 66 grams. That’s a big perk, as is its USB-C charging, which is still a rarity among other popular models from Razer and Logitech. It can operate on 2.4GHz wireless with its included USB-C dongle, or Bluetooth, and the Aerox 3 Wireless features an IP54 rating to protect it from some water and dust. It isn’t as ergonomic as the options above. While that might not be much of an issue for people who use it simply to game, it’s not particularly comfortable to use as an all-day device. Also, I noticed that it loses connection with my PC regularly, but rather than a connectivity issue, it seems like it falls asleep to preserve power if you don’t use it for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TR1BuZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GoOPfo"&gt;Though, you don’t have to pay around $100 to get a solid wireless mouse that’s made for gaming. The $69.99 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22403511/razer-orochi-v2-wireless-gaming-mouse-battery-life-custom-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Orochi V2&lt;/a&gt; improves on Razer’s previous battery-operated gaming mouse, the Basilisk X Hyperspeed, in some big ways. The marquee feature is its long-lasting battery life. Razer claims that a single AA battery can last for up to 950 hours in this mouse’s Bluetooth mode (or up to 425 hours by switching the bottom-mounted toggle over to the 2.4GHz Hyperspeed mode that offers lower latency).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPLqgj"&gt;The Orochi V2 is an ambidextrous mouse, though it only features thumb buttons that cater to right-handed gamers. It has a similar arch in the palm section to the Basilisk X Hyperspeed that should cater to people who use a palm or fingertip grip in and out of gaming, though it’s more compact than most of Razer’s other gaming mice and might not fit larger hands well. Given the low price, you won’t find Razer’s best sensor inside, nor are there optical switches under the mouse buttons for the fastest performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8NyiUd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10481049"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2q8aDd"&gt;The best wired gaming mouse: Razer DeathAdder V2 ($70)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best wired gaming mouse: Razer DeathAdder V2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JPODoDBPSU6YYV9veJq7J9hKMOA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19832658/deathadderv2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QqAQPG"&gt;Razer’s DeathAdder V2 is proof that a wired mouse doesn’t need countless features to be worth the money. It just needs to be extremely good at the fundamentals, including being comfy enough to use for hours at a time with games that require quick reflexes, having a simple assortment of buttons that take little to no time to master, and, of course, great performance. If this matches what you want in a mouse, the $70 Razer DeathAdder V2 is the one you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oR5KE"&gt;Of all the wired gaming mice that I tested for this buying guide, no other mouse felt like a more natural extension of my hand. That’s crucial when you’re playing a game that requires precision, and it’s good to have when you just want to feel support while you’re using your computer in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0HHFi1"&gt;The DeathAdder V2’s design provides a lot of palm support, whether my fingers are flat and relaxed over the mouse or arched when I need to use faster reflexes. I use my index finger to left click and middle finger to right click; unlike most mice, this design gives me enough space on its right side to keep my ring and pinky fingers from dangling off the side and dragging on the mouse pad. That’s something I didn’t know I wanted out of a mouse until I started using this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWZiOf"&gt;Those design features keep things comfortable, but I think the part of the mouse that sold me is where my thumb rests. Many mice etch out an area for your thumb to relax and laze around. That’s fine, but I find that it necessitates more arm movement when the action ramps up. I prefer this mouse’s solution: its ergonomic design keeps my thumb wrapped around its side, naturally resting upon the edges of the customizable macro buttons. It’s good to have multiple buttons within reach, and the thumb location makes it easy for me to push the mouse around using just my wrist. It’s comfortable and has the dual purpose of keeping me limber in case I need to make sudden movements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDrU52"&gt;(Note: It’s worth mentioning before digging into specs that this mouse is rather large. If you want something a little smaller, but with the same design perks, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B3K9K6P/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check out the $49.99 DeathAdder V2 Mini&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t have the same sensor as the larger model, topping out at 8,500 DPI versus 20,000, but the complimentary grip tape that’s included is a small consolation. Alternatively, if you like the larger size of the DeathAdder V2, but want a wireless version instead, you can get that in the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FQMBKQG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DeathAdder V2 Pro, usually less than $100&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="20uVFV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221835"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zVjY6B"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fjlknf"&gt;The runner-up: BenQ Zowie’s EC2 ($69)&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BenQ Zowie EC2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3hE1MusijcYopmb66zVUU8Kdn6U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19984101/cfaulkner_200513_4020_0012.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IyFgOW"&gt;BenQ Zowie’s EC2 may be an equally good, if not better, option for some people. This $69.99 mouse is my favorite of the company’s current catalog. It’s shaped similarly to the DeathAdder V2, in that it’s ergonomic and sloped to give your palm a comfortable surface to lay on while you game or browse. What’s more, there’s a generous amount of thumb space underneath the side buttons that I found to be spacious and equally accommodating to my grip style. All of Zowie’s mice are delightfully no-frills in terms of their design, but the EC2 is the most curvy mouse the company offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8OiDu4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221807"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0oXpaI"&gt;The no-frills philosophy extends into the feature offering, but that’s not to say it’s lacking. I think the EC2 offers exactly what most gamers need, and perhaps of equal importance, nothing they don’t. This mouse features four buttons (two main, two side) and a DPI button that can be adjusted on the mouse’s bottom side. Even the more advanced settings, like adjusting lift-off distance or USB report rate, are done by holding down a unique sequence of buttons when you plug it in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="VyYR8X"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sBIvEu"&gt;Other good wired options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TeVjwP"&gt;If $150 for Logitech’s wireless G502 Lightspeed is too much for you to spend, you might want to consider this wired version, the G502 Hero. It has the same design as our pick for the best wireless gaming mouse — actually, it’s basically the same in almost every way, down to the kind of sensor it uses and its adjustable weights. That makes it almost as good, though some might take issue with its thick braided cable and the somewhat slippery plastic used on the scroll wheel that isn’t on the Lightspeed model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rm9W6Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221788"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hs4a0r"&gt;The Basilisk V2 is the wired mouse that I’d recommend to people who want the advantages of a modern Razer wired mouse, like the thin, braided SpeedFlex cable, fast performance, PTFE feet that let the mouse glide across your mouse pad, and, of course, LEDs. Despite having a design that might not fit well in everyone’s hands, it’s a smaller mouse that has more features than the DeathAdder V2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I15iEA"&gt;For instance, the Basilisk V2 has a removable sniper button that’s easy to reach. Perhaps my favorite feature here is the scroll wheel that has an adjustable tension. It’s not quite as cool as the Logitech G502’s free-spinning wheel, but you’ll probably love it if you want a custom feel to your wheel. One of the best things about this mouse is that it has most of the same features found in the more expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20947669/razer-wireless-basilisk-gaming-pc-mouse-ultimate-x-hyperspeed-battery-life-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Basilisk Ultimate, Razer’s wireless version of this mouse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gmcFzc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221776"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TsB5ht"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="KPe1W2"&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="VPma8f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oYHvRZ"&gt;The New York attorney general’s office &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/oag-fakecommentsreport.pdf"&gt;issued a report Thursday&lt;/a&gt; confirming that some of the US’s largest broadband providers engaged in a massive campaign to flood the Federal Communications Commission with fake comments in the run-up to the commission’s 2017 order to roll back net neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZBrUr"&gt;The attorney general’s multi-year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16686644/eric-schneiderman-fcc-net-neutrality-spam-investigation-evidence"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; found that fake comments accounted for the vast majority of comments received in response to the order — nearly 18 million, out of a total of 22 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fc15G3"&gt;Out of those 18 million, 8.5 million were submitted through a process called “co-registration,” which saw outside companies promising “gift cards and sweepstakes entries” in order to attract consumers to join in the campaign. They would then use that information to file form responses to the order, even as the people behind the comments had no idea their names had been used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iT0dTD"&gt;According to the report, many of these companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/10/15610744/anti-net-neutrality-fake-comments-identities"&gt;filed fake consumer responses&lt;/a&gt; as well. More than half a million fake letters to Congress were also fabricated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2AyfVK"&gt;The attorney general’s office found that the largest groups funding this influence campaign were three of the largest telecom companies in the US, together with an industry trade group. All told, the parties represented more than 65 million subscribers and a combined market value of half a trillion dollars.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zB7r1"&gt;The FCC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQhDRt"&gt;“Americans’ voices are being drowned out by masses of fake comments and messages being submitted to the government to sway decision-making,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-issues-report-detailing-millions-fake-comments-revealing"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; Thursday. “Instead of actually looking for real responses from the American people, marketing companies are luring vulnerable individuals to their websites with freebies, co-opting their identities, and fabricating responses that giant corporations are then using to influence the policies and laws that govern our lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruwBSg"&gt;The three main companies found to have falsely influenced the FCC’s rollback — Fluent, React2Media, and Opt-Intelligence — entered into settlements with the attorney general’s office, requiring the companies to pay over $4 million in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FT6nip"&gt;The attorney general’s office also found 9.3 million fake comments were sent to the FCC in support of net neutrality using false identities. “Most of these comments were submitted by a single person — a 19-year-old college student using automated software,” James said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5dnfr"&gt;Concerns were raised about automated commenting during the comment period, with a number of media outlets reporting on comments filed either by dead people or people who had no recollection of filing a comment. The New York attorney general’s office began investigating the claims &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17990758/net-neutrality-fcc-new-york-attorney-general-investigation"&gt;in November 2017&lt;/a&gt;, a month before the FCC was set to vote to repeal the Obama-era net neutrality rules.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft would like to remind you the Xbox definitely makes money</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gbrUG6gAiTeugzAcK4eE2EsejnE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245901/vpavic_4275_20201030_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4OokXO"&gt;A Microsoft executive has admitted that the company doesn’t earn any profit on sales of Xbox consoles alone. The admission came as part of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial yesterday, confirming what we’ve known for years: Microsoft sells Xbox consoles at a loss. Asked how much margin Microsoft makes on Xbox consoles, the company’s head of Xbox business development, Lori Wright, said, “We don’t; we sell the consoles at a loss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kuDVqw"&gt;An Epic Games lawyer asked a follow-up question: “Does Microsoft ever earn a profit on the sale of an Xbox console?” Wright replied, “No.” That doesn’t mean Xbox doesn’t make money, though. Microsoft was keen to point this out in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; just hours after Wright’s testimony yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVnfkQ"&gt;“The gaming business is a profitable and high-growth business for Microsoft,” says a Microsoft spokesperson. “The console gaming business is traditionally a hardware subsidy model. Game companies sell consoles at a loss to attract new customers. Profits are generated in game sales and online service subscriptions.“&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FEUW7o0SLmMH0yrqGsPtZ6aOk0A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22013076/vpavic_201103_4275_0252.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xbox Series S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NFgB6W"&gt;I asked Microsoft whether it never truly makes any margins on hardware alone, but the company didn’t respond in time for publication. Typically, Microsoft and Sony subsidize hardware at the beginning of a console’s lifecycle, but those early component costs tend to decrease over time. Those lower costs also translate to lower retail prices for consoles over time, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VhHN5"&gt;A teardown analysis of the Xbox One S, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160805005103/en/IHS-Markit-Teardown-Analysis-Microsoft%E2%80%99s-Xbox-One-S-Brings-Significant-Value-Gains-with-Minimal-Commercial-Pain"&gt;revealed an estimated bill of materials&lt;/a&gt; of $324, which is $75 less than the $399 launch price for the 2TB version of the console, back in 2016. Microsoft also launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18309223/microsoft-xbox-one-s-all-digital-edition-price-release-date"&gt;disc-less version of the Xbox One S&lt;/a&gt; two years ago, which was presumably also sold at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjHqYY"&gt;Sony and Microsoft have similar business models for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, but Nintendo is the exception. In court documents, Microsoft estimates that hardware is generating a loss for Sony, but a profit for Nintendo. That’s backed up by Nintendo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422451/nintendo-annual-earnings-switch-84-59-million"&gt;impressive 84.59 million Switch sales&lt;/a&gt; this year, up to March 31st.&lt;/p&gt;

Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial. Epic isn’t happy about Apple’s 30 percent revenue cut on in-app purchases for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, but Apple is arguing that Epic should also take issue with Microsoft or Sony’s identical 30 percent cut. It has resulted in hours of testimony about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421570/epic-apple-trial-iphone-xbox-console-specific-general-purpose-pc-testimony-day-3"&gt;whether the iPhone is more like a PC or an Xbox&lt;/a&gt;, and a debate around open platforms versus locked-down ones. Microsoft clearly sees a difference between Xbox and PC, and has only cut the amount it takes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;on the Windows side to 12 percent&lt;/a&gt;, while the Xbox remains at 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CHG6Y"&gt;Microsoft obviously wants to maintain its business model for Xbox, and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/19/4445984/xbox-one-policy-reversal-changes"&gt;attempted to push&lt;/a&gt; the industry toward digital games for years. Microsoft has very much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22411686/microsoft-windows-store-game-fees-change-apple-app-store-epic-games-eu"&gt;sided with Epic Games in the case against Apple&lt;/a&gt;, and Epic has admitted it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22411686/microsoft-windows-store-game-fees-change-apple-app-store-epic-games-eu"&gt;never even questioned&lt;/a&gt; Microsoft’s digital sales cut. But how long this harmony will exist between the pair will very much depend on the future of digital game sales and cloud gaming. Microsoft is increasingly focused on its Xbox Game Pass subscription, which spans across devices that aren’t even Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCjUkY"&gt;Game Pass also includes xCloud, Microsoft’s cloud gaming technology. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407849/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-epic-games-block"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;isn’t part of xCloud&lt;/a&gt;, because Epic Games won’t allow it. That highlights the emerging battles that are starting to take place in the game industry over shares of revenue. It looks like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415712/microsoft-xbox-store-cut-epic-games-court-documents"&gt;Microsoft has been preparing&lt;/a&gt; for some of them, but &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; feels like the beginning of a greater war over the digital future of game stores.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The final trailer for A Quiet Place Part II drops over a year after I thought it came out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IwJNCs0EL9X7zDY_EPip8t2htI8=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245877/a_quiet_place_part_ii_AQP2_03710R_rgb.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Jonny Cournoyer / Paramount Pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="afYANt"&gt;Over a year after &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place Part II&lt;/em&gt; was set to release, Paramount has dropped the final trailer for it. It looks pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08vobL"&gt;Paramount made the decision to pull the movie from the schedule back in March 2020 due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21176712/a-quiet-place-part-2-delay-paramount-coronavirus-concerns"&gt;concerns over the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, director and star of the first film &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/johnkrasinski/status/1238115296017371137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1238115296017371137%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F3%2F12%2F21176712%2Fa-quiet-place-part-2-delay-paramount-coronavirus-concerns"&gt;John Krasinski tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that he was proud of it, but felt it needed to be seen in a theater for true impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x5sOyy"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BpdDN9d9Jio?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Js27R9"&gt;The problem was Paramount had already blown its marketing budget for the movie when it was pulled from the release schedule. The world premiere was held in New York on March 8th, 2020. Critics saw it and many published glowing first reactions to it. Plenty of my friends saw it in early screenings and told me it was great. Emily Blunt appeared on talk shows hyping it. Billboards and murals went up all over the country with a big March 20th, 2020 release date plastered on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNOGFu"&gt;Then &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place Part II&lt;/em&gt;’s release was pulled and, at least in my neighborhood, no one rented the billboards and murals after the release date came and went. Ten-foot tall images of a beleaguered Emily Blunt and her kids making their way through an abandoned city lingered for months in my partially abandoned New York neighborhood. Every day I’d walk my dog on empty streets, and pass by them — weird time capsules of the before time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCilbR"&gt;And I guess I just forgot the film never actually came out. Until today’s final trailer dropped, I just assumed it had come out, and everyone but me saw it, and then Paramount just didn’t put it on Paramount+ for reasons known only to Paramount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqTCDp"&gt;But with millions of Americans vaccinated, and theaters slowly moving toward reopening, &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place Part II&lt;/em&gt; is finally getting its big release. If you are like me and had assumed it already came out, you can now look forward to May 28th, 2021, when it really will, for totally real this time, be released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9EMWc"&gt;And if you’re wary of actually going to a theater, given an alarming number of Americans are unvaccinated for a wide variety of reasons, and you’d prefer to watch it at home as we’ve all learned to consume our big-budget flicks, then good news! Paramount has confirmed &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place Part II&lt;/em&gt; will be on Paramount+ 45 days after it premieres in theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iainRg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus Watch gets an always-on display — at the cost of half its battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Piqc2cn4rbtJfTTv3Xqksy4ApRo=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245840/dseifert_4521_oneplus_watch_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HHoNyQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oneplus-watch-software-update-b-48-change-log.1431439/"&gt;OnePlus has released its latest update&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380322/oneplus-watch-review-price-specs-features"&gt;OnePlus Watch&lt;/a&gt;, adding its promised always-on display mode that was absent on the device when it first launched in April. But being able to always see the time on OnePlus’ smartwatch comes at a big cost, with the company cautioning that the new mode will halve the expected battery life when using it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="L4Nvx6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus Watch review: big, basic, and boring","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22380322/oneplus-watch-review-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5UeCtn"&gt;The release of the always-on display was surprisingly swift for OnePlus, which announced that it planned to add the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395791/oneplus-watch-smartwatch-always-on-display-update"&gt;just two weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;. The company says in a blog post that the B.48 update that adds the new feature will arrive for a “small percentage” of users first, with wider rollout over the coming days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idjpPy"&gt;In addition to enabling the always-on display, the B.48 update also adds the option to use the OnePlus Watch as a remote camera button, a new “Marathon” workout mode, and other improvements, optimizations, and bug fixes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZZ46m"&gt;While the new always-on display option does fix one of the OnePlus Watch’s glaring absences, the fact that it comes with such a big hit in battery life makes it a tougher trade-off for users (especially given that battery life was one of the watch’s highlights.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkBZVO"&gt;The full OnePlus Watch B.48 update changelog is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OBpZXI"&gt;Add Always-on Display dial*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HnSjVO"&gt;Remote Control Camera function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zp0ihA"&gt;Add Marathon workout&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4FBhkg"&gt;Improvements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O3KGgf"&gt;Optimize system UI details&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsIhXq"&gt;Fix known issues and improve system stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YG0m6P"&gt;*After Always-on Display dial is turned on, the screen remains constantly on. This will lead to increased power consumption. Battery life will be reduced by about half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>This could be your last chance to order gifts that’ll arrive by Mother’s Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kindle Paperwhite" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xqhZ5E6a1GmdNFCRSKwUk9hcb-w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245828/akrales_181101_3056_0200.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HRCzbE"&gt;Mother’s Day is Sunday, May 9th. You knew that though. That’s why you already got Mom a gift. Nice going... Wait, you haven’t done that yet? Today is likely the cut-off date for guaranteeing that orders placed online will get where they need to be by Sunday (you may have luck tomorrow, but I wouldn’t push it, personally). So, without further delay, let’s load you up with a few last-minute ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPaTg3"&gt;Firstly, our team has already compiled a big, varied list of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22358371/mothers-day-gifts-ideas-best-mom-tech-gadgets"&gt;Mother’s Day gift ideas right here&lt;/a&gt;. It’s refreshed to reflect the strange year that 2020 was and that 2021 is proving to be. There are fun gifts in there, as well as practical ones. Check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EOweJI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10443858"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GpZDC0"&gt;The latest &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ96B6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Kindle Paperwhite is $35 off&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $95. We’ve seen a slightly lower price on this before, but it’s still a good value if you’re looking for an e-reader that’s waterproof and has a sharp, easy-to-read display. This model is ad-supported, so its lockscreen will display an ad.

    <title>The art of making simple but tough rhythm games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U3QIFgE4o3RFy5suJarM8UhNyRM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245754/ss_7dc2c278e2c6c2346c8f1a9a0ec30ddfc3d502ca.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unbeatable.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: D-Cell Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Unbeatable and Rhythm Doctor make the genre more accessible — and challenging&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="seA3kE"&gt;From the trailer’s opening, with its striking, pastel-colored anime visuals, loud rock guitar riffs, and energetic vocals, &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dcellgames/unbeatable"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;looks and sounds &lt;em&gt;incredible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyn7DE"&gt;Wrapped in turn-of-the-millennium influences in both its anime and rock aesthetic, it looks like a game from the Dreamcast era, with its tagline calling it “a game where music is illegal and you do crimes” recalling the youthful rebellious spirit of &lt;em&gt;Jet Set Radio&lt;/em&gt;. But as the trailer for its successful Kickstarter shows, it’s also part of a new wave of indie rhythm games, alongside early access title &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/774181/Rhythm_Doctor/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where accessibility is at the forefront. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLu0Pj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt; may have aesthetics inspired by Japanese rhythm games, where in the arcades they are known either for peripherals or for demanding intimidating dextrous feats, but its inputs are much simpler. As pink-haired protagonist Beat, players use just two buttons to hit oncoming enemies and objects much like notes approaching on top and bottom lanes from either the left and right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwbgBN"&gt;The format, which had one fan dubbing it “street-style Taiko,” went through some iteration since the project first materialized with a public demo at 2019’s MAGFest, as the developer D-Cell Games explained to me over Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIkyrB"&gt;“That version was four buttons, and what we actually found was, ironically, that made the game too easy for the people who were really into rhythm games but too hard for anyone who was coming in new,” explains RJ Lake, &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt;’s writer and music supervisor. “Cutting it to two buttons made it way more approachable if you have no idea what a rhythm game is or how rhythm games are supposed to play. But then because there’s only two buttons to pay attention to, we can throw a lot more at the player without them feeling overwhelmed, which means our songs can be mapped in a much more complex way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="oRajVw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j-xFczhoZb8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nb8Uvt"&gt;Even though &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt;’s songs are played to note charts typical of the genre, the team actually took their cue from action games, which can be seen with how the buttons correspond to the visuals as Beat attacks, dodges, or combos different notes. “We wanted to draft a rhythm system that felt like playing an action combat game akin to a PlatinumGames title,” says Jeffrey Chiao, the game’s producer and level designer. “I think what was the initial accepted draft that we built with was something along the lines of &lt;em&gt;One Finger Death Punch&lt;/em&gt;, which is not actually a rhythm game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWpTFG"&gt;That approach has, incidentally, thrown some players for a loop. Instead of just watching oncoming notes to hit on cue, you might also be avoiding others by hitting the opposite button, while more devious are blue notes that need a 1-2 combo follow-up. While the team is aware of the feedback and aims to balance it, those elements are still very much intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8tbQY"&gt;“The blue note design is a pretty good example of trying to hit in that action, where the down and up is kind of like in &lt;em&gt;Devil May Cry&lt;/em&gt; when you do a launcher and then juggle the enemy that’s thrown up in the air,” adds Chiao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xOViY9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“For me, rhythm games are also much more of a casual thing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xHEIwH"&gt;The team is only too aware of the ridiculously high level of play certain rhythm aficionados can reach, but ultimately accessibility has been an important priority. “I loved &lt;em&gt;Elite Beat Agents&lt;/em&gt; and crushed that game in one sitting when it came out,” says Lake. “But for me, rhythm games are also much more of a casual thing. When I’m working on the project, a thing I try to focus on is making sure that people who aren’t going to sit down and endlessly play the same song to full-combo perfection, but want to come in and just enjoy music in an interactive way, will still be invested in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lre7OP"&gt;Some accessibility options are already apparent in the demo, such as reducing the visual clutter with various toggles (the aim is for more granular customization for the final product) and even an option to lose the game’s intentionally fuzzy filter, which gives it the vibe of a long-lost bootleg VHS recording of a cult anime. “There’s nothing harder in the world at this point, we’ve realized, than trying to make a game that everyone will like,” says Lake. “But at the very least, we’d like to settle for a game that everyone can play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KYks7udaAa0sK4ujM7jmSm5AH3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489115/ss_ec7ff92bacd37cf1242079931cf0ad7a1a1aadc2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1TcoLu"&gt;Preceding &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable,&lt;/em&gt; however, is &lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor&lt;/em&gt;, which is arguably even more accessible, as it’s all limited to just one button. This mimics your role as a remote medical intern tasked with hitting a defibrillator to treat patients with strange ailments. But anyone who’s played it will also know that the simple premise of smacking the space bar at the seventh beat of a tune is more devilishly difficult than it lets on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNPp4r"&gt;Development has been far from straightforward. The project has been going on for almost a decade; it first started as a college summer project that resulted in a Flash demo. The one-button design was in part due to developer Hafiz Azman’s dislike of the multi-button dexterity demanded by most rhythm games. “After the first few levels were released as a Flash demo, it became a kind of challenge to myself to see how far I could go without ever introducing a second button,” he tells me over email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="30Viow"&gt;Part of why &lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor&lt;/em&gt; has taken so long to make is also the challenge of keeping within those constraints, where in some cases a boss level might have taken hundreds of hours to iterate and perfect. “There’s tons of concepts and even full levels that we threw away, a lot of times it’s because the level isn’t delightful or surprising enough,” he continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PHQuc0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It gets difficult to squeeze out the surprise from a simple mechanic”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nsZoiY"&gt;“It gets difficult to squeeze out the surprise from a simple mechanic, but I think that struggle is also necessary. I read somewhere that the writing team behind &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt; held to that principle of writing without looking ahead too much — they’d write themselves into a corner that they had no idea how to get their characters out of, and then sit in the writing room and struggle until they figured out something. The end result would be surprising to them, and as a result, surprising to the viewers too. I guess we ended up following that philosophy by sticking so adamantly to our constraints.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1R25i"&gt;Another reason for sticking to the one-button mechanic was because &lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor&lt;/em&gt; was designed to be “blind-friendly,” which in theory meant that visuals mattered less. Of course, part of the game’s delight and deviousness is down to its deliberately distortive and distracting visuals designed to throw players off. Indeed, you might have an easier time by shutting your eyes and just focusing on listening to the beat in your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jc0rkw"&gt;“We actually needed to put extra effort in the visuals because, if the visuals are technically redundant, that means we have a lot more flexibility to do anything we want with it, so our ceiling of what to achieve is higher if we want to use everything we could potentially do,” explains Azman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVn5y7"&gt;It’s the simplicity of the design that then allows for more complex layers to be built on top of it, such as the night modes that provide an alternative version of a song with a more difficult twist. “For example, the first level in the game is about counting to seven only with no other mechanics. So for the night shift version, I settled on using dubstep because that genre tends to have bass sounds that change rhythms quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="9jt84B"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BaF2YFhLaok?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OEzrFh"&gt;Arguably, being able to prove these concepts in early stages, whether it’s a demo or early access, has been key to the successful reception these games have so far gotten. Meanwhile, D-Cell Games has already gone above and beyond by not only dropping an “arcade mix” &lt;a href="https://dcellgames.itch.io/unbeatable-arcade-mix"&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; at the start of &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt;’s Kickstarter campaign, but also following it up with a “white label” demo that tells a side story showcasing the game’s narrative adventure elements (although at time of writing, this hasn’t yet been made available).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kLpL4"&gt;Granted, &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt; actually achieved its $55,000 funding goal before the demo had even gone live, but its success is a stark contrast to the crowdfunding misfortunes of rhythm game &lt;em&gt;Project Rap Rabbit&lt;/em&gt; a few years ago. Even a project with the combined talents of legendary rhythm studios NanaOn-Sha (&lt;em&gt;PaRappa the Rapper&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vib-Ribbon&lt;/em&gt;) and iNiS (&lt;em&gt;Gitaroo Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Elite Beat Agents&lt;/em&gt;) couldn’t get funded. While that could be down to the much higher funding goal (its final pledges actually amounted to slightly more than what &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt; currently has), it also suffered from failing to present actual gameplay footage that could communicate what kind of rhythm game it was meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cz05z"&gt;“Messaging is so, so important when you launch your Kickstarter,” says Lake. “If you do not have any external aesthetic sense, and you’re not hiring people or working with people who have the ability to make a project really shine in someone else’s eyes, you’re not going to have people want to even look at it to begin with. It’s so important to present the project well and make sure people aren’t confused or have any of those lingering questions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijuvHW"&gt;Azman mentions that early in development, he was actually approached by indie publisher Humble based on &lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor&lt;/em&gt;’s Flash demo, although nothing came of it. “They went silent for weeks, but got back to us saying they couldn’t get anyone else in the team to see how a single-button mechanic where you just press space on the seventh beat could ever support a full game,” he says. “It was clear people much more experienced than us thought it wasn’t wise to stick to a constraint, but we did it anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoFt4h"&gt;Rhythm has always been integral in games, whether showing up as a mini-game or as an underlying mechanic to something as hardcore and mainstream as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/animturnbull/status/1116028893125677057?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Another recent trend has been to explicitly mash rhythm up with other genres as a hybrid, such as dungeon-crawling roguelike &lt;em&gt;Crypt of the NecroDancer&lt;/em&gt; or first-person shooter &lt;em&gt;BPM: Bullets Per Minute&lt;/em&gt;, although Azman is less interested by these: “It’s a personal preference, but adding rhythm to an existing genre feels like it inhibits the freedom that was there before, rather than adding something exciting to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="MOS0np"&gt;But with both &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor&lt;/em&gt;, it’s an exciting time for the genre to go back to basics, finding the joy of rhythm in its pure, distilled form. As Lake puts it, “We want to bring more types of people to get the basic joy of pressing buttons in response to a beat. There’s something just gut-level brain-tingling about doing that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stranger Things 4’s latest teaser is a glimpse of Eleven’s dark past</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Stranger Things 4" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bZrEWuS4ebQ_JfXfUH9N_XMV0c4=/302x0:2090x1192/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245554/Screen_Shot_2021_05_06_at_9.08.12_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rGwIZU"&gt;It’s been a long time since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/30/20891537/stranger-things-netflix-renewed-season-four-hawkins-duffer-brothers-deal-tv"&gt;Netflix first announced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4 &lt;/em&gt;— the upcoming fourth season of the streamer’s hugely popular series — but there’s finally a new trailer teasing the next adventures of the Hawkins gang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LlEkwc"&gt;The new teaser appears to be a flashback, showing the sinister Dr. Martin Brenner addressing a group of children at the same facility that Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) originated from. Presumably, the new season will continue to explore Eleven’s origins, as well as potentially introduce other supernatural children (something the show has explored before back in season 2.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FI1yE1"&gt;The new trailer is technically the second for the upcoming fourth season, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137590/netflix-stranger-things-4-trailer-character-teaser-missing-return"&gt;following a teaser released back in February 2020&lt;/a&gt; that promised the return of the — spoilers for season 3 — presumably dead (in an extradimensional portal explosion) Chief Jim Hopper, played by David Harbour. Based on the captions of the two videos (001/004 and 002/004, respectively), it seems that fans should expect two more teasers on the way at some point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHOZg9"&gt;The lengthy amount of time between that last teaser and today’s new trailer is because Netflix was only able to get in two weeks of filming at the beginning of 2020 due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; work on the series only resumed last September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drcJLW"&gt;Netflix has yet to announce a release date for the fourth season, but presumably, with the marketing campaign ramping up again, it won’t be too far off before &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4&lt;/em&gt; debuts. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s HomePod and HomePod mini can now integrate with music streaming service Deezer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S7Fh8ctVESXqYoMA1hXQE_RR3m4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245527/dseifert_201107_4281_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hKd53X"&gt;Owners of Apple’s HomePod and HomePod mini can now connect their smart speakers directly to Deezer and make the music streaming service their default player. That means they can take advantage of the HomePod’s Siri voice controls to navigate their tunes and playlists on Deezer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJnhri"&gt;To connect the services, you’ll first need to be a paying Deezer subscriber. If you are, head to the Deezer app on your iOS device (make sure you’re on iOS 14.3 or later), hit the settings cog in the top right, then scroll down and hit “Connect with HomePod.” You can then play music from Deezer on your Apple speakers by saying “Hey Siri, play [insert cool and relevant band of choice] on Deezer&lt;em&gt;.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u5PDD0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s smart speakers now work directly with Deezer, but still no Spotify&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5oidUz"&gt;Alternatively,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;you can make Deezer your default player from Apple’s Home app and avoid having to specify which streaming service to use. We weren’t able to test this ourselves, but it’s likely the same process as for other third-party streaming services. So go to Home Settings by hitting the house icon in the top left of Apple’s Home app, tap on your face under the “People” section,” then go to “Default Service” and choose Deezer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzwbri"&gt;Phew. Isn’t it fantastic when these services &lt;em&gt;just work&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AShI0p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple HomePod mini review: playing small ball","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="c3dlfx"&gt;Of course, the struggle to offer these sorts of basic, third-party integrations is exactly what’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16976906/apple-homepod-review-smart-speaker"&gt;hurt&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s smart speakers, likely contributing to the company’s decision to discontinue the original HomePod in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini"&gt;March this year&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, the reasonably-priced and good-sounding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;HomePod mini&lt;/a&gt; still soldiers on. In addition to Deezer, these devices can now directly integrate with other streaming services including Apple Music, iHeartRadio, TuneIn, and Pandora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuR9VH"&gt;What’s missing from this list, of course, is Spotify. Although Apple says it’s enabled integration with the music streaming giant, as far as we know Spotify hasn’t switched things on at its end. If you’re searching for an explanation, look no further than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;huge lawsuit Spotify is currently pursuing against Apple&lt;/a&gt;. As an alternative, you can use Spotify to play music on HomePod speakers, but you’ll need to connect via AirPlay, which is frustratingly slow and lacks voice controls — one of the big draws of using a smart speaker at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82dyym"&gt;But hey, that’s what you, the unlucky consumer, get for being stuck between two warring corporations. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
