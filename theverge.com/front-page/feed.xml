    <title>Ubisoft’s game subscription service now supports Google Stadia for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bJh8lP9LWXm3RHdpDZdV4VcISL8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510347/acastro_190528_1777_ubisoft_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t1CkH8"&gt;Ubisoft announced on Monday that its game subscription service, Ubisoft Plus, is adding support for Google Stadia, meaning any subscriber can sign up for a free Stadia account and stream Ubisoft games from the cloud on supported devices. Ubisoft first announced Stadia support in October when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535105/ubisoft-plus-uplay-subscription-service-google-stadia-amazon-luna-pc-gaming"&gt;rebranded from UPlay Plus into its current iteration&lt;/a&gt;, but the cloud gaming integration wasn’t ready at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvECNA"&gt;The rollout will take a few days to reach all users, Ubisoft says, and it’s only available to US subscribers at the moment. Those eligible should be able to find the option to link their Stadia account to their Ubisoft Plus profile from Ubisoft’s website. The company says subscribers will not be required to also purchase Google’s Stadia Pro subscription; because Stadia has a free tier, that’s all you’ll need to stream Ubisoft games, though Stadia Pro does provide 4K streaming while the free tier caps at 1080p. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yS7qOZ"&gt;Ubisoft Plus costs $14.99 a month and offers access to PC versions of first-party Ubisoft games, including new releases like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;. Now, with Stadia support, you won’t need a powerful PC to play some of the more recent and technically demanding Ubisoft games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sIuG94"&gt;Ubisoft Plus also supports Amazon’s Luna cloud gaming service, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525435/amazon-luna-early-access-cloud-gaming"&gt;became available in beta back in October&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/5tYHOyUKA0j141UXfEj4RO/ubisoft-now-available-on-amazon-luna"&gt;began supporting Ubisoft Plus last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mVDQB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Health care workers in US start receiving COVID-19 vaccines</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-VACCINE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T-aqZZDQGY2HZM47aPqjgPDrPRc=/0x0:5400x3600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510335/1230124244.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Michelle Chester prepares a COVID-19 vaccine in New York.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Mark Lennihan / POOL / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mhdvWp"&gt;Just after 9AM on Monday, Sandra Lindsay, a critical care nurse in Queens, New York, was vaccinated against COVID-19. Lindsay was one of the first people in the United States to get a dose of the newly authorized Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and was the first to get the shot in New York, an early epicenter of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blkq4d"&gt;“I hope this marks the beginning of the end of a painful time in our history,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rtyCHM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Breaking: A critical care nurse in Queens, Sandra Lindsay, is the first New Yorker to be vaccinated in a non-trial capacity after the first doses of Pfizer’s vial arrived at Northwell Health this morning. “It didn’t feel any different from taking any other vaccine,” Lindsay said. &lt;a href="https://t.co/KSaYEQUTHE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/KSaYEQUTHE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Spectrum News NY1 (@NY1) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NY1/status/1338490930723217408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4v7N3y"&gt;Lindsay was vaccinated just two days after the Food and Drug Administration issued an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22158608/fda-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-authorized-emergency-use"&gt;Emergency Use Authorization&lt;/a&gt; (EUA) for the Pfizer and BioNTech product. The announcement marked the end of a record-breaking push to develop a vaccine against the deadly disease and the start of an unprecedented campaign to vaccinate millions of people in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehaQLL"&gt;As soon as the authorization was handed down, Pfizer’s factory &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/11/world/covid-19-coronavirus#millions-of-pfizer-vaccine-doses-to-be-shipped-immediately-after-fda-approval"&gt;started preparing&lt;/a&gt; doses for shipment. Trucks left the company’s Michigan facility on Sunday, headed for the airport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XE8fO5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Breaking - UPS and FedEx trucks carrying the first U.S. shipment of coronavirus vaccine have left Pfizer’s facility near Kalamazoo, Michigan. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Cf32ki9gCF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Cf32ki9gCF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Pete Muntean (@petemuntean) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/petemuntean/status/1338116009190944769?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oYMpt6"&gt;Shipments touched down all over the country this morning, and other health care workers joined Lindsay as the first group of vaccine recipients. Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center coordinated the first shots after a countdown of “three, two, one, vaccinate.” Staff at Hartford HealthCare in Connecticut got their first doses at an outdoor tent, surrounded by cameras and reporters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fFNPp4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The first Ohioans have been vaccinated at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OSUWexMed?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@OSUWexMed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/aPCztnVTww"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aPCztnVTww&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Max Garrison (@m_p_garrison) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/m_p_garrison/status/1338511321864630272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="qBFhfg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And with that, the vaccination has begun. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hartford HealthCare’s Dr. Ajay Kumar becomes the first person in Connecticut, and one of the first nationally, to receive the COVID-19 vaccine since its authorization. &lt;a href="https://t.co/DesXwqWlBN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DesXwqWlBN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alex Putterman (@AlexPutterman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlexPutterman/status/1338511224577855490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZlkmh"&gt;Other hospitals will take a few more days to begin vaccinations. Boston Medical Center &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mbebinger/status/1338499436457160705"&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt; to start Tuesday or Wednesday, for example. Some doctors said on Twitter that they still &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/notdred/status/1338493555334115329"&gt;haven’t gotten information&lt;/a&gt; about when their shots will be scheduled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7H6MhQ"&gt;The FDA is expected to authorize the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at the end of this week, and if it does, shipments of that product will&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;start to roll out across the country as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAMofq"&gt;Operation Warp Speed, the federal partnership behind vaccine development, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/07/pledge-to-vaccinate-20-million-against-covid19-in-december-seems-unrealistic/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that 20 million people could be vaccinated against COVID-19 by the end of the year. Some hospitals say that &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/07/pledge-to-vaccinate-20-million-against-covid19-in-december-seems-unrealistic/"&gt;seems unrealistic&lt;/a&gt; because of the logistical challenges of coordinating shots and shifting expectations around the number of doses they’ll receive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99vFgm"&gt;Despite all efforts to accelerate the distribution of the vaccine, COVID-19 cases are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/12/22158376/covid-vaccine-pfizer-public-health-antivirus"&gt;still surging&lt;/a&gt; around the country. It’ll be a few months before the vaccine is able to slow down the spread of death and disease. Still, the first injections are a scientific triumph — and for many people in the US, they are a bright sign of hope at the end of a long, dark year.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom calls are beginning to arrive on the Google Nest Hub Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YkD5zDHpaU9o_8zI9uuBBthB3DM=/280x133:1343x842/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510295/Zoom_on_Nest_Hub_Max.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IF4S7P"&gt;Google is starting to roll out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21373661/zoom-smart-displays-facebook-portal-google-nest-amazon-echo-show"&gt;Zoom support for the Nest Hub Max &lt;/a&gt;smart display as an early preview for users in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, the company announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcmoKY"&gt;People who are using a Google or Nest Wi-Fi system may see some improvements to video calls, Google also announced. It’s updating the devices to automatically be able to detect and prioritize video call traffic for Google Meet and Zoom, which may help if your video calls have been a little choppy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJNPqN"&gt;As the holidays approach, it’s the perfect time for this update, as more and more people are going to be making video calls to friends and family. Zoom has been an especially popular service this year as social distancing measures and shutdowns have forced people to celebrate together remotely. The Nest Hub Max is getting Zoom after &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/rave-zoom-on-facebook-portal/"&gt;Facebook added the service to its Portal devices&lt;/a&gt; back in September, but before Amazon rolls it out to its Echo Show devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHthep"&gt;This kind of smart display is popular with people who want the functionality of a smart speaker, but want to do more than the audio-only devices allow — and that includes video calls. Facebook offers their range of Portal devices with four sizes to choose from (ranging from 8 inches to literally your TV), but you’ll have to contend with their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18072998/facebook-portal-plus-smart-display-messenger-review-price-specs"&gt;not so privacy-friendly reputation&lt;/a&gt;. The Nest Hub Max, at $229, is pricier, but just plain does more, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;which is reflected in our review score&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnAaD2"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;also reviews well&lt;/a&gt; for its good display, sound, and Alexa support, but doesn’t yet have support for Zoom, and it’s not clear when that’ll be coming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Two people showing off a gingerbread house using their Google Nest Hub Max" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cHVSPu3kofPeHmNys6utpZ1jVkY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22163969/holiday_blog_image.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even Google knows that these devices are best for flexing your culinary creations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S0XSXk"&gt;If you choose to pick up the Google device, or if you already have one, you can try out the Zoom feature by &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9905737"&gt;linking your Zoom and Google accounts&lt;/a&gt;. Once you do, you can control the feature with your voice, using commands like “Hey Google, join my next meeting” or “Hey Google, start a Zoom call.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGToGR"&gt;The hands-free commands will be useful, since these devices are popular in the kitchen, so you won’t have to get dough on the display to flex your awesome Christmas cookies thanks to a year of pandemic baking.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo unite on new set of safety principles for online gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rj-BBeBH86R_AoIMXKRzVgwVez4=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510175/Hero_Image_12112020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft / Sony / Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="As03P6"&gt;Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo, who among them effectively control the entirety of the console gaming market, have announced a shared set of safety guidelines for how they’ll moderate and police their online platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhTInj"&gt;“Protecting players online requires a multidisciplinary approach,” the statement, which was posted &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/14/shared-safety-principles/"&gt;simultaneously&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/online-safety-principles/"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sie.com/en/blog/shared-online-safety-principles/"&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt;, reads. “One that combines the benefits of advanced technology, a supportive community, and skilled human oversight.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNyhFU"&gt;The principles have been published as increasing numbers of games, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18261532/fortnite-patch-xbox-one-ps4-cross-play-default-battle-royale"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496885/apex-legends-cross-play-beta-launch-ps4-xbox-pc-compete"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496885/apex-legends-cross-play-beta-launch-ps4-xbox-pc-compete"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, are offering crossplay among the different platforms, allowing gamers to play together regardless of which hardware they’re using. However, the feature could cause problems if each platform’s rules are enforced differently. The new principles should help each console manufacturer follow similar approaches to keeping players safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vRSCy4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This partnership signifies our commitment to work together”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vJ48o0"&gt;In the past, Sony has cited potential differences like these as the reason for not allowing PS4 gamers to play against other consoles. Back in 2017, PlayStation global sales and marketing head Jim Ryan &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-13-sony-defends-decision-to-block-cross-play-with-xbox-one-and-nintendo-switch"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the reason the company wasn’t supporting crossplay in &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; was that the company didn’t want to expose its players to online environments outside of its control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GT0DA"&gt;“We have a contract with the people who go online with us, that we look after them and they are within the PlayStation curated universe,” Ryan said. “Exposing what in many cases are children to external influences we have no ability to manage or look after, it’s something we have to think about very carefully.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJ01KC"&gt;Sony later walked back its position, and allowed for crossplay between consoles in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/14/18182389/rocket-league-cross-play-enabled-ps4-switch-xbox-pc"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/14/18182389/rocket-league-cross-play-enabled-ps4-switch-xbox-pc"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt;. It has allowed other games on its platform to support the feature since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwNPtF"&gt;The new principles come under three main categories; prevention, partnership, and responsibility. Prevention covers allowing players to customize their privacy controls, to promote the existence of these options and make them easy to use. Partnership, meanwhile, includes pledges to cooperate with other organizations and ratings agencies on safety initiatives. Finally, responsibility includes a commitment to be transparent about rules, and to make it easy for players to report when people break the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHaV2m"&gt;“This partnership signifies our commitment to work together to improve player safety and ensure gaming remains truly for everyone,” the statement reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XgrB2"&gt;The announcement doesn’t contain any details about specific policy changes any of the companies are making, but the solidarity is notable in an industry where competition among them is often characterized as a “war.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2020: bad year, good gadgets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OQqLTrxs-WRnsuQMaVYmqYyoRIE=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68509995/VRG_ILLO_4320_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Game hardware and laptops both started promising new generations&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="if2UI8"&gt;It doesn’t feel right to praise much of anything in 2020, but here goes: the gadgets were good. In a year when many of us have been more dependent than ever on our screens to stay connected, do our jobs, and just stay sane, the technology behind them has been better than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdyWAj"&gt;Big tech promised generational changes in consumer technology this year. The new Macs and the new gaming hardware we got in 2020 really have kicked off noticeably different and better eras in computing. I don’t like using grandiose phrases like “eras in computing,” but there’s really no other way to put it. Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Sony, and AMD &lt;em&gt;actually delivered&lt;/em&gt; on their bombastic claims. That’s not usually how it goes. It’s a little bewildering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwVwTa"&gt;So yes, there were the usual hits and misses in this year’s gadgets, but what’s different is the hits were blockbusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7vIpR"&gt;The biggest star has to be the M1 chip in Apple’s new laptops and the Mac Mini. We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;very nearly gave the MacBook Air a perfect score&lt;/a&gt;. Normally, a processor transition means app incompatibility problems that go on for years, but you have to go to strange edge cases to find apps that just don’t work. Normally, apps designed for the old chips run slow, but in some cases, they run faster on the M1. Normally, speed improvements and battery improvements are measured in single percentage points, but these laptops are astonishingly fast and last forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="UnRvkH"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="M1 MacBook Pro and Air review: Apple delivers|96773" data-volume-uuid="6412f55d2" data-volume-id="96773" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-402" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jF9l52"&gt;It’s hard to express what a big deal this is. More than once, we would have to double- and triple-check our test results because they seemed too good to be true. I do not know how Windows PCs are going to respond. Thus far, emulated apps that run in Windows on Arm have been slow and buggy, while Intel-based machines are unlikely to match the M1’s battery life. It’s going to be a tough row for the entire PC industry to hoe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNU2EG"&gt;Then there’s the new slate of gaming hardware, which all seemed to land at once and which all seem to be impossible to find at any retail site. Before this year, getting 4K, HDR, and high refresh rates all at the same time was a stretch goal at best. After 2020, it’s accessible on PC or console (assuming you can find the hardware in stock and buy it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snHnKU"&gt;The new graphics cards from both Nvidia and AMD &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;force away the trade-offs gamers usually have to make in their graphics settings&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-reviewhttps://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and S&lt;/a&gt; don’t have a slate of next-gen launch titles, but they have competently and quietly made existing games run faster and look better. And they also have a ton of potential for the future with Microsoft’s Game Pass Ultimate subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="iEsayI"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="PlayStation 5 Review: a next-gen feel|96572" data-volume-uuid="eae294ab6" data-volume-id="96572" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-864" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uXiAyI"&gt;The Playstation 5, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;surprised us all by having a new controller that offers some genuinely new and engaging experiences&lt;/a&gt;. It seems weird to enthuse about haptics and trigger resistance, but you really can feel the difference. The PS5’s fundamentals as a console are also strong — though the design of course remains polarizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9kKAs"&gt;Taken as a whole, the new PC graphics cards and the new consoles really do represent the beginning of a set of next-gen gaming experiences. And unlike the last time we got a big console refresh, it doesn’t seem like any of them have significantly stumbled out of the gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGeWA1"&gt;The phones of 2020 were also great. It’s hard to remember because it was a thousand years ago, but Samsung’s Galaxy S20 line launched in March as the first flagship 5G phones. It’s weird to suggest that anything Samsung does is quiet, but the S20 and S20 plus were just quietly the best Android phones this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="TgPWVL"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Samsung Galaxy S20 review: better than the Ultra|75203" data-volume-uuid="dc391ca04" data-volume-id="75203" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-439" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSFjkN"&gt;5G turned out to be the most explicit claim to making something “next generation” that did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; pan out. In the US especially, 5G is only slightly better than 4G for people who can find a signal in the first place. Even so, the phones that were meant to usher in the 5G era were great — not because they had 5G, but because they were simply well-made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yabrti"&gt;The new iPhones were also great — and launched along with a confident claim that “5G is real now.” But as with Samsung’s phones, the iPhone 12 lineup is great despite 5G, not because of it. The iPhone 12 mini, in particular, finally made a top-tier phone available to people who have felt that everything since the iPhone 5S was too big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GytRYJ"&gt;Hell, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 finally made good on the promise of the original&lt;/a&gt;. Overpriced and blingy? Yes. But also a really good little tablet that folds up. I know at least one &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor who I shall not name (it’s not me) who bought one and loves it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovOg71"&gt;Then there are the gadgets that don’t purport to be next-gen anything but nevertheless were simply &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG G14 Zephyrus gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;GoPro Hero 9&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21550181/dji-mavic-mini-2-drone-4k-price-release-date-battery-life"&gt;DJI’s Mini 2 drone getting OcuSync wireless&lt;/a&gt; and its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21517121/dji-ronin-s2-sc2-rs2-rsc2-gimbals-announced-price"&gt;Ronan gimbals getting built-in focus wheels&lt;/a&gt;; Nintendo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514758/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;Mario Kart Live Home Circuit remote control AR cars&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof S3 e-bike&lt;/a&gt;; Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;WH-1000XM4 headphones&lt;/a&gt;; and Dell’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;latest XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;. Even smart speakers like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt; significantly improved their sound while Apple finally hit a reasonable price point with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;HomePod mini&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="t6bq6y"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="The Verge’s favorite gadgets of 2020|96860" data-volume-uuid="a521f8b3f" data-volume-id="96860" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-736" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t2Zovz"&gt;I wish I could tell you what ties this year’s wave of good gadgets into a coherent trend. It wouldn’t be right to tie any of this to the pandemic — the lead times on everything mentioned here are such that they would have begun development well before lockdown. Certainly there was an effort to make “next-gen” products feel worthy of the description, but I don’t think that explains it all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GdJ5B3"&gt;If I’m honest, I think it’s just luck. A bunch of technologies happened to mature around the same time and a bunch of companies happened to be ready to do something with them. In a year when so many things have gone predictably bad, it’s nice that this one small thing was unpredictably nice. The gadgets were good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDBY5b"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FA7S3S"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Halo fitness tracker that monitors your tone of voice is now widely available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qNMFzUpIQVi1A-qygYpoKRxPLuU=/45x0:3795x2500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68509939/Halo_App_and_Halo_Band.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SHG9Em"&gt;If you want to give someone the gift of a 3D model of their body fat, you’re in luck. Just in time for the holidays, Amazon is making its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;Halo fitness tracker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QK955LS?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;widely available&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpGOrS"&gt;The $99.99 tracker does more than track movement; it scans a wearer’s body to create a 3D scan of their body fat and also monitors their voice throughout the day for tone. The first six months with the device are free, but it then costs $3.99 per month to maintain its features. (If you don’t opt in to the subscription, the Halo only tracks sleep time, heart rate, and step tracking.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18CT8u"&gt;The device comes in three colors — silver, black, and pink — and features a fabric strap with no display. It pairs with iOS and Android devices over Bluetooth, although Amazon does list some devices that aren’t compatible &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=21524859011&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlW1l4"&gt;Halo’s big promise is it can provide a better representation of health over other wearables because of its body fat measurement. &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, however, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/technology/personaltech/amazon-halo-review.html"&gt;recently published&lt;/a&gt; a piece pointing out that the measurements might not be accurate, and the device needs a more in-depth study to prove its worth. Still, if you’re someone who’s intrigued by the idea of a 3D body scan and also want to keep a check on your voice tone, the Halo’s the only tracker on the market that does it all now. Maybe just think twice before gifting it to a relative or friend for the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Demon’s Souls remake is down to its lowest price ever at B&amp;H Photo today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BWj3BhMMPnR_paXzN3Usb8hXnvE=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68509856/50349495328_52945d48a3_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: PlayStation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2zhfNa"&gt;The holiday shopping season is in full swing; if you are still looking for gifts to give to loved ones or even yourself, there are still plenty of deals to consider. Today’s best deals include historically low prices across several categories, including $20 of instant savings on one of the best (don’t at me) PS5 console exclusives, the best price ever on Jabra’s 75t wireless earbuds, and Nvidia’s Shield TV Pro for as low as $179. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="v0xRKT"&gt;Grab the Demon’s Souls remake for just $50&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8iguE1"&gt;The PS5 might be hard to find right now, but if you are one of the lucky few to own the next-gen console, the holiday season is a great time to start building out your next-gen library. Over at B&amp;amp;H Photo, you can grab the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1595078-REG%2Fsony_3005730_demon_s_souls_playstation_5.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls remake&lt;/em&gt; for just $50&lt;/a&gt; (usually $70).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1hDgzf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZahbHX"&gt;Nvidia’s Shield TV Pro, which can run GeForce Now, is down to $179&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WBnyhJ"&gt;Nvidia’s Shield TV Pro is one of the more multidimensional media players. Not only does this Android TV set top box allow you to stream movies and TV shows, it also doubles as a Plex server. If you’re into cloud gaming, this device also supports Nvidia’s GeForce Now service. You can grab it for &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1512596-REG%2Fnvidia_945_12897_2500_101_shield_tv_pro_hdr.html%2F%3Fap%3Dy%26ap%3Dy%26smp%3Dy%26smp%3Dy%26lsft%3DBI%253A514%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAt9z-BRBCEiwA_bWv-DKTqibAOrpsYvhucU_NuoLF2-opm92HmJr8AaoqiE4JvXjIC9J_bxoC-00QAvD_BwE#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as low as $179 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; or $180 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Shield-Android-Streaming-Performance/dp/B07YP9FBMM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726526502455821775" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FFCuZ6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226108"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o3fXac"&gt;Solid gaming laptops for as low as $1,200&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kJUBCw"&gt;Asus’s impressive &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725507320874252995" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ROG Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop is back down to its lowest price of $1,200 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This configuration features an AMD Ryzen 9 processor, an RTX 2060 Max-Q graphics card, 1TB of SSD storage, and a 120Hz refresh display. It’s our favorite gaming laptop of the year and this sale makes it even more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="amDrqt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505867"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s1Vfq2"&gt;You can grab the Razer Blade 15 with a RTX 2060 GPU, a 144Hz 1080 display, and a 10th-gen Intel Core i7 processor for $1,350 at Amazon and Best Buy. Normally this configuration would set you back $1,800.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UFXVWK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9673268"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HKkDw7"&gt;Jabra’s Elite 75t are down to a lowest price yet of $120&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4C8igM"&gt;Jabra’s Elite 75t wireless earbuds are an excellent and more comfortable alternative for Android users or people that do not prefer the one-size-fits-most design of Apple’s AirPods. You can get the earbuds for $120 at Amazon and Best Buy, $60 off their usual retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="39e6XW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625438"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Zoox unveils a self-driving car that could become Amazon’s first robotaxi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P_CuEO4fEXmW3b9dbWYHz74HzIo=/0x0:2800x1867/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68509830/zoox_robotaxi_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoox unveiled a self-driving, electric “robotaxi” in San Francisco.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Zoox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CYCC0K"&gt;Zoox, a self-driving car company that Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304111/amazon-zoox-acquisition-self-driving-car-autonomous-vehicles-startup-robotaxi-bi-directional-vehicle"&gt;bought in June&lt;/a&gt;, has finally revealed its robotaxi after six years of &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-07-17/robot-taxi-startup-zoox-has-800-million-and-a-wild-pitch"&gt;gnarly prototypes and secrecy&lt;/a&gt;. And while it broadly resembles other first-generation autonomous vehicles from automakers and Silicon Valley startups, Zoox’s robotaxi has a few standout features, as well as an overall polish to it that makes obvious why Amazon thinks it might be the cornerstone &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/37ae69d9-f160-48c3-b3c5-736730c110ce"&gt;of a fledgling autonomous ride-hailing service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBNfWS"&gt;The autonomous “carriage-style” vehicle is an all-electric four-wheeler that seats up to four people, and is similar in appearance to fully self-driving vehicles created by other companies in the space. At just 3.63 meters long, it falls somewhere in between the big, boxy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075977/cruise-driverless-car-gm-no-steering-wheel-pedals-ev-exclusive-first-look"&gt;Origin robotaxi&lt;/a&gt; from Cruise (which is owned by General Motors) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21272966/nuro-cvs-autonomous-medicine-delivery-robot-houston"&gt;the delivery-focused robot made by Nuro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tp3Gbe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Zoox claims a top speed of 75 miles per hour, hinting at highway use&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ffq7CP"&gt;To further differentiate, Zoox has spent the last few years working on outfitting its autonomous vehicle with the ability to drive both forward and backward, and side to side, or “bi-directionally.” Combined with four-wheel steering functionality, Zoox says its vehicle will be able to handle precise maneuvers like “tight curbside pickups” and “tricky U-turns.” Zoox also claims its vehicle is the first of its kind to be able to travel at up to 75 mph, a possible nod to ambitions to one day put the vehicles on the highway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fWhL4b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10226337"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sH2qe7"&gt;Like most early autonomous vehicles, Zoox’s robotaxi is decked out in safety technology. There’s a crown of six LIDAR pucks up top, as well as multiple radar sensors and cameras. Zoox says this provides a 270-degree field of view at each corner, virtually eliminating blind spots as well as providing redundancy in case a sensor fails. The sensor suite allows the vehicle to see objects up to 150 meters away, Zoox says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eF7xwP"&gt;The interior of Zoox’s vehicle is less coldly technological. The cozy bench seats, which face inward (hence the term “carriage-style”) are surrounded by what looks like textured fabric. The seats also conceal what Zoox says is a radical rethink of how airbags work. There are cupholders and wireless charging mats between seats. And the ceiling has a starry sky pattern, the kind commonly &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-rolls-royce-creates-starlight-shooting-star-headliner-illuminated-fascia-2020-11?amp&amp;amp;jwsource=cl"&gt;seen in luxury vehicles like the Rolls Royce Ghost&lt;/a&gt;. A small touchscreen at each seat is the most obvious tech found inside; Zoox says passengers will use these to control music, air conditioning, or see their route and ETA. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rcOYSk8kTF8uRZtPL5Apu6BfRTc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22168899/zoox_robotaxi_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Zoox&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tNCYgq"&gt;The robotaxi is powered by a 133kWh battery pack, which is a little bigger than the packs that currently power Tesla’s most capable vehicles. Zoox says these battery packs will last for 16 hours of continuous use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xNUiry"&gt;That should be plenty of juice to help Zoox and Amazon start chipping away at their collective goal, which is creating an autonomous ride-hailing service. It’s a goal that Zoox has been pursuing since it was founded in 2014, and one it sought in &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-07-17/robot-taxi-startup-zoox-has-800-million-and-a-wild-pitch"&gt;almost theatrical secrecy&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/22/zoox-ceo-and-co-founder-tim-kentley-klay-is-out/"&gt;stumbling through a public spat&lt;/a&gt; with its co-founder and CEO in 2018, who was ultimately pushed out. The company has been testing prototypes of its self-driving vehicle in San Francisco and Foster City in California, as well as in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/3/20897526/zoox-self-driving-taxi-robot-las-vegas-2020"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, Nevada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COMXBp"&gt;Of course, Zoox is just part of Amazon’s increasingly massive push into the transportation sector. Not only has the e-commerce giant essentially built out its own shipping infrastructure, but it has poured &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21319899/rivian-2-5-billion-funding-round-amazon-soros-r1t-r1s-truck-suv-ford"&gt;a ton of money into buzzy EV startup Rivian&lt;/a&gt; (and is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507495/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-date-specs"&gt;working with the company on a fleet of electric delivery vans&lt;/a&gt;). It also has a stake in Aurora, the autonomous vehicle outfit that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;just acquired Uber’s self-driving division&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The pandemic couldn’t keep the space industry down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n7OL3U1WlMIlrHNhgwIt4waIPqU=/0x0:3840x2560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68509787/49971436642_cbf70a9f4d_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NASA astronauts Bob Behnken (L) and Doug Hurley (R) flew on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon for the first time in May.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4Fo1yh"&gt;As most of the world slowed to a pandemic-induced halt this year, the space industry rocketed forward. A pair of astronauts launched to orbit on a private spacecraft for the first time. Three separate missions blasted off to Mars. And a robot hundreds of millions of miles from Earth grabbed the largest sample of an asteroid ever captured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4J5zN"&gt;Looking back on 2020, space turned out to be a relative bright spot in a particularly dark year. Boosted by government contracts and increased demand in some sectors, the private space industry pushed through the chaos of this year. At the same time, public exploration missions scrambled to meet rigid timetables. And both groups managed to triumph while adhering to rapidly changing public health restrictions around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XOOOMX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Governments around the world have increased their focus on space as a priority”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WN84zK"&gt;Despite the turmoil, the world launched more than 1,200 satellites this year, according to spaceflight tracker Jonathan McDowell — more than in any other year past. And while many of those satellites were either small in size, or bulk satellites from SpaceX, the numbers are indicative of just how much the space economy has grown in the previous years — and how resilient spaceflight has become even when faced with a pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1sdkt"&gt;“Governments around the world have increased their focus on space as a priority, either for national defense like in the US, or for exploration,” Carissa Christensen, founder and CEO of Bryce Space and Technology, a space analytics and engineering firm, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Even during a pandemic, that emphasis continued, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4JrhW"&gt;The space world wasn’t completely immune to COVID-19, though. When the pandemic first got underway, many companies had to slow down or pause their activities as they adjusted to new social distancing guidelines, staggered shifts, and new cleaning practices. Europe temporarily ceased flights out of its spaceport in French Guiana in mid-March, and some satellite launches suffered delays as travel restrictions made it difficult to transport hardware. Engineers even turned off some instruments on spacecraft already in space to reduce the labor needed to keep them running.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-E1FQ_St9wv6dV22wZtyxsWiAVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22155199/NHQ202007300020_large.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ULA’s Atlas V rocket launched NASA’s Perseverance rover to Mars in July.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MntCmN"&gt;A few companies suffered major losses, too. Bigelow Aerospace, which aims to build inflatable space habitats, let go all of its employees in late March, citing lockdown restrictions. And certain sectors of the satellite industry suffered slowdowns, especially those that provide communications and services for cruise and maritime industries, as well as airlines, says Christensen. “Some of the changes in travel patterns have had an impact on satellite operators,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ir5bm"&gt;But other areas of the satellite world saw a huge increase in demand this year. Governments and industries sought out data from companies that provide high-resolution imagery of Earth and geospatial intelligence, says Chad Anderson, CEO of angel investment and venture capital firm Space Angels. People were eager to learn more about how the pandemic has impacted travel and what new global trends have emerged on Earth in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AXj8sY"&gt;“In times of uncertainty, businesses and leaders are really hungry for information and insight, which is exactly the type of data that space companies provide,” says Anderson. “So as the world gets more uncertain, and as anxiety goes up, people are clamoring for more information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PrA9l6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“As anxiety goes up, people are clamoring for more information”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V8W7XP"&gt;Not only did the government seek more data from the industry, but in the US, it classified many aerospace companies as “essential,” since they held contracts with NASA or the Department of Defense. This allowed companies to continue to bring employees on site to continue working on all their projects, both government-related and commercial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfICW8"&gt;The US government also provided a lifeline in the form of contract payouts, Anderson says. Government agencies restructured how they paid out their contractors, providing more money at the height of the pandemic. That kept a lot of organizations afloat until investment picked back up again, Anderson says. And after a second quarter slowdown, the third quarter of 2020 became “one of the biggest quarters on record for investment and growth in infrastructure space,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o1hKlvtZ_IixTbedkLDwiiHmS9g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22155223/mosque.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Planet&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Satellite imagery from Planet reveals the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Great Mosque of Mecca on January 25th, 2020 (L) and March 10th, 2020.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jiFGsJ"&gt;Of course, much of the spotlight in space this year was on SpaceX’s first crewed mission to the International Space Station. On May 31st, two NASA astronauts — Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley — flew to space on the company’s new Crew Dragon capsule, marking the first crewed launch to orbit from US soil since the end of the space shuttle program. Thousands of viewers from all over the world tuned in to the launch, providing a hopeful distraction for a suffering public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2kHhq"&gt;SpaceX’s flight was just the headliner of a massive year in space-related accomplishments. Three missions launched to Mars from three separate countries, including NASA’s new Perseverance rover, equipped with tools to look for life on the Red Planet. NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission grabbed what could be the largest sample of an asteroid ever retrieved. And China landed its third robotic mission on the Moon, in a quest to bring a sample of lunar dirt back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXEhMH"&gt;Some of these achievements were more or less an exercise in weird timing. All three Mars missions &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to get off the ground this year, or they’d miss the window to reach the Red Planet. If they hadn’t launched this summer, they would have been forced to wait until 2022, resulting in loss of time and money. OSIRIS-REx, on the other hand, has been in space since 2016, with longstanding plans to grab a sample of an asteroid this year. Postponing the grab for too long just wasn’t an option, as the vehicle has limited fuel on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CLuVDo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was definitely a bright spot in an otherwise horrible year”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dCeheM"&gt;“Some of that was just very good luck — or very bad luck, depending,” says Christensen. “You’ll have a five, seven, 10-year program, and it launches when it launches. So I think that for the exploration program, it’s kind of a reflection of a long schedule.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZXfzZ"&gt;Still, the fact that these major achievements happened during the pandemic is a testament to the strength of the people who run their spacecraft. NASA engineers told tales of racing to get Perseverance off the ground just in time, while adhering to stricter guidelines and new work from home policies. And it wasn’t just them. Everyone in the space world was still grappling with the pandemic here on Earth, while trying to keep their space robots launching and functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6u3yY"&gt;While the humans of Earth are doing their best to stay in one place, we’re still thrusting our way into the cosmos — a sign that we’ll continue to explore the stars even in times of incredible adversity. “It was definitely a bright spot in an otherwise horrible year, and more is on the way,” says Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Does Avatar have a place in Disney’s ambitious future?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Avatar" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LxqVF41HyQbQ9fr7bmllKfP7rx4=/32x0:1069x691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68509390/Avatar.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: 20th Century Fox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WhtCqq"&gt;Disney announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;virtual avalanche&lt;/a&gt; of updates and news for almost every one of its properties. But one of the company’s biggest franchises was strangely absent: in all the hullabaloo, where was &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4lXUJ0"&gt;There was no &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; segment of the investor call, showing off preview images of the sequels and a logo or subtitle for &lt;em&gt;Avatar 2&lt;/em&gt;. No news of any &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; Disney Plus shows, or any animated spinoffs to help further expand the brand across the Disney empire. Amid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;more than 50 announcements&lt;/a&gt; covering &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, Marvel, and Pixar, the Na’vi were nowhere to be seen. Interconnected branding and stories has become Disney’s lifeblood, but &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;isn’t taking part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="s0tHOR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 52 things Disney just announced","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pV4y7I"&gt;While not originally a Disney property, the studio acquired the rights to the James Cameron blockbuster alongside the rest of 20th Century Fox in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273142/disney-fox-acquistion-final-hulu-marvel-streaming-21st-century"&gt;2019’s landmark merger&lt;/a&gt;. The company has invested significantly in the &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;brand long before it owned the movies, with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/27/15701562/pandora-world-of-avatar-disney-world-review"&gt;dedicated Pandora section&lt;/a&gt; of Disney World in 2017. On Disney Plus, the original &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;is a prominent fixture — and, until its dethroning by &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt; last year, was one of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_box_office_records_set_by_Avatar"&gt;most lucrative films&lt;/a&gt; ever produced, with &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl876971521/"&gt;a $2.7 billion box office&lt;/a&gt;. 20th Century Studios — and, by extension, Disney — have four more &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;films in production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHIuxs"&gt;Between the inherited investment from 20th Century Fox into the future of Pandora, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/2/15721206/disney-world-avatar-pandora-photo-tour-james-cameron"&gt;Disney’s own $500 million theme park&lt;/a&gt;, the blue aliens of James Cameron’s imagination take up a big role on the balance sheet, if nothing else. It’s a huge investment for the company to be silent about. Disney’s entire event was meant to prove to investors (and the world) that the Disney brand is strong. And yet, it didn’t provide a single piece of information about the sequels to the second biggest movie ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Avatar" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cYKpaXy3YZzjXDUTJ9asspz0P2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/4529421/avatar16.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: 20th Century Fox&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RV6JUI"&gt;The first two sequels have been shooting concurrently for three years, and &lt;em&gt;Avatar 2&lt;/em&gt; — per Disney’s most recent theatrical release calendar — is still prominently on the schedule, for December 16th, 2022. And James Cameron’s sequels are set to alternate December slots each year with Disney’s other major sci-fi franchise, &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. But while Disney was willing to announce a title card and details on its next &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; movie as far away as 2023 (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168682/patty-jenkins-star-wars-movie-rogue-sqaudrons-wonder-woman"&gt;the Patty Jenkins-helmed &lt;em&gt;Rogue Squadron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), the studio didn’t even mention the word “&lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt;” during the four-hour-plus presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MLlFFg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt;’s cultural prominence has faded over the years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mxlY8l"&gt;Part of the answer may lie in &lt;em&gt;Avatar’&lt;/em&gt;s depreciation following its record-shattering debut. For a film as big as &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; was in 2009, the movie itself has had a tiny impact on the overall cultural landscape disproportionate to its massive box office numbers. Other top films, like &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, and the Avengers movies, are part of the modern zeitgeist. Even the most out-of-touch person knows who Iron Man is, or has an opinion on whether Jack and Rose could have fit on that board. &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;just doesn’t occupy the same place in people’s hearts, minds, or wallets anymore, outside of a far smaller subset of fans. It’s not clear it ever did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wSZoZZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt;’s cultural prominence has faded over the years. Viral &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxp1IBK1OPI"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/perpetua/avatar?utm_term=.wmvPPK7LE#.lwxEEw8Mo"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; trying to recall the details of the film have more prominence than the characters or worlds that the film so meticulously created. And &lt;em&gt;Avatar’&lt;/em&gt;s paint-by-numbers story and focus on a white savior narrative have aged particularly poorly when viewed with fresh eyes that aren’t blinded by the fantastical computer-generated sights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRbEps"&gt;It’s an open question whether an &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; sequel will be able to gross anything close to the original, which had the advantage of riding the dual waves of inflated 3D movie tickets and immersive CGI hype, neither of which are benefits a second movie, over a decade later, will have. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/61N_XAtTL2EnghFnRgUjIa84K5I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8609241/jbareham_170524_1720_A_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0nhNU1"&gt;And yet, &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; didn’t gross $2.7 billion out of apathy toward the franchise. With Cameron’s reputation, it could be that he’ll manage to make lightning strike a third time, but with the huge price tags for the films, it’s a big gamble. (Disney itself hadn’t decided whether to greenlight Cameron’s fourth and fifth films when it first acquired the franchise.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oq0hCR"&gt;Disney’s investor call announcements were a blueprint for the company’s future. That path is one built firmly on its strengths: popular brands like Marvel, Pixar, and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, expansions of modern animated classics like &lt;em&gt;Moana&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;, and shows that remake or further build out beloved properties like &lt;em&gt;The Mighty Ducks&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson and the Olympians&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CpIDIe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Disney finally revealed the real Disney Plus ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169873/disney-plus-streaming-marvel-star-wars-new-shows-movies-star-hulu"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sTQ6hK"&gt;In other words, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169873/disney-plus-streaming-marvel-star-wars-new-shows-movies-star-hulu"&gt;Disney’s future is committed to franchises and brands&lt;/a&gt; that customers love. It’s a calculated, measured approach, the thing that separates it from the scattershot tactics of Netflix’s hundreds of original shows and movies that flare up into the spotlight for a few days or weeks and are then forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MQm9o"&gt;It’s hard to believe that Disney hasn’t thought about how to better integrate the &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; franchise into its own stable of brands. But if &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; isn’t in the spotlight as part of Disney’s future, it might be because the company has recognized that in 2020 (and beyond), the world of Pandora and the Na’vi just can’t measure up.&lt;/p&gt;
