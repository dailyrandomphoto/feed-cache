    <title>The best budget laptop of 2021</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best cheap laptops under $800 from HP, Lenovo, and more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="ItC6sO"&gt;The best cheap laptops are getting better and better for less than $800. The question to ask is: what’s most important, and what are you willing to sacrifice? Even the best cheap laptops aren’t perfect in every area — they have some strengths but cut corners to achieve their price tags. You can almost certainly find a budget laptop with a touchscreen, a premium-looking chassis, an HDMI port, a backlit keyboard, or stylus support, but you may need to consider which of those features you want the most, and which you can go without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqLems"&gt;Our pick for the best cheap laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;, running Windows 10. We feel that the Envy has build quality, performance, and battery life that surpass those of many premium laptops, as well as those priced under $800. But we’ve tested dozens of systems below $800, and we’ve got a number of additional models on this list from Lenovo, Acer, Samsung, HP, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVG16P"&gt;Other best cheap laptops of 2021 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these laptops also appear on our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptop&lt;/a&gt; lists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPoJxi"&gt;Many of our picks for the best cheap laptop of 2021 are currently Chromebooks. We believe that Chromebooks are, in many cases, the best-value option for shoppers seeking a laptop under $500 and tend to offer better specs, features, and build quality than most Windows laptops at that price point. We hope to add more Windows laptops under $500 to this page in the future and are keeping a close eye on those releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best cheap laptop ofof 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="r62WQ4"&gt;HP’s Envy x360 13, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeBestLaptop101521&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-envy-x360-laptop-13z-ay000-8lz58av-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $860&lt;/a&gt; is the best budget laptop you can buy under $800. With a high-quality and sturdy convertible build, it looks like a device that should cost twice its price. It has plenty of other great features as well, including a really excellent keyboard and a bright, colorful screen. It’s also exceptional on the inside. Thanks to its AMD Ryzen processor, the system delivers all-day battery life and very smooth performance — it can even handle some light gaming. (Intel options are available as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ox216u"&gt;We have some minor complaints about the Envy, of course. The screen is 16:9, which is a cramped aspect ratio for multitasking. Our test unit had a somewhat limited port selection (notably, missing Thunderbolt and HDMI support) and came with some bloatware preinstalled. But none of these are deal-breakers at the Envy’s price point. Overall, budget shoppers will want for very little with this machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best laptop under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hyeIry"&gt;If you’re looking for an absurdly cheap Chromebook that absolutely gets the job done, you should definitely be looking at the $260 Lenovo Chromebook Duet. The Duet is a 10-inch aluminum alloy Chrome OS tablet that comes with a kickstand and keyboard cover. It looks sturdy and classy, and it can easily function as either a tablet or a PC. But you’re not compromising &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;much on performance for this device’s tiny size; as long as you’re not running dozens of tabs and apps, you should be fine. And we got over 11 hours of battery life in our testing, making it one of the longest-lasting Chromebooks we’ve seen in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHlVCe"&gt;The main thing to know about the Chromebook Duet is that the screen is quite small — just 10.1 inches. That’s a fine size for a young student (especially with the touch capability) and for an adult’s secondary device for note-taking, Netflixing, and the like, but it’s not an ideal size for a primary work device unless you’re fine with quite a bit of squinting. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the clamshell Chromebook to buy, and one of the best cheap laptops under $800.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SoHxJX"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best budget laptop with Chrome OS &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="N34v09"&gt;If you’d prefer a more traditional Chromebook with a clamshell form factor, the $329 Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is an affordable option that’s all-around excellent. It has a gorgeous 3:2 display that delivers a sharp picture and bright, vibrant colors with plenty of vertical space. The screen alone would make the Chromebook Spin 713 a standout, but it has a number of other strengths as well, including a great keyboard, all-day battery life, and a comprehensive port selection, including an HDMI, in addition to USB-C, USB-A, and a microSD slot. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 is the best cheap laptop with a built-in stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SSaLnR"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best cheap laptop with a stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iQA7Ph"&gt;If you like the Duet’s size and detachable form factor but are willing to spend on something a bit more upscale, you may find the Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 to be a better choice. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, kickstand, and detachable screen. But the CM3’s kickstand folds multiple ways: you can crease it lengthwise to stand the tablet up like a laptop or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. Plus, it comes with a built-in USI stylus and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. Battery life was also quite impressive: we averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUYikQ"&gt;Where the CM3 lags a bit behind the Duet (and other cheap laptops you may try) is the power. Its MediaTek processor can be a bit sluggish compared to more pricier offerings. But the CM3 still offers a surprising number of perks for its sub-$400 price and makes a great student driver or secondary device. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Pavilion Aero 13 is a 13-inch powerhouse that weighs almost nothing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best laptop under $800&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="o8zBHM"&gt;If you’re looking for a budget Windows laptop that’s thinner and lighter than the Envy x360 while delivering similar category-topping performance, the $669 HP Pavilion Aero 13 is a good choice for you. It has a powerful eight-core Ryzen processor, which is one of the fastest processors for thin and light laptops that you can get. Not only does it perform well, but it’s also unbelievably light at just 2.1 pounds, and it comes with a blindingly bright 16:10 screen. It’s a standout in battery life, too — I averaged almost 11 hours of continuous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOWROI"&gt;HP did have to cut a few corners to achieve those benefits at this price point. The audio on our model wasn’t great, and the device shipped with some cheap bloatware installed. But the Pavilion Aero 13 is excellent in almost every other way, and it won’t disappoint if you’re looking for a functional, cheap Windows PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;An affordable laptop with a bold look&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pT23AG"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable Chromebook that stands out from the crowd, the $549 Galaxy Chromebook 2 should be on your list. It comes in a bold “fiesta red” color (as well as a regular gray, if you prefer to blend in). It’s a touchscreen convertible with stylus support (though the stylus isn’t included). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QIDME"&gt;On top of the design, the Galaxy Chromebook 2 includes an excellent QLED panel, which is one of the best displays we’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. You also get a solid keyboard, decent battery life (we averaged 7 hours and 21 minutes of continuous work), and a port selection that includes two USB-C ports, a microSD slot, and a headphone jack. It’s easily one of the best Chromebooks you can buy and one of the best cheap laptops as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best cheap laptop for Surface fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9t4Ji3"&gt;The $399 Surface Go 2 is a 10.5-inch tablet that’s about the size of a regular iPad. You’ll have to buy the keyboard cover separately, but the overall package is still quite affordable if you’re buying a lower-priced model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hPLGr"&gt;You can configure the Surface Go 2 with a Pentium Gold or Core m3 processor. Those aren’t the fanciest or most powerful processors, but the system should still be adequate for your streaming and browsing needs, especially if you only need it to do one task at a time. It can run any Windows app, it’s easy to carry around, and it makes a solid secondary computer. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Swift 3 is one of the best college laptops you can buy, and one of the best cheap laptops under $800.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best student laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DeUYiZ"&gt;Many of the best cheap laptops might be good choices for high school and college students, but the Acer Swift 3’s exceptionally durable build makes it an excellent choice for backpack-battering and dining hall spills. Its 14-inch screen also gives you more room for homework multitasking than some of the 13-inch machines here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVxnSd"&gt;But the highlight of the Swift 3 is its Ryzen 4000 processors. We tested a model with a Ryzen 7 4700U, which did an excellent job handling our daily multitasking workload, and delivered seven-hour battery life as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWSkuR"&gt;On the outside, the Swift 3 isn’t the thinnest or most beautiful laptop you can buy, but it’s a solid performer in most areas. It has all kinds of ports, including USB-C, USB-A, and an HDMI. The backlit keyboard has a nice click to it and has a reliable integrated fingerprint reader as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lenovo Yoga C740 is a sturdy aluminum laptop for any use case, making it one of the best cheap laptops under $800.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m9IrEq"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21174917/lenovo-yoga-c740-review-laptop-specs-features-price-2-in-1-convertible"&gt;Lenovo Yoga C740&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;A cheap laptop with standout build&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HqEdaD"&gt;The Yoga C740 is as straightforward as a laptop can get. It has a sturdy aluminum build and perfectly fine 10th Gen Intel processors. We were pleasantly surprised by the device’s audio — the upward-firing speakers on the sides of the keyboard deliver a nice surround-sound experience. The keyboard and touchpad are both quite comfortable to use. There’s not much to complain about and not much to enthusiastically praise — if you’re looking for a sub-$800 Windows laptop with a well-made aluminum chassis and a sturdy frame, you’re looking for the Yoga. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGHm6c"&gt;The C740 is a year old now, but that means you can get it at very affordable prices. We’re looking forward to reviewing its successor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373719/lenovo-yoga-7i-6-convertible-laptops-intel-amd-processors-windows"&gt;Yoga 7i&lt;/a&gt;, shortly in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="NvgzEB"&gt;Twitter is piloting a new feature that will let users add specific content warnings to individual photos and videos sent out in tweets. The platform noted that the feature would be available to “some” users during the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EvFNz1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;People use Twitter to discuss what’s happening in the world, which sometimes means sharing unsettling or sensitive content. We’re testing an option for some of you to add one-time warnings to photos and videos you Tweet out, to help those who might want the warning. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LCUA5QCoOV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LCUA5QCoOV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1468317145423511554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Scf8iu"&gt;Although Twitter currently has a way to add content warnings to tweets, the only way to do it is to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/media-settings"&gt;add the warning to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; your tweets&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, every photo or video you post will have a content warning, regardless of whether it contains sensitive material or not. The new feature it’s testing lets you add the warning to single tweets and apply specific categories to that warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHB3Fv"&gt;As shown in the video that Twitter posted, it appears that when you’re editing an image or video, tapping the flag icon on the bottom right corner of the toolbar lets you add a content warning. The next screen lets you categorize the warning, with choices including “nudity,” “violence,” or “sensitive.” Once you post the tweet, the image or video will appear blurred out, and it’s overlaid with a content warning that explains why you flagged it. Users can click through the warning if they want to view the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCqHpp"&gt;If you fail to flag content when you post sensitive material, Twitter will — as it has already been doing — rely on user reports to decide whether or not your content should have a warning. In addition to its content warning experiment, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822878/twitter-testing-changes-report-tweet-abuse-suspicious-behavior"&gt;Twitter announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that it’s trying out a “human-first” way to handle the reporting process. Instead of asking the user what rules the tweet is breaking, it will give the user the chance to describe what exactly happened, and based on that response, it will determine a specific violation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Over 40 million people had health information leaked this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X4mdRqzqJfSSnUMGFBmkBTc5NuU=/0x0:2130x1420/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244745/VRG_ILLO_1777_AK_body_data.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aSY4OY"&gt;Over 40 million people in the United States had their personal health information exposed in data breaches this year, a significant jump from 2020 and a continuation of a trend toward more and more health data hacks and leaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mf8SHn"&gt;Health organizations are required to report any health data breaches that impact 500 or more people to the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, which &lt;a href="https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf"&gt;makes the breaches public&lt;/a&gt;. So far this year, the office has received reports of 578 breaches, &lt;a href="https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf"&gt;according to its database&lt;/a&gt;. That’s fewer than the 599 breaches reported &lt;a href="https://pages.bitglass.com/rs/418-ZAL-815/images/CDFY21Q1HealthcareBreachReport2021.pdf?aliId=eyJpIjoiOE54NGRRTkhCZDY3aUxGMiIsInQiOiJ0RTZ1QVZXbnFPUGRhZXhVbmhyMmVnPT0ifQ%253D%253D"&gt;in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but last year’s breaches only affected about 26 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PF8S7Q"&gt;Since 2015, hacks or other IT incidents have been the leading reason people have their health records exposed, according to &lt;a href="https://pages.bitglass.com/rs/418-ZAL-815/images/CDFY21Q1HealthcareBreachReport2021.pdf?aliId=eyJpIjoiOE54NGRRTkhCZDY3aUxGMiIsInQiOiJ0RTZ1QVZXbnFPUGRhZXhVbmhyMmVnPT0ifQ%253D%253D"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; from security company Bitglass. Before then, lost or stolen devices led to the most data breaches. The transition coincided with federal rules in the US requiring that healthcare organizations use electronic medical records and the broader switch toward digital tools like internet-connected monitors in healthcare. Medical records are &lt;a href="https://www.accountablehq.com/post/why-is-phi-valuable-to-hackers"&gt;valuable&lt;/a&gt; on the black market — they have information that’s harder to change than a credit card and can be used to make fake medical claims or purchase medications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zhk0l"&gt;There are a few ways these types of breaches can harm patients: people can have private information exposed and could have to deal with the financial repercussions of having their medical identity stolen. Hacks and attacks on healthcare institutions that shut down hospital computer systems can make it harder for them to deliver quality care, and that can be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696097/hospital-ransomware-cyberattack-death-rates-patients"&gt;harmful to the people treated there&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02058"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that more people die in hospitals suffering from data breaches, even those that don’t result in a computer system shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sOs2Xl"&gt;Many healthcare organizations haven’t prioritized investment in cybersecurity, even as the risk of cyberattacks continues to go up. The biggest breach in 2021, for instance, was from a cyberattack of the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation health plan, which exposed the information of 3.5 million people. An analysis after the attack found that the plan’s website had “significant vulnerabilities,” &lt;a href="https://health.wusf.usf.edu/health-news-florida/2021-01-29/florida-healthy-kids-website-breached"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Health News Florida&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWd10Y"&gt;Experts say, though, that the spikes in attacks over 2020 and 2021 — particularly in ransomware attacks — are pushing organizations to take the threat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22776561/hosptial-cyberattack-ransomware-risk"&gt;more seriously&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the disc-based model and the Digital Edition will be available.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n38PYV"&gt;Ready. Steady. Go. If you’re still looking for a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X, Walmart Plus members will be able to queue up for the console beginning at 12PM EST on Wednesday, December 8th. Walmart will open the digital queue for the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420%3F&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restock120521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standard PlayStation 5 ($500&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restock120521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;disc-less, digital-only version ($400)&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;sharedid=Vergerestock12082021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X ($500)&lt;/a&gt;. This paywall doesn’t guarantee that you’ll have success in snagging a console, but it’s currently the only way to be in the running at this particular retailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DjPdLk"&gt;You have to be logged into your Walmart Plus account to even attempt to add a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X to your cart, so if you haven’t done so already, make sure you log in ahead of time and have your credentials saved to keep things moving along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6lICTr"&gt;If you aren’t already a Walmart Plus member, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus%2Fplans%3Fdirect%3Dtrue%26returnurl%3D%25252Fip%25252FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%25252F987823383" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you’ll need to sign up for this $13 / month subscription service&lt;/a&gt; in order to be eligible for this restock. Unfortunately, you can’t simply exploit the 15-day free trial it offers, but subscribing to the service will make you eligible for benefits like free shipping and early access to sales and restock events.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DeepMind tests the limits of large AI language systems with 280-billion-parameter model</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xV9oGpw1PY-UCk-U2KNM7nNnkqo=/170x217:1871x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244594/acastro_200730_1777_ai_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YCGXgS"&gt;Language generation is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22734662/ai-language-artificial-intelligence-future-models-gpt-3-limitations-bias"&gt;hottest thing in AI&lt;/a&gt; right now, with a class of systems known as “large language models” (or LLMs) being used for everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443441/google-ai-language-models-dangers-risk-io-timnit-gebru-margaret-mitchell-firing"&gt;improving Google’s search engine&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21042942/ai-dungeon-nick-walton-openai-gpt2-text-adventure-game-web-version-launch"&gt;creating text-based fantasy games&lt;/a&gt;. But these programs also have serious problems, including regurgitating sexist and racist language and failing tests of logical reasoning. One big question is: can these weaknesses be improved by simply adding more data and computing power, or are we reaching the limits of this technological paradigm? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0ztqP"&gt;This is one of the topics that Alphabet’s AI lab DeepMind is tackling in a trio of research papers &lt;a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/language-modelling-at-scale"&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s conclusion is that scaling up these systems further should deliver plenty of improvements. “One key finding of the paper is that the progress and capabilities of large language models is still increasing. This is not an area that has plateaued,” DeepMind research scientist Jack Rae told reporters in a briefing call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="b36D63"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is not an area that has plateaued.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G5zmBg"&gt;DeepMind, which regularly feeds its work into Google products, has probed the capabilities of this LLMs by building a &lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/research/language-research/Training%20Gopher.pdf"&gt;language model with 280 billion parameters&lt;/a&gt; named Gopher. Parameters are a quick measure of a language’s models size and complexity, meaning that Gopher is larger than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential"&gt;OpenAI’s GPT-3 &lt;/a&gt;(175 billion parameters) but not as big as some more experimental systems, like Microsoft and Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/12/nvidia_microsoft_mtnlg/"&gt;Megatron model&lt;/a&gt; (530 billion parameters). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQq635"&gt;It’s generally true in the AI world that bigger is better, with larger models usually offering higher performance. DeepMind’s research confirms this trend and suggests that scaling up LLMs does offer improved performance on the most common benchmarks testing things like sentiment analysis and summarization. However, researchers also cautioned that some issues inherent to language models will need more than just data and compute to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Fgfks"&gt;“I think right now it really looks like the model can fail in variety of ways,” said Rae. “Some subset of those ways are because the model just doesn’t have sufficiently good comprehension of what it’s reading, and I feel like, for those class of problems, we are just going to see improved performance with more data and scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sawSU4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not all problems with AI language systems can be solved with scale&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IQDwRG"&gt;But, he added, there are “other categories of problems, like the model perpetuating stereotypical biases or the model being coaxed into giving mistruths, that [...] no one at DeepMind thinks scale will be the solution [to].” In these cases, language models will need “additional training routines” like feedback from human users, he noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rstqKE"&gt;To come to these conclusions, DeepMind’s researchers evaluated a range of different-sized language models on 152 language tasks or benchmarks. They found that larger models generally delivered improved results, with Gopher itself offering state-of-the-art performance on roughly 80 percent of the tests selected by the scientists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMbaKN"&gt;In another paper, the company also &lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/research/language-research/Ethical%20and%20social%20risks.pdf"&gt;surveyed the wide range of potential harms&lt;/a&gt; involved with deploying LLMs. These include the systems’ use of toxic language, their capacity to share misinformation, and their potential to be used for malicious purposes, like sharing spam or propaganda. All these issues will become increasingly important as AI language models become more widely deployed — as chatbots and sales agents, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oblXC6"&gt;However, it’s worth remembering that performance on benchmarks is not the be-all and end-all in evaluating machine learning systems. In a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.15366.pdf"&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt;, a number of AI researchers (including two from Google) explored the limitations of benchmarks, noting that these datasets will always be limited in scope and unable to match the complexity of the real world. As is often the case with new technology, the only reliable way to test these systems is to see how they perform in reality. With large language models, we will be seeing more of these applications very soon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s new professional profiles let creators unlock audience-growing tools</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nJynu9pdQzLJao09Ky3OdWj8LAQ=/0x0:1302x868/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244554/professional_mode_facebook.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Turning on professional mode lets creators earn money for their Reels. | Photo by Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yD2OPi"&gt;Facebook is &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/professional-mode-for-profiles"&gt;rolling out professional mode for profiles&lt;/a&gt;, letting creators take advantage of additional monetization tools. The new mode also gives creators access to features that help track the growth of their audience, something that was previously only available with Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Xn5JAY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Professional mode lets creators partake in the Reels Play bonus program&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N1iLCt"&gt;Turning on professional mode allows creators to partake in the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/programs/bonuses"&gt;Reels Play bonus program&lt;/a&gt;. Reels, Instagram’s short-term video feature, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700289/facebook-reels-instagram-play-bonus-tiktok"&gt;became available on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; in September. The bonus program lets creators earn up to $35,000 / month, all depending on how many views their Reels rack up. However, all creators aren’t eligible for the program — it’s currently invite-only, and creators must comply with Meta’s &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/169845596919485?id=2520940424820218"&gt;Partner Monetization Policies&lt;/a&gt; to qualify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEiHJs"&gt;Additionally, Facebook says it’s working on more advanced editing features for Reels, such as an easier way to create a Reel comprised of multiple clips, as well as the ability to save your Reel as a draft while you’re in the process of editing it. The platform is also considering extending the length limit of Reels from 30 seconds to one minute on Facebook, as only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596530/instagram-reels-60-seconds-time-extension"&gt;Instagram supports one-minute Reels&lt;/a&gt; at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Professional mode unlocks a dashboard for audience insights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gUPDXX"&gt;Outside of Reels, professional mode also unlocks audience, post, and profile insights, which lets creators keep track of any activity on their profile. Creators can review the total number of shares, comments, and reactions that their posts have received and can also see how their follower count has changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvLMRu"&gt;Similar to Pages, enabling professional mode makes all the content you post public and means that anyone can view your profile and start following you. Meta says that you can still choose to make certain posts visible to friends only, however. Professional mode is only available in the US for now, but Meta says it’ll be coming to more countries “in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15hCwZ"&gt;Just yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/stars-fest-is-here"&gt;Facebook introduced&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="http://fb.com/stars"&gt;Stars store&lt;/a&gt;, a dedicated website for purchasing Stars — otherwise known as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687603/facebook-creators-stars-subscriptions-supporter-groups"&gt;the virtual currency&lt;/a&gt; that users can buy with real money and use to tip creators. While Stars are available for purchase within the Facebook app, the Stars on Facebook’s new store are offered at a discounted price. The platform may be trying to entice users to purchase Stars on the web-based Stars store, likely to skirt the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;30 percent commission&lt;/a&gt; that Apple takes for purchases made in third-party apps on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla allows drivers to play video games in moving cars, raising safety concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HwCV64p7GydX-hI2pjeCNmL8oRY=/0x140:3341x2367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244439/IMG_0832.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;You could play Sky Force Reloaded while driving — but you shouldn't. | Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WJxKd8"&gt;Tesla updated its software allowing vehicle occupants to play video games on the center touchscreen while in motion, raising questions about safety and driver distraction. Previously, video games were only playable while the vehicle was in park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WoGkWt"&gt;But according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/business/tesla-video-game-driving.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an over-the-air software update was pushed out last summer enabling the ability to launch some games regardless of whether the car was stationary or not, raising serious concerns about safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8v2mEs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; confirmed the ability to play video games while the vehicle is in motion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ddgqmY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; confirmed in a Tesla Model 3 that &lt;em&gt;Sky Force Reloaded&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Solitaire&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Battle of Polytopia&lt;/em&gt; are playable on the center touchscreen while the vehicle is in motion. A notification asks the player to confirm they aren’t the driver before launching the game, but the message is hardly a deterrent. A driver could easily tap “I AM A PASSENGER” and play a complex action game like &lt;em&gt;Sky Force&lt;/em&gt; while in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Tesla center screen is displaying the warning prompt on a black background to confirm you are a passenger, allowing you to tap a button to continue the game." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G4E5Ol-Le2meNHOodGTXhStJrVI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071674/IMG_0834.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Double-check if you’re a passenger﻿&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BUYLPd"&gt;Some interactive apps in the car worked in motion even before the update, including the drawing pad and the Karaoke mode in music — which also warns the driver not to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RD8nUn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are aware of driver concerns and are discussing the feature with the manufacturer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nf9TAl"&gt;A Model 3 owner told the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;that he had filed a complaint to the NHTSA upon discovery of the games being playable while driving in his car. That complaint won’t be a first. Tesla currently has &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2021/TESLA/MODEL%2525203/4%252520DR/AWD"&gt;59 complaints&lt;/a&gt; from owners regarding the Model 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jo6OMY"&gt;A spokesperson for NHTSA &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-auto-safety-agency-discussing-video-game-feature-with-tesla-2021-12-08/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it was “discussing” the issue of playable video games in moving cars with the company. “Distraction-affected crashes are a concern, particularly in vehicles equipped with an array of convenience technologies such as entertainment screens,” the spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. “We are aware of driver concerns and are discussing the feature with the manufacturer.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Tesla center screen is displaying a video game running with a jet craft flying over an ocean, while also displaying the status of the Tesla vehicle in drive and running on autopilot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lyfET7aS2WUCIt62fHZa8k-RSn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071692/IMG_0828.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky Force running while on Autopilot. Don’t try this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M9mX3H"&gt;Tesla has a reputation for regularly skirting safety rules and ignoring regulator recommendations for improvements. The company offers a version of its Level 2 advanced driver assist system called “Full Self-Driving,” which does not make its vehicles autonomous and requires drivers to stay vigilant while in use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48Wwdc"&gt;The US government has taken a renewed interest in Tesla, recently announcing that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa"&gt;investigating incidents involving Tesla cars operating Autopilot that have crashed&lt;/a&gt; into parked emergency vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dSSz0"&gt;NHTSA is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724171/nhtsa-tesla-letters-fsd-beta-autopilot-recall-emergency-vehicles"&gt;seeking more information from Tesla&lt;/a&gt; about the growing public beta test of FSD, the recently launched “Safety Score” evaluation process for entering the program, and the nondisclosure agreements Tesla was making participants sign up until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Tesla center display is showing a list of games in stacked squares that can be selected, and a button to play the game is visible on the screen though cannot be activated." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NmJ1ASdjBz8EeB-dT7O0JKk9OoA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071721/IMG_0831.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Previously released games like Cat Quest block the ability to launch the game while driving, a better way for Tesla to discourage unsafe behaviors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qw6mGj"&gt;Touchscreens in vehicles are quickly becoming the norm as manufacturers continue to remove tactile buttons and knobs from their vehicles. Many vehicles are becoming more dangerous as a result. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-seniors-autos/vehicle-infotainment-systems-dangerously-distracting-especially-for-seniors-idUSKCN1UK34F"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt;, drivers can get distracted and look away from the road for up to 40 seconds per task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0HpDh0"&gt;Tesla has pioneered the use of over-the-air software updates in the auto industry, using smartphone-style updates to add features like improved driver assistance to silly Easter eggs like “James Bond mode” to its electric vehicles. The company has also rolled out a whole suite of video games it calls Tesla Arcade (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18684297/tesla-arcade-model-3-hands-on-beach-buggy-racing-2-demo-electric-cars"&gt;we tried it out on a Model 3 back in 2019)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3meHK9"&gt;Tesla has started using an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457430/tesla-in-car-camera-driver-monitoring-system"&gt;interior camera&lt;/a&gt; to monitor drivers for its Full Self-Driving beta program, which allows drivers to use automatic steering, lane-keeping, and adaptive cruise control on local, non-highway streets. But the vast majority of Tesla vehicles do not use any cameras to track driver eye movements to ensure they are keeping their attention on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Masahiro Sakurai on the future of Smash: ‘I’ve been doing too much of the work myself’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iG8jRTHYwWLgzAJGWcPHz1hllNU=/0x118:1339x1011/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244366/Sakurai_pic.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VZsja8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; is finally complete. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128015/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;launching in 2018&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453214/super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch-masahiro-sakurai-e3"&gt;a roster that included every single character from the series’ long history&lt;/a&gt;, it has since been steadily updated with new fighters, culminating in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22690440/sora-kingdom-hearts-final-smash-ultimate-character-nintendo-switch"&gt;the addition of Sora from &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in October&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The game’s last major update &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoVS/status/1466218355262697472"&gt;came on December 1st&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIDzTg"&gt;Three years and countless charming video presentations later, series creator Masahiro Sakurai — &lt;a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/sakurai-on-smash-bros-ultimate-his-health-choosing-bosses-and-spirits-new-stages-much-more/"&gt;an infamous workaholic&lt;/a&gt; — seems to finally be taking it easy. “I have more free time now than I’ve probably ever had since I started working in game development,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; over email. That career has been tightly intertwined with &lt;em&gt;Smash, &lt;/em&gt;a series he has not only led but also been a key developer on for more than two decades.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“I have no regrets because &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; is like none other,” he says of his time working on the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fni5Sw"&gt;With development on &lt;em&gt;Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; wrapping up, there’s been much discussion on the future of the franchise — and particularly whether Sakurai would still be involved. I had the chance to ask the director a few questions over email, and we talked about working on new fighters, taking time off, and where &lt;em&gt;Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; goes from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5n7Dg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxlw7L"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the game was first announced at E3 2018, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453214/super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch-masahiro-sakurai-e3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you told me how daunting the prospect of creating such a large roster was&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. How did the post-launch development, and adding all of these new fighters, compare to that initial development process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62dN6i"&gt;You may have already noticed, but DLC fighters tend to be more uniquely made compared to standard fighters on the roster. Some sort of new in-game system is implemented, their Final Smash is accompanied by a visual sequence, they have a relatively elaborate stage setup and guests, and their battle tactics and in-game systems clearly set them apart from other existing fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xl8sKW"&gt;Fans are paying extra for these additional characters, so we tell ourselves that we need to strive and do our best to deliver content that is more than worthy. Given that, adding one piece of DLC fighter and their accompanying stages, music, and other content proved to be a greater challenge than adding one piece of content in the base game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cov4Lp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now that it’s finished, how does the final product compare to what you originally envisioned for the game? Are there elements you are particularly proud of?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxpwj1"&gt;We envision the finished product and aim for that as we work on the game, so where we landed is certainly not too far from that initial vision. Even so, I feel that there are still some shortcomings, which I took as lessons learned. I have a feeling the notion of “being proud of” differs between Japanese and English, but I do not wish to boast about what we have accomplished with this project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="29iso0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I knew that as long as we continued to work diligently, it would come to an end one day. “&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3bUAXU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After working on it for so long, was it hard to finally step away from the game? What was it like when you realized work was complete?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oGLGd"&gt;I knew that as long as we continued to work diligently, it would come to an end one day. This was a large-scale project that spanned many years, but even for a project like this, we still apply the same amount of effort to each step as with any other project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0s1Ehf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you managed to take any time off since Sora launched? What does a break for you look like (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1459390846709551112"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;aside from riding horses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rx26dx"&gt;Usually, I like to go on drives. I have more free time now than I’ve probably ever had since I started working in game development, so I occasionally go on short trips, overnight or just a day trip. My itinerary gets fairly packed since I like to make stops here and there. Also, it is fortunate that the COVID-19 situation in Japan has improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKXxC9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you ever have regrets about not being able to work on projects outside of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; over the last few years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ydSwd"&gt;I do sometimes look back and think about the fact that there may have been other opportunities had I not been working on &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; However, I have no regrets because &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; is like none other, and this was an opportunity that I could not have gained with any other project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32Moks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would convince you to come back to make another &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;? Do you think, if you did return, your role would be different or reduced?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XXd7m"&gt;I think we’ve reached the limit, at least in terms of volume of content and fighters. Basically, if I were to have the opportunity to work on another &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; game, that means we would have to shrink the roster, but we need to think about whether fans would be pleased about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EVOTnx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The current ‘Super Smash Bros.’ has too much of my personality poured into it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bo6vO1"&gt;Also, I’ve been doing too much of the work myself, so I’d need to resolve that, too. The current &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; has too much of my personality poured into it. In order for a long-time series to continue thriving today, we need to think about eliminating the series’ dependence on just one person’s vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxXQHy"&gt;Of course, this is the way it is now because we weren’t successful in splitting the vision between multiple people before. This would be a challenge for the future and something that needs to be discussed with Nintendo, if there were to be a next installment in the &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJ5gAY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07Z9W0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GTA Online’s next big update brings back Franklin and adds Dr. Dre</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/49uatkgJhC3aPXBvHyv_Zycqqzk=/117x37:1137x717/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244297/gta_online_contract.9.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rockstar Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CuByLA"&gt;Rockstar Games is releasing new story content for &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; featuring Franklin Clinton, one of the key characters from &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt;. In lieu of releasing standalone single-player expansions, the company is &lt;a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51ko98182a41o9/introducing-the-contract-a-new-gta-online-story-featuring-franklin-cli?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=o_social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=gtao_announcement_the-contract-20211208"&gt;weaving new story-focused missions&lt;/a&gt; into its massive online mode on December 15th. Despite what sounds like a more low-key approach, Rockstar seems to be going big with this one, including Dr. Dre’s likeness, as well as new, unreleased music from the legendary rapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3ZarM"&gt;The story apparently picks up in the years following the events that transpire in &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt;, and Rockstar got Franklin’s voice actor, Shawn Fonteno, to reprise the role. Aside from new missions, the content drop will include lots of new music. There will be a new radio station, as well as “huge first-of-their-kind updates to existing radio stations including a ton of new and unreleased exclusive tracks from Dr. Dre and a heavy-hitting line-up of artists,” says Rockstar. There will also be new side missions, weapons, and vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cQKg3ve3CW9LnCui1kYzL-QJnJk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23072822/gtaonlinedec15thupdate.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4K3ijH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/dr-dre-new-album-detox-2021-grand-theft-1248754/"&gt;Snoop Dogg claimed that Dr. Dre was making music for &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt; in late October&lt;/a&gt;. Many took that to mean it would debut at a much later date in &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto 6&lt;/em&gt; (which itself has yet to be confirmed by Rockstar Games), but players will be able to listen to Dr. Dre’s latest songs sooner than they might have expected. This new content will arrive as a free update that’s available to all &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; players.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram head Mosseri to face questions about child safety in Senate hearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u7Hav0GIvwIV9pZjTigHfpX9FGY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244271/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S5W6XR"&gt;On Wednesday afternoon, head of Instagram Adam Mosseri will appear before a Senate Commerce subcommittee to answer questions about whether the photo-sharing app is harmful to children’s health. It’s Mosseri’s first appearance before Congress and the first hearing to specifically address Instagram separately from Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Li0m6S"&gt;The hearing, titled Protecting Kids Online: Instagram and Reforms for Young Users, will be &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/12/protecting-kids-online-instagram-and-reforms-for-young-users"&gt;streamed live from the Senate&lt;/a&gt; beginning at 2:30PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bECky1"&gt;Instagram has been the focus of growing concern from lawmakers and parents, following a bombshell &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline"&gt;report in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; based on documents provided by whistleblower Frances Haugen. Those documents suggested that Facebook was well aware that Instagram is “toxic” for its teenage users and that its algorithms could direct them to content that may encourage self-harm. Lawmakers have said they want to toughen child privacy laws, including updating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and are seeking broader reforms aimed specifically at Facebook and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QloKUN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Parents ... have a right to know the truth about the safety of Instagram.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bcyvd1"&gt;In October, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) wrote a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, demanding the company explain how Instagram plans to protect children. He later extended the invitation to Mosseri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbg0SJ"&gt;“Parents across America are deeply disturbed by ongoing reports that Facebook knows that Instagram can cause destructive and lasting harms to many teens and children, especially to their mental health and wellbeing,” &lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2021.10.20%20-%20Facebook%20and%20Instagram%20-%20Consumer%20Protection%20Invitation.pdf"&gt;Blumenthal wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “Those parents, and the twenty million teens that use your app, have a right to know the truth about the safety of Instagram.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1eD1Wo"&gt;Blumenthal has called for new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747330/snap-tiktok-youtube-facebook-papers-blumenthal-coppa-kids-child-safety"&gt;online child safety measures&lt;/a&gt; to address concerns around the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezwu63"&gt;Pressure is also mounting from anti-tech groups outside of Congress. On Tuesday, the Tech Transparency Project &lt;a href="https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/xanax-ecstasy-and-opioids-instagram-offers-drug-pipeline-kids"&gt;released a report&lt;/a&gt; claiming Instagram’s algorithms are recommending drug dealers’ accounts to underage users on the platform. Stephanie Otway, a spokesperson for Instagram parent company Meta, said in a statement &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/instagram-pushes-drug-content-teens-rcna7751"&gt;to NBC News&lt;/a&gt; that the platform does not allow drug sales, and that it would “continue to improve in this area in our ongoing efforts to keep Instagram safe, particularly for our youngest community members.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhACCm"&gt;Concerns about Instagram became particularly relevant in March, when news &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-instagram-for-children-under-13"&gt;leaked&lt;/a&gt; that parent company Facebook was planning a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338911/facebook-instagram-kids-privacy-coppa"&gt;version of Instagram for children under age 13&lt;/a&gt;. Reaction was &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22385570/instagram-for-kids-youtube-facebook-messenger"&gt;swift and mostly negative&lt;/a&gt;, with public health experts urging the company to reconsider, &lt;a href="https://fairplayforkids.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/instagram_letter.pdf"&gt;saying in an April letter&lt;/a&gt; that such a platform would “put young users at great risk.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V9ktBi"&gt;Facebook said in September it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;“pausing” work on the kids version of Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, with Mosseri insisting that the pause was not “a concession that the project is a bad idea.” &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CUU3AM9AaIx/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;ig_rid=af386193-8761-41af-b94b-e78d8f4c528a"&gt;He said&lt;/a&gt; at the time that he believed “parents would prefer the option for their children to use an age-appropriate version of Instagram — that gives them oversight — than the alternative. But I’m not here to downplay their concerns, we have to get this right.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HHAdk"&gt;Instagram has already made some minor product changes aimed at addressing concerns around unhealthy usage in advance of the hearing. On Tuesday, the platform rolled out the “Take a Break” feature it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774827/instagram-take-a-break-feature-test-meta-facebook"&gt;started testing last month&lt;/a&gt;, to users in the United States and other English-speaking countries. The feature prompts users to pause using the app after they’ve been using it for a certain time period. Take a Break is opt-in, but the company said a test of the feature showed that 90 percent of users will leave the reminders on once set. More parental controls over their teenagers’ use of Instagram will be released next year, &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/raising-the-standard-for-protecting-teens-and-supporting-parents-online"&gt;Mosseri wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a blog post announcing the changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPK2r1"&gt;Mariana Ruiz Firmat, executive director of nonprofit advocacy organization Kairos Action, said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that she remained skeptical of Instagram’s motives. “They don’t want to move young people off the platform,” Firmat said, “because they’re making so much money from young people on their platforms.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="anfJ31"&gt;Firmat added that she’s not encouraged by any of the new regulations Instagram announced Tuesday and doesn’t see the Take a Break feature as all that impressive. “They’re looking at young people as a primary target for their profit margin, so it’s hard to imagine they’re going to really change anything right now,” she said. “The platform is way too enticing and addictive to young users.”&lt;/p&gt;
