    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. There are currently three models to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4vnkg"&gt;The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop at least another $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. The three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E67sPx"&gt;Regardless of which model you choose, all three models support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at the Watch SE, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. But for those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0eLZZK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch SE review: pay a lot less to give up only a little","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6p1Qub"&gt;The best deal right now on the Apple Watch SE 40mm with GPS, you can get it for &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-aluminum%2F-%2FA-81498739%3Fpreselect%3D80606314%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;$250 at Target&lt;/a&gt;. This configuration is also on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5W9QWZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=8352f50c4c29885a93610962debcab11&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$269 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725900256762314827" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F555062032&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games Store now offers Spotify, signaling app store ambitions beyond just games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Z7M3duAph-o1wYyi26gflrs3x0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68542679/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7YV18j"&gt;Spotify is &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/spotify/home"&gt;now available on the Epic Games Store&lt;/a&gt;, signaling developer Epic’s ambitions to turn what has so far been strictly a games store into a more general app distribution platform. The Spotify app is free to download on the Epic Games Store, just like it is on the App Store, Google Play, or as a direct download for your PC or Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaKjdG"&gt;Spotify’s availability on the Epic Games Store arrives as Epic is in prolonged legal battles with Apple and Google over the business models of each company’s respective app store. Epic has sued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt; over the removal of the mobile version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;alleging antitrust violations and arguing that developers can and should be able to process their own payments and circumvent giving 30 percent of all in-app revenue to the store owner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhTnQf"&gt;The Epic Games Store is still a relatively new digital distribution platform, having launched in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/4/18124203/epic-games-fortnite-valve-steam-game-store-distribution-unreal-engine"&gt;December 2018&lt;/a&gt; as a rival to Valve’s Steam. But from the jump, Epic offered more generous payouts to developers, taking &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/about"&gt;only 12 percent&lt;/a&gt; of a developer’s revenues for its cut instead of the 30 percent taken in many cases by Valve, as well as Apple and Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yfEsdd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Epic Games Store now stores more than games! &lt;a href="https://t.co/RRvivqimsx"&gt;https://t.co/RRvivqimsx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1339603062957064194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="twzdaT"&gt;As of January, the Epic Games Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064951/epic-game-store-users-number-cross-play-revenue-valve-steam"&gt;has more than 100 million users&lt;/a&gt;, and presumably, that number has grown due in part to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/15/21260139/epic-games-store-sale-deals-discounts-gta-borderlands"&gt;Epic’s plentiful sales and giveaways&lt;/a&gt;. (A &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt; giveaway in May was so popular that it resulted in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258043/epic-games-store-down-gta-5-grand-theft-auto-free-pc"&gt;multi-hour store outage&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNIjnQ"&gt;With the Epic Game Store’s growing user base, developer-friendly fee structure, and the fact that it now hosts one of the most popular apps in the world, Epic seems to be making the case that non-gaming developers should consider its distribution platform as a viable alternative to other app stores.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="5b53xh"&gt;I always enjoy this time of the year. Usually, I take some time off of work and use it as a golden opportunity to tackle my ever-growing backlog of games. With the year wrapping up and a ton of great games already available (and even more coming over the next few years), it’s truly a great time to be a gamer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYuaN0"&gt;Today’s deals spotlight an incredible deal for PS4 and PS5 owners, a sale on Dell’s 27-inch 1440p gaming monitor, plus a few deals on some great headphones and wireless earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fHdAxM"&gt;Get two years of PlayStation Plus for less than $60&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1npEWm"&gt;If you were one of the lucky ones to grab a PS5, I recommend taking advantage of this &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states%3Fadmitad_uid%3De32d8d2030532f7c716099ec07a158f2%26af_id%3Dawinus%26utm_source%3Dawinus%26utm_medium%3Daw_173843_www.theverge.com%26utm_campaign%3Daw_Editorial%2BContent%26currency%3DUSD%26awc%3D20387_1608226294_d02a4e21dfe68dd25d479b87dd75426d&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2020%2F12%2F17%2F22180232%2Fplaystation-plus-two-year-membership-ps4-ps5-airpods-pro-deal-sale#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus subscription deal, which is $32&lt;/a&gt; at Eneba.com. However, if you want the most bang for your buck, I strongly advise picking up two one-year PlayStation Plus subscriptions. You can get it for $60 by using code &lt;strong&gt;DECEMBERPLUS&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout. This is a great deal, considering one-year of PlayStation Plus when purchased through a retailer like Sony is $60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6mJZw"&gt;This is a great price if you want online multiplayer, free monthly games, and access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a digital compilation of “generation-defining” PS4 games available exclusively for PS5 users with an active PlayStation Plus membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1PkT7"&gt;And yes, this membership will still work on PS4 consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="57p3e9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vUaxRi"&gt;Grab a 27-inch Dell 1440p gaming monitor for $450&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TfrSK0"&gt;If you recently upgraded your PC gaming rig to deliver a 1440p resolution gaming experience and need a monitor to support the higher resolution, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-27-gaming-monitor-s2721dgf%2Fapd%2F210-axeh%2Fmonitors-monitor-accessories%3FAID%3D4485850%26cjevent%3D1604740b406c11eb83c600aa0a240614%26gacd%3D9694607-23736398-5750457-266319267-127795103%26dgc%3Daf%26VEN1%3D12578053-4485850-162f05da406c11eba4e79633568f93140INT%26dclid%3DCOHZjoKQ1e0CFcnmKAUdgZcBwA#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell’s S2721DGF gaming monitor is down to $450&lt;/a&gt; (usually $610) on the company’s direct website. This monitor supports Nvidia G-Sync, includes a 16:9 aspect ratio IPS panel, and supports HDR400 with a 98 percent DCI-P3 color gamut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4Tiuch"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10232615"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="71kLdg"&gt;Save $100 on Sennheiser’s Momentum 3 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rPuSg7"&gt;If you want a comfortable pair of noise-canceling headphones and are okay with spending a pretty penny for better sound quality, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;Sennheiser’s third-generation Momentum Wireless headphones&lt;/a&gt; are excellent. Over at Amazon, you can get these wireless headphones for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Momentum-Cancelling-Headphones-Functionality/dp/B07VW98ZKG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b205e0761da348f87244cc7c77f67222&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 in black&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Momentum-Cancelling-Headphones-Functionality/dp/B08B3MJBW8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=84f04a510180642cbea1d89730b0446b&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kBHDvs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9636852"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oahnAZ"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro are under $200 (again) at Woot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bXlgAF"&gt;This is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/25/21719200/apple-airpods-pros-black-friday-deal-sale-walmart"&gt;not the lowest price&lt;/a&gt; we have seen Apple’s flagship wireless earbuds go, but getting these for under $200 is still a great bargain. The AirPods Pro are on sale at a few places, but &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-19" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the lowest right now is $190 at Woot&lt;/a&gt;. If you have an active Amazon Prime membership, you can get free shipping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FeOG6B"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uWgNHj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 12:15PM ET December 17th, 2020:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Eneba has slightly increased the price of the promotion on two years of PlayStation Plus from $58 to $60.

    <title>Dutch prosecutors say Donald Trump’s Twitter account was really hacked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Trump Golfs On A Mild December Sunday In Virginia" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sZNgfrGlsoF-HNUxXkT7ZJ4_V2w=/0x0:3336x2224/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68542559/1230110656.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Al Drago / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5FI758"&gt;Dutch prosecutors believe a security researcher hacked President Donald Trump’s Twitter account in October, despite earlier denials from the White House and Twitter. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/16/trumps-twitter-account-was-hacked-dutch-ministry-affirms"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a specialist police team investigated hacker Victor Gevers, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528745/trump-twitter-hack-claim-dutch-security-researcher-victor-gevers-maga2020"&gt;claimed to have guessed&lt;/a&gt; Trump’s password as “maga2020!” and breached his account. “We believe the hacker has actually penetrated Trump’s Twitter account, but has met the criteria that have been developed in case law to go free as an ethical hacker,” a public prosecutor’s office spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCYOzW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55337192"&gt;The BBC reports&lt;/a&gt; that Dutch law enforcement alerted US authorities to the findings. It’s unclear exactly what evidence Gevers provided to police; he previously offered screenshots that apparently showed him logged into Trump’s account. (&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epd4x7/twitter-trump-hack-evidence?utm_content=1603399116&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=motherboard_twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; published an article&lt;/a&gt; casting additional doubt on Gevers’ story, pointing out a missing emoji in Trump’s bio, but that could be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alcyonsecurity/status/1319543147253403649"&gt;explained by factors&lt;/a&gt; like using a browser plugin.) Gevers said he’d guessed Trump’s password during a routine check on major public figures’ account security, and he didn’t deface or otherwise compromise the account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HK2Vif"&gt;Twitter denied the original hacking reports in October, saying that it saw “no evidence to corroborate this claim” from Gevers. “Our original statement still stands and we have nothing further to share,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in response to the prosecutor’s new conclusion. The White House has also strenuously denied the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5qIkg"&gt;Trump has &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2013/02/donald-trump-twitter-account-was-hacked-087912"&gt;admitted at least one breach&lt;/a&gt; of his personal Twitter account, which he’s continued to use in office. But Gevers allegedly hacked Trump’s account just a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21443741/twitter-security-election-chaos-election-accounts-prompt-notification-password-two-factor"&gt;Twitter ramped up security&lt;/a&gt; for high-profile users, and Twitter said it had “proactively implemented account security measures” for high-profile government accounts. The hack would have required Trump to break Twitter’s best practices and disable two-factor authentication, a basic security precaution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LC7Z9w"&gt;That said, the Trump administration’s response to far &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; serious cybersecurity threats &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174429/solarwinds-hack-russia-cisa-christopher-krebs-cybersecurity-infrastructure"&gt;hasn’t inspired much confidence&lt;/a&gt;. And at least one law enforcement agency is taking Gevers’ admission seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Prosecutors say Google accessed private WhatsApp messages — but the evidence is thin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EhzHEcKwjv9Xd_t0PCCtbIiAPaY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68542515/akrales_170512_1743_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1i4pN8"&gt;On Wednesday, the Texas attorney general announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178988/google-antitrust-ad-tech-lawsuit-texas-attorney-general-paxton"&gt;a far-reaching antitrust case&lt;/a&gt; against Google’s ad business. &lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20428869-the_state_of_texas_et_al_v_google__txedce-20-00957__00010"&gt;The complaint&lt;/a&gt; makes a lot of eye-opening allegations, including a long-running conspiracy between Google and Facebook to defuse the threat of header bidding, but one of the strangest allegations had to do with WhatsApp. According to the complaint, Google made a deal with Facebook to access millions of private messages, and photos from WhatsApp users, shortly after the app was acquired.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwTZUS"&gt;The specific allegation comes 57 pages into the complaint. The passage is heavily redacted, but it unmistakably alleges an exclusive agreement between Google and Facebook, granting Google access to users’ WhatsApp messages.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BZozDixph--tAUeyMHZ-qCEuqag=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22177260/Screen_Shot_2020_12_17_at_8.55.32_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An excerpt from p57 of the Texas v. Google complaint.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q4rAe3"&gt;This is an extraordinary claim for a couple of reasons. WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted, which means Facebook did not have centralized access to user messages at the time of the acquisition. (This is in contrast to a service like Gmail, where Google retains all of the messages on its servers and can scan them en masse.) That should make it impossible for Facebook to cut this kind of access deal to another company since it doesn’t have access itself. The whole point of end-to-end encryption is that it’s impossible for a company to trade away user privacy in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKkA4A"&gt;So... what is Texas talking about here? The clearest explanation — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1339326648160669696"&gt;put forward by Stanford’s Alex Stamos&lt;/a&gt;, among others — is that the passage is actually referring to backup files, which are initiated by the user and lie outside the service’s end-to-end encryption. But even then, the claims don’t quite hold water. Google does make it easy for Android users to store WhatsApp backups on Google Drive — but there’s nothing exclusive about the deal, and it’s not clear why it would have required a written contract. iOS users can store backups on iCloud too, and in each case, the backup is only created if the user initiates it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0wkHA"&gt;Neither Google nor Facebook would provide an on-the-record statement, citing the sensitivity of the ongoing legal proceeding, but on background, both denied any exclusive deal to share WhatsApp user data. Google also pointed to a previous statement from Sundar Pichai, where the CEO committed to not using Drive data for advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QirWWv"&gt;“We don’t sell your information to anyone,” Pichai &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/keeping-private-information-private/"&gt;wrote in June&lt;/a&gt;, “and we don’t use information in apps where you primarily store personal content—such as Gmail, Drive, Calendar and Photos—for advertising purposes, period.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvihPi"&gt;That leaves us in a difficult place. This complaint was the result of months of probes to both Google and Facebook, which almost certainly turned up information that hasn’t been made public. But the redactions and general confusion around the case make it difficult to tell how much is actually there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEVA1f"&gt;The idea of a backroom deal to unlock millions of private messages is too alarming to ignore, but it’s also too alarming to accept at face value — especially when it contradicts so much of what we know about how these systems work. Along with the other claims of Facebook collusion, this will place a massive burden of proof on prosecutors as the case goes forward. But for now at least, it seems as if Texas has dropped a bombshell claim without backing it up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offer noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-822" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000014846099%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Brand%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9008008%26targetid%3Dpla-82462042369%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6-IseMU-VKzo5xzTTBT8BVk65z1R7t_lZHR-ApDuYug7wocNVuNr-RoCuiUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D433%26%26adid%3D22222222227281354149%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D339987579106%26wl4%3Dpla-667825192756%26wl5%3D9008008%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D111830562%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D604342441%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA61H2BRTbBBeDsoekxoiD1iyavhCvjOe-rc1VRE8KROBAR83M_YmAIBoC31kQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $125 or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725261146929567782" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160, which is what this pair of wireless earbuds are currently going for at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4781ccd9dac6fb8bf9e60c657cd3fbba&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724675251539044953" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000014846099%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Brand%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9008008%26targetid%3Dpla-82462042369%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6z1zgThWDp2tf3j60kOubPIybm5uNl4EBzedCsO2Rm4cjFVJV1QJbxoCUaAQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt; Compared to the options above, Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality, noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The best deal right now is at Woot, which has Apple’s flagship earbuds for $190. If that deal sells out, you can get them for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$199 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Fapple-airpods-pro-mwp22am-a-in-the-ear-bluetooth-headset-white%2Fproduct_24422954&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Staples&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Spin is adding sensor-powered ADAS to its electric scooters to curb scofflaw riding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XJJNmeGtN8PP5z9UfTtKrgePHLs=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68532706/A51A1055__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Spin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XGEvRH"&gt;Spin, the electric scooter company owned by Ford, says it has a novel solution to the problem of sidewalk clutter and scofflaw riders. The company is teaming up with an IoT startup called Drover AI to add cameras, sensor arrays, and onboard computers to all of their scooters in the hopes of curbing improper parking and riding behavior by customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQBe3n"&gt;Spin has forged an “exclusive partnership” with the Los Angeles-based Drover AI to use the startup’s PathPilot technology in Spin’s next-generation Insight monitoring platform in US cities. By equipping its scooters with cameras and sensors, Spin hopes to better “understand its surroundings in real time and assist riders in making safe riding decisions.” Also, Spin will share data generated by the new equipment with cities to help them better regulate shared fleets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="atOALY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Understand its surroundings in real time and assist riders in making safe riding decisions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8MWKdF"&gt;Ideally, Spin will be able to track where its scooters are being ridden, and then share that data with cities so planners can make decisions about traffic congestion and bike lane placement. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EZo9moRTe6QgB9r3COZ10AaGhRg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22178632/Artboard_5.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Spin&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lc0GkZ"&gt;Since they launched several years ago, the shared scooter industry has been plagued by the twin scourges of sidewalk clutter and dangerous riding behavior by some customers. This has led cities to demand more innovative solutions from companies for controlling how their vehicles are used in public spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aasjXj"&gt;Drover AI’s new equipment is attached right below the handlebars, with a second module fixed lower on the stem. Spin describes the “array of sensors” as “visual, inertial, environmental, and positioning sensors,” which will be used for “granular location awareness.” Think of it as an advanced driver assistance system, like Tesla’s Autopilot, Spin says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="rAQzF0"&gt;Akin to advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that use on-board sensors to help automobile drivers park, brake, and stay in their lanes, Spin Insight Level 2 has the ability to combine the latest in sensor and artificial intelligence technologies to enable local regulation compliance enforcement and create a safer experience for riders and pedestrians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wSDkLE"&gt;The company is hoping that the new technology will give it an edge in New York City, which is now accepting applications for a limited number of permits for its first shared scooter pilot. The competition for the new permits is expected to be fierce, with practically every major scooter company hoping to prove its commitment to safety and law-abidingness to the city’s Department of Transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fn0cc9"&gt;New York City is expected to announce the winners in spring 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrSHDHNRiQrX7uCuXdtZyYvmZKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this incredibly tough time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a Nintendo Switch (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a Switch Lite (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that are preowned or refurbished — will likely continue to sell out quickly during the pandemic. But we’ll do our best to keep this article up to date with the latest in-stock offers, and we’ll tell you when each offer was posted. When something gets sold out, we’ll try to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="D0nXc0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 8 best games for your new Nintendo Switch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/25/21012569/nintendo-switch-best-games-2019-pokemon-zelda"},{"title":"The best games of 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21126558/best-games-2020-ps4-ps5-xbox-nintendo-switch-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch Lite is the smaller, portable-only version of the console that comes in a few different color options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o2G175"&gt;If you’re not against buying a preowned or refurbished console, you’ll want to check out &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-with-gray-joy-con%2F206007.html%3Fgclid%3DCjwKCAiAt9z-BRBCEiwA_bWv-HzeKt4-dsaWdi9G9SGmxFTUUEAxrCA4NxZS0xEWCkIacwTZ_cUKPRoCEYUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html"&gt;Nintendo’s own online store where it sells refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Those have been sold out recently, but there’s no telling when it will restock the page with some repaired, refreshed consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqBPoZ"&gt;Oddly enough, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frover.ebay.com%2Frover%2F1%2F711-53200-19255-0%2F1%3Fmpre%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebay.com%252Fstr%252Fnintendo%26campid%3D5338421472%26toolid%3D20008&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21257643%2Fnintendo-switch-lite-how-to-buy-in-stock#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo has its own official seller page on eBay&lt;/a&gt;, which usually hosts refurbished Switch consoles, though it has been closed “until further notice” due to the pandemic. Still, that’s worth keeping an eye on, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a microSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SC7BZHR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=d9d13492d7a2383ae455b1e464853cbe&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $70&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074RNRM2B/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=ebcbe0aae0692190d419f2c892d31718&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A 400GB microSD card will cost you around $45&lt;/a&gt;, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nintendo Switch does not include a Pro Controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro controller, Walmart also has the normal &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Black%2F55485228&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Switch Pro controller for $59&lt;/a&gt;, knockings $11 off its normal retail price.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=e9815cab861c6f59255b7b948189eef3&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $20 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KY69YFM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=a424685866013735203d8722ee49a601&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose Sleepbuds II review: get your eight hours</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;These earbuds are only made for sleeping&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="F2fq6a"&gt;Like I imagine many of us do these days, I often have trouble sleeping. To add to that, I have always been a light sleeper and can be easily awakened by a variety of noises: an especially loud siren outside, a crack of thunder, the heat suddenly coming on in the early morning hours. So I was the perfect person to try out the Bose Sleepbuds II, a set of $250 earbuds, which are specifically designed not to play music or podcasts, but to block out and replace sounds that might disturb your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u57mCq"&gt;The Bose Sleepbuds II are a pair of small — very small — earbuds that were built specifically to try to help you sleep using a combination of sounds and music. They are a follow-up to the rather disastrous introduction of the first-gen pair, which suffered from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20899371/bose-sleepbuds-faulty-battery-issues-problem-refunds-price"&gt;inconsistent battery life and sudden shutdowns&lt;/a&gt;. This second generation has gone through several improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Sleepbuds are small enough to fit snugly into your ear." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gjNQfrOBCv32C7irpg2-e230IYg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22175615/akrales_201215_4331_0033.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sleepbuds II are small enough to fit snugly into your ear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N27JR5"&gt;To begin, they are using a completely different battery technology. The previous generation were built around silver zinc batteries that, according to a Bose representative, “are very high in energy density, which makes them very good for an application like ours.” In other words, they could pack a lot of battery life into a very small package. But they turned out not to be ideal for consumer products — thus, the sudden shutdowns. As a result, the Sleepbuds II are based around more familiar nickel-metal hydride batteries, which means they have approximately 10 hours of life rather than the previous 16 but should prove to be more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YBYZa1"&gt;Other changes include better low-end response to improve noise blocking, better connectivity, and an anti-friction coating to prevent extraneous sounds (like rubbing against a pillow) to interfere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="95ZApX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10231545"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9cWsHI"&gt;So now that we know what’s changed, how do they work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6BevW"&gt;The Sleepbuds II attach to your phone via a low-energy Bluetooth connection, which is used to transfer the various sounds to the buds. (Note that I use the term “transfer” and not “stream” since the sounds actually live on the buds rather than your phone.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPtg15"&gt;There are three classifications of sounds that you can listen to. Noise Masking sounds are supposed to cover up any noises (such as snoring) that can disturb your sleep. Naturescapes are meant to soothe you with natural sounds such as rain or leaves rustling. Finally, Tranquilities are quiet musical selections described as “relaxing tones.’’ A few of these are already loaded onto the buds when you get them; after that, you use Bose’s Sleep app to check out others you may want to use instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3CrqU"&gt;To tell you the truth, I couldn’t find much difference between many of the Noise Masking and Naturescapes sounds, especially since the former uses several nature sounds, such as a campfire or a breeze blowing. That didn’t bother me; both sets of sounds were pleasant enough. I was, however, disappointed with Tranquilities, which were, as far as I could tell, made up mostly of new-age genre music, useless to someone who finds that kind of monotonous tonality irritating. A quiet classical number would have worked a lot better for me — but of course, it’s a matter of taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rViBpP"&gt;The buds themselves come in a round, hockey puck-sized case with a top that slides open. They fit nicely into two small slots within the case, labeled for the left and right ears. The buds themselves are labeled for “L” and “R,” but the labels are covered by the tips, and so they aren’t much use. Still, it is easy enough to figure out which bud fits into which ear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="55P50L"&gt;A series of small LEDs at the edge of the case let you know how much power is left in the case itself. It will hold two or three power-ups before it needs to be plugged in via a USB-C connection. (The only way to know if the buds are low in power is to check the app.) There is also an LED in front of each earbud that pulses while each one is powering up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="LEDs let you know how much power is left in the case." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVt5DiTgAjZ3SLmfB7Bw2FChrO0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22175618/akrales_201215_4331_0088.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LEDs let you know how much power is left in the case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jjBNZl"&gt;The Sleepbuds come with three differently sized tips. I tried the medium, which were on the buds when I first got them, but they were uncomfortable, verging on painful, so I switched to the small, which fit fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZzTmUc"&gt;You use the associated Bose Sleep app to choose which sounds you want to listen to at night. The buds must be out of the case for them to attach to the app, and connecting takes around 15–20 seconds, but they always eventually attached. Because the sounds are directly downloaded into the buds, you can only have a limited number in your library at one time — usually about 10, although that can vary depending on which sounds you’re using. If you hit your maximum, you are warned that you have to remove a sound before you can upload another. The upload will take about 10 to 20 minutes — because the buds use low-energy Bluetooth, their upload speed isn’t going to be as fast as, say, your typical phone app — so it’s best to do your sound experimentation before bed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Sleep app lets you choose a sound for the night; you can also set an alarm." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sj9cda8TQo2Xem1i6MXGkOLb0MQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22175842/Screenshot_20201216_151723.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sleep app lets you control the buds; you can also set an alarm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Sleep app lets you choose a sound for the night; you can also set an alarm." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qC4amQUhhs-1Hs6V1rW6Kr_YHW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22175841/Screenshot_20201216_152009.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sound Library lets you download a variety of sounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2YAyZU"&gt;Besides the sounds themselves, you can also set an alarm and be alerted to phone calls. Both are useful. But while you can be alerted that a call is coming in, you can’t answer the phone using the buds. So while you may not wake your partner with an early phone call, you certainly might when rushing out of the room to answer it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJUW0I"&gt;If you don’t want to keep your earbuds attached to your phone all night, and you’ve already downloaded the sound you want to use, you can use the “phone free” mode. However, because you aren’t connected to the phone, you can’t use the alarm or be alerted to phone calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="alelFw"&gt;But do they work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UcZqqN"&gt;So, the main question: are they effective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqRnvb"&gt;To tell you the truth, as someone who is not used to falling asleep to anything but relative quiet (I live in NYC, so it’s got to be “relative”), the idea of purposefully listening to sounds or music seemed a little off to me. But I have to say, after trying it out, it is not a bad idea at all. I like listening to rain, and there were several noise-masking “rainy” sounds that worked quite well. The buds didn’t mask &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, but they took care of random street noises and the baby next door quite well. And other noises were, if not completely masked, deadened to the point where they weren’t much of a disturbance. (I can also see where the Sleepbuds would be ideal for napping on a plane or train.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tVjAbh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The buds didn’t mask &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, but they took care of random street noises and the baby next door quite well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qLQTx5"&gt;The buds were also perfectly comfortable to wear. During the test period, I wore them for about six to seven hours a night, with the sound constantly on (you can also set them to shut off after a certain number of minutes or hours) and found that they went from 100 percent to 40–45 percent power during that time. So using them at night, and then charging them during the day, works very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oKQGKB"&gt;Judging from my experience and what I’ve read about the first set of Sleepbuds, these are definitely an improvement over their predecessors. (There was at least one &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bose/comments/ji1z8z/sleepbuds_ii_burning/"&gt;report of the new model burning and discoloring&lt;/a&gt;, but the defective unit was apparently exchanged and no further problems were reported.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t97hDI"&gt;There’s only one more question to ask: are they worth the price? That depends. If you have real problems sleeping because of environmental noise or even tension, it might be worth it to pay $250 for a pair of earbuds whose only purpose is to help you sleep. (Of course, if your sleeplessness is due to medical issues such as sleep apnea, a doctor’s visit is probably in order.) The effectiveness of Bose’s Sleepbuds II is probably very personal. They may work well for some people and less so for others. In my case, they did improve my sleep somewhat, for which I was grateful — but whether they’d be worth the investment is something I’d have to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="XbXZIO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10229415"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Jzkw0F"&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

    <title>The best TV shows of 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wjN6FQkeTT4AJBcz36Ie5HKsKNo=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528994/JAN22_D035_EP08_078_1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: WarnerMedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mF7Lbs"&gt;TV was a constant companion in 2020. With most cultural institutions shut down, the small screen still managed to provide us with a deluge of new things to enjoy and talk about — far more than any one person could ever watch. In fact, at times this year, I found it difficult to watch anything — or at least, anything new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2npvQ"&gt;My habits were often fickle, and I danced across shows new and old; I started many and finished few on my journey to get lost in &lt;em&gt;something.&lt;/em&gt; And so even in this extraordinary year, the usual caveats apply. I am but one person, and I cannot watch &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; television. Here, in no particular order, are the shows that stayed with me, long after I turned off the set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLpaHC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sfrxqA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dare Me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HmU2un"&gt;While the show premiered in 2019, the rest of &lt;em&gt;Dare Me&lt;/em&gt;’s 10 episodes aired in 2020, and each of them was among the best dramas of the year. Based on Megan Abbott’s novel of the same name, &lt;em&gt;Dare Me&lt;/em&gt; followed the friendship between high school cheerleaders Beth and Addy — and what happened when their ambitious new coach Colette French got a little too involved in their lives. A high school noir thriller with tremendous pacing and performances, &lt;em&gt;Dare Me&lt;/em&gt; was brave, bold television that, while canceled, works incredibly well as a standalone season of TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqMcKL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Tf3VCz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To With John Wilson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3jXpER"&gt;The strangest show of 2020, &lt;em&gt;How To&lt;/em&gt; is part documentary, part video essay, and part cringe comedy. Each of &lt;em&gt;How To With John Wilson&lt;/em&gt;’s six episodes starts with a simple question — how to split a check, for example — and then proceeds to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; answer it in the most incredible ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXoJ4s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How To &lt;/em&gt;is also an instruction manual for loving the city you live in: it&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;embraces the inherent strangeness of being in close proximity to so many others and responds to this weirdness with affection. No other show I’ve ever seen is so concerned with the meaning of scaffolding, or with a man who’s obsessed with the health benefits of foreskin. Watching &lt;em&gt;How To With John Wilson&lt;/em&gt; will make you care more about the weirdos in your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRmb7G"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TzyCm4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good Lord Bird&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NdQfwX"&gt;Americans’ collective understanding of history is uncomplicated and dishonest and needs upending. Fortunately, in the meantime, there’s &lt;em&gt;The Good Lord Bird&lt;/em&gt;, a show based on the James McBride novel of the same name. The show presents itself as a mostly-true account of abolitionist John Brown’s final days, as seen through the eyes of a young man he “rescues” and continually mistakes for a girl. It’s a funny and blunt look at the messy work of revolution, a story interested in tearing down the myth that progress is seen as a clean and noble pursuit in its time.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VAOPI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="cgDVuj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BIXtU4"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Friday Night Lights &lt;/em&gt;were a comedy, it’d probably look a lot like &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;. The sleeper-hit series fleshes out the eponymous character — who’s mostly known from commercials — and builds a fish-out-of-water comedy around him. The premise: Ted Lasso, a folksy American football coach, is inexplicably hired to lead a troubled soccer team in England. It’s a ridiculous idea and everyone knows it — but what no one knows is that Lasso is being set up to take the fall by a cynical team owner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXxrZA"&gt;In this tension, &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;sings: it’s a show about what it means to relentlessly work to be a good, positive person in a hostile environment. It’s about picking yourself up over and over again in the hopes that your faith in others becomes contagious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik7yc2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ArnrGB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mythic Quest: Raven’s Banquet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="tDkdSZ"&gt;The first good show about video games is here, and, surprisingly, it’s also terrific fun for people who don’t know the first thing about them. A scathing workplace comedy about the pleasures (few) and toxicity (plentiful) of game development from the creators of &lt;em&gt;It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt; follows the employees at a studio behind a popular online game. The show succeeds because it refuses to pull punches: &lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt; makes no bones about the fact that it’s a show about a sexist industry that seeks to pacify online trolls and Nazis, and with that clarity comes some pretty damn good comedy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIgaCs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3rh8nG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Boys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6N7Nsr"&gt;Superheroes are blunt instruments, primary-color metaphors for very simple ideas. This isn’t a drag. I think it’s what makes them good, a vehicle for stories that translate across decades and media. &lt;em&gt;The Boys&lt;/em&gt; is a show about the people wielding those instruments, now that they’ve become extremely valuable corporate IP, controlled by a handful of people. Juvenile, on-the-nose, and incredibly bingeable, &lt;em&gt;The Boys&lt;/em&gt; grew in its second season and turned its eye toward fandom, and what happens when you cheer for a country like you do a rock star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="op7Dp8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="9RbVAI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I May Destroy You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BzetYq"&gt;Arabella is on a deadline. She’s a viral success story, a blogger with a successful debut book working on her follow-up — mostly futilely. Because in the meantime Arabella is also struggling to rebuild her life after being drugged and raped on a night out. &lt;em&gt;I May Destroy You&lt;/em&gt; shows Arabella taking on these twin endeavors; the result is a searing work of introspective television about what happens to a person who works in a world interested in the exploitation of trauma, and how the stories we tell ourselves to survive can also break us down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVur13"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I May Destroy You&lt;/em&gt; is a messy, complicated story about equally messy and complicated people. It’s one of the best things you can watch this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBc3hM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ScNPMW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="z58FJk"&gt;Few shows are concerned with portraying complicated struggles of religious faith; even fewer are interested in exploring these stories in non-Christian contexts. &lt;em&gt;Ramy&lt;/em&gt; is different. In its second season, the Hulu comedy from comedian Ramy Youssef becomes a show about a young man who is bad at being Muslim but desperately wants to be good at it. Ramy pledges himself to a new sheikh, only to learn the depths of his all-consuming selfishness. It slowly alienates him from everyone he cares about, despite their faith in him. In &lt;em&gt;Ramy&lt;/em&gt;, faith makes you consider your own failings, and asks: what next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eouneA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8gwGx4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dGLMUe"&gt;Anyone who’s watched &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt; knows that, five seasons in, Saul Goodman is going to do something irredeemably awful. &lt;em&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/em&gt;’s 2020 episodes brought us closer to heartbreak as well-meaning huckster Jimmy McGill fully embraces his Saul Goodman alter ego and plays dangerous games with Kim Wexler, one of the only people who still cares about him. Catch up now — because while it’s far less popular than its predecessor &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/em&gt; has become a much better show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzdfIE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GjWQsD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doom Patrol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HC7crW"&gt;The second season of &lt;em&gt;Doom Patrol &lt;/em&gt;ditches the more annoying aspects of its first season — namely, an annoying, omniscient villain who &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; narrated — and doubles down on what worked: stories about broken people Going Through It. In &lt;em&gt;Doom Patrol&lt;/em&gt;, accepting who you are is dangerous, frightening work, especially when you might be a powerful cyborg, host to a deadly cosmic being, or a system of alternate personalities that each possess a devastating power. Irreverent, weird, and affectionate, &lt;em&gt;Doom Patrol &lt;/em&gt;is the best new DC Comics adaptation you can watch right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpMBPO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zBrXjA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Last Dance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yDJthD"&gt;Was Michael Jordan the GOAT? We could argue all day. Was he really that &lt;em&gt;popular&lt;/em&gt;? Without question. &lt;em&gt;The Last Dance &lt;/em&gt;is less about Michael Jordan the man than it is about Michael Jordan the phenomenon. Framed against in-depth, never-before-seen footage that followed Jordan’s final year with the Chicago Bulls, the superstar’s career is recounted across 10 episodes that feature interviews with former teammates, rivals, and His Airness himself. Filmed with Jordan’s involvement, it’s less an argument about the man and more a document of how he sees his time as the biggest name in basketball — which, like the best documentary subjects, is a bit more revealing than he might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4cjid"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XEr89z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What We Do In The Shadows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WuOUTR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What We Do In the Shadows&lt;/em&gt; became great in its second season by leaning into the things that made it different from the film it was based on. Namely, Colin Robinson, an “energy vampire” who looks like a normal dude — only he feeds off the misery victims get from the &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; dull conversations he holds. And then, Guillermo de la Cruz, a familiar who desperately wants to be a vampire but has &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; learned he is destined to be a vampire hunter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khYd2h"&gt;These two are &lt;em&gt;What We Do In The Shadows’&lt;/em&gt; secret weapons, comedic haymakers deployed when the already-good premise of a mockumentary about vampires living together in Staten Island needs a little bit of shaking up. Which, honestly, doesn’t really need to happen. That &lt;em&gt;What We Do in the Shadows &lt;/em&gt;does it anyway is why it’s one of the best comedies on TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfkfzf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
