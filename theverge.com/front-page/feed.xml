    <title>The best budget laptop of 2022</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best cheap laptops under $800 from HP, Lenovo, and more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="ItC6sO"&gt;The best cheap laptops are getting better and better for less than $800. The question to ask is: what’s most important, and what are you willing to sacrifice? Even the best cheap laptops aren’t perfect in every area — they have some strengths but cut corners to achieve their price tags. You can almost certainly find a budget laptop with a touchscreen, a premium-looking chassis, an HDMI port, a backlit keyboard, or stylus support, but you may need to consider which of those features you want the most, and which you can go without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqLems"&gt;Our pick for the best cheap laptop of 2022 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;, running Windows 10. We feel that the Envy has build quality, performance, and battery life that surpass those of many premium laptops, as well as those priced under $800. But we’ve tested dozens of systems below $800, and we’ve got a number of additional models on this list from Lenovo, Acer, Samsung, HP, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVG16P"&gt;Other best cheap laptops of 2022 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these laptops also appear on our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptop&lt;/a&gt; lists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPoJxi"&gt;Many of our picks for the best cheap laptop of 2022 are currently Chromebooks. We believe that Chromebooks are, in many cases, the best-value option for shoppers seeking a laptop under $500 and tend to offer better specs, features, and build quality than most Windows laptops at that price point. We hope to add more Windows laptops under $500 to this page in the future and are keeping a close eye on those releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best cheap laptop ofof 2022&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="r62WQ4"&gt;HP’s Envy x360 13, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeBestLaptop101521&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-envy-x360-laptop-13z-ay000-8lz58av-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $860&lt;/a&gt; is the best budget laptop you can buy under $800. With a high-quality and sturdy convertible build, it looks like a device that should cost twice its price. It has plenty of other great features as well, including a really excellent keyboard and a bright, colorful screen. It’s also exceptional on the inside. Thanks to its AMD Ryzen processor, the system delivers all-day battery life and very smooth performance — it can even handle some light gaming. (Intel options are available as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ox216u"&gt;We have some minor complaints about the Envy, of course. The screen is 16:9, which is a cramped aspect ratio for multitasking. Our test unit had a somewhat limited port selection (notably, missing Thunderbolt and HDMI support) and came with some bloatware preinstalled. But none of these are deal-breakers at the Envy’s price point. Overall, budget shoppers will want for very little with this machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best laptop under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hyeIry"&gt;If you’re looking for an absurdly cheap Chromebook that absolutely gets the job done, you should definitely be looking at the $260 Lenovo Chromebook Duet. The Duet is a 10-inch aluminum alloy Chrome OS tablet that comes with a kickstand and keyboard cover. It looks sturdy and classy, and it can easily function as either a tablet or a PC. But you’re not compromising &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;much on performance for this device’s tiny size; as long as you’re not running dozens of tabs and apps, you should be fine. And we got over 11 hours of battery life in our testing, making it one of the longest-lasting Chromebooks we’ve seen in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHlVCe"&gt;The main thing to know about the Chromebook Duet is that the screen is quite small — just 10.1 inches. That’s a fine size for a young student (especially with the touch capability) and for an adult’s secondary device for note-taking, Netflixing, and the like, but it’s not an ideal size for a primary work device unless you’re fine with quite a bit of squinting. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the clamshell Chromebook to buy, and one of the best cheap laptops under $800.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SoHxJX"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best budget laptop with Chrome OS &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="N34v09"&gt;If you’d prefer a more traditional Chromebook with a clamshell form factor, the $329 Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is an affordable option that’s all-around excellent. It has a gorgeous 3:2 display that delivers a sharp picture and bright, vibrant colors with plenty of vertical space. The screen alone would make the Chromebook Spin 713 a standout, but it has a number of other strengths as well, including a great keyboard, all-day battery life, and a comprehensive port selection, including an HDMI, in addition to USB-C, USB-A, and a microSD slot. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 is the best cheap laptop with a built-in stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SSaLnR"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best cheap laptop with a stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iQA7Ph"&gt;If you like the Duet’s size and detachable form factor but are willing to spend on something a bit more upscale, you may find the Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 to be a better choice. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, kickstand, and detachable screen. But the CM3’s kickstand folds multiple ways: you can crease it lengthwise to stand the tablet up like a laptop or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. Plus, it comes with a built-in USI stylus and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. Battery life was also quite impressive: we averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUYikQ"&gt;Where the CM3 lags a bit behind the Duet (and other cheap laptops you may try) is the power. Its MediaTek processor can be a bit sluggish compared to more pricier offerings. But the CM3 still offers a surprising number of perks for its sub-$400 price and makes a great student driver or secondary device. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Pavilion Aero 13 is a 13-inch powerhouse that weighs almost nothing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best laptop under $800&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="o8zBHM"&gt;If you’re looking for a budget Windows laptop that’s thinner and lighter than the Envy x360 while delivering similar category-topping performance, the $669 HP Pavilion Aero 13 is a good choice for you. It has a powerful eight-core Ryzen processor, which is one of the fastest processors for thin and light laptops that you can get. Not only does it perform well, but it’s also unbelievably light at just 2.1 pounds, and it comes with a blindingly bright 16:10 screen. It’s a standout in battery life, too — I averaged almost 11 hours of continuous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOWROI"&gt;HP did have to cut a few corners to achieve those benefits at this price point. The audio on our model wasn’t great, and the device shipped with some cheap bloatware installed. But the Pavilion Aero 13 is excellent in almost every other way, and it won’t disappoint if you’re looking for a functional, cheap Windows PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;An affordable laptop with a bold look&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pT23AG"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable Chromebook that stands out from the crowd, the $549 Galaxy Chromebook 2 should be on your list. It comes in a bold “fiesta red” color (as well as a regular gray, if you prefer to blend in). It’s a touchscreen convertible with stylus support (though the stylus isn’t included). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QIDME"&gt;On top of the design, the Galaxy Chromebook 2 includes an excellent QLED panel, which is one of the best displays we’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. You also get a solid keyboard, decent battery life (we averaged 7 hours and 21 minutes of continuous work), and a port selection that includes two USB-C ports, a microSD slot, and a headphone jack. It’s easily one of the best Chromebooks you can buy and one of the best cheap laptops as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best cheap laptop for Surface fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9t4Ji3"&gt;The $399 Surface Go 2 is a 10.5-inch tablet that’s about the size of a regular iPad. You’ll have to buy the keyboard cover separately, but the overall package is still quite affordable if you’re buying a lower-priced model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hPLGr"&gt;You can configure the Surface Go 2 with a Pentium Gold or Core m3 processor. Those aren’t the fanciest or most powerful processors, but the system should still be adequate for your streaming and browsing needs, especially if you only need it to do one task at a time. It can run any Windows app, it’s easy to carry around, and it makes a solid secondary computer. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Swift 3 is one of the best college laptops you can buy, and one of the best cheap laptops under $800.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cIbAld"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21377208/acer-swift-3-review-2020-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Acer Swift 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best student laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DeUYiZ"&gt;Many of the best cheap laptops might be good choices for high school and college students, but the Acer Swift 3’s exceptionally durable build makes it an excellent choice for backpack-battering and dining hall spills. Its 14-inch screen also gives you more room for homework multitasking than some of the 13-inch machines here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVxnSd"&gt;But the highlight of the Swift 3 is its Ryzen 4000 processors. We tested a model with a Ryzen 7 4700U, which did an excellent job handling our daily multitasking workload, and delivered seven-hour battery life as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWSkuR"&gt;On the outside, the Swift 3 isn’t the thinnest or most beautiful laptop you can buy, but it’s a solid performer in most areas. It has all kinds of ports, including USB-C, USB-A, and an HDMI. The backlit keyboard has a nice click to it and has a reliable integrated fingerprint reader as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lenovo Yoga C740 is a sturdy aluminum laptop for any use case, making it one of the best cheap laptops under $800.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m9IrEq"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21174917/lenovo-yoga-c740-review-laptop-specs-features-price-2-in-1-convertible"&gt;Lenovo Yoga C740&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;A cheap laptop with standout build&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HqEdaD"&gt;The Yoga C740 is as straightforward as a laptop can get. It has a sturdy aluminum build and perfectly fine 10th Gen Intel processors. We were pleasantly surprised by the device’s audio — the upward-firing speakers on the sides of the keyboard deliver a nice surround-sound experience. The keyboard and touchpad are both quite comfortable to use. There’s not much to complain about and not much to enthusiastically praise — if you’re looking for a sub-$800 Windows laptop with a well-made aluminum chassis and a sturdy frame, you’re looking for the Yoga. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGHm6c"&gt;The C740 is a year old now, but that means you can get it at very affordable prices. We’re looking forward to reviewing its successor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373719/lenovo-yoga-7i-6-convertible-laptops-intel-amd-processors-windows"&gt;Yoga 7i&lt;/a&gt;, shortly in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gHKtoG"&gt;Gap is selling &lt;a href="https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/articles/2022-1/01/gap-launches-gamified-collectible-nft-experience-t"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, following other clothing retailers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22822143/adidas-nft-launch-into-the-metaverse-price-release-date"&gt;Adidas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22833369/nike-rtfkt-nft-sneaker-shoe-metaverse-company"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22800985/macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-nfts-auction"&gt;Macy’s&lt;/a&gt; that in recent months have jumped into the NFT space. The NFTs are built on the Tezos blockchain, which &lt;a href="https://tezos.com/carbon/"&gt;touts itself&lt;/a&gt; as a more energy-efficient option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wj9bRV"&gt;The NFTs come in the form of a series of digital hoodie art, with different levels of rarity at different price points. Common level pieces starting at roughly $8.30, or 2 tez, are on sale today. Rare, epic, and one-of-a-kind tiers will roll out over the next few weeks. Gap is partnering with artist Brandon Sines, creator of the Frank Ape cartoon character, on the designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yv7x69"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The gamified experience comes out to around $500.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrZ6TW"&gt;For shoppers who’d prefer to buy something wearable, look no further than the epic level NFTs, priced at around $415 (100 tez), which include digital art by Sines and a physical Gap x Frank Ape sweatshirt. But first, customers will need to purchase four common and two rare NFTs (priced at 6 tez, or roughly $24.90) to get the chance to buy an epic one, &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/90285/the-gap-tezos-nfts-physical-apparel-perks"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Decrypt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Gap says the “gamified experience” will encourage fans to collect hoodie art leading up to the epic level. In this case, the gamified experience comes out to around $500. If you’re not too picky about your clothing, Gap also has a 50 percent off sale right now that brings the price of a men’s hoodie to about $25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4oCqD"&gt;Gap has scaled back its physical presence over the past few years, retreating from the shopping malls it was once a mainstay in. In October 2020, the company announced it would close &lt;a href="https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/news/responds/gap-stores-update"&gt;350 Gap and Banana Republic stores&lt;/a&gt; in North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="av20ev"&gt;Though the NFT-ification is noteworthy, this isn’t the first time Gap has rolled out a special edition drop. The company saw success and buzz around the Yeezy Gap Hoodie in September, which Gap says resulted in the most sales of an item in a single day. The company said &lt;a href="https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/articles/2021/11/gap-inc-reports-third-quarter-results"&gt;70 percent of shoppers&lt;/a&gt; were new to Gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PpbOCw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4IppS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2021 was hot as hell, NASA confirms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MALTA-SIGGIEWI-WILDFIRE-HEATWAVE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3HqPKLV1d0LkOQWUzYBYJaEleAw=/0x0:4176x2784/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70383386/1234642957.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o3fPPM"&gt;The last eight years have been the eight hottest years on record, NASA and the National Oceanic Administration (NOAA) confirmed today. 2021 ranks as the sixth hottest year on record, the agencies said, as global average temperatures trend upward. Rankings aside, there were plenty of red flags throughout 2021 to show us how remarkable the year was for temperature extremes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEsqtU"&gt;“The fact is that we’ve now kind of moved into a new regime ... this is likely the warmest decade in many, many hundreds, maybe 1000s of years,” says Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. “There’s enough change that it’s having impacts locally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zTQ1r"&gt;In North America, those local impacts included epically bad summer heat, even for typically cool regions. In late June and early July, the Pacific Northwestern US and Western Canada struggled with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602208/june-heatwave-most-extreme-summer-record-north-america"&gt;record-smashing&lt;/a&gt; temperatures that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22559961/heat-roads-washington-oregon-climate-infrastructure"&gt;buckled&lt;/a&gt; roads and melted &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/29/1011269025/photos-the-pacific-northwest-heatwave-is-melting-power-cables-and-buckling-roads"&gt;power cables&lt;/a&gt;.  In the desert further south, California’s Death Valley reached a blazing 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54.4 degrees Celsius) in July, potentially breaking the world record for the hottest temperature ever recorded on the planet — for the second year in a row. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eqr2vP"&gt;Across the Atlantic, Europe experienced sweltering heat, too. A reading of 119.8 degrees Fahrenheit (48.8 degrees Celsius) &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/mediterranean-gripped-extreme-heat-new-reported-temperature-record"&gt;in Sicily&lt;/a&gt; might have broken the European record for maximum temperature. (The World Meteorological Organization is still &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/wmo-recognizes-new-arctic-temperature-record-of-38%E2%81%B0c"&gt;working&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21395621/hottest-temperatures-verification-research-death-valley-wmo-record"&gt;vet those records&lt;/a&gt;.) All told, July 2021 was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623843/july-2021-hottest-month-recorded"&gt;hottest month humans have ever recorded&lt;/a&gt;, according to NOAA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0HpFZ7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Record-smashing temperatures that buckled roads and melted power cables&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QPt5MA"&gt;More than a discomfort, the heat took a serious toll on communities. Emergency department visits spiked in the Pacific Northwest as a result of the extreme heat wave, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580120/emergency-department-visits-spiked-june-heat-wave-us-northwest"&gt;CDC reported&lt;/a&gt;. Further north, an inferno all but &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/world/canada/canadian-wildfire-british-columbia.html"&gt;wiped out the small town&lt;/a&gt; of Lytton, British Columbia soon after it recorded Canada’s highest temperature on record. The event stood out as one of the most shocking of 2021 for Schmidt. “The scale of human tragedy there, you know, even if people don’t die, that’s a community destroyed,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dERM3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/11/oceans-hottest-temperatures-research-climate-crisis"&gt;Heat trapped in the world’s oceans&lt;/a&gt; also reached record levels in 2021, according to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00376-022-1461-3"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published this week. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882502/marine-heatwaves-oceans-united-nations-ipcc-report-climate-change"&gt;Ocean heatwaves&lt;/a&gt; are likely twice as common now as they were in the early 1980s, and they can be devastating for marine life and coastal communities. They kill coral, take a toll on fishing and crabbing industries, and can even make droughts worse onshore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkAyFF"&gt;Temperatures might have been even hotter in 2021, were it not for a La Niña event. La Niña is a &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ninonina.html"&gt;recurring climate phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; defined by cooler-than-average waters in the eastern equatorial Pacific, which has predictable effects on weather patterns worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94E50n"&gt;Earlier this week, the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service released its own &lt;a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-globally-seven-hottest-years-record-were-last-seven"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; on global temperature records, which vary slightly from NASA and NOAA because the agencies use somewhat &lt;a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/earthmatters/2015/01/21/why-so-many-global-temperature-records/"&gt;different methods&lt;/a&gt; to make their calculations. Copernicus determined that 2021 was fifth warmest year on record. It also confirmed that the world has warmed by more than a degree Celsius since the preindustrial era, a result of greenhouse gases released by burning fossil fuels. Experts are urging a transition to clean energy because global warming needs to stay well below two degrees Celsius to prevent catastrophic climate change — as this year’s heat extremes illustrate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1zCV7"&gt;“We are unfortunately, reaping what we have sown,” Schmidt says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUi9Pb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwQl15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite is technically back on iOS, thanks to a GeForce Now game streaming loophole</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HtyUxf0pBtgDZv_BRibCrnvuzKs=/256x0:1792x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70383281/GFN_Thursday_January_13.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YlWmSf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is back on iOS today... sort of. The popular battle royale game isn’t back on the App Store (where it’s been missing since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;Apple pulled the app from its storefront&lt;/a&gt; in August 2020), but iPhone and iPad owners can now stream &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to play on their phones and tablets through Nvidia’s GeForce Now service, which opened up a closed beta today to test the new streaming version of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2L94w"&gt;Nvidia and Epic Games have been promising that Fortnite would come back to iOS through GeForce Now running through Safari’s web browser (the only way that Apple currently allows game streaming services like GeForce Now, Stadia, xCloud, or Luna to operate on iOS) &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/11/19/geforce-now-on-ios-safari/"&gt;as far back as November 2020&lt;/a&gt;, when the service first launched on Apple’s hardware. But it’s apparently taken quite a bit of time to sort out the details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PwgyeL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fortnite streamed to iOS, complete with touchscreen optimized controls&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YMVD3h"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has technically already been available on GeForce Now for Android users, but that version of the game is a streamed copy of the desktop version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. The new version that Nvidia and Epic Games are beta testing is optimized for mobile devices, with similar touchscreen controls and menus to the old native iOS and Android versions of the game. (Nvidia warns that Android users who join the beta will &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; be able to play the new mobile version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and won’t be able to use a keyboard and mouse like they currently can.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1WrZP"&gt;According to Nvidia, beta sign-ups start today, with “selected members” set to get access later in January. The company says that the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;beta will be a “limited time” process but that “we do not have an exact timeline for how long it will last.” Anyone interested in trying the new streamed version of Fortnite can sign up at Nvidia’s website, with both free and paid GeForce Now customers getting an “equal chance at the closed beta.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KP7q7m"&gt;Nvidia is notably the only game streaming service that Epic Games is partnering with for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; — as a deposition in the Apple / Epic trial revealed last year, Epic deliberately isn’t allowing Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407849/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-epic-games-block"&gt;to offer &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;as part of its xCloud service&lt;/a&gt;, due to concerns that xCloud would compete with Epic’s own PC offerings. Streaming &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; through xCloud to iOS would also require that Epic pay Microsoft’s 30 percent fee for in-app purchases — similar in Epic’s eyes to the Apple fees that led to the company’s lawsuit in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vhPDK6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite isn’t on Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming service because Epic won’t allow it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407849/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-epic-games-block"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OjhX3i"&gt;Nvidia’s GeForce Now service, on the other hand, just acts as a conduit for Epic’s existing storefront, meaning that Epic Games won’t have to hand over a cent of any of the in-game purchases players make on the new streamed version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; through GeForce Now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pv6m2h"&gt;Epic and Nvidia aren’t saying how long the beta will last or when to expect the GeForce Now-streamed version of Fortnite to be broadly available for all Android and iOS users. And while game streaming has improved in leaps and bounds in recent years, it’s hard to imagine that the streamed version will be a better long-term solution than the native Fortnite app that used to be on the App Store. Still, for Fortnite fans looking to get a quick round in on the go, the GeForce Now option will probably be better than nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>White House hosts tech summit to discuss open-source security after Log4j</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qGTwSp6WvpPDQQbMartrYY_gVn4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70383279/acastro_210708_4663_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QVdwQ2"&gt;The White House &lt;a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/white-house-log4j-open-source-software-security/"&gt;will meet with leaders of major tech&lt;/a&gt; companies including Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta, IBM, and Microsoft on Thursday to discuss the security of open-source software. The issue has become urgent in the wake of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828303/log4j-library-vulnerability-log4shell-zero-day-exploit"&gt;extremely serious Log4j vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, discovered in December 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iq5QbA"&gt;The summit will also include the Apache Software Foundation — the owner and maintainer of the Log4j library — and Oracle, owner of the Java software platform on which the Log4j library runs. GitHub and the Linux Open Source Foundation will also be represented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZhRJT"&gt;Executives from the tech companies will meet with representatives of various federal agencies, including the departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security. Other agencies include the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National Science Foundation, according to &lt;em&gt;Cyberscoop&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z05cZv"&gt;In the wake of the discovery and fallout from the Log4j vulnerability in December, White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/23/politics/white-house-log4j-tech-firms-meeting/index.html"&gt;described open-source security&lt;/a&gt; as a “key national security concern.” The open-source security summit was called shortly after as a direct response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ocRxY6"&gt;In May 2021, well before the Log4j vulnerability was discovered, President Biden issued an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/"&gt;executive order on improving the nation’s cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt;. Among other things, the order mandated that agencies of the federal government shore up their software supply chains by “ensuring and attesting, to the extent practicable, to the integrity and provenance of open source software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SD1FPb"&gt;Vulnerabilities in open-source software have led to some of the most serious security flaws in recent memory. The Heartbleed bug, discovered in 2014, affected an open-source encryption library called OpenSSL that was believed to be used in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/8/5594266/how-heartbleed-broke-the-internet"&gt;two out of three servers across the web&lt;/a&gt;. Despite its large-scale usage, the library was maintained largely by unpaid volunteers — &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-13/how-apache-raced-to-fix-a-potentially-disastrous-software-flaw"&gt;as was the case with Log4j&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M0sBXX"&gt;Open-source software that is critical to the functioning of highly profitable tech companies may still struggle to attract funding, a fact that is likely to be discussed at today’s summit. Just days ago the issue was brought to the fore again when an open-source developer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/9/22874949/developer-corrupts-open-source-libraries-projects-affected"&gt;intentionally corrupted two JavaScript libraries&lt;/a&gt;, potentially affecting thousands of projects. Reporting by &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt; uncovered previous posts in which the developer lamented “support[ing] Fortune 500s...with my free work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZrvv4"&gt;Writing &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2022-01-13-open-source-software-security-summit-securing-the-worlds-code-together/"&gt;on Github’s company blog&lt;/a&gt; Thursday morning, chief security officer Mike Hanley described a landscape in which open software was widely used but still poorly supported in terms of resources made available to developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avRdC6"&gt;“First, there must be a collective industry and community effort to secure the software supply chain,” Hanley wrote. “Second, we need to better support open source maintainers to make it easier for them to secure their projects.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Neurotech company will use Magic Leap 2 for dizziness</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hp7BqgxEAOEEYXaHKiKOAQNap0M=/59x0:692x422/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382964/magic_leap_2_image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Magic Leap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BotmcB"&gt;Magic Leap &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22880090/magic-leap-2-ar-headset-rollout-healthcare-companies"&gt;announced Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that it was giving four healthcare partners early access to its next-gen augmented reality headset, including neurotechnology company SyncThink. With the new partnership, the company is interested in targeting vestibular disorders, which cause dizziness, SyncThink chief clinical officer Scott Anderson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4RpWb"&gt;SyncThink has been collaborating with Magic Leap for a few years, Anderson says. Now, it’s expanding that relationship to bring Magic Leap 2 into the neurological health space and collaborate on clinical studies, he says. SyncThink already has FDA clearance for an eye-tracking VR device that helps &lt;a href="https://syncthink.com/2021/10/05/syncthink-receives-second-fda-clearance-for-eye-sync-platform-the-first-mobile-rapid-test-for-concussion/"&gt;diagnose concussions&lt;/a&gt;. Changes in eye movements are also linked to vestibular disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koXF6Y"&gt;The upgrades to the camera and sensors in the Magic Leap 2 headset let SyncThink flag abnormal eye movements that could cause or worsen dizziness, Anderson says. “We need high fidelity cameras and sensors that can track at a medical-grade level, not a consumer-grade level,” he says. That affects the accuracy of the tools SyncThink is able to build. The company is initially working on tools that could diagnose vestibular conditions, but Anderson says he thinks they could eventually develop VR-based treatments for those disorders, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSANGK"&gt;Digital tools that treat diseases are becoming &lt;a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/06/15/digital-therapeutics-use-coverage-polling/"&gt;more common&lt;/a&gt;, and the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated their adoption. Early in the pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) &lt;a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/digital-therapeutics-eye-opportunity-as-pandemic-prompts-fda-to-ease-rules/576628/"&gt;relaxed&lt;/a&gt; some guidelines, which gave patients more access to products under development. Magic Leap’s announcement and its new relationships with healthcare companies come on the heels of first-of-their-kind FDA authorizations for VR-based therapeutics this fall: one to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736894/fda-vr-tv-movies-treatment-lazy-eye-amblyopia"&gt;treat lazy eye&lt;/a&gt; in children and a second for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785609/vr-chronic-pain-fda"&gt;chronic pain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cExLFZ"&gt;More and more virtual and augmented reality companies like Magic Leap are moving toward healthcare as part of that digital health trend, Anderson says. And that’s made it easier for companies like SyncThink to find the hardware they need to develop new tools. Over the past five or so years, many VR equipment manufacturers have started to move away from gaming and esports and toward industries like healthcare or the military (which Magic Leap says it’s also interested in). The companies interested in healthcare have started paying attention to the types of features important for medical applications and incorporating those features into their devices, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6S1R40"&gt;“Even going back five years, we were having to go buy off-the-shelf VR devices and send them to Germany and have infrared sensors put in,” Anderson says. “Now, everyone is learning really quickly the importance of specific types of features that appeal to sectors like healthcare.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max monthly plans are 20 percent off for a limited time</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the ad-free and ad-supported HBO Max plans are currently on sale.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ga2vY3"&gt;Whether it’s exclusives like the new Harry Potter reunion special, &lt;em&gt;Return to Hogwarts&lt;/em&gt;, or access to new films like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22841582/matrix-resurrections-lana-wachowski-keanu-reeves-carrie-anne-moss-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; an HBO Max subscription means you can watch some of today’s most popular titles from the comfort and safety of your home. Unfortunately, we rarely see deals on the popular streaming service — that is, until today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgsyvQ"&gt;Right now, HBO Max is offering 20 percent off both its ad-supported and ad-free monthly subscription plans, which throughout 2021 gave subscribers limited-time access to movies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22737214/dune-review-hbo-max-denis-villeneuve-timothee-chalamet-sandworm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the same day they hit theaters. And while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850666/hbo-max-2022-trailer-westworld-game-of-thrones"&gt;Warner Bros. has stated&lt;/a&gt; it doesn’t intend to keep simultaneously releasing movies in theaters and on HBO Max this year, &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-max-reveals-new-campaign-spot-highlighting-upcoming-originals-warner-bros"&gt;it will release six exclusives&lt;/a&gt; on HBO Max that won’t make it to theaters, including &lt;em&gt;House Party&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Father of the Bride&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kimi&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Fallout&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Scoob: Holiday Haunt&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Moonshot. &lt;/em&gt;The subscription also gives you access to HBO Max exclusives and original shows like &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Euphoria&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Doom Patrol&lt;/em&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUyunM"&gt;Now until January 25th at 11:59PM PT, HBO Max is dropping the price of its &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeBestHBOMax2021&amp;amp;aff_unique1=https://www.hbomax.com/subscribe/plan-picker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad-free subscription plan from $14.99 a month to $11.99 a month&lt;/a&gt;. That equates to about $36 in savings over the span of one year, which is like getting two months of the ad-free plan for free. Alternatively, you can &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeBestHBOMax2021&amp;amp;aff_unique1=https://www.hbomax.com/subscribe/plan-picker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;opt into the $9.99-a-month, ad-supported tier for $7.99 a month&lt;/a&gt;, saving yourself about $24. The promotion is available to both new and lapsed subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DCpUdr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10932723"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="1G6Yd9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"HBO Max 2022 trailer offers a peek at Westworld and its new Game of Thrones spinoff","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850666/hbo-max-2022-trailer-westworld-game-of-thrones"},{"title":"11 great shows and movies from 2021 to stream on HBO Max","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22819936/hbo-max-best-shows-movies-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="keCIRc"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22860324/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;making its debut at CES 2022&lt;/a&gt; just last week, deals on Samsung’s new Galaxy S21 Fan Edition (FE) smartphone are already here. If you’d like a lower-cost, full-featured alternative to Samsung’s more expensive Galaxy S21, the new phone is worth a look, especially given you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Smartphone-Intelligent-Lavender/dp/B09PMRDM9Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get a $100 Amazon gift card&lt;/a&gt; right now when you &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Smartphone-Intelligent-Lavender/dp/B09PMRDM9Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;purchase the unlocked, 128GB configuration from Amazon for $699.99,&lt;/a&gt; its typical retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBObe6"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22860324/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;Allison Johnson noted in her first impressions of the phone&lt;/a&gt;, this edition shares many features with the more expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt;. This includes a 1080p OLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate, a Snapdragon 888 chipset, 5G support, 25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, and an IP68 weather-resistance rating. The Galaxy S21 offers a higher-res telephoto camera and more RAM, though interestingly, the S21 FE boasts a greater battery capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVwudQ"&gt;Of course, if you’d prefer the latest (and maybe greatest?), it might be worth waiting for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870027/samsung-s22-series-unofficial-dummy-leak-design-camera-specs"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S22&lt;/a&gt;, which should arrive sometime this year. Samsung typically launches new lineups in February; however, given ongoing supply chain issues and the global chip shortage, it’s unclear if that will happen. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22644338"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8qN5gA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10974491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5bgazm"&gt;For those of you with a Nintendo Switch Online membership, &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-entertainment-system-controllers.html"&gt;you can currently pick up the $59.99 Nintendo Entertainment System Controllers for just $34.99&lt;/a&gt; — one of their lowest prices ever — from Nintendo. This deal lasts through 11:59PM PT on February 2nd, and the price includes two wireless controllers, which work with all Nintendo Switch models but require a standard Switch console or the OLED edition in order to charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XH5Kgr"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/12/13/18139299/nintendo-switch-online-nes-controller-review"&gt;noted in our review&lt;/a&gt;, these are wireless recreations of the original NES gamepad that work perfectly with classic Switch Online NES games. In fact, they work so well, we believe they’re the best way to access classic Nintendo titles. However, given they only offer two face buttons, they don’t work well with other modern games. Thus, if you require more flexible gamepads with extra buttons that work with multiple platforms, this controller may not be the best pick. Otherwise, this deal is a great one, definitely worth taking a look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JwY3pE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PSA: you can now buy a Nintendo Switch OLED or an Xbox Series S without the hassle","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22848923/nintendo-switch-oled-model-console-microsoft-xbox-series-s-in-stock-stores-amazon-best-buy-walmart"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="WwygNl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10470259"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="blAZLe"&gt;The Super Bowl season is nearly upon us, and already we’re starting to see some great TV deals trickling in. For those looking for a smaller 4K TV, the 43-inch configuration of the new Omni Fire TV is available at a new all-time low at Amazon. Typically $409.99, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6DZ81T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the retailer is selling it right now for $284.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is $15 less than what we saw it go for on Black Friday. The 4K TV works with Alexa, boasts a low input lag and support for two-way video calling, and offers access to major streaming services like Netflix without extra hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SYGDG"&gt;Other configurations are on sale for up to $200 off, too, so fans of larger TVs can also save on Amazon. However, it’s important to note only the 65-inch and 75-inch models include support for Dolby Vision HDR. If that’s a feature you’d like, or you’d just prefer a larger TV, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6J1HG8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch is also available for $599.99 instead of $829.99&lt;/a&gt;, just $1 shy of its lowest price to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SZCxjT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on 4K TVs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="npDpgX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10974342"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VeCscB"&gt;One of the smallest smart displays on the market, Lenovo’s new Smart Clock 2 incorporates a touchscreen display with a form factor that’s ideally suited for your bedside table. At the same time, it also offers full Google Assistant capabilities. What we particularly liked, however, is the separate wireless charging dock, which provides up to 10 watts of power, a USB Type-A port for your peripherals, and a built-in night light. Normally $89.99, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgo8plWliEV" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling&lt;/a&gt; both the smart clock and its wireless charging dock for just $69.99, the typical retail price for the smart clock &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; the wireless dock. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22714538/lenovo-smart-clock-2-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c2sx0o"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10974433"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eaaJf9"&gt;You can save even more today with these great deals:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="nloyEi"&gt;You can save $50 today on the new Samsung 980 Pro 1TB SSD, which comes with a built-in heatsink. Regularly $249.99, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JHL33X7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling it for $199.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is just $9 more than its best price ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nv6byv"&gt;Whether you’re a streamer or you’re simply looking for a webcam that’s better than your laptop’s for Zoom calls, Razer’s Kiyo is a solid pick. Right now, the webcam — which features a built-in ring light and supports 1080p resolution at 30 frames per second or 720p resolution at 60 frames per second — is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075N1BYWB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling for $61.23 (nearly $40 off) at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, its second-best price to date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0U8EQW"&gt;If you’re into tabletop gaming, the digital version of &lt;em&gt;Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics &lt;/em&gt;for the Nintendo Switch is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086Z9D3TD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $27.99&lt;/a&gt;, almost matching its best price to date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Hvf91u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PWC32ZD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This 60W Anker USB-C charger&lt;/a&gt; comes with both a USB-C PowerIQ 3.0 port and a USB-A port equipped with PowerIQ 2.0. Right now, it’s on sale at Amazon for $26.34 instead of $39.99, nearly half off the typical list price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="gq6NgA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="urvXAC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The pandemic has blurred the lines between laptop categories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HP Eite Dragonfly G3 seen from above on a marble table. The screen displays a multicolor background. To the left is an open notebook with a pen on top. To the right are two cups and a phone." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QBK17J6NJKv8-s3LQ5egUMR9174=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382869/3.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Elite Dragonfly G3 is one of thebiggest laptop releases from CES, bringing more consumer-friendly features to a traditional business laptop.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YkLAWJ"&gt;HP had one of the most expansive laptop launches of this year’s CES. The headliners included two &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866703/hp-elite-dragonfly-g3-chromebook-enterprise-laptops"&gt;Elite Dragonfly models&lt;/a&gt;, a whole &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865588/hp-elitebook-805-g9-amd-ryzen-6000-605-work-laptops"&gt;gaggle of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865447/hp-intel-commercial-laptop-intel-alder-lake"&gt;Windows 11 Elitebooks&lt;/a&gt;, and a dump of &lt;a href="https://press.hp.com/us/en/press-releases/2022/hp-ces-2022-gaming-experiences.html"&gt;gaming laptpos and desktops&lt;/a&gt; (as well as accessories). We saw the usual spec upgrades: better chips, smaller bezels, better battery life, bigger touchpads, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeOdQM"&gt;But a few newer themes ran through HP’s releases and through those of many other major laptop manufacturers as well. Less obtrusive, chic-er looks. Heavier duty chips in chassis that are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22862528/lenovos-thinkpad-z-series-z13-z16-business-laptop"&gt;thinner, lighter,&lt;/a&gt; and easier to take from place to place. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868089/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-nano-yoga-laptops-ces-2022"&gt;AI features&lt;/a&gt; meant to prevent snooping in public places. Better conferencing technology — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22864968/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-g15-gaming-laptop-2022-webcam-amd-16-10-aspect-ratio-specs-features"&gt;lines that have resisted adding webcams for years&lt;/a&gt; finally have them. These aren’t changes limited to the business sphere. We’re seeing these trends in consumer lines, gaming lines, workstation lines, and even Chromebooks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruc53a"&gt;It’s clear what these companies’ market research is showing: people want to work on the move more than ever before, and their definition of “work” is expanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nx3eDp"&gt;That’s certainly what HP has found. “People are working differently,” Alex Cho, HP’s president of personal systems, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “People are going to create even more. They’re going to be getting entertained and playing differently. They’re going to connect with other people differently.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A worker uses the HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook in a cafe setting." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KReHQP0c34v83OiirzcgdKLwtao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144523/2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, a device that was previously unthinkable in the business sphere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ks8vpy"&gt;It’s hardly a no-brainer that remote work has exploded around the world since early 2020. But there’s certainly been some question as to whether that explosion would lead to temporary trends or longer-term changes to the laptop sphere. Per this CES, it appears that the market has spoken: consumers expect that conferencing and on-the-go work are here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiCdoQ"&gt;HP has found that “75 percent of people are now saying they want to set up their permanent home office,” Cho says. Meanwhile, “80 percent of conferencing rooms in the office are being upgraded, because you’re recognizing that ‘I will now be working from home on a permanent basis, and when I go back into the office, I need that office to be far more around collaboration.’” Cho added that 75 percent of people have admitted to judging others based on their appearance on video calls, per HP’s findings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svvamL"&gt;The new demands extend beyond webcam quality. COVID-19 has driven swaths of people in some countries (the US included) from full-time jobs to freelance work. This means the demand for devices that can serve both as workstations and personal drivers — workstation power in a small, attractive chassis — is higher than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCYWI4"&gt;“We’re seeing that a lot of people are having more personal gigs,” says Cho. “They’re creating a lot more on their devices. They’re doing a lot of custom work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpPckT"&gt;While many of the biggest “creator” laptops of the past few years have looked more like a gaming laptop than an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;, last year saw a few creation-oriented ultraportables (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22445605/acer-swift-3x-review-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Acer’s Swift 3X&lt;/a&gt;, for example) that tried to bridge the gap. Expect to see more of those in 2022; Cho hinted that HP is prioritizing better screen technology this year to target that market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="14HBn5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People are having more personal gigs.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FfA7Lm"&gt;Gaming is also a rapidly growing segment, which the pandemic has accelerated. “It’s not just a lot of people, but there’s new segments,” Cho says. HP has found that 60 percent of new gamers, for example, are female. But gaming, for many of these new users, is more of a social affair than it has been in the past — the isolation that COVID-19 imposed upon many people has made some turn to gaming as a source of virtual interaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qFZvr"&gt;“Gamers game because they want to connect,” says Cho. “People are going online ... at set times — ‘Hey, why don’t we all get on at 8PM?’ We see that in multiple age demographics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Es93I"&gt;Not only does that mean more people want laptops that can game; it also means gamers are looking for better keyboards, webcams, and other peripherals that have previously been more of a focus in the consumer laptop sphere. There’s more demand for gaming laptops that can also work, and personal laptops that can also game. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 Plus is another heavy-hitting consumer model that’s undergone bold changes to target a wider audience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With the ThinkPad Z-Series, Lenovo is trying to push the ThinkPad line to a hybrid-focused audience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4QlsrQ"&gt;Much marketing for personal technology (laptops included) makes reference to a “hybrid world,” an “era of remote work,” and the like. Those terms are being used to describe an American workforce that consists of, by recent estimates, &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/355907/remote-work-persisting-trending-permanent.aspx"&gt;less than 50 percent&lt;/a&gt; remote or hybrid workers. While many people have permanently altered their lifestyles and are upgrading their home offices, there’s still a large segment that needs (or wants) to work in person. Do companies like HP expect to split their products between those segments or focus on products that accommodate both? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYP3XB"&gt;Cho didn’t directly answer that question. “There are needs that are converging because you want some consistent type of experience, but there are distinct needs in each of the spaces for which we’re continuing to innovate,” he said. Noted. But the broader point — that the needs of the business, consumer, gaming, and creative laptop spaces are converging and will likely lead to more laptops that bridge those categories — is well taken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQLhFF"&gt;That comes with all sorts of questions. For one: laptops in the business, gaming, and workstation sphere are traditionally much more expensive than consumer laptops of similar quality. There’s certainly a question of whether the needs of these customers’ encroaching on the consumer sphere could make the category as a whole less accessible. (HP’s Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, for example, positioned as one of these work-and-play devices, is expected to start at $999, which is not at all cheap for a Chromebook.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rduiIl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865547/dell-xps-13-plus-2022-hands-on-new-design-features"&gt;Multiple established lines&lt;/a&gt; have also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22862528/lenovos-thinkpad-z-series-z13-z16-business-laptop"&gt;made significant compromises&lt;/a&gt; to keyboard and touchpad quality this year in the name of thinness and portability — compromises that have been, at least in part, positioned for the benefit of work-on-the-go use cases. That may be a sacrifice the new generation of workers is willing to make, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/27/21270299/apple-butterfly-keyboard-hardware-design-macbook-pro-physical-key-button"&gt;MacBooks of the last decade&lt;/a&gt; certainly beg to differ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="US0D7a"&gt;And then there’s the problem of security — using the same laptop for work that you use for freelance gigs, gaming, or the like, is something IT departments have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22671697/personal-laptop-work-security-privacy"&gt;begging people not to do&lt;/a&gt; since the dawn of time. It has the potential to compromise your privacy (IT can see everything you’re doing on there, after all) and your company’s information (what if you accidentally copy and paste the wrong thing?). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xe9nW0"&gt;These are likely bridges we’ll be crossing further down the line — laptop production is often a multiyear cycle, and while some features can be added or tweaked on the fly, it may take some time for the market to see any drastic reimagining of a laptop’s role in the workplace. But within the next five years, Cho hopes that the ideal laptop will be one that “easily transitions”. It will recognize “that you use that device to work, but you’re not just working — you’re checking an email, you’re shopping.” That certainly appears to be the case for many people. I just hope that’s a feature of today’s market, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NxJUM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leica’s new M11 gains some resolution and sheds some weight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ULs55wXs6eXO_3h3uEokqMpxdNQ=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382823/Leica_M11_Ambient_03_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leica M11 in black&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Leica&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SKCnQb"&gt;Leica has introduced the latest generation of its venerated M rangefinder camera, the new M11. The M11 is very similar in appearance to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/17/14592306/leica-m10-digital-camera-review-photography"&gt;M10 line it’s replacing&lt;/a&gt;, with much of the claimed 40 new improvements found on the inside. Leica says the M11 will be available starting today, January 13th, 2022, with a price tag of $8,995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JouvEO"&gt;The most significant upgrade is a new, 60-megapixel backside-illuminated full-frame CMOS sensor that captures 14 stops of dynamic range at its full resolution. Uniquely, the M11 also allows photographers to capture RAW files at 36 or 18 megapixels, which unlocks another stop of dynamic range, provides better low light performance, and allows for longer burst shooting at the expense of zoomed-in detail. (The company says it is using pixel binning alongside a newly developed algorithm to create the lower resolutions, a similar technique used by many smartphone cameras.) File sizes range from 70 to 120MB for a 60-megapixel DNG RAW file; the 18-megapixel setting can reduce that down to as low as 20MB per image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4O3XW"&gt;Along with the new sensor, Leica is using a new, ultra-thin UV filter on top of it, which the company claims provides more natural color reproduction. The company says the M11 captures the highest dynamic range of any digital M ever, including the black-and-white Monochrom models that were praised for their ability to capture a wide range of tones. The M11’s ISO range starts at 64 and goes up to 50,000.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ftyncpqz9yHWeCJDUFaRPUc5A5w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23164831/Leica_M11_HF_Ambient22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Leica&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The silver M11 maintains the classic brass top plate (and its heavier weight).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mowh5o"&gt;On the outside, the main difference between the M11 and its predecessors is the lack of Leica’s signature bottom plate, which had to be removed to load film or swap memory cards and batteries on the old cameras. The M11 instead adopts the slick cartridge-style battery system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18253745/leica-q2-camera-announcement-price-features-specs"&gt;from the Q2&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s much faster to swap batteries or memory cards as a result. Leica says the new battery is 64 percent larger than the M10’s and can last for up to 700 shots using live view on the rear display or 1,700 shots when using the rangefinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J8SydJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The black M11 is 20 percent lighter than the silver model thanks to its more aluminum construction&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cnBRP7"&gt;Alongside the new battery slot is a USB-C port that can be used for data transfer (either to a computer or to a phone — the M11 is actually Made For iPhone (MFi) certified for connecting to iOS and iPadOS devices) or charging. 64GB of storage is built into the camera, and you can choose to save images to it or an SD card in a variety of configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KViGIt"&gt;Perhaps the most noticeable difference when using the M11 is how much lighter it is. Leica swapped the brass top plate for an aluminum one on the black model (the silver model retains the brass plate) and cut 20 percent or about 100 grams off its weight. It’s immediately noticeable and makes the black M11 easier to carry around and maneuver than prior M cameras, which were always heavier than most people would expect. Fortunately, Leica’s signature build quality is still here, and the M11 doesn’t feel any less durable than prior models. It likely won’t gain the same &lt;a href="https://www.japancamerahunter.com/tag/brassed-leica/"&gt;brassing or patina as the older models&lt;/a&gt; as it ages, however.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zT10Ry34Q9tHvviipnAyFhSnVME=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23164834/Leica_M11_black_bottom_LoRes_RGB.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Leica&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lack of a bottom plate provides direct access to the M11’s new battery, plus a new USB-C port for connectivity and charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mFGtfZ"&gt;Despite the lighter weight, the M11 will feel immediately familiar to existing M-system photographers, and its overall shooting experience remains the same. Though the sensor is higher resolution, the processor inside is faster, and it has a couple of new tricks, such as the ability to use multi-field metering even when shooting with the rangefinder, the M11 is still a fully manual camera built for still photography. It does not shoot video of any sort, its burst rate caps out at 4.5 frames per second, and it requires manually focusing and exposing every shot, which makes it less than ideal for a lot of photography disciplines, such as sports (or keeping up with a fast-moving toddler). But those qualities are exactly the reason many Leica owners are willing to pay so much money to have one of these cameras, and it’s smart of Leica to not mess with the experience too much.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/59rL9WEx4kjvHYbpe6HKD9QgH9w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23164839/Leica_M11_HF_Ambient11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Leica&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M11 can connect directly to an iPhone and transfer images to it using Leica’s latest Fotos app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="irEOUN"&gt;The M11 is the first in the new line of M-series cameras, and though the company is only announcing the one model today, it’ll likely be followed up with other variants in the future. If you are interested in picking one up and have the padding in your bank account to afford it, it is available for purchase through authorized Leica dealers starting today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to keep your Zoom meetings safe and secure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KjWD9mMwYCuSifqRf5QaM4RQnZ8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382752/VRG_ILL_4947_Zoom_secure_call.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Samar Haddad / Photo by Becca Farsace&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AkqYwl"&gt;Back in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, people who wanted to get together while staying safe from infection discovered that they could meet with friends, families, and co-workers via videoconferencing software. Maybe because many of them were already using Zoom at work for videoconferencing, that app almost immediately became the flavor of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EL3buM"&gt;There were a few hiccups along the way — possibly because Zoom was meant to be primarily a business app. At first, while Zoom included some methods that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21197090/zoombombing-zoom-stop-how-to-porn-trolls-video-chat-screen-sharing"&gt;could be used to safeguard meetings&lt;/a&gt;, those features could be hard to find, especially if you hadn’t used the app before. Meetings began to be interrupted by unwanted intruders who would purposely cause disruptions, often in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221421/white-supremacist-zoombombers-target-jewish-community-zoom"&gt;extremely nasty ways&lt;/a&gt; (a problem that was soon named “Zoombombing”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3HLii3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best free apps for video calling","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21286781/best-video-call-apps-free"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DGsXuc"&gt;Not surprisingly, this led to a considerable backlash, much of it concerning &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202584/zoom-security-privacy-issues-video-conferencing-software-coronavirus-demand-response"&gt;the lack of security for users&lt;/a&gt;. In response, the company put additional safety measures in place. For example, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21207643/zoom-security-privacy-zoombombing-passwords-waiting-rooms-default"&gt;automatically enabled virtual waiting rooms and passwords&lt;/a&gt; for accounts in its free and lowest-paid tiers, and encouraged people to use unique meeting IDs rather than their permanently assigned personal IDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2dcKjI"&gt;Having to deal with passwords and virtual waiting rooms may make for a slightly less friendly interface, but it also means it’s less likely somebody you don’t know will pop into your family get-together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I1OmAZ"&gt;Although there are a number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286781/best-video-call-apps-free"&gt;alternative videoconferencing services&lt;/a&gt; available, Zoom is still a popular choice. So if you’re using the free version of Zoom, here are some ways to keep your meetings secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rIW2HG"&gt;Use a unique meeting ID and password&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KWAUCG"&gt;Zoom automatically adds passwords to accounts, and those passwords can be embedded in the meeting links. For example, if you schedule a meeting, you’ll see that the link contains your meeting ID and, right after that, the password for the meeting. Anyone you send that link to will be able to immediately gain access to your meeting without having to separately post a password — and if they decide to post that link publicly, it will negate any security the password might have provided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hX9HTM"&gt;So while everyone who uses Zoom has a personal meeting ID, using that ID for all your meetings means more and more people will know that ID, and that increases the chances someone unwelcome may find their way in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otCFRR"&gt;For this reason, when you schedule a meeting, Zoom now assumes you want to use an automatically generated unique meeting ID rather than your personal meeting ID. In fact, there are few reasons to use that personal ID — even if you have a regularly scheduled conference with friends, you can simply send out a new invitation (with a new meeting ID) for each meeting, just to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xVq1rQ"&gt;If you haven’t yet created a meeting, this is the process that you will probably follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="7cMcbG"&gt;If you’re using the Zoom app, click on the “Schedule” button. If you’re using the web interface, click on “Schedule a meeting” on the top line. In either case, the “Schedule Meeting” window will appear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="x1eMaI"&gt;If you wish, you can enter a meeting topic and description. Put in the date, time, and duration of your meeting. (If you’re on the free plan and there will be more than two people in your meeting, you’re limited to 40 minutes.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="V5nAx5"&gt;Look for “Meeting ID,” and make sure that “Generate Automatically” is selected. This will generate a unique ID for that meeting rather than use your personal meeting ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aoZlWo"&gt;Under the Security heading, you will be assigned a passcode; you can change it if you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O3eUfyPT6qNu5nUSJDV7Dre_3mE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23148281/Screen_Shot_2022_01_05_at_5.17.12_PM__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CrOGBE"&gt;Below that, it’s strongly recommended that you enable “Waiting Room,” so that you can approve anyone who wants to enter the meeting space. (We’ll discuss it more in a moment.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pAtViS"&gt;Click on “Advanced Options” if you want to allow participants to join without having to use the waiting room (not recommended), mute them upon entry, automatically record the meeting, or approve or block entries from specific geographic areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ew3d0M"&gt;Click on “Save.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="19bI73"&gt;You will most likely be brought to a page where you will see all of the options for that meeting. Halfway down, you can click “Copy the invitation” to easily save the info so you can send it to your participants. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4tl9zg"&gt;And that’s it. When you’re ready, you can click on the blue “Start this Meeting” button or use the generated meeting link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lkEGuT"&gt;Use the virtual waiting room&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PsoudW"&gt;As mentioned before, you can approve anyone who wants to join a meeting by using a virtual waiting room, from which you can then either let them in — or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSaKvt"&gt;When each participant clicks on their link, they will be asked to wait, while you will get a notification at the top of your screen telling you someone has entered the waiting room. You can either immediately admit them or click on “View.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1UT0Q"&gt;A sidebar will then show you everyone who is waiting to enter the meeting; you can then either admit them, remove them from the waiting room (and from any chance to enter the meeting), or send them a message.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FfXMBpEbU3-u70Hss3ZPTsaoDsc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23150753/Screen_Shot_2022_01_06_at_3.00.11_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use the waiting room to make sure of your participants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qlhaCl"&gt;Having to approve everyone who wants to join might be a pain to deal with, especially if you’re expecting a lot of people, but it will ensure that anyone who shows up in your meeting actually belongs there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NyU9G1"&gt;Lock down, don’t share, kick ’em out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kWtJG6"&gt;There are other Zoom security features you can use to protect yourself and other participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bk4zE8"&gt;If you know exactly who belongs in your meeting, and they’re all there, you can lock down the meeting by clicking on the “Security” link at the bottom of the screen and choosing “Lock Meeting.” Once you do that, even somebody who has the meeting ID and password cannot get in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8CLYN"&gt;Using the same menu, it could also be a good idea, especially if you’re holding a meeting with a lot of people, to uncheck the “Share Screen” selection. If by bad luck somebody who means to disrupt the meeting is allowed to share their screen, they can make things extremely uncomfortable for the rest of the participants. (If at some point, a participant has a legitimate need to share their screen, you can re-enable sharing at any time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmfgyH"&gt;If a participant does start to misbehave but you don’t necessarily want to kick them out (or you want to discuss what you’re going to get them for their birthday), you can put them back in the waiting room. Click on the “Participants” icon at the bottom of your screen, find the name of the participant on the resulting side panel, hover over their name, and then click on “More” &amp;gt; “Put in waiting room.” The participant will no longer have access to the meeting; in effect, they will be back in the waiting room until you decide to let them return.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Security icon leads to several ways you can handle a problem participant." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dUuSX_efrVC4G5rWzbTLmjAAeZ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23150534/Screen_Shot_2022_01_06_at_3.07.16_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Security icon leads to several ways you can handle a problem participant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="46VB0c"&gt;Of course, you can kick somebody out of the meeting entirely by using that same drop-down menu and clicking on “Remove.” If that becomes necessary, by the way, it might be a good idea to then lock the meeting so they can’t try to get back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JB5eMU"&gt;If things get really out of hand, click on the Security icon and select “Suspend Participant Activities.” &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/new-ways-to-combat-zoom-meeting-disruptions/"&gt;According to Zoom&lt;/a&gt;, this will stop “all video, audio, in-meeting chat, annotation, screen sharing, and recording during that time” and as host, you’ll be asked if you want to report any particular user. You will also be able to supply details of the problem, along with screenshots. That person will be removed from the meeting (and reported to Zoom’s “Trust and Safety” team), and you can then re-enable your various features and continue your meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q44dLV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 13th, 2022, 9AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on April 17th, 2020, and has been updated to reflect changes in Zoom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
