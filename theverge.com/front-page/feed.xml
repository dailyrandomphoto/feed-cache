    <title>How to score a COVID-19 vaccine appointment </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_u2r1v0qpkmDCofvfzLEcU6WDG4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68809161/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DzZXIa"&gt;One of the most frustrating tasks for many of us these days is finding how and where to get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. It can be a real exercise in exasperation: the websites are often difficult to navigate and prone to frequent crashes; in addition, after finding an open appointment slot and filling out multiple pages of questions, you are often told that the opening has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vp4Bt"&gt;In view of all this, we’ve tried to gather as much helpful information as we can about ways to research and snag vaccination appointments for yourself and others. We’ll update this as more information presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JYv8ZW"&gt;Research the vaccination qualifications in your state&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jJJ2mU"&gt;To begin with, it’s a good idea to try to pin down if you or the person you are assisting is currently qualified for the COVID-19 vaccine. Find the vaccine information site (or sites) that is being run by your state and / or city. This will also help you figure out when you might be qualified if you aren’t already. If you can’t find it via a quick search, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/plan-your-vaccine/"&gt;NBC News has created a simple website&lt;/a&gt; that lets you find out what the current situation is in your specific state. &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/covid-19/where-to-get-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;Prescription company GoodRx&lt;/a&gt; offers similar information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="N5dWHX"&gt;Find all the places that might offer appointments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XK1Cc0"&gt;There are, fortunately or unfortunately, many different sites where you can go to find out if you can get an appointment to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgvDmn"&gt;For example, here in New York City, we’ve had to navigate separate sites run by the city and the state. Various hospital systems also have their own sites, as do pharmacies such as Walgreens and CVS, which have recently begun offering appointments for vaccinations. It’s a lot to check — and it can be enormously confusing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usTdFX"&gt;As a result, your first step is probably to check your state’s government health website (searching your state name and “COVID vaccine” will probably do it). If you’re an urban dweller, check for your city’s information site as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8ot2F"&gt;While most personal physicians do not have access to vaccines, your doctor may be able to tell you some of the places to check. Other resources include your local hospital system, your union (especially if your employment qualifies you for a vaccination), and, of course, friends and colleagues, many of whom have probably been doing their own searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZ6Bfn"&gt;As you find resources and sites, make sure to bookmark them. I keep a folder on my bookmarks bar called “COVID” — you may want to name yours something more cheerful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lP4_R3np2CX9crqTcg9Mq6I2Js=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13963741/IMG_1653.1419968302.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6uguNM"&gt;Have all your information ready&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1Dt0LZ"&gt;Many of us who have tried to register for vaccination appointments have gone through the experience of filling out several screens of information only to find that, by the time we got to the end, the appointment was gone. So it’s a good idea to have all your data — such as your name, age, address, insurance info, and the registration ID / password for the site — immediately at hand. The faster you can go through the registration process, the more likely you are to actually get an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRD8jU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleague Cory Zapatka says that he highly recommends using a password manager if you have one. He created accounts with all the vaccination sites in his area, even if they didn’t have appointments available at the time, so that if / when the time came, he could just auto-fill and get in right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9bBlc"&gt;And if you do get an appointment, make sure you have the appropriate paperwork already handy — especially since available appointments can be last minute. Necessary paperwork could include proof of employment, proof of age, or proof of a qualifying condition. Since the last one may require a doctor’s note or other record, it’s a good idea to call your doctor now — or if you’ve got access to a doctor’s or hospital website, that may offer you access to the proof you need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dqUcf"&gt;One more thing: check to see if you’ve gotten all the email that has been sent to you by your vaccine supplier. At least one staff member of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; found a necessary consent form hiding in her spam folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wCK4vB"&gt;Watch for news of upcoming vaccination sites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bDlWg4"&gt;Keep an eye on the news. More and more sites and hubs are being added as the US gears up for a stronger push. If you see a news item saying that a hub is about to open, find the site for the hub and keep checking — once it does open, the available slots will probably go quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz172X"&gt;One thing that sometimes helps is to look for patterns in the appearance of new appointments. For example, when I heard that the pharmacy chain Walgreens was going to begin giving out vaccines in my area, I spent a couple of days going onto the site, and suddenly realized that there was a pattern: the company was only scheduling appointments two to four days in advance and was adding new appointments each day just after midnight. Once I understood the pattern, I was able to get appointments for a couple of friends and let others know about it as well. (Note: since vaccine supplies and scheduling methods can change on a dime, this particular strategy may no longer work by the time you read this.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsRia6ki1VqiuNodQvjKHdK9-ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299690/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_8.47.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gz26d4"&gt;Look for help online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PgrwN8"&gt;There are a number of online resources popping up headed by developers and other technology-savvy folks who have taken the time and effort to try to make sense of this confusion. (Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/10/covid-vaccine-appointment-websites/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/nyregion/vaccine-website-appointment-nyc.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for some of these listings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bUR9PN"&gt;California&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="111Dwk"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/"&gt;VaccinateCA&lt;/a&gt; checks pharmacies and hospitals for information about open appointments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="h3AFk9"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WLYqtL"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.macovidvaccines.com/"&gt;MA Covid Vaccine Appointments site&lt;/a&gt; offers lists of and links to sites with available appointments. A volunteer-run site, &lt;a href="https://vaccinatema.com/"&gt;Vaccinate MA&lt;/a&gt;, tries to improve on the state website with a map-based design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BeZogz"&gt;Another site, &lt;a href="https://macovidvaxhelp.com/"&gt;Massachusetts COVID Vaccination Help&lt;/a&gt;, uses volunteers to help eligible state residents book an appointment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="c9OpvY"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZYJAS8"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vaccinatenj.com/"&gt;Vaccinate NJ&lt;/a&gt; also uses volunteers to try to help state residents find vaccine opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ijVYyv"&gt;New York&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Vhk2GI"&gt;An NYC site called &lt;a href="https://www.turbovax.info/"&gt;TurboVax&lt;/a&gt; pulls “the latest appointments from 45 city and state-run vaccine sites in the NYC area” and puts them on Twitter. Followers who set their Twitter notifications for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/turbovax"&gt;@turbovax&lt;/a&gt; can quickly find out about newly opened appointment slots. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c0AX5B"&gt;Another called &lt;a href="https://nycvaccinelist.com/"&gt;NYC Vaccine List&lt;/a&gt; uses a combination of scripts and checks by volunteers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22256167/covid-vaccine-website-nyc-appointment"&gt;scour various sites for openings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vRg75P"&gt;Texas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZJic26"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.covid19vaccinetx.com/"&gt;Covid 19 Vaccine TX&lt;/a&gt; is a crowdsourced resource for registering with local counties and finding locations where vaccines may be available.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NEM7f0"&gt;Washington&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="yR8waA"&gt;A volunteer group in the state of Washington has launched the &lt;a href="https://www.covidwa.com/"&gt;WA COVID Vaccine Finder&lt;/a&gt; as an aggregation resource for vaccination appointments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hFMYTz"&gt;General resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="C1YLfR"&gt;There are several sites that aggregate the aggregators: &lt;a href="https://wherecanigetavaccine.com/"&gt;Where Can I Get A Vaccine?&lt;/a&gt; offers a list of sites available for various US states. &lt;a href="https://covidshotfinder.com/"&gt;COVIDShotFinder&lt;/a&gt; lets you select a state or county and look for the various vaccine resources available. &lt;a href="https://www.findashot.org/"&gt;Find A Shot&lt;/a&gt; also shows you possible openings depending on your state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jTJTFG"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), together with the Boston Children’s Hospital and other medical institutions, operates &lt;a href="https://vaccinefinder.org/"&gt;VaccineFinder&lt;/a&gt;, which was created to promote flu and other general vaccinations but is now dedicated toward helping people find COVID vaccinations. Currently, VaccineFinder is only available for people in Alaska, Tennessee, Indiana, and Iowa, but according to the site, it should be adding more providers in other states over the coming weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jdCWU8"&gt;One possible strategy is to use page-change-monitoring tools such as &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/blog/how-to-be-alerted-of-covid-19-vaccine-availability-in-your-local-pharmacy/"&gt;Visualping&lt;/a&gt; to generate alerts for when new appointments become available. These apps watch websites for you and send alerts to your email, text, or even Slack account when new information appears. They can be very useful (and allow you to take time for, say, lunch). But since these are, for the most part, business apps, you may need to pay for the privilege. For example, while &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/pricing"&gt;Visualping does have a free service&lt;/a&gt;, it is limited to pinging you once an hour up to 65 times a month, which may not be often enough if you’re trying to score an appointment.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nhHjOx"&gt;If you’re a developer and / or coder who wants to help, check out &lt;a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/"&gt;US Digital Response&lt;/a&gt;, an independent organization which, according to its website, “connects experienced, pro-bono technologists with local government and non-profit organizations responding to crisis.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Reservation Of The Anticovid Vaccine For Over Eighty In Apulian Pharmacies" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4leCSmB_jTd6jhw7V_SvQQsfQ8Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299704/1231117569.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are able, it’s a good idea to reach out and help those who may not be able to get appointments on their own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8mSy40"&gt;If you can, help others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Kz9AlN"&gt;One of the worst things about the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines is that those who need it the most are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;often the least likely to be able to navigate the technology required to get an appointment&lt;/a&gt;: older people, differently abled people, or those who don’t have or can’t afford computers and / or internet connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2VOR9"&gt;If you have the time and talent, reach out to anyone you know who may not be able to get an appointment on their own. This could be as simple as finding phone numbers they can call to try to schedule an appointment, going online and getting an appointment for them, or helping them get to and from the vaccination site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Evm4o5"&gt;You could also see if there are any groups that are organizing help. &lt;a href="https://www.westsiderag.com/2021/01/19/need-help-signing-up-for-a-vaccine-a-young-tech-savvy-person-can-help-you"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The West Side Rag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, reports that a group of New Yorkers created the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO11RAr7tqHU6LJp_ZNMl5mRbxdg-zc1lO1SuVHBBDLTyJrg/closedform"&gt;Vaccine Appointment Assistance Team (VAAT)&lt;/a&gt; to help their non-technically-savvy neighbors navigate the process. (At the time this was written, VAAT had temporarily suspended their services.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rm5plO"&gt;Look for leftover vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M5v0nn"&gt;While the vaccines can last for six months while they’re kept frozen, once thawed and refrigerated, the Pfizer vaccine will last five days while the Moderna vaccine will last for 30 days. As a result, when people don’t show up for their appointments, some centers will &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22229169/leftover-vaccines-random-people-grocery-stores-pharmacies"&gt;offer vaccinations to those who may not immediately qualify&lt;/a&gt; rather than waste vaccines that would otherwise be rendered unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI3933"&gt;However, running to a nearby pharmacy or vaccine hub in the hit-and-miss hopes that there will be some shots waiting at the end of the day isn’t the most effective way to be vaccinated. (Besides, getting hypothermia while waiting in the cold isn’t going to help.) At least one group is trying to ameliorate the situation: a pilot project called &lt;a href="https://vaxstandby.com/"&gt;Vaccination Standby&lt;/a&gt; says that it will monitor providers around the US for word of extra doses and text notifications to those whose zip codes are near the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAc3tM"&gt;There are also local organizations that are offering standby lists. For example, Buncombe County in North Carolina has a &lt;a href="https://www.buncombecounty.org/countycenter/news-detail.aspx?id=19137"&gt;vaccination waitlist and standby list&lt;/a&gt;, as does the &lt;a href="https://www.co.monroe.in.us/egov/documents/1611179705_09719.pdf"&gt;Monroe County Health Department&lt;/a&gt; in Indiana. Check your local government site to see if there’s one in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fg3eNk"&gt;Be persistent!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JTTPvK"&gt;Yes, it’s frustrating as hell, but keep at it. If a website crashes, try again. If you’re dropped from a phone call, call again (and have a game, video, or book ready to keep yourself occupied while you’re on hold). If you can’t find anything during working hours, try late at night or very early in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBXxUO"&gt;Persistence may be one of the most important aspects of getting an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. You may be tempted to give up, especially after hitting the “no appointments available” wall time and time again. But until vaccine production is ramped up enough to cover more of our population, and until distribution becomes more organized and easier to manage, simple stubbornness may be your best tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwiVs8"&gt;And hopefully this article, and all the advice it contains, will soon be unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QdqaC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 12th, 11:10AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to include the WA Covid Vaccine Finder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bravely Default II is a classic RPG that feels a little too familiar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FTPl4cx0YeDOtNNH5QGZp45DBXo=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68872908/Switch_ND021721_BD2_SCRN_06_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u3Jdaz"&gt;When the first &lt;em&gt;Bravely Default&lt;/em&gt; launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/6/5383040/bravely-default-nintendo-3ds-review"&gt;in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, it represented a return of sorts. Developer Square Enix made its name with classic turn-based roleplaying games like &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;, but those eventually gave way to bigger, more cinematic experiences. With &lt;em&gt;Bravely Default&lt;/em&gt;, Square was going back to its roots. It may have technically been a new franchise, but the game was pure classic &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;-style adventuring. It even introduced a novel battle system to help it from retreading too much new ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qR0TC"&gt;So where does that leave a sequel? &lt;em&gt;Bravely Default II&lt;/em&gt; — technically the third game in the series, following 2016’s &lt;em&gt;Bravely Second: End Layer&lt;/em&gt; — does all of the same things that made the original so interesting. But seven years later, it doesn’t have quite the same impact. &lt;em&gt;Bravely Default II&lt;/em&gt; is solidly made, and the battle system is still a lot of fun to play around with. However, it also does very little to stand out — this isn’t a game you play for an engrossing story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYAmjS"&gt;First, let’s clear up the naming scheme. &lt;em&gt;Bravely Default II&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a direct sequel to the original game but instead a new story, with new characters, set in a new world. That’s why Square Enix started over with the title. (Think of it like &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;X-2&lt;/em&gt; was a direct sequel, while &lt;em&gt;XI&lt;/em&gt; was a brand-new experience.) If you haven’t played any games in the series before, the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; thing to know about the name is that, ridiculous as it sounds, “&lt;em&gt;Bravely Default&lt;/em&gt;” actually makes some kind of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UT3dSXOI4dpiGkIT8dal5ysMI4Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326762/Switch_ND021721_BD2_SCRN_05_copy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lK1Z4K"&gt;The turn-based battles are based around two unique commands called “brave” and “default.” It’s essentially a risk / reward system. Being brave means you can take multiple turns at once, but this also means you forfeit upcoming turns. Defaulting, meanwhile, lets you skip a move in order to stack up turns for future use. It’s a clever setup that adds a lot of strategy to battles, particularly bosses, as you have to make hard choices about when to go all-in and when to be patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="cye1Wc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10360139"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jqVFvX"&gt;The setup is buoyed by the job system, a long-running &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; feature that lets you customize your characters by fitting them into specific roles, like a white mage or monk. You unlock new abilities over time and can even mix and match jobs to create your ideal squad. It takes a lot of time, but I really enjoy experimenting with different combinations of jobs and abilities. The copious battles and grinding in classic RPGs can be a turn-off in some games, but in &lt;em&gt;Bravely Default II&lt;/em&gt;, I felt invested in virtually every encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MRm8R8"&gt;Enjoying those systems is key to liking this game — because otherwise, there’s not a lot here to dig into. Yes, &lt;em&gt;Bravely Default II&lt;/em&gt; technically takes place in a whole new world, but it’s &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; familiar, particularly if you’re a &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; fan. It’s really hard to say anything unique about it. You’re once again exploring a vast fantasy realm, searching for powerful crystals, while controlling the famous heroes of light. It’s not exactly memorable. And after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17561880/octopath-traveler-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Octopath Traveler&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was developed by some of the same team and featured an ambitious multi-character narrative, this blandness is particularly disappointing. At a certain point, I started skipping cutscenes that ran long.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IKBgwrw-6nPxqhSEvZbaBQxLHik=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326764/Switch_ND021721_BD2_SCRN_02_copy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S3LcTf"&gt;Really, what you’ll get out of &lt;em&gt;Bravely Default II&lt;/em&gt; depends on what you’re looking for. The combat is still among the most interesting that I’ve experienced, and the job system — which dates way back to &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy III&lt;/em&gt; — has yet to grow old. Tinkering with character builds and then unleashing them on monsters remains incredibly satisfying. If that’s what you’re into, this is the game. It’s especially nice playing on the Switch, which is ideally suited for this kind of game, as you can chip away at a dungeon while lying in bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oxGNp"&gt;The rest of the experience isn’t exactly bad, per se, it’s just… there. A bland fantasy realm with characters I can barely remember. In &lt;em&gt;Bravely Default II&lt;/em&gt;, the grind isn’t the combat — it’s listening to all of the dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNCxgS"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Bravely Default II &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches on the Nintendo Switch on February 26th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xbox Series X and S are available again at Target</title>

  &lt;p id="ikctbP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 25th, 2021 09:07AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameStop has run out of stock, but Target now has supply available for both the Xbox Series X and Series S. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQNYsH"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x-console%2F-%2FA-80790841&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-s-console%2F-%2FA-80790842&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Series S&lt;/a&gt; consoles have been available to purchase since last fall, but actually finding one to buy has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;extremely difficult&lt;/a&gt;. If you are looking to buy either console, Target has both models in stock, and they are available for preorder while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZpQOHY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cfRAwj"&gt;Regardless of which console you buy, you may want to consider picking up a few accessories that will help you get the most out of your new gadget, most notably &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF26MXW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an additional controller&lt;/a&gt; if you are playing a game with a local co-op with a friend or family member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v4Zgyt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P06Nfx"&gt;As far as storage goes, both consoles have rather limited storage. If you plan to download some older games that do not take full advantage of the next-gen hardware and don’t want to deplete your limited SSD storage, you can grab an external hard drive. You can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Game-Drive-Xbox-Special/dp/B072LX7WLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;4TB external hard drive from Seagate for $100&lt;/a&gt;, and it includes two months of Xbox Game Pass, a Netflix-like digital video game subscription service for Xbox consoles. Or you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months of Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t have any games you’re interested in buying yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gpa4v9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QOq3lx"&gt;Of course, you can also upgrade your SSD as well, but there are a few things to keep in mind. Seagate is the only one with an SSD expansion card compatible with both consoles. Additionally, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SSD expansion card only comes in 1TB&lt;/a&gt;, and it is very expensive, costing $220. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SE84Lx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s head of Fire TV and Luna cloud gaming has left for Unity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a6vy-Gv4UGaV4UUQz0qyHaR8Dpw=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68872883/1600885423_downloadable_luna_heroamazon_luna.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eSYity"&gt;Amazon’s head of Fire TV, Kindle, and its new Luna cloud gaming service departed the company this month. Marc Whitten has joined Unity as an executive on the company’s Unity Create business. Unity is a cross-platform game engine that many developers use to get their games running across multiple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LhrOxz"&gt;Whitten’s departure, spotted by Matthew Ball &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ballmatthew/status/1364556039480344581"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, comes less than six months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21451371/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming-service-twitch-alexa-controller"&gt;Amazon launched an early access version of Luna&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s new cloud gaming service. It also comes during the same month Google announced it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;shutting down its in-house game development studios&lt;/a&gt; for Stadia. That’s left the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option"&gt;writing on the wall for Stadia&lt;/a&gt;, as it increasingly looks like Google will focus on licensing the underlying tech it has built out to industry partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CR0ELn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon hasn’t launched Luna broadly yet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g1wPKn"&gt;Amazon’s Luna is currently available on PC, Mac, iOS, and Android as long as you’re invited to try the service. Amazon has also expanded &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298746/amazon-luna-expanding-fire-tv-devices-invite-only"&gt;Luna to Fire TV devices without an invite&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s still limited to just the US right now. It’s not clear when Amazon plans to make Luna available more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSSBki"&gt;Whitten confirmed his Amazon departure &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/notwen/status/1364616333858545668"&gt;on Twitter yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m just digging in at Unity of course, but it is so much fun seeing the amount of energy, passion, and creator/user love here,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5ul8N"&gt;Before Whitten arrived at Amazon, he spent 14 years at Microsoft helping launch three Xbox consoles. Whitten &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/17/5520132/marc-whitten-leaves-xbox-for-sonos"&gt;left Microsoft in 2014&lt;/a&gt; to take up the role of chief product officer at wireless audio company Sonos. He has spent the last nearly five years overseeing the Fire TV, Amazon’s Kindle devices, and the launch of Luna.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scientists created this seaweed to save the planet </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-QSL546R01XEVBfAc-OvPc0jDjo=/149x0:1769x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68872791/Thumb_TEXTLESS_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aD4jmu"&gt;A new seaweed-based supplement could reduce a potent greenhouse gas released in burps — sheep burps, that is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GvD5Ze"&gt;Diana Zlotnikov is a farmer in New York with plenty of burping sheep who release methane as a byproduct of their digestion system. Methane is a gas that has 28 times the warming capacity of carbon dioxide. Farming can produce a ton of &lt;a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/natural-resources-environment/climate-change/#:~:text=U.S.%20agriculture%20emitted%20an%20estimated,in%202018%20(EPA%202020)"&gt;CO2 and methane gas&lt;/a&gt; — two of the largest threats in greenhouse gases. Together they make up nearly 50 percent of all emissions and threaten the climate of our planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3luLqn"&gt;Five years ago, Diana started her farm with regenerative agriculture principles in mind — she implemented practices that would not only reduce the carbon footprint of her livestock but would help negate it. Diana has designed her farm to act as a carbon sink that can pull carbon from the atmosphere and &lt;a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/soil_as_carbon_storehouse_new_weapon_in_climate_fight"&gt;trap it in the soil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IsGBus"&gt;But reducing the methane gas coming from her sheep was a much more difficult problem. Based on some research, she tried a mixture of feeds (garlic, legumes, alfalfa), but nothing worked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mJM0n9"&gt;One day her daughter Nicole, a sophomore in high school, came home from school in a researching frenzy. She had recently learned how methane gas was contributing to global warming and was determined to find a way to reduce the methane emissions caused by their farm. She came across &lt;em&gt;asparagopsis taxiformis&lt;/em&gt;, a type of red seaweed, as an effective solution. It is not yet commercially available, but there are some people trying to change that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y2T5LT"&gt;Chemist and entrepreneur Alexia Akbay is one of them. Her company, Symbrosia, produces a red seaweed-based supplement that could reduce livestock methane production dramatically, but what will it take to get it to small farmers like Diana and Nicole? Check out the video above to see how Alexia and her team are domesticating a new seaweed species to tackle climate change — one sheep at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Sony’s State of Play live stream today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ONVKJ5dT7jFkHQ7lkjq4ktwICSY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68872794/acastro_180604_1777_playstation_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    <title>One of Las Vegas’ biggest hotels will soon have a podcast studio in its lobby</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/918eQUqX8LKYdX2gsiSVv9CCjXA=/0x20:2604x1756/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68872813/Wynn_Las_Vegas_Exterior_Daytime_Barbara_Kraft.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Wynn Resorts&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Aj0Zgb"&gt;Podcast studios are now a Las Vegas attraction. Wynn Resorts announced today that it’s investing $3.5 million in Blue Wire, a sports podcasting network, in a deal that’ll include the build out of a podcasting studio in the Wynn Las Vegas’ lobby. That studio will host Blue Wire podcast personalities as well as star athlete guests to entice people to visit the hotel, get excited about sports, and hopefully place bets on them. Wynn runs a subsidiary business called WynnBet, which handles sports betting, and the team specifically eyed Blue Wire to promote that brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="thZtV7"&gt;Craig Billings, president of Wynn Resorts, says the studio will be “activated” during March Madness and NFL kickoff, for example, to bring energy to the hotel around sports, and in turn, it’ll get people to possibly gamble on games. The studio is set to open this summer with Blue Wire branding committed to it for three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsSvuh"&gt;With this deal and investment, Blue Wire CEO Kevin Jones says his team will hire staff on both the operations and talent side based in Vegas. Wynn will receive equity through this investment as well as some in-podcast ads, and the two groups will also collaborate on a branded podcast for WynnBet. Billings and Jones declined to share details about the branded show other than to say it’ll have a “deep level of storytelling” that’s “entertaining” and “compelling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFUYYO"&gt;Blue Wire recently raised $5 million as part of its series A funding, and the network hosts more than 140 shows, hyper-focused on sports. (That funding is separate from Wynn’s investment.) This deal echoes another in the industry; The Athletic, which also specializes in sports content and podcasts, &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-athletic-and-betmgm-announce-exclusive-sports-betting-partnership-301216988.html"&gt;partnered with BetMGM&lt;/a&gt; in January to launch an entire sports betting hub on its website, along with deeper content integrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Hd4PK"&gt;MGM and Wynn are both big names in Vegas, so they, of course, want to become the biggest names in the space and the places people go to place their bets. Maybe an on-premises studio will be the thing that gets tourists to walk in the door at the Wynn or maybe it’ll be a visiting athlete. Either way, Wynn hopes content becomes a major facilitator in growing sports betting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 review: $329 with an asterisk sign</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;No Founder’s Edition this time, so say hello to EVGA&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MyC8Ek"&gt;So you want to buy a graphics card. Join the club: every modern game-capable GPU has instantly sold out for months. The pandemic birthed a global semiconductor shortage, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217206/nvidia-amd-gpu-trump-tax-china-tariff-exemption-expire"&gt;Trump’s trade war didn’t help&lt;/a&gt;, and now even four-year-old graphics cards can fetch several hundred dollars on the secondhand market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95ZbLq"&gt;Into that chaos, Nvidia is launching the $329 GeForce RTX 3060, a card the company insists will actually have a starting price of $329, and I’m reviewing a model of that card that they claim will actually go on sale for that price later today: the EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming. “Supply will be limited though,” EVGA tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Of course it will. And as I write these words, I’m already seeing it listed &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733235739061848871" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $60 over MSRP at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bluI4Z"&gt;Even if it eventually winds up being easy to purchase, though, I’ve got to wonder if the 3060 is the affordable GPU that we’ve been waiting for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JTT4PM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10360918"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OsbWXN"&gt;Every graphics card we’ve reviewed over the past six months had a compelling reason to exist. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;GeForce RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt; was the first no-compromise 4K gaming graphics card under $1,000, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21571414/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review"&gt;AMD RX 6800 XT&lt;/a&gt; gave it a direct competitor. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21534142/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-review"&gt;RTX 3070&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"&gt;RX 6800&lt;/a&gt; excel at 1440p and invite you to turn your aging desktop &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"&gt;into an entry-level 4K rig&lt;/a&gt; for the price of a PS5 or Xbox Series X. Meanwhile, the $400 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21726429/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-review"&gt;RTX 3060 Ti&lt;/a&gt; is the bang-for-the-buck champ, delivering nearly as much 1440p performance as the RTX 3070 for $100 less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ur8jpD"&gt;The vanilla 3060’s story isn’t quite as inspiring by comparison. Nominally, it’s only a little less expensive than the 3060 Ti, but you sacrifice more than a little bit of performance to get there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZD6Ga3AY7erakqkCo-FvdFDRPf4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326016/shollister_200224_4441_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rear ports of EVGA’s RTX 3060.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uVSVw9BhK7ewL4DqWJN4xPmZIww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326017/shollister_200224_4441_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;EVGA’s RTX 3060 has a regular eight-pin connector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l4DLxB"&gt;Before we dive into benchmarks, let’s spend a moment on the EVGA XC Black Gaming. I kind of dig the design: the twin-fan, dual-heat-pipe card is small and easy to slot into a Mini-ITX case — and with a tried-and-true eight-pin PCIe power connector instead of the proprietary 12-pin connector featured in Nvidia’s own RTX 3090, 3080, 3070 and 3060 Ti cards. You still get the full array of video outputs, including three DisplayPort 1.4a ports and an HDMI 2.1 port with HDCP 2.3 support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zOkg9"&gt;Here’s what it looks like next to my own 3060 Ti Founder’s Edition. It’s notably smaller:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2IppII7CiE4NYiTUbqcswQAvJa8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326018/shollister_200224_4441_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 vs. Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founder’s Edition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j43T3M"&gt;The eight-inch-long card isn’t even the smallest RTX 3060 you’ll see this year, as Nvidia’s partners have some single-fan designs that should squeeze into practically any case on the market that has room for a dual-slot GPU. This dual-fan XC Gaming cooler is potent enough that EVGA already fit &lt;a href="https://www.evga.com/products/product.aspx?pn=08G-P5-3663-KR"&gt;an RTX 3060 Ti&lt;/a&gt; into this form factor, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5DvT2F"&gt;While I can’t imagine all those embossed “E” symbols exactly help my fan performance, they don’t seem to especially hurt, with a moderately pitched whirring sound at full bore instead of a mini jet engine scream. It’s both a few degrees cooler and a tad quieter than my 3060 Ti FE during a demanding game, hovering around 70 degrees Celsius and 2,200 RPM with my two Noctua A12x15 case fans backing it up and around 80C without. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RbbJlE"&gt;Add the lower 550W power supply requirement (the card draws 170W, versus 200W for the Ti), and that’s a lot of reasons the 3060 should be popular for mini builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ0cFJ"&gt;Okay, let’s talk performance. If you’ve read my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; two &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt;, you know I’m a bit of a cheapskate. I’m the kind of person who’d definitely buy a $330 graphics card instead of a $600 one, and that means I’m also the kind of person who’d pair it with my existing, plenty-good-enough CPU instead of upgrading my whole rig. I’m running the RTX 3060 with my quad-core 4.2GHz Core i7-7700K, and proud of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6kaIwM"&gt;You probably know that CPU power matters less as you raise the resolution; at 4K or 1440p, your frame rate is limited a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more by your graphics card in all but a handful of games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6Pezb"&gt;But at 1440p, the vanilla 3060 doesn’t have &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; enough oomph to regularly make it over 60fps in the latest games without tweaking lots of settings in a build like mine — and yet the 3060 Ti generally hits 60 without a problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BDVO7L7aD1_1DsuRpo8EUvGsoIM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326015/shollister_200224_4441_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;EVGA’s RTX 3060 comes with a lot of embossed “E” symbols.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="gu9kHr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10360894"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="02Jl4U"&gt;I benched 14 games with the 3060 and 3060 Ti at ultra spec, with and without ray tracing and Nvidia’s DLSS, and the 3060 Ti was almost always between 15 percent and 35 percent faster. The 3060 is punching below its weight: a higher boost clock and 12GB of memory can’t hope to make up for 26 percent fewer cores and a narrower 192-bit memory bus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AGjDMR"&gt;You’ll see in the chart that &lt;em&gt;neither&lt;/em&gt; card let me comfortably run the most demanding games like &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt; at ultra spec at 1440p, but the difference between these two cards is the difference between running those games at medium or high levels of detail. High settings tend to look a lot better, and it’s nice to have some additional headroom for future games that’ll push the GPU even harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAahH6"&gt;That said, these frame rates are still nothing to sneeze at. My four-year-old GTX 1080 couldn’t dream of maxing out &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at 1440p at a smooth 78fps or &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; at 87fps. I had to play through a bunch of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; at low spec earlier this year, which I absolutely do not recommend, and I’d honestly been saving &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; until I could find a new GPU. It’s also very nice to be able to play &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Squadrons &lt;/em&gt;at a full 120fps (even if I could get to 144fps with a 3060 Ti) or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286507/valheim-steam-pc-game-2-million-sales"&gt;the delightful but unoptimized &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at around 60fps with the eye candy turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bgx8qwBS6F9Wh7OFEFCRq1VWrVs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326013/shollister_200224_4441_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;EVGA is using a dual heat pipe on its RTX 3060 card.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RyrgR9"&gt;And if you’ve got a 1080p monitor instead of 1440p, or if you’re a fan of Nvidia’s resolution-reducing, AI-sharpening DLSS technique — I hate it, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21726429/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-review"&gt;my colleague Tom Warren loves it&lt;/a&gt; — you can genuinely turn on ray tracing with a $329 graphics card and begin to experience the wonder of real-time reflections. A 46fps average in &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; may not sound like a lot, but it’s a smooth game north of 45fps if you’ve got a G-Sync or FreeSync monitor actually delivering each of those frames, and that’s what I saw with ray tracing turned on at 1080p. With ray tracing off, &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs Legion&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt; look playable at 1080p high spec as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7rNXAJ"&gt;But even then, 1080p is a resolution where your CPU begins to matter, and my Core i7-7700K or earlier won’t always be enough. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285676/microsoft-flight-simulator-uk-ireland-update-football-stadiums-castles-manors-features"&gt;new &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is famously CPU-limited, &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-cpu-scaling-benchmarks"&gt;and to some degree so is &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where I saw dips below 60fps no matter what level of detail I’d set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I_ZOp_3muZrCkrqx5NQ5BZS7JDY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326019/shollister_200224_4441_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, these were all photographed on the lid of my Ncase M1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CeWiVM"&gt;If you’ve specifically been waiting for a $300-ish card to replace an aging GPU, you’ll be satisfied with lower settings over the next couple of years, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you can actually find an RTX 3060 at its retail price, I don’t think you’ll be disappointed. But I’d set aside $500 for an RTX 3070, and though I settled for a $400 RTX 3060 Ti, I can’t imagine settling for a 3060 instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="lSihgR"&gt;If you have an extra $70 in the budget for the slightly beefier card, I would absolutely spend it. And if you can’t find what you want, I’d say keep on waiting. The GPU market is wild right now, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;more chips are coming&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299529/amd-radeon-rx-6000-gpu-event-announced"&gt;what should be a more affordable AMD GPU&lt;/a&gt; on March 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon might be famous for its games, but it also has some great gadgets</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kcuZGO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; might be renowned for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22289300/pokemon-25-anniversary-red-blue-gameboy-nintendo-co-op"&gt;cooperative gameplay&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296948/pokemon-25th-anniversary-spinoffs-go-snap-detective-pikachu"&gt; delightful spinoffs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297722/pokemon-25-anniversary-approachable-rpg-game-nintendo"&gt;making an intimidating genre approachable&lt;/a&gt;, but the franchise also has a long history of creative and interesting gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9GJsp"&gt;The series is bursting with technology. The original in-game pokédex clearly takes inspiration from early Palm Pilot-like devices, for example. And if you think about them, pokéballs are technological marvels: they somehow transform living creatures into particles that can be transported across the world (and in the TV show, the pokéballs can even shrink). So it’s not all that surprising that there have been many &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;-themed toys and hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEasGM"&gt;We’ve collected just a few of the many memorable &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; gadgets in honor of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297819/pokemon-25th-anniversary-nintendo-game-boy-pikachu"&gt;the series’ 25th anniversary&lt;/a&gt;. The IRL devices range from gamified pedometers to custom video game consoles to actual pokéball replicas (though they can’t turn living things into particles just yet). There’s a lot of gear you can get if you want to catch ‘em all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UjJIFN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t4UIYzepWgw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rWN4qA"&gt;An actual pokédex&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ALIwJP"&gt;Tiger Electronics and Hasbro released a toy pokédex in the late ‘90s, and I still consider it one of my favorite toys of all time. It was modeled after &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8ziMBZCJgvg"&gt;Ash’s pokédex&lt;/a&gt; from the first season of the TV show, though with a few different features to allow it to actually function as a real-life toy. It had a keypad and a number pad for searching information, a small screen that showed the pokémon you were looking at, and could show information about each pokémon like its height, weight, type, and some attacks it could learn. It made me feel like I was a bona fide pokémon trainer, and I remember spending hours reading up on different pokémon with my pokédex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Xogj4D"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bDBa8zsyxF4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X6Yb9u"&gt;Pokémon Pikachu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rPSO4h"&gt;My Pokémon Pikachu was a staple of my childhood. &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990218041314/http://www.nintendo.com/corp/press/110698.html"&gt;Released in 1998&lt;/a&gt;, it was a pocket-sized gadget that was kind of like a Tamagotchi, except you took care of a digital Pikachu. But it also had a built-in pedometer that you could activate just by shaking the device up and down. (Or, like in the commercials embedded above, jumping.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6HxHI"&gt;That shakeability meant that I was &lt;em&gt;constantly &lt;/em&gt;bouncing the little device to earn a currency called watts. You could gift watts to Pikachu or, oddly, gamble them away at a slot machine. You can learn more about it on this delightful Nintendo Japan website &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/n09/pokepika/"&gt;that’s still around&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kGS5r"&gt;Nintendo released an upgraded model, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khJQyldV6Qs"&gt;the Pokémon Pikachu 2 GS&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/n09/pika_kg/index.html"&gt; in 1999 in Japan&lt;/a&gt; and 2000 in North America and Europe, &lt;a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Pikachu_2_GS"&gt;according to Bulbapedia&lt;/a&gt;. It had a color screen and could connect to &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Gold&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Silver&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Crystal&lt;/em&gt; via the Game Boy Color’s infrared port, allowing you to trade watts for items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3ATsn4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L7ab_SK8Bj8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Uas9CW"&gt;A pokémon-themed camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7PPYZH"&gt;Just look at this point-and-shoot camera. It has a giant Pikachu on one side, two poké balls hold the flash and the lens, and an adorable Diglett is the shutter button. The camera shot 35mm film, and each photo would also have a pokémon-themed border, &lt;a href="https://www.manualslib.com/manual/66182/Tiger-Electronics-Pokemon-Camera.html#manual"&gt;according to the manual&lt;/a&gt;. (You can see that border, which featured Pikachu, Meowth, Squirtle, and Blastoise, &lt;a href="https://www.lomography.com/cameras/3341370-pokemon-toy-camera/photos"&gt;in this album&lt;/a&gt;.) A couple eBay listings peg its release date as 1999.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="0zsM1n"&gt;Hey You, Pikachu’s “Voice Recognition Unit”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4sX4MX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey You, Pikachu &lt;/em&gt;was a Nintendo 64 game that let you talk to Pikachu with the help of the Voice Recognition Unit, or VRU, that was bundled with the game. It was released in &lt;a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hey_You,_Pikachu!"&gt;1998 in Japan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/games/hey-you-pikachu"&gt;2000 in North America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLyHTj"&gt;You can see the VRU in the picture above — users clipped a large microphone to their controller, plugged that into a special module (which stored Pikachu’s 256-word vocabulary, &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=IKvES_TIwJoC&amp;amp;q=pikachu&amp;amp;pg=PA42#v=snippet&amp;amp;q=pikachu&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Popular Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and then plugged &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; module into the Nintendo 64 itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfkLYs"&gt;And speaking of Pikachu-themed hardware...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="UMvH4s"&gt;The Pikachu-themed Nintendo 64, &lt;a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Nintendo_64#Pok.C3.A9mon_special_editions"&gt;released in 2000&lt;/a&gt;, put a fun twist on the console’s design by making the on-off switch a poké ball and Pikachu’s right foot the reset button. I love how giant Pikachu is — it dominates almost half the console. And while I can’t remember ever actually using one of these myself, I imagine it must have been very satisfying to press Pikachu’s little foot to reset a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x4HQ7U"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/td4PyrDg9R0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rajetJ"&gt;Pokémon mini&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4CyHmA"&gt;The Pokémon mini was a tiny handheld console designed specifically to play Pokémon-themed games from cartridges. It was released in &lt;a href="https://www.serebii.net/mini/"&gt;2001 in North America and Japan and 2002 in Europe&lt;/a&gt;. It was 74mm x 58mm x 23mm — described on the &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Corporate/Nintendo-History/Pokemon-mini/Pokemon-mini-627132.html"&gt;still-active Pokémon mini Nintendo UK website&lt;/a&gt; as “well under half the size” of Nintendo’s iconic Game Boy Advance — and came in three colors. It even had motion sensing &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; rumble built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TZwAVp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VBZceKkx9Tk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pl5uDu"&gt;Pokéwalker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mzLnYH"&gt;The Pokémon Pikachu devices were succeeded by the poké ball-themed Pokéwalker in 2009, which was bundled with every copy of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon HeartGold&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;SoulSilver&lt;/em&gt;. Like the Pokémon Pikachu, the Pokéwalker was a pedometer, let you accumulate watts, and allowed you to take care of pokémon. But unlike the Pokémon Pikachu, you could transfer pokémon back and forth from the Pokéwalker, meaning you weren’t forced to only care for Pikachu. You could also find new wild pokémon and items directly on your Pokéwalker by spending watts to play mini-games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kowUzM"&gt;Nintendo has uploaded the &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/downloads/Pokewalker_Tri.pdf"&gt;Pokéwalker’s manual online&lt;/a&gt;, if you’d like to learn more about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jn3ZVS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1GrsVmwwPAg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="shn1M5"&gt;Poké Ball Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DqBYMd"&gt;Nintendo released another poké ball-themed device in 2018 alongside &lt;em&gt;Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu!&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee!&lt;/em&gt;: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/16/18091186/poke-ball-plus-review-mew-catch-cute"&gt;Poké Ball Plus&lt;/a&gt;, an actual, functional game controller that’s compatible with the Nintendo Switch. You can play both games with the controller and catch pokémon by making a throwing motion with your arm. Similar to the Pokéwalker, you can also store pokémon inside the Poké Ball Plus, and they’ll even cry from inside it if you shake it around. The controller is also compatible with the huge mobile hit &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZlyPpu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RWM3tIlXTp8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LnvM0o"&gt;This Poké Ball replica that “must never be thrown”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LLP863"&gt;This only barely counts as a gadget, but I had to include it. Last November, The Pokémon Company International and The Wand Company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726725/pokemon-pokeball-collectible-metal-motion-activated-do-not-throw"&gt;announced this $99.99 die-cast replica&lt;/a&gt; of the Poké Ball. As realistic as it looks, don’t go throwing it at your cat as a joke; it weighs 10.5oz, which is double the weight of a baseball. And in fact, &lt;a href="https://www.thewandcompany.com/pokeball/"&gt;The Wand Company says&lt;/a&gt; that it “must never be thrown” and that “throwing the Poké Ball will damage it and may injure someone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91K0eh"&gt;But if you’ve ever wanted to actually hold a poké ball, buying one of these might be the closest you can get. It even glows.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="zvxwjZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 25th, 8:03AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Sony’s PlayStation 5 with the disc drive is currently &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console%2F-%2FA-81114595&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;&lt;em&gt;available for purchase at Target&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, while supplies last. You can find more information &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22295875/sony-ps5-playstation-5-restock-target"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaMPZI"&gt;Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; is available now. Due to the pandemic and high demand for the PS5, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550842/sony-playstation-5-ps5-launch-day-in-store-purchases"&gt;retailers such as Best Buy and Target will only sell the console online&lt;/a&gt; for the foreseeable future. So, if you were planning to camp outside your local Target hoping to buy the console today, there will be no walk-in purchases available this year. But, you can order one online and request an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="Antnby"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="1XN8E0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9564009"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7M35PW"&gt;If you are torn between which PS5 console to buy, no need to worry. The biggest difference to note is that the PS5 Digital Edition is smaller than the PS5 standard, costs $399, and it does not include a Blu-ray disc drive. The PS5 standard is $100 more, is a bit bulkier than the digital edition, and includes a disc drive, allowing you to play game discs. &lt;/p&gt;
