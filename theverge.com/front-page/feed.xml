    <title>Anker’s new Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro earbuds support high-quality LDAC audio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EJY-96XnjA31RFr171h-JJMWEfQ=/0x27:1399x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69962872/F85E02CD_CC42_4CC2_86EB_2FF0ADB218EC.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Anker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bl6ETq"&gt;Anker’s Soundcore brand is today refreshing its flagship true wireless earbuds with the new $169.99 Liberty 3 Pros. Both the earbuds and their slider-style charging case look very similar to the Liberty 2 Pros, though the buds are 30 percent smaller and have an “air pressure relief structure” in their wingtips for added comfort. Anker has made more significant improvements to the features they offer: the new earbuds have active noise cancellation — you’d hope for as much at this price — and the “HearID ANC” system is optimized for efficiency and comfort. Anker says it monitors outside ambient noise while also taking in-ear pressure into account, so the level of ANC automatically adapts to the environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGatIW"&gt;The dual-driver acoustic architecture of the Liberty 3 Pros has been refined, and these earbuds join Sony’s WF-1000XM4s in offering upgraded audio quality thanks to their support for the LDAC codec. There aren’t many wireless earbuds out there that offer LDAC (though aptX HD is more common), so hopefully, this will be the start of a trend. AAC and SBC codecs are also supported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTf8GG"&gt;The charging case charge features wireless charging, and Anker says the earbuds can hit up to six hours of continuous playback with ANC enabled or eight with it off. The case stores an additional 24 or 32 hours, respectively. Anker says its fast charge capabilities can give you three hours of playback if you plug in and charge the earbuds over USB-C for just 15 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="due9HN"&gt;Anker will offer the Liberty 3 Pros in four different colors: black, white, silver, gray, and purple. They’re rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance and have three different transparency modes for when you do need some environmental awareness. You can order the new buds starting today. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323748/anker-liberty-air-2-pro-review-wireless-headphone-price"&gt;Becca reviewed the Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pros&lt;/a&gt;, which have a more AirPods-esque design and are priced at $130. As is often the case with Anker, they’re a very competitive product for the asking price. But with the Liberty 3 Pros priced a good bit higher, Anker will be facing off with plenty of worthy alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap is taking action to address fentanyl dealing on Snapchat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WuGqcuw-1OGdDzXHxYwHrIcFuGE=/0x0:911x607/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69962866/Heads_Up_Triptych___cropped.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users will be directed to an educational portal if they search for certain keywords.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Snapchat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gjFI6O"&gt;Snapchat has announced a series of measures it’s taking to counter drug dealing on its platform, and to educate users about the dangers of fentanyl and other drugs. When users search for drug-related keywords like “fentanyl,” Snap says it will direct them to a new educational portal called Heads Up. It’s also ramping up actions against drug dealers on its platform, including improved in-app reporting tools and proactive detection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cfb0Vq"&gt;The announcements follow a recent &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/pills-bought-on-snapchat-deadly/index.html"&gt;investigation by &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into a spate of deaths involving teens and young adults who were suspected of having bought fentanyl-laced drugs through the social network. The report alleged that drug dealers are able to use Snapchat to find buyers, and that the platform isn’t doing enough to remove their accounts and keep them off the platform. The social network was also accused of taking too long to provide information to law enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kY0FoM"&gt;Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that’s complicit in an alarming increase in deaths in the United States in recent years. In 2019, nearly 50,000 people in the US are believed to have died from overdoses involving opioids, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/drug-topics/opioids/opioid-overdose-crisis"&gt;National Institute on Drug Abuse&lt;/a&gt;. According to Snap, drug dealers include fentanyl in counterfeit Vicodin or Xanax prescription pills, which are then bought by unwitting customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LJj34P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A new Heads Up portal will direct users to educational content&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xMP1Sy"&gt;In its blog post, Snapchat stresses that it’s taking more enforcement action against dealers on its platform. It says that enforcement rates have more than doubled in the first half of 2021, and that its systems have proactively detected 260 percent more material than it did previously. It says that nearly two-thirds of drug-related content is proactively discovered by its artificial intelligence systems and adds that it’s improved its response time to valid law enforcement requests by 85 percent year over year. Nevertheless, Snap admits it still has more work to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mK7t5X"&gt;As well as more proactively removing drug dealers from its platform, Snap points towards research its commissioned that suggests some users are unaware of how dangerous fentanyl can be — something its Heads Up portal is designed to address. Snap says it will be promoting the portal, as well as the dangers of fentanyl more generally via a new filter, and that it will also discuss the crisis in upcoming episodes of its Snap Original show &lt;em&gt;Good Luck America&lt;/em&gt;. Expert organizations contributing to Heads Up include Song for Charlie, Shatterproof, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), with resources from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be added in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sky’s new Glass TVs ditch satellite dishes for Wi-Fi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Su3sncNLg53FCTLJzGios1cm-ps=/469x0:5532x3375/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69962840/Sky_Glass___Racing_green___Home_page.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky Glass TVs stream channels over Wi-Fi instead of satellite dishes.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sky&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e5tGLM"&gt;British Satellite broadcaster Sky is moving away from the satellite dishes that have defined its TV service for decades. Sky Glass is launching today, an ambitious effort to sell television sets that stream Sky TV content over Wi-Fi directly to consumers. There’s no external box, no satellite dish, and no need for a soundbar. Sky calls the all-in-one TV “no fuss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0yBdX"&gt;Although announced for the UK today, Sky has global aspirations for Glass TV “built on technology borne of the collaboration as part of the Comcast Corporation.” As such, we might be looking at the platform underpinning Comcast’s rumored &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685538/comcast-xclass-tv-sky-q-smart-tv-hisense-x1-operating-system"&gt;XClass TVs&lt;/a&gt; for the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QHF5Qz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sky.com%2Fglass&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22714076%2Fsky-glass-tv-streaming-service-uk-pricing-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sky Glass TVs&lt;/a&gt; will be available in three sizes: 43-inch, 55-inch, and 65-inch. Each 4K TV will stream Sky’s TV channels, and integrates in voice control (Hello Sky) and 21 apps to access additional content like Netflix, Spotify, or Disney Plus. Sky hasn’t named the TV manufacturer it partnered with yet, but the full specifications include a UHD Quantum Dot display, support for Dolby Vision, HDR 10, HLG, three HDMI 2.1 ports, and a single USB-C port. The rather chubby TV fits six speakers for up to 215W of Dolby Atmos surround sound: 3 outward firing speakers, 2 upward, and 1 central subwoofer. There will also be five color options: white, pink, green, blue, and black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y6_dvhGot_6yiby9aHrRZEhz1xo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907030/skyglasstvs.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky Glass TVs come in three sizes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KzZP5itoxFwj8Uf9GmLwobvJEKk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907031/Sky_Glass_Voice_remote___lifestyle__TV_in_action.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s voice support or the usual TV remote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fc6eVy"&gt;The price of a Sky Glass TV is designed to be baked into a monthly subscription to Sky’s TV service, known as Sky Ultimate TV, but you can also pay for the TV upfront if you want to lower the monthly costs. Sky Ultimate TV includes access to Netflix and some basic Sky channels, but Sky Sports and Sky Cinema are separate add-ons. What you pay will depend on the size of TV and whether you want to spread payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8Tk1U"&gt;The smallest 43-inch model is £649 upfront, or you can spread the payments at £13 per month over 48 months, or £26 per month over 24 months. The 55-inch model works out at £849 upfront, or £17 per month over 48 months, and £34 per month over 24 months. The largest 65-inch Sky Glass TV is £1,049 upfront, or £21 per month over 48 months, and £42 per month over 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ugTPH"&gt;That means the cheapest option for a Sky Glass TV is £39 per month for the smaller 43-inch model, unless you’re willing to pay for it upfront and pay the £26 per month subscription separately. Sky has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sky.com%2Fglass%2Ftechnical-specifications%2F43inch%3Fcontract%3D48months%26irct%3DglassHome-glass-techSpecs&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22714076%2Fsky-glass-tv-streaming-service-uk-pricing-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full pricing options here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wzJWrF0mVbrhU2sGKW5zEG1QFPY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907039/skyglasspucksandremote.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky Stream pucks also let you stream Sky channels to existing TVs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qJO7JG"&gt;Sky is also offering Sky Stream pucks at £50 each upfront, which you can use in other rooms of your house to stream Sky content to existing TVs. These appear to be offered only as add-ons, much like Sky’s multiscreen offering, so you can’t purchase a Sky Stream puck without a Sky Glass TV. Sky Steam pucks will also require a £10 monthly subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZugX9"&gt;Sky describes its new Glass TVs as a “voice-first” platform, so while there is a separate remote, the company is pushing voice commands more than ever before. “Hello Sky” activates Sky’s voice commands, much like a digital assistant, and you’ll even be able to use it to switch HDMI ports by saying “Sky, Xbox” to switch to an Xbox console if you have one connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k0IInO"&gt;Sky is also working on a 4K smart camera that will attach to its Sky Glass TVs and will launch in 2022. It looks a lot like Microsoft’s Kinect camera, and it even includes body tracking and motion controls just like Kinect. Sky boldly claims it will “transform how we chat, play games, workout, and share entertainment at home.” It will support apps like Zoom, and includes noise-cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oW_pW3SfiX2feqEPrMTmO2vSwT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907038/skyglasscamera.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sky Glass 4K webcam looks like a Kinect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DlRlSJ"&gt;The most interesting aspect of the camera is Sky’s collaboration with Microsoft to watch TV together with others. Sky demonstrated a software experience that allows you to watch TV channels with others, and see each other’s reactions to sport in real time. This is something Microsoft always wanted to deliver through its Kinect work, so it’s interesting to see the company with Sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDUlQS"&gt;This camera includes motion controls, allowing Sky Glass owners to access “family games” and control them with their body. This was always the dream of Kinect on Xbox, and it looks like Sky is trying to resurrect it with Sky Glass TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="peBibH"&gt;While Sky has detailed its hardware today, we’re still waiting to hear more on how the company is streaming its content over the web. TV providers have struggled to stream live TV without a delay over the internet, which is particularly jarring when you’re watching live sport and neighbors cheer or you see the score on Twitter before it happens on your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNJi7n"&gt;Sky says you’ll need a minimum connection of 10Mbps to stream HD content through a Sky Glass TV, or 25Mbps for 4K. That’s identical to the minimums for Netflix, but Sky hasn’t detailed what bitrates and streaming protocols it’s using yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vE7wNVg5KKQN2B2nf8Im3Ill8Nk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907034/white3.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;It’s not the thinnest of TVs.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nwjjKD"&gt;Sky also says it will be the first TV manufacturer in the world to have a swap program, allowing customers to swap old Sky Glass TVs for newer models when they’re available. It’s not immediately clear how that will work, but it will likely only be offered to those who spread the cost in Sky’s monthly subscriptions instead of buying the TV upfront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VO1fIG"&gt;Sky Glass won’t be limited to the UK, either. Sky has built these TVs so other telcos and television operators can launch Sky Glass TVs, too. Australia’s Foxtel Group will launch Sky Glass at some point in the future, and Sky says this is the “first of many collaborations as Sky Glass is scaled across the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSQ1Vc"&gt;Sky Glass TVs could also form the basis of Comcast’s XClass TVs, as Sky notes its TVs are “built on technology borne of the collaboration as part of the Comcast Corporation.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685538/comcast-xclass-tv-sky-q-smart-tv-hisense-x1-operating-system"&gt;Rumors suggest&lt;/a&gt; Comcast’s upcoming TVs will run Comcast’s X1 OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDqK6t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox Cloud Gaming is now fully powered by faster Xbox Series X hardware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D9AzVTO8-NlHpWbmmzgiyxot1v0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69962830/acastro_210429_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1m9G7M"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming service (xCloud) is now fully powered by custom Xbox Series X hardware. Microsoft tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it recently completed the upgrade, which improves both framerates and game load times for players streaming Xbox games over the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHNjNb"&gt;While Microsoft has moved Xbox Cloud Gaming to 1080p and 60fps streams in recent months, the company has yet to unlock the full potential of custom Xbox Series X hardware to deliver 4K streams. It’s not clear when this will be available, but Microsoft has been moving towards delivering Xbox Cloud Gaming beyond just mobile devices and browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1WkLc"&gt;Microsoft is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527420/microsoft-xbox-tv-app-streaming-stick-xcloud"&gt;working on a dedicated Xbox app for TVs&lt;/a&gt; that will allow Xbox players to stream games without a console. Standalone streaming devices that you can plug into a TV or monitor are also planned, and it’s reasonable to assume there could be further upgrades to the Xbox Cloud Gaming resolution to match this TV push.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fA5Sjfsim5U23N2FXiJUwzr7yjA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802300/Xbox_Game_Pass___Minecraft_Dungeons.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Game Pass is getting integrated into the Xbox dashboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R4iVxE"&gt;Xbox Cloud Gaming started off as a way to play games on mobile devices, but with its upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698101/microsoft-xcloud-xbox-cloud-gaming-console-integration"&gt;integration into the Xbox dashboard&lt;/a&gt; and TVs, it’s already becoming a lot more than just a mobile offering. Microsoft is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710708/microsoft-xbox-web-store-xcloud-cloud-gaming-wishlists-features"&gt;integrating Xbox Cloud Gaming into its new Xbox web store&lt;/a&gt; that’s starting to rollout, and we’re still waiting to hear more about its plans to bring its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299032/microsoft-mixer-closing-facebook-gaming-partnership-xcloud-features"&gt;xCloud technology to Facebook Gaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubqJ95"&gt;Microsoft also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22701912/xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-australia-brazil-mexico-japan-launch-october"&gt;recently expanded Xbox Cloud Gaming&lt;/a&gt; to Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and Japan, shortly after completing its custom Xbox Series X hardware upgrade for the service. Microsoft’s xCloud tech is now available in 26 countries, and the company has previously hinted at “new subscription offerings for Xbox Game Pass,” so we could see additional tiers that provide access to Xbox Cloud Gaming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A text message routing company suffered a five-year-long breach</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VMwX3ELU5_8o28rq6RFFI7PHSqE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69962056/acastro_170621_1777_0006_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n692sJ"&gt;Syniverse, a telecom company that helps carriers like Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&amp;amp;T route messages between each other and other carriers abroad, disclosed last week that it was the subject of a possible five year long hack. If the name Syniverse sounds familiar, the company was also responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953422/text-messages-delayed-received-overnight-valentines-day-delay"&gt;the disappearance of a swath of Valentine’s Day text messages&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGv9U2"&gt;The hack in question was brought to light &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1839175/000119312521284329/d234831dprem14a.htm#toc234831_9"&gt;in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Syniverse published last week&lt;/a&gt;. In it, Syniverse shares that in May 2021 it “became aware of unauthorized access to its operational and information technology systems by an unknown individual or organization.” The company did its due diligence notifying law enforcement and conducting an internal investigation, resulting in the discovery that the security breach first started in May 2016. That’s five years of (possibly) unfettered access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KDq6Uq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The hack went back as far as 2016&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FEMyp9"&gt;The hackers “gained unauthorized access to databases within its network on several occasions, and that login information allowing access to or from its Electronic Data Transfer (EDT) environment was compromised for approximately 235 of its customers,” the filing reads. That could include access to call records, and metadata like phone numbers, locations, and the content of text messages, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3xpm8/company-that-routes-billions-of-text-messages-quietly-says-it-was-hacked"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard’&lt;/em&gt;s sources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ioWW2R"&gt;Syniverse’s SEC filing says the company notified anyone caught up in the breach, and reset credentials were appropriate. Additionally, “Syniverse did not observe any evidence of intent to disrupt its operations or those of its customers and there was no attempt to monetize the unauthorized activity,” the filing states. Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and Syniverse did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, while T-Mobile referred questions to the CTIA. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/10/company-that-routes-sms-for-all-major-us-carriers-was-hacked-for-five-years/"&gt;T-Mobile did tell &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it was “aware of a security incident” with Syniverse but there is “no indication that any personal information, call record details or text message content of T-Mobile customers were impacted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BL1hwg"&gt;Syniverse’s security breach was revealed as the company &lt;a href="https://www.syniverse.com/news-and-events/syniverse-merger-with-m3-brigade-acquisition-ii-corp"&gt;is trying to go public&lt;/a&gt; through a merger with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition company (SPAC)&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems like it was a target in the first place because of the company’s size. Syniverse has spent the last decade becoming a quasi-gatekeeper for multiple US carriers through acquisitions, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974692/valentines-day-text-message-delay-explanation-sms-syniverse-carriers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s earlier reporting found&lt;/a&gt;. Size matters in business, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22248631/solarwinds-hack-cybersecurity-us-menn-decoder-podcast"&gt;but as with the SolarWinds hack&lt;/a&gt;, it matters even more when something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix will edit phone numbers out of Squid Game following prank calls </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B-RomZEPDqE-pFX037-1-FkvpKo=/253x0:2271x1345/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69962040/Screen_Shot_2021_10_06_at_4.12.41_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fh69lb"&gt;Netflix’s immensely popular &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; is getting an edit after phone numbers shown in the series dialed real numbers, leading to what the company described as “unfortunate” prank dials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjTnsa"&gt;The Korean drama about a sadistic “game,” in which players find themselves with no option but to participate in a series of twisted challenges, contains visible phone numbers in multiple scenes (a phone number is also clearly visible in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704313/sk-broadband-netflix-suing-for-payment-squid-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; trailer). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQklFG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflix-edit-squid-game-phone-number-after-woman-inundated-with-calls-2021-10-06/"&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; the news, cited Netflix and production company Siren Pictures as saying they purposefully did not include a complete number and weren’t aware the number shown would reach a real line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkKXoY"&gt;Netflix confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the numbers that appear in &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; will be edited, adding that it hopes that the change will end the prank calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVUJFd"&gt;A man who &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/entertainment/article/3150377/after-man-phone-number-netflixs-squid-game-bombarded-calls"&gt;claims to be the owner&lt;/a&gt; of the number told a local media outlet that he’d been “bombarded” with messages and calls, adding that they had made it difficult to live his life normally. However, it appears as though &lt;a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2021/10/688_316564.html?fl"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflix-edit-squid-game-phone-number-after-woman-inundated-with-calls-2021-10-06/"&gt;individuals&lt;/a&gt; may have received calls from enthusiast &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; viewers. Netflix did not immediately return a request for clarification about whether the series had impacted one or multiple local numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdHwnX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; has been a massive success for Netflix, becoming the streaming service’s &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-korea-the-story-so-far"&gt;top title in the US&lt;/a&gt; as of last week — it remained a top title as of this week as well — the first Korean series to claim that top spot, according to Netflix. That’s great for the show’s creators and certainly a win for Netflix. It’s probably safe to assume the poor individual(s) receiving prank calls from random &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; devotees feel differently, though.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony didn’t close the PS3 and Vita stores, but it’s making it hard to shop at them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PS3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/faj4_mZ4Qgt4NCY6NvZLJ300Gpc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69961859/vpavic_191205_untitled_0018_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i8C52N"&gt;Sony is making it a little bit harder to buy games digitally on the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation Vita. Beginning October 27th, you won’t be able to use a credit card, debit card, or PayPal to purchase games or add money to your wallet on those systems, &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/important-notice/"&gt;according to a support document&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, you’ll have to use a PlayStation Store gift card or load up the wallet tied to your account on the PlayStation Store on the web, your phone, or on a PS4 or PS5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQzvwY"&gt;This disappointing change is the latest in something of an ongoing story of Sony’s support for its older consoles. In March, Sony announced it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356791/sony-playstation-store-close-ps3-vita-psp-game-downloads"&gt;closing the PlayStation Store for the PS3 and Vita&lt;/a&gt;, but it reversed that plan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22392126/sony-ps3-ps-vita-stores-open-backtrack-psp-july-2nd-mistake"&gt;a few weeks later&lt;/a&gt;, saying it “made the wrong decision.” As part of that original March announcement, Sony also said it was dropping remaining PlayStation Portable purchase functionality on July 6th, which now means you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22561047/sony-psp-games-available-ps3-vita-stores"&gt;no longer buy new DLC for PSP games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDaJdM"&gt;Fortunately, you can still buy PSP games from the PS3 and Vita digital storefronts if you want. But starting in a few weeks, you’ll want to make sure you load up your wallet in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 is causing performance issues for some AMD Ryzen processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The AMD Ryzen 5 sticker on the bottom left corner of the ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eClGE_kzVbBrk8ne1IDItE5ZrrE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69961459/mchin_20190730_4573_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VxUO8e"&gt;Windows 11 is officially out, but if you’ve got an AMD Ryzen processor, you might want to hold off on updating for a bit: the &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/pa-400"&gt;company is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that its chips might have issues with the new OS that could cause performance drops of up to 15 percent in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NSMGFg"&gt;AMD and Microsoft have found two main issues with Windows 11 on Ryzen. The first is that Windows 11 may cause L3 cache latency to triple. AMD says that the issue could cause 3–5 percent worse performance in most affected applications, while some games (AMD specifically calls out those “commonly used for eSports”) could see performance dips of 10–15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VEYO78"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Windows 11 review: a familiar home that’s still being renovated","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XMePzB"&gt;Windows 11 is also having issues with &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/15137/amd-clarifies-best-cores-vs-preferred-cores"&gt;AMD’s “preferred core” technology&lt;/a&gt;, which usually aims to shift threads over to the fastest core on a processor. AMD warns that users could see performance issues on CPU-reliant tasks, specifically on processors with more than eight cores about 65W TDP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GoIou"&gt;AMD and Microsoft have already confirmed that they are “actively investigating these known issues for resolution via software updates.” The two companies promise that both a Windows update and a software update are planned for later this month to try and resolve those issues. But in the meantime, you might want to stick with Windows 10 until AMD and Microsoft sort things out. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are a go-to pick that’s often on sale | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJnRvD"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. Both the AirPods and AirPods Pro are compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which isn’t always the case with even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best true wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;. The AirPods Max, the latest pair of headphones to join the AirPods lineup, are just as dependable, albeit at a higher price and larger size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3YqqO"&gt;Updated versions of the AirPods were a no-show at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22663255/apple-event-iphone-13-live-stream-watch-start-time"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 13 event&lt;/a&gt; last month, but Apple did recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22477167"&gt;roll out a firmware update&lt;/a&gt; to bring Conversation Boost to the AirPods Pro. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711557/apple-lost-airpods-pro-max-find-my-network-now-available"&gt;An earlier software update&lt;/a&gt; also expanded the Find My integration on the AirPods Pro and Max, allowing you to locate your misplaced headphones if they come within Bluetooth range of another Apple device (whether it’s yours or someone else's).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOVS4I"&gt;The absence of the third generation of AirPods might be a little disappointing, but if you’re in the market for a pair of AirPods right now, you can still find regular discounts on all the latest models. There are often sizable sales on the second-gen base AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on the AirPods, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max. We’ll also include options for the AirPods with wireless charging case, if that’s something you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VFDHZw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10742787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="KOD5bX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="ej2msf"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;The AirPods are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair with a one-size-fits-most design. They usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted. Right now, for instance, you can find Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods for $109 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747976896193620917" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with a wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard second-gen AirPods, save for one thing: their case can be charged via the included Lightning cable or a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charger to take advantage of this feature, but, thankfully, chargers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-PowerWave-Upgraded-Fast-Charging/dp/B07THHQMHM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s PowerWave pad&lt;/a&gt; are now relatively cheap. If you have no use for wireless charging, however, we recommend saving more and opting for the base AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but be on the lookout for deals that bring the price down to $150 or below. Right now, you can get them for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=vergeairpodsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or $160 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747977841356115870#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747977841356115870" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;est Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the models above and offer noise cancellation. They also come with swappable silicone tips and support Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; feature, which adds an immersive surround sound effect to select content. They also recently received a firmware update that added Conversation Boost, an accessibility feature for those who are hard of hearing. We think they’re the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy, regardless of the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ci8unb"&gt;Thankfully, the AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their asking price of $249, and sometimes drop to as low as $170. The lowest price you can grab a pair for right now is $179 at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D0%26%26adid%3D22222222227317608597%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D395477009936%26wl4%3Dpla-834433976587%26wl5%3D9061079%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D8175035%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D520468661%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwr56IBhAvEiwA1fuqGoJTvXd60Wil7w2NpRvHJQwNPXUkWno3r0nNI2Z3XwNpX4tSWE601RoCuScQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or for $200 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1122332/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro%2F-%2FA-54191101" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, wrapped in aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max have been discounted to under $450 at retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Simply Mac in the past, there are currently few sales that deep to speak of. The best price right now comes from &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/107530/1036?subId1=VergeAirpodsDeals100621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmgyl3ama.html%3Femailprice%3Dt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, where you can get a new pair of AirPods Max for $450. The Max are also currently available in all colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $489, which is their typical sale price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AirPods Pro can help you hear conversations better after recent firmware update</title>

      &lt;img alt="The AirPods Pro, the best wireless earbuds for people who use Apple products, pictured next to an iPhone 11 Pro Max and MacBook Pro." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hkpPUCWmztF0heVw-2NMB3zvH9U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69961291/cwelch_191031_3763_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJ7Qqt"&gt;Apple’s promised &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522951/apple-airpods-find-my-hearing-accesibility-notification-wwdc"&gt;Conversation Boost feature&lt;/a&gt; that uses the AirPods Pro to make it easier to hear people’s voices is available now (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/06/airpods-pro-conversation-boost/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Macrumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Support for the new feature was included as part of the same update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711557/apple-lost-airpods-pro-max-find-my-network-now-available"&gt;that made it easier to find AirPods Pro and AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; using the Find My app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4L5wQl"&gt;Conversation Boost is included as a Custom Transparency Mode in Apple’s headphone accommodations. When the feature is enabled, the beam-forming microphones on the AirPods Pro attempt to isolate voices above any background noise and other conversations. There’s also access to sliders to modify the amplification, transparency, and tone of what you hear.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KR7KtQvfreXLEFfxOVnQ8E1bHw4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22905796/Image__2_.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your AirPods Pro are running firmware 4A400, you can enable Conversation Boost as a Custom Transparency Mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Tzbc1L"&gt;You can enable the feature for yourself using the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ggBD3h"&gt;Open Settings and tap on Accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HKK6v1"&gt;Tap Audio / Visual under the Hearing section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="czhfTI"&gt;Toggle Headphone Accommodations to on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oHxsXT"&gt;Tap Transparency Mode and toggle it on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QljbqE"&gt;Scroll down to Conversation Boost and turn it on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="9trmDg"&gt;Conversation Boost requires AirPods Pro running firmware “4A400.” Unfortunately there’s still no manual way to force an update on your AirPods, AirPods Pro, or AirPods Max, but you can check if you're already running the new firmware in the Settings app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rmgVpD"&gt;Tap General, then About.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SGw2Lh"&gt;Find and tap on the AirPods connected to your device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vX39vK"&gt;Check the firmware number next to the field labeled Firmware Version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="iIAh2t"&gt;Conversation Boost is just the latest accessibility feature Apple has added to its devices in the last year. Earlier in May, the company revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444137/apple-accessibility-updates-disabilities-iphone-ipad-watch"&gt;a slew of new updates&lt;/a&gt;, including the ability for the Apple Watch to accept muscle movements as an input method, and support for third-party eye-tracking devices on the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
