    <title>Ford’s F-150 Lightning Pro is an electric pickup truck for businesses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1H4toINMEmiyi9YQDF88Ex6kbkk=/188x0:2213x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69332936/ford_f150_lightning_pro_0025.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G07eZ3"&gt;Ford has revealed a version of its new F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck aimed specifically at commercial customers. It’s called the F-150 Lightning Pro, and it starts at $39,974 for a version with an estimated 230 miles of range. Extended-range versions of the truck, which are expected to get 300 miles on a full battery, will start at $49,974.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2DCql"&gt;Much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;the retail version of the electric F-150&lt;/a&gt;, the Lightning Pro stands to win Ford a lot of business as long as the company executes well when the truck starts shipping in 2022. Fleets all over the country are already considering a switch to electric vehicles, either to get ahead of zero-emission guidelines at the state or federal level, or in an attempt to take advantage of what should be a lower total cost of ownership with electric vehicles. Ford claims the Lightning Pro could cut maintenance costs up to 40 percent over eight years and 100,000 miles of use compared to a 2.7L EcoBoost F-150.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CeaYJF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The F-150 Lightning Pro is one of the only electric trucks aimed at commercial customers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdpcPD"&gt;Multiple electric pickups are coming to market over the next year or two, including Tesla’s Cybertruck, the GMC Hummer EV, and the Rivian R1T. But almost none are geared specifically towards commercial fleets. One of the only examples is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302966/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-truck-ev-endurance-unveiling-pence"&gt;electric pickup truck being developed by Ohio startup Lordstown Motors&lt;/a&gt;. That truck is supposed to go into production later this year, but it will start at around $52,000, and the company doesn’t have anywhere near the track record of an established automaker like Ford. Paired with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21559954/ford-e-transit-electric-delivery-cargo-van-price-specs-range"&gt;the E-Transit van&lt;/a&gt;, the Lightning Pro gives Ford a potent one-two punch in the fight to electrify the commercial market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N987VR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10515280"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IIwun5"&gt;There aren’t a lot of obvious differences between the Lightning Pro and the retail versions of the electric F-150 that Ford revealed last week. Like the retail version, it only comes in a four-door SuperCrew cab and 5.5-foot bed configuration. Buyers can choose to equip the Lightning Pro with the standard or extended range battery. The standard range version will have a max 7,700-pound towing capacity when equipped with the optional towing package, while the extended range can pull up to 10,000 pounds. Both versions use a dual-motor, all-wheel drive setup, with the standard range truck maxing out at an estimated 426 horsepower, while the extended range version can make around 563HP.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="k1gzl6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ford F-150 Lightning revealed: an electric truck for the masses","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uH8g3T"&gt;Both Lightning Pro trucks have onboard power available, which can run electric tools or other accessories, though buyers will have to pay more for extra outlets (including a 240 volt plug in the bed) and higher total output. The extended range option also comes with an 80-amp charging station that can pretty much help refill a truck’s battery overnight. All versions of the commercial truck come with the massive, water-resistant front trunk, which has 14.1 cubic feet of storage and its own set of electrical outlets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTLb9C"&gt;There is one big difference between the commercial and retail versions, though: the Lightning Pro will come with Ford’s commercial telematics software, which makes it easier for fleet owners to keep tabs on the location, charging status, or health of their vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGkjC2"&gt;“It’s actually complimentary for customers, and it gives insights such as: what’s your odometer [at]? What warning lights and diagnostic trouble codes are there? And we’re going so far as to provide preventative and proactive prognostics,” says Alex Purdy, the head of connectivity on Ford’s business operations side. Purdy says Ford even offers a data service that works with any other third-party fleet telematics software businesses might already have up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="INPO5D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“there are unique challenges”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qivY2n"&gt;Ford’s fleet software will also help operators tackle some of the more unconventional issues that might crop up as they switch to electric vehicles. For instance, some workers take their fleet vehicles home at night, fill up the gas tank on their own, and get reimbursed by their employer. Ford could help install home chargers for those workers, Purdy says, but the company has also written into the fleet software a way to let employers reimburse workers for the cost of at-home charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kq2Cs"&gt;“These are the kinds of things that make Ford different,” Purdy says. “We say that we know how people use their vehicles, and it feels like a hollow thing — it’s not actually hollow in this case at all, because there are unique challenges with making an electric vehicle, relevant, useful, and adoptable by commercial customers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces bigger and smaller versions of its TV-like Smart Monitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jdq5m-75yjM2IaLkZaAyndfnnac=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69332653/Smart_Monitor_PR_main1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vLuDrb"&gt;Samsung’s Smart Monitor range is expanding. The company’s line of Tizen-powered smart computer displays &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-expands-smart-monitor-lineup-worldwide-to-meet-growing-demand-of-do-it-all-displays"&gt;now includes&lt;/a&gt; a 43-inch 4K M7 model as well as a 24-inch 1080p M5, marking the biggest and smallest Smart Monitors to be made available to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egIBP3"&gt;Samsung introduced the Smart Monitor last year and describes it as a “do-it-all” display designed for both work and entertainment. The screens have built-in speakers and smart TV functionality through Samsung’s Tizen platform, meaning you can run video apps like Netflix directly on the device, as well as remote desktop access and productivity software like Office 365. The Smart Monitors have a remote control that works with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Bixby, and there’s also wireless support for DeX, Samsung’s desktop-style environment that runs on Galaxy smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MCpkG2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung’s new Smart Monitor is like a TV for your PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/15/21562738/samsung-smart-monitor-m5-m7-tizen-smart-tv-airplay-2-usb-c-release-date-price-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JATagp"&gt;The M7 series now includes 43-inch and 32-inch 4K options. The M5 series uses 1080p panels and comes in 24-inch, 27-inch, and 32-inch sizes. Samsung is also introducing a white version of the 27-inch and 32-inch M5 Smart Monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXji3o"&gt;Samsung hasn’t announced pricing yet for the new models, but for context, the 32-inch M7 was released at $399.99 while the 27-inch M5 was $229.99, so you can probably expect prices slightly above and below those two extremes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook reportedly hit with campaign by pro-Palestinian activists leaving 1-star app store ratings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration Facebook, Inc. logo seen..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tbcxN_kZXw2OFymE7bzIv9W9j2s=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69331565/1233004792.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Iny5gO"&gt;A social media campaign by pro-Palestine activists has pushed down the ranking for Facebook’s app in Apple and Google’s app stores, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/pro-palestinian-activists-target-facebook-1-star-app-store-reviews-n1268258"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The activists are seeking to protest Facebook’s alleged censorship of Palestinian accounts on its platform, and are instructing people to leave Facebook’s app a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Skkyy__/status/1394588317900025858"&gt;one-star review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50MaNh"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;NBC New&lt;/em&gt;s, Facebook is treating the situation as a high-priority issue internally; one software engineer wrote in a post on an internal Facebook message board that “users are upset with our handling of the situation,” adding that the users “have started protesting by leaving 1-star reviews.”  Facebook has reached out to have the reviews removed, but so far, Apple has declined the request to remove the reviews. It’s not clear how or if Google responded to the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRbdQF"&gt;The rating for Facebook’s iOS app on the App Store as of Sunday afternoon was 2.3 stars out of 5, with 1-star ratings far outpacing others. In the Google Play store the situation was similar; the Android Facebook app had a slightly higher 2.4 rating, with the majority of the reviews 1-star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvjnPi"&gt;Apple and Google did not immediately reply to requests for comment Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4ezoe"&gt;Facebook did not reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but a spokesperson said in a statement to&lt;em&gt; NBC&lt;/em&gt; that the company does not censor it users, but applies its policies equally “regardless of who is posting or their personal beliefs.” The spokesperson added that the company has a dedicated team that includes Arabic and Hebrew speakers who are “closely monitoring the situation on the ground, who are focused on making sure we’re removing harmful content, while addressing any enforcement errors as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrUndz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvXQbz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Trese, Respect, Friends: The Reunion, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZoVXqVZmNzNXdvoIg5FHZ8sfhvs=/0x4:1358x909/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69331064/trese.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trese&lt;/em&gt; comes to Netflix in June | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUy0RgeggCQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=NetflixPhilippines" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Q7QtV"&gt;Still reeling from that shocking ending to last week’s &lt;em&gt;Mare of Easttown&lt;/em&gt;? Me too! I have literally no idea what to expect in tonight’s episode or from next week’s finale. I can’t say the same for &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead,&lt;/em&gt; a movie I really, really wanted to like but which felt really predictable. I found myself wishing the entire movie could have been as wild as its opening credits. &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; looks spectacular (except perhaps for the digitally-added Tig Notaro character), but could have done away with a few of the rag-tag mercenary characters and tightened things up a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e9QyiE"&gt;Here are this week’s trailers: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R8iD42"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jUy0RgeggCQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lCpj1c"&gt;Trese&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pRJFzO"&gt;This long-awaited adaptation of the award-winning Filipino comic of the same name, &lt;em&gt;Trese&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a woman who protects Manila from monsters that are based on Filipino mythology. In the English-language version, Shay Mitchell stars as Trese (Liza Soberano voices her in the Filipino-language version), along with Griffin Puatu, Manny Jacinto, Lou Diamond Phillips, and Dante Basco. &lt;em&gt;Trese &lt;/em&gt;comes to Netflix in the US on June 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SJgHCs"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qTtxoz3OIlU?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=3&amp;amp;start=3" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AI3VjS"&gt;Respect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="sAtLhj"&gt;Jennifer Hudson stars in this biopic of the late Aretha Franklin and looks at the Queen of Soul’s early years as her star was on the rise. Naturally, it looks and sounds amazing. Forest Whitaker and Audra McDonald also star in &lt;em&gt;Respect&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ThBOqg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUpFzScK7P8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nGO7t9"&gt;The Mysterious Benedict Society &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7XYxKb"&gt;Four gifted orphans are recruited for a secret mission by Mr. Benedict to figure out what’s behind the mysterious LIVE Institute. This series is based on the book series by Trenton Lee Stewart, with Tony Hale starring as Benedict and his shady twin brother Mr. Curtain. Kristen Schaal also stars in &lt;em&gt;The Mysterious Benedict Society&lt;/em&gt;, which premieres on Disney Plus June 25th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3yY1jJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRXVQ77ehRQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YwwePC"&gt;Friends: The Reunion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cGv7eG"&gt;This trailer does not make me want to watch this reunion, but I was already leaning in that direction anyway.&lt;em&gt; Friends &lt;/em&gt;was, of course, wildly popular in its decade-long run on network television, and is a popular show on streaming as well. But I’m far from the first person to point out that this is not a show that aged well— in addition to the conspicuous lack of non-white characters throughout most of the show’s run, it had &lt;a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/09/04/fat-monica-friends-25-years-later/"&gt;ongoing fatphobic storylines&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.out.com/television/2019/10/01/heres-your-reminder-friends-was-really-really-homophobic"&gt;homophobic&lt;/a&gt; jokes and storylines as well (and also for the love of god, who cares whether you were “on a break,” Ross: you were in the wrong, the end). If the reunion would deal with and discuss some of &lt;em&gt;Friends’ &lt;/em&gt;more problematic elements, that might be interesting to watch. But the trailer makes no indication this will be the case;  rather it looks like it will include a lot of obsequious questions for the cast members from James Corden (?). The &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; reunion comes to HBO Max on May 27th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SXBY5i"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zG9RuJb3QU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MzKv8c"&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7aDonQ"&gt;We got a glimpse of this movie with a teaser a couple of weeks ago but this is the first full-length trailer for &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt;, a post-apocalyptic fairytale based on a DC comic, with a hybrid deer-boy seeking answers about other hybrid children like him. I’m into it. &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; comes to Netflix June 4th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The needless drama of buying a PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-SKPnBNhfD9hT9qezauEBfTzDeo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69330601/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="STXeel"&gt;Securing a PS5 is not easy, and it feels like it could be. With a combination of greed and incompetence, the stores selling PS5s in the United States have transformed the process into a weirdly dramatic affair where you’re forced to join Discords and follow overly exuberant guys on Twitter in the hopes that they’ll give you a heads-up on a PS5 “drop” — a store making a big shipment of PS5s available for purchase. These stores have turned every drop into an event, when really, buying a PS5 should be as easy as buying a pepper grinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAccHq"&gt;The other day, a package was sitting in the vestibule of my apartment building. I noticed my name on the label and mentally cataloged any recent purchases I may have made or packages someone mentioned sending. This didn’t match anything I was expecting, and I brought it upstairs, carefully opened the box... and found &lt;a href="https://mannkitchen.com/blogs/blog/what-makes-the-worlds-best-pepper-mill-the-worlds-best-pepper-mill"&gt;the pepper grinder I’d Kickstarted back in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. It began shipping months before, and my name had finally popped to the top of the queue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oTS7ZT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I have gotten extremely good at Recaptcha&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4CBFt"&gt;Buying a PS5 feels like trying to enter a supremely pricey raffle, securing a COVID vaccine slot in March 2021, or getting tickets to a &lt;em&gt;Serenity&lt;/em&gt; preview in 2005 before we knew Joss Whedon was an awful human and Browncoats were insufferable. Every time a PS5 “drop” is imminent, my blood pressure rises to the occasion, trying to prepare me for a Sisyphean “Add to Cart — slog through a Recaptcha — watch the PS5 leave my cart” process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4BDr1"&gt;Again and again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvVzOT"&gt;I have gotten extremely good at Recaptcha. (I only learned Thursday that my ad-blocker may be responsible for my prolonged experience with Recaptcha and that I should white list any site I’m trying to buy a PS5 from.) I can spot the smudgiest bus and the most hidden car with ease. I can now safely tell you that it’s okay to not click on the one tiny bit of the bicycle in a lonely square but to not ignore things that look like a crosswalk but aren’t because Recaptcha’s database is different from the database you call a brain and cares not for logic but only for your furious clicks of things it approximates are other things. Recaptcha was created to teach computers to see, and I am confident that when a nuclear murder robot one day tracks me down in the midst of a crowd to forcefully shuffle off my mortal coil, I will have trained the damn thing with Recaptcha clicks to buy a PS5 that I still do not own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJbeO0"&gt;I didn’t take part in the initial rush to buy Sony’s next-generation console. I already had an Xbox Series X and told myself I’d get a PS5 when the furor had died down and an exclusive I was interested in was closer to launching. I’m old enough now that lining up for hours outside Walmart or Best Buy has lost any romance it once had. I like to think I am an adult and can patiently wait to buy the thing when it does not involve Black Friday rushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mthcuh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A whole weird sub-economy has sprung up around the PS5&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uOnzvu"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&lt;/em&gt; is out in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5la9WX"&gt;Six months in, the furor to buy a PS5 has not died down. Thanks to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;semiconductor shortage&lt;/a&gt; affecting everything from laptops to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423479/semiconductor-shortage-new-car-truck-prices-sales"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt;, the PS5 supply has not been able to meet demand. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428322/sony-ps5-supply-constraints-2022-hiroki-totoki"&gt;Sony admitted the delay would last well into 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nAovp"&gt;If a PS5 were like my pepper grinder, video game preorders at GameStop, or most things at mom-and-pop stores, then I would simply put my name on a list at a retailer, put some money down, and patiently wait for my name to appear in the queue and then the PS5 on my doorstep. But that isn’t what has happened. Instead, a whole weird sub-economy has sprung up around the PS5 and other products affected by the semiconductor shortage, like the Xbox Series X, AMD’s entire new lineup of GPUs and CPUs, and Nvidia’s newest GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nW0GGV"&gt;Sites, including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, have gotten very good at pointing readers to restocks that become obsolete minutes after the drops go live. Personalities on Twitter have developed whole brands around restocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EU1Cal"&gt;Retailers have put labyrinthine mechanisms in place in an attempt to discourage scalpers who resell the products for hundreds more. In practice, scalpers still seem to have no issue stocking up, while typical consumers are left feeling like they’ve entered a lottery and the prize is spending hundreds of dollars. Enterprising programmers have attempted to halt scalpers in other ways, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-nvidia-rtx-3080-ebay-debacle-exposed-a-scalper-bot-1845133050"&gt;such as overbidding on products on eBay&lt;/a&gt;, but for the most part, people are in a race with other people who just want to try out &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; and a guy who wants to try to sell a PS5 for $500 more on eBay or StockX. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yq0rLy"&gt;NewEgg’s solution has been to transform buying a PS5 into an actual raffle. Newegg periodically announces free drawings. The prize? You get to buy a PS5! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="In8PIq"&gt;Best Buy and Target’s apparent method to halt scalpers is to force you to wait between the first and second click to add the item to your cart and then require you to pick up the PS5 in person. Given I live in New York City, where one walks everywhere, I have been okay with losing out on these PS5s, as I assume it also means missing out on being robbed as walk home with a giant PS5 box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="l7aZYm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Retailers have put labyrinthine mechanisms in place in an attempt to discourage scalpers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="36VZqa"&gt;Walmart and GameStop both ship you the actual device. That’s perfect! However, both are inconsistent with drops, and GameStop forces you to pad your purchase with gift certificates and games you probably don’t want. Worse, neither company has updated its website since, I think, HTML became the primary language of websites. After many Recaptchas, I got a PS5 into my cart at both stores, only to lose them when the checkout process ground to a crawl.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dr1var"&gt;Sony will sell you a PS5 directly but uses a randomized queue similar to the one San Diego Comic-Con relies on to book hotels. You can use as many computers as you like to sit in the queue (and you will be forced into a few Recaptcha processes along the way). But unlike the others, if you get in, you actually get in. No elation over getting a PS5 in your cart only to experience the extremely stupid but very real annoyance of losing it because they’re sold out in your area or the Waltons’ billion-dollar empire can’t handle a few thousand people trying to check out at once. You’re in. You get a PS5. You have to pay shipping because Sony only offers free shipping on purchases over $510. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpmxYU"&gt;And this awful and overly dramatic way of doing business isn’t going away anytime soon. The semiconductor shortage means there will be plenty of must-buy gadgets in short supply and the companies with barely functional webpages have feverish consumers in need of the next new thing over a barrel. They can make us jump through hoops just for the chance — the mere chance — of buying something because they have the supply and we all have the demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aw2G3X"&gt;My PS5 apparently ships from Sony next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P28pPw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G UW review: extreme durability for an extreme price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A pricey phone built to withstand the elements&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="RqQfv2"&gt;The Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G is a rugged phone that doesn’t require you to give up too many modern conveniences to gain the benefits of extreme durability. It’s common for rugged phones to feature older processors and lack modern features — these phones often have specialized uses, like barcode scanning or taking payments, and more or less just need to keep working in harsh environments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgtCHM"&gt;The DuraForce Ultra 5G includes both the durability of a rugged phone and modern features like 5G, wireless charging, a high-quality processor, and dual rear cameras. At $899, it’s an expensive phone — you can buy a very nice non-rugged phone for that much — but if durability is a must and you don’t want to sacrifice performance or convenient features, the DuraForce 5G is (quite literally) a solid choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EUeitz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10511069"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LCwS5H0Rr6eSgsG4CWaocFtUhG8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526443/ajohnson_20210514_4587_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W7VFuv"&gt;Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G rugged features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bgM0jd"&gt;Pick up the DuraForce Ultra 5G and you’ll know right away that you have a rugged device in your hands. The top and bottom of the phone are wrapped in thick plastic bumpers, the sides feature a texturized finish, and at 278g (9.8oz) it’s much heavier than your standard smartphone. The screen itself isn’t very big — just a 5.45-inch 1080p LCD panel — but the sizable bezels and thick chin make it a chunky device overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdguzi"&gt;Despite its dimensions it’s actually easy to use one-handed, since the screen itself is relatively small. The phone will fit in a jacket pocket, but it’s too bulky for any of my jeans pockets. Haptics are aggressive, even at the “medium” default setting, which is a good thing in a phone you might be using with gloves. Otherwise, you can turn touch vibrations down to low or off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKFwdX"&gt;The phone is both IP65 and IP68 rated, meaning there’s generous protection against water intrusion both from jets and immersion (up to 6.5 feet for up to 30 minutes). The DuraForce Ultra 5G meets the Military Standard 810H specifications and includes protection against vibration, blowing dust and sand, extreme temperatures, drops from five feet onto concrete, high altitudes, and plenty of other hostile conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6wpa1D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Aside from some minor scuffs acquired in the driveway test, the DuraForce Ultra 5G merely shrugged at my efforts and kept on working just fine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hJWRm2"&gt;I couldn’t test it against all of those conditions, but I did subject the phone to plenty of abuse including an hourlong stay in the freezer, water immersion for 30 minutes in the kitchen sink, exposure to sand, and a drop from about five feet onto driveway asphalt. Aside from some minor scuffs acquired in the driveway test, the DuraForce Ultra 5G merely shrugged at my efforts and kept on working just fine. Kyocera does include a two-year warranty with purchase, so as long as you use the phone within the conditions it’s rated to withstand, you shouldn’t be putting your purchase at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpGg8x"&gt;In addition to rugged features, the DuraForce Ultra 5G is just loaded with buttons. There’s a power button with embedded fingerprint sensor, three programmable keys, and a large volume rocker that’s easy to press with gloves on. I frequently pressed one of the programmable buttons accidentally when I grabbed the phone — they’re in easy reach when you’re using the phone, but that unfortunately means a lot of unintentional presses, too. These buttons do require a long press to bring up whatever shortcut function you’ve assigned to them, so a brief press won’t do anything. You can also assign any of them to “do nothing” when pressed if you’d rather not use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FLffBgLPWI_Llf-npqmIGqOt0UY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526445/ajohnson_20210514_4587_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GXpg0z"&gt;Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G screen, performance, and battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="E8kAww"&gt;Aside from the obvious difference in appearance and ergonomics, the DuraForce Ultra 5G handles pretty much the way any other Android device does. The screen looks a little low on contrast in comparison to your standard display — likely because the panel is optimized for viewability in bright sunlight. That’s probably more important to the phone’s target user than a rich multimedia viewing experience, and the panel is indeed usable even in very bright direct light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sccb8"&gt;The screen’s protective “Sapphire Shield” remained free of scratches during my testing, but it does pick up reflections easily outside, more so than other phones with Gorilla Glass. It wasn’t enough to bother me, but someone planning to use the phone outside in bright light often might find it distracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l13Zen"&gt;The DuraForce Ultra 5G ships with Android 10; Kyocera says it will provide an update to 11, but that the timeframe is still being determined. Android 10 is fine for now, but given that Google is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;readying Android 12 for the public&lt;/a&gt;, it’s definitely a step behind. Kyocera says it will provide a minimum of two years of security updates, which is a common if not terribly generous policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EKwQAE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This model works with both widely available sub-6GHz frequencies and hard-to-find but much faster mmWave spectrum&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HPDPTP"&gt;The DuraForce Ultra 5G uses a Snapdragon 765G processor with 6GB RAM, which puts overall performance on par with a midrange phone. There’s some slight stuttering when scrolling quickly through screens with lots of images and video, and a noticeable pause after taking a photo in the camera app, but other than that it keeps up well — especially considering the lower performance bar in the rugged class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mjmbC"&gt;There’s a 4,500mAh battery built into the DuraForce Ultra 5G. It’s a comparatively large battery for the class, and it got me through a full day of moderate to heavy use. The phone supports Qi wireless charging, which is uncommon among rugged phones. The phone was a little finicky on my stand-style Belkin wireless charger, but it eventually worked when set on the charger in landscape orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrNjuL"&gt;And of course, there’s one of the DuraForce Ultra 5G’s namesake features: 5G. This model works with both widely available sub-6GHz frequencies and hard-to-find but much faster mmWave spectrum (also called Ultra Wideband by Verizon, hence the UW in the phone’s name). It’s only sold through Verizon in the US, which makes sense: the company has been pushing mmWave much harder than the other major carriers and does offer more coverage, though it’s still relatively scarce. Verizon’s 5G network is kind of lackluster overall at this point, though it will improve over the next couple of years. It’s a good feature to have on a phone you’re going to hang onto for a while, but definitely don’t buy this (or any phone, really) just for mmWave since you’ll probably have a hard time finding a signal anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9K8_BvBox1IIgUPqGHpe6gIS1iE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526441/ajohnson_20210514_4587_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SstD0A"&gt;Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nEfbUr"&gt;The DuraForce Ultra’s rear camera array consists of a 24-megapixel f/1.8 standard wide and a 16-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide, plus a time-of-flight sensor. Around front, there’s an 8-megapixel f/2.0 selfie camera. That’s a cut above what’s offered on many rugged phones. Picture-taking likely isn’t a high priority for prospective DuraForce Ultra owners, and image quality is certainly not up to what you’d find on conventional $900 phones, but it does the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SUrxOC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10511127"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HkQEvB"&gt;Photos in good light look fine, if a bit on the low-contrast, washed-out side. Exposure and color can shift noticeably between two images taken with the same camera at slightly different angles, and I noticed some odd misses here and there, like a blurry shot of a static subject where it looked like the camera had tried to apply too much HDR. But most of the time in bright light, photos are perfectly fine, and a cut above what I’d expect from a rugged phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPE5GH"&gt;There’s also a mode that will overlay live information on your still image or video about whatever extreme situation you happen to be in, including location, altitude, speed, and G-force. Extreme activities are generally not recommended in your second trimester of pregnancy, so I didn’t really test this out. I imagine if you’re into something like mountain biking or climbing and you want to record that kind of information with your activity, you probably have a better way of doing so already. In any case, it’s there, and it’s definitely more of a casual, fun feature than it is practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RdoMQqBzgM7hSRn2TD79gBmGDB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526440/ajohnson_20210514_4587_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="lwm3nQ"&gt;If you’re merely curious about living a rugged phone lifestyle, the DuraForce Ultra 5G isn’t for you. The phone’s extremely hardy specifications would be appealing to anyone who’s nervous about dropping their phone or occasionally brings their phone to rough environments like beaches or backcountry camping. If that’s you, spend your $900 on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"&gt;good standard phone&lt;/a&gt; (many are IP68 rated) and a rugged case. You’ll get better performance, a better camera, timelier software updates — basically, a lot more for the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uGUklv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The inclusion of 5G, wireless charging, and processing power that’s a cut above the rest of the class makes it a good tool on and off the job site&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jansg3"&gt;If you need a rugged phone on the job as a frontline worker, first responder, or construction worker, for example, then the DuraForce Ultra 5G makes a lot more sense — especially if it’s going to be your primary phone off the job and you’d really like some extra bells and whistles. The inclusion of 5G, wireless charging, and processing power that’s a cut above the rest of the class makes it a good tool on and off the job site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gd8RS"&gt;However, $900 is an awful lot to spend on a phone, and I think that very specific kind of customer for this phone is a pretty small group. You could buy a less expensive rugged phone with more limited functionality like &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/kyocera-duraforce-pro-2/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kyocera’s own DuraForce model from last year&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;darn good midrange phone&lt;/a&gt; for around the same price. You probably can’t get mmWave 5G that way, but that’s no great loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Z3Jnx3"&gt;Still, the DuraForce Ultra 5G represents a convenient option for a particular type of person if two phones feels like too much fuss. It certainly handled everything I threw it at, and functioned well as a daily companion for more pedestrian tasks like scrolling social media and navigating trips across town. If extreme durability is a must and you don’t want to give up too much to get it, then the DuraForce Ultra 5G is a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>India reportedly orders social media platforms to remove references to “Indian variant” of COVID-19</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5BMn9lPARBgY5gDIk6xrT_r6ck8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69330457/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K1T2Ap"&gt;India’s government has sent notices to social media platforms ordering them to take down content that refers to an “Indian variant” of the COVID-19 virus, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/india-asks-social-media-firms-remove-reference-indian-variant-coronavirus-2021-05-21/"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; reported. The letter from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology sent Friday was not made public, but was viewed by several news outlets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRXYW2"&gt;It was not clear which social media outlets received the letter, but India’s government has recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;ordered Twitter to remove tweets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/27/991343032/indias-government-is-telling-facebook-twitter-to-remove-critical-posts"&gt;Facebook and Instagram to take down posts&lt;/a&gt; that were critical of its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SBhjF"&gt;“There is no such variant of COVID-19 scientifically cited as such by the World Health Organisation (WHO). WHO has not associated the term ‘Indian Variant’ with the B.1.617 variant of the coronavirus in any of its reports,” the letter states, adding that the phrase is “completely FALSE.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yd9Blk"&gt;A variant of the coronavirus first detected in India last year, B.1.617 is believed responsible for the latest wave of COVID-19 cases in south Asia. &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/who-classifies-b1617-variant-first-identified-in-india-as-global-variant-of-concern-1.6020830"&gt;The World Health Organization has classified it&lt;/a&gt; as a variant of global concern, with some evidence that it is more contagious than other strains of the virus.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exJGOr"&gt;But while India’s approach to censoring information about the coronavirus and variants is extreme, WHO and other health organizations and scientists are critical of the practice of referring to viruses and variants with geographic nicknames, since it can be stigmatizing and inaccurate. The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/08-05-2015-who-issues-best-practices-for-naming-new-human-infectious-diseases"&gt;WHO’s 2015 guidance&lt;/a&gt; for naming infectious diseases discourages using place names, human names, or animal species names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0zRVZ"&gt;However, as &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/how-virus-variants-get-their-confusing-names-and-how-to-make-them-better"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt; notes in its very good explainer&lt;/a&gt; about how virus variants get their names, the current naming conventions are cumbersome and confusing, making them difficult for non-scientists to grasp or remember. &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt; reports that WHO is working with virologists to create a new way of naming viruses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJHeno"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZNgb0W"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/8/14546312/lg-watch-sport-style-review-android-wear-2-smartwatch"&gt;Once again&lt;/a&gt;, Google is hitting the reset button, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;combining with Samsung’s Tizen wearable operating system&lt;/a&gt; for a new wearable OS, tentatively called “Wear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohGKGe"&gt;The company is throwing in the towel on Wear OS. It’s trying yet again, this time with Samsung’s Tizen OS helping to fill in the gaps that Google, for whatever reason, can’t. It’s theoretically good news for Android owners interested in a decent smartwatch — but one that’s damning of Google’s lackluster efforts in the smartwatch space to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="f0Zc37"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"11 things we know about the new smartwatch OS from Google and Samsung — and some we don’t","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443809/google-samsung-wear-os-tizen-things-we-know"},{"title":"Google and Samsung are merging Wear OS and Tizen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7nyCDt"&gt;In the years since Google first introduced Wear OS (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/15/17124448/google-wear-os-announced-android-wear-rebranding-smartwatch"&gt;neé Android Wear&lt;/a&gt;), there’s never been a truly good Android-powered smartwatch. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368752/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Samsung’s Tizen-powered watches&lt;/a&gt; have been the best option for years, but they’re ultimately &lt;em&gt;Samsung&lt;/em&gt; watches. They still work best with Samsung phones, and while they’re good enough with other Android devices, there’s the friction of extra helper apps that need to be installed to get them to work. A seamless experience, it is not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPgJVZ"&gt;It’s obvious why Google would want the benefits of battery life, app support, and performance that Samsung has cultivated over the past few years; but it’s harder to understand why Google hasn’t managed to build any of this itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqgw4D"&gt;Google is the creator of Android, one of the quintessential software development companies of the modern era, the brains behind the common component for over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440813/android-devices-active-number-smartphones-google-2021"&gt;three billion smartphones&lt;/a&gt; around the world. Its resources are practically limitless, and it’s made some serious investments in smartwatch and wearables computing over the years: $40 million on some of Fossil’s secret wearable technologies in 2019, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943318/google-fitbit-acquisition-fitness-tracker-announcement"&gt;recent $2.1 &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; to buy Fitbit&lt;/a&gt;. (That’s not even counting the rest of Google’s hardware team, which includes its $1.1 billion for the HTC’s smartphone design team, and the existing Pixel hardware group.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9PFEnutS4QYAybQWvveb1XzMCIA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21900540/20200919FitbitSense4.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Brent Rose for The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N4cyPw"&gt;Yet, despite all that hardware, software, and engineering prowess, Google has utterly failed to get its smartwatch platform from being anything other than a curiosity. Part of that can be blamed on the poor silicon support — Qualcomm’s Wear OS-powering Snapdragon chips saw a years-long drought before last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307368/qualcomm-snapdragon-4100-google-wear-os-smartwatch-wearables-faster-battery-life"&gt;Snapdragon 4100 was launched&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/05/12/in-a-year-we-got-exactly-1-snapdragon-wear-4100-watch/"&gt;Exactly &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; Snapdragon 4100 watch&lt;/a&gt; has been launched. Google’s software updates to Wear OS in the past year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423707/google-wear-os-gboard-swipe-type"&gt;have been tiny, lackluster features&lt;/a&gt;. And there’s still no Pixel-esque reference device to show developers the platonic ideal, although that’s not exactly for lack of trying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Srqg91"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20872740/google-pixel-smartwatch-flagship-why-it-failed-wear-os"&gt;reportedly had&lt;/a&gt; a Pixel watch in the works at one point, but axed the concept over fears of bringing down Google’s burgeoning hardware ecosystem and software issues. The company also (wisely) chose to not attach its name to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/8/14546312/lg-watch-sport-style-review-android-wear-2-smartwatch"&gt;LG’s lackluster watches in 2017&lt;/a&gt; either, and the brand has largely languished in obscurity since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJC5zC"&gt;Pixel devices occupy an outsized place in the smartphone world because of what they represent: Google’s pure, unadulterated vision for what Android could be, a place for other manufacturers of more popular phones to aspire to. The same could apply to watches if Google had any inclination to actually try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tVeiML"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google almost had a Pixel smartwatch — here’s why it reportedly failed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20872740/google-pixel-smartwatch-flagship-why-it-failed-wear-os"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="v4c6bh"&gt;But for the past few years, there’s been no cohesive vision for what Wear OS should be; Google hasn’t offered one. And by the looks of the recent Samsung partnership, it’s choosing to punt on the issue entirely, handing off the business of imagining the future of Android wearables to one of its partners instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4LCbu"&gt;Samsung &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/25/5842804/this-is-the-gear-live-samsungs-199-android-wear-smartwatch"&gt;offer an Android Wear watch&lt;/a&gt;, until it jumped ship for its own Tizen platform. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380322/oneplus-watch-review-price-specs-features"&gt;OnePlus’ recent smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; also skips Wear OS entirely. You have to have screwed up &lt;em&gt;badly&lt;/em&gt; to get partners to forgo the deep built-in integration and the wealth of apps on the Play Store, but Google has managed to accomplish it with Wear OS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jOzkXE"&gt;Maybe the Tizen-hybrid Wear will fix that. It’s certainly a win for Samsung, the hero that gets to provide the essential backbone for Google’s third-act of wearable hardware while reaping the benefits of the massive Android developer community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQoasz"&gt;And Google does get some big benefits here. There’s one fewer competitor for its future smartwatch platform (something that there were already relatively few of outside of Apple after Google bought Fitbit.) And there’s also the potential of gaining Samsung’s semiconductor expertise for future smartwatch chips, which would certainly help with the Qualcomm issues that the company has had in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6urjUA"&gt;But Google hasn’t shown yet that it’ll handle the next phase of its wearables any better than the first two. And it’s a concerning start that a company that’s best known for leading on software innovation had to go and outsource its next wearable operating system to Samsung instead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned about the band making a giant marble-based instrument</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YZdxfCQt9UM2I1F3rHBvUSNuowQ=/57x0:1737x1120/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69330324/Screen_Shot_2021_05_21_at_3.10.54_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This machine plays marbles.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Wintergatan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eURomX"&gt;Swedish band Wintergatan may be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/2/11147884/marble-machine-music-wintergartan-martin-molin"&gt;widely known for its Marble Machine music video&lt;/a&gt; (which featured a machine dropping marbles to play drums, a bass, and other instruments), but today I learned that they’re building a bigger, better version, and documenting the entire process on YouTube. It’s called the Marble Machine X, and it’s driven by a motor instead of a hand crank, is being built by an entire team of people, and, hopefully will be able to go on tour and be played on stage when it’s finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXIhmY"&gt;Wintergartan also produced a build log of the first machine, but this new project is way grander in scope, offering a deeper look at the creative process that leads to... well, building a massive musical instrument that uses marbles. The band put out eight build videos for the original machine before it released its debut music video — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLLYkE3G1HED6rW-bkliHbMroHYFf4ukv"&gt;the build log for the Marble Machine X&lt;/a&gt; is at 161 videos and counting. (If you were looking for something to do this weekend, that’s quite a backlog of delightfully nerdy content to fill your time with!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBcKRq"&gt;It also turns out that, when you’re building a machine made to sling marbles to make tunes, almost every part of that process is interesting. The music nerd in me squealed in delight when Martin Molin, the band member that’s working with a team to build the machine, showed off &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ygofdm9JB3g"&gt;the 28-audio channel cable&lt;/a&gt; they’re using to keep the machine looking clean and wire-free. There’s also the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ygofdm9JB3g"&gt;fascinating video that first got me hooked&lt;/a&gt;, where he shows off an immaculately-crafted wood piece that sorts marbles equally into four tracks. Or, rather, the piece of wood that doesn’t do that job properly, which is why he’s now designing a replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IvTXF7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ygofdm9JB3g?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eyNi5X"&gt;The videos aren’t exactly obscure: Wintergatan has over 2.2 million subscribers on YouTube, and some of the videos about the Marble Machine X have close to that number of views. But somehow I, someone who routinely watches videos about people building &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYLBjScgb7o"&gt;weird, awesome instruments&lt;/a&gt;, had just missed it until now, so I figured I’d share the joy in case the YouTube algorithm had also kept this hidden from you. I can’t wait to hear Wintergatan fully turn the thing on, and do an epic remaster of the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvUU8joBb1Q"&gt;original Marble Machine song&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virgin Galactic spaceplane VSS Unity completes successful flight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-0tWf1S05usIHuajcpWyk4wKcEE=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69328384/Unity21___VSS_Unity_in_space_over_New_Mexico.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;VSS Unity in space over New Mexico on May 22nd. | Virgin Galactic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QbGNaU"&gt;Richard Branson’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Virgin Galactic completed its first successful space flight in more than two years on Saturday, with its crewed VSS Unity spacecraft carried to an altitude of more than 44,000 feet before gliding safely back to Earth. It marked the first spaceflight from New Mexico, making it the third US state to launch humans into space. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_New_Mexico"&gt;The Zia sun symbol&lt;/a&gt; of New Mexico’s state flag was displayed on the outside of the ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJfZWr"&gt;Virgin’s VMS Eve carrier aircraft took off from Spaceport America in New Mexico at about 10:35AM ET with Unity aboard. About 10 minutes before its release, Unity switched to its own battery power, and conducted flight control and electrical checks. Once released by Eve, Unity’s pilots C.J. Sturckow and Dave Mackay ignited the rocket motor, then shut it down a few minutes later, with the spacecraft’s momentum keeping it traveling toward its apogee, or highest point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyKm2o"&gt;Unity reached a speed of Mach 3 after it was released from Eve, and reached space at an altitude of 55.45 miles.  It reached apogee at about 11:30AM ET, did a slow turn, then glided back into Earth’s atmosphere, landing at about 11:43 AM ET on the same Spaceport America runway where its flight began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="me7nHP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today’s view: Infinite. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Unity21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Unity21&lt;/a&gt; made a beautiful ascent to apogee over Spaceport America, New Mexico. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VirginGalactic?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#VirginGalactic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/jphjbMbSr2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jphjbMbSr2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Virgin Galactic (@virgingalactic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/virgingalactic/status/1396166206604914689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0MX6rI"&gt;“It was picture perfect,” Virgin Galactic CEO Michael Colglazier told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a phone interview Saturday after Unity and Eve were back on the ground. “We’re gonna go through the data deeply and thoroughly as we always do.” In a statement, Colglazier called the flight a “major step forward for both Virgin Galactic and human spaceflight in New Mexico,” which had never hosted a crewed test mission to space until today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9GkWA"&gt;“You’ve never seen a mix of more proud parent engineers,” Colglazier said of Virgin Galactic’s engineering team. Dozens of company employees gathered to watch the test flight under clear blue skies at Spaceport America, the company’s HQ for future commercial missions. Champagne was popped to celebrate the craft’s landing and Branson, the company’s billionaire founder, was “electrified” to see it all play out, Colglazier said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oY3VoQ"&gt;Saturday’s flight, which also carried research payloads for NASA’s Flight Opportunities program, is the latest step toward Virgin Galactic’s goal of a space tourism program. The company has some 600 reservations for tickets on future space flights, which go for around $250,000 each. Unity is able to carry up to six passengers and two pilots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GRYU5"&gt;It was Virgin Galactic’s first space flight since 2019, and the third one it’s completed. Unity’s first two flights, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18138279/virgin-galactic-vss-unity-spaceshiptwo-space-tourism"&gt;in late 2018&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18232354/virgin-galactic-vss-unity-spaceplane-test-spaceflight-passenger-beth-moses"&gt;early 2019&lt;/a&gt;, were conducted at the company’s test facility at the Mojave Air and Spaceport out of California. Virgin Galactic later moved its operations to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21035125/virgin-galactic-spaceport-america-truth-or-consequences-new-mexico"&gt;Spaceport America&lt;/a&gt;, where it plans to conduct all of its commercial tourist flights. The company had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/12/22171114/virgin-galactic-vss-unity-powered-test-flight-abort-spaceport-america-new-mexico"&gt;abort its first flight attempt&lt;/a&gt; at the new facility in December, after Unity’s engine cut out early ahead of its glide back to Earth due to what the company later said was electromagnetic interference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kagbfo"&gt;VSS Unity’s flight on Saturday featured some hardware upgrades installed since the December abort scenario, including a new digital controller that the pilots used for tighter handling. “This was our first run with it under full power, and it was flawless. Spot on,” Colglazier said. That controller will be used on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356889/virgin-galactic-unveils-new-spaceship-iii-three-3"&gt;SpaceShipThree&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s upgraded spacecraft tailored for routine production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxkVJf"&gt;Virgin Galactic said in February, and &lt;a href="https://s24.q4cdn.com/816362521/files/doc_financials/Quarterly/2021/q1/Virgin-Galactic_Q1-2021-Earnings-Slides_FINAL_5'10'21_12pm.pdf"&gt;confirmed during its May 10th earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, that it has a total of four spaceflights planned this year. The next one is slated to have two pilots and four Virgin Galactic employees as passengers, and a third flight is scheduled to have Virgin founder Richard Branson on board. Flight four is intended to be a commercial flight for the Italian Air Force, which should generate $2 million in revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFYuwb"&gt;Saturday’s flight was the &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/?newsId=97565"&gt;400th commercial space launch&lt;/a&gt; licensed by the FAA. The dates for the future Unity flights are still to be announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGpw3V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 22nd 2:17PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds details from Virgin Galactic about the flight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7DMeY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 22nd 5:51PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds interview with Virgin Galactic CEO and more details about Unity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
