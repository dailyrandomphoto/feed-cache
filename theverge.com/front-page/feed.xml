    <title>Workhorse is already redesigning its new electric van</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XoSL5igvsQYUXFIAPqbzArCiMf4=/0x36:1449x1002/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69699679/E3nZHe_XMAED9jF.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Workhorse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b49uNC"&gt;Ohio-based startup Workhorse says it has to redesign its flagship electric van to meet customer needs, after finally getting the vehicle into production this past quarter following years of struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6odI9m"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://ir.workhorse.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/178/workhorse-group-reports-second-quarter-2021-results"&gt;announced Monday morning&lt;/a&gt; that it needs to “revise the design [of] the vehicle” to increase the payload capacity, which has been reported to be &lt;a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/workhorse-ready-to-run-with-c-series-electric-delivery-van"&gt;around 6,000 pounds&lt;/a&gt;. The C-1000 van, as it’s called, has 1,000 cubic feet of cargo space. The company says the electric powertrain will remain untouched and that it will continue to deliver some C-1000s as they come off the line to customers who are fine with the van’s current capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mD4oLs"&gt;“We’re going to go through full vehicle design reviews down to the bill of materials with both our engineering team, and our purchasing team,” CEO Rick Dauch said on a call with investors. Dauch, who &lt;a href="https://ir.workhorse.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/176/workhorse-appoints-richard-f-dauch-as-chief-executive"&gt;only just joined Workhorse at the end of July&lt;/a&gt;, said the company knew about these “issues” with the C-1000 “long before I got here.” He promised to release a revamped product roadmap by November but said he “can’t commit to have all the design plans specifically buttoned down” by then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="m2XzHg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new CEO says the issues were known “long before” he came on board&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TT8J4E"&gt;Dauch, who came from automotive supplier Delphi, tried to calm any nerves by teasing a recent call with one of the company’s prospective customers, which he says wanted to place an order for 1,500 to 2,000 vans as is. “I said hold off for now, let’s get the designs right, let’s get our production right, and we’ll come back and tell you when we’re ready to actually make those orders,” he says he told the customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TRRIC"&gt;Dauch replaced prior CEO Duane Hughes as part of a series of shakeups in Workhorse’s executive ranks that came in the wake of the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297823/usps-postal-service-mail-truck-electric-oshkosh-workhorse"&gt;losing the bid to build the next-generation delivery vehicle&lt;/a&gt; for the United States Postal Service (USPS). That contract was awarded to defense manufacturer Oshkosh in February, though Workhorse is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557764/workhorse-complaint-oshkosh-usps-mail-truck-fight"&gt;currently challenging the decision in federal court&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L0zEsE"&gt;The decision to redesign the C-1000 van comes at a crucial moment for Workhorse. The startup has spent years trying to be the first to offer a fully electric delivery van and has drawn the attention of big-name customers like UPS and Ryder. But it has struggled to get the van (and its successor, a 650-cubic-foot variant) ready for production. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22423179/usps-mail-trucks-electric-oshkosh"&gt;as the USPS contest dragged on&lt;/a&gt;, it survived for a while on money borrowed from hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5usQOG"&gt;In early 2019, Workhorse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537225/gm-factory-workhorse-ev-electric-vehicle-startup-sale-trump-tweet"&gt;licensed the intellectual property for an electric pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; it had in development to a new startup called Lordstown Motors — which was founded by Hughes’ predecessor, Steve Burns. In exchange, Workhorse received a 10 percent stake in Lordstown Motors as well as millions of dollars in licensing fees and royalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2z76DE"&gt;Lordstown Motors went public in a merger with a special purpose acquisition company late last year, and the value of Workhorse’s stake briefly ballooned to around $330 million. But Burns &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327207/general-motors-lordstown-hindenburg-short-electric-truck-orders"&gt;has since been accused of faking and lying about the number of preorders&lt;/a&gt; for Lordstown Motors’ electric pickup truck and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;was ousted from the company&lt;/a&gt; in June. Lordstown Motors is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;now facing multiple federal investigations&lt;/a&gt; and has had to narrow the scope of its own plans to get into production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CtiQUx"&gt;With that in mind, Workhorse also announced Monday that it recently sold 72 percent of its stake in Lordstown Motors to add to its cash reserves. (The company finished the quarter with $156 million in the bank, though it has lost $183 million through the first half of 2021.) As Lordstown Motors’ stock price has dropped amid the startup’s struggles, Workhorse said the sale is only expected to net around $79 million. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf’s new trailer teases a ton of monster-hunting action</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XkgQoKI7XGRWqFZ8Rtx0_tHugP8=/207x0:2232x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69699662/Screen_Shot_2021_08_09_at_11.40.39_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cn9Of7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22602293/witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-anime-spinoff-netflix-interview"&gt;Netflix’s anime &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; spinoff film&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;em&gt;The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; — is almost here, and a new full-length trailer shows off a lot more of the epic monster fighting and charismatic heroics of its protagonist, Geralt’s mentor Vesemir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CY4Gwt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Witcher’s anime spinoff keeps the bathtub, but adds a fun-loving lead","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22602293/witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-anime-spinoff-netflix-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="SEuVYJ"&gt;The film is set before the events of the live-action series and will look to explain more about the Witcher’s world, including how the magically mutated monster hunters are created. It’ll also provide useful backstory on Vesemir, who’s set to appear in the upcoming second season of the show when it arrives this December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnCqZR"&gt;The new trailer for the anime spinoff also shows off a lot more of the expanded &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; universe, and some rather impressive-looking fight scenes and effects, the sorts of which would have been far harder to achieve in the live-action series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZtuvO"&gt;Kwang Il Han, director at Studio Mir, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22602293/witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-anime-spinoff-netflix-interview"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; one benefit of the animated format included allowing the witchers to carry &lt;a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Witcher_steel_swords"&gt;their iconic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Silver_sword"&gt;dual blades&lt;/a&gt;: “The actors had difficulty carrying multiple swords at the same time, because they were too heavy, so they were only carrying one sword at a time,” he says. “In the anime we don’t have those restrictions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zgazJY"&gt;The new trailer follows a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZANFe4zS-yk"&gt;shorter teaser&lt;/a&gt; released last month and comes just a few weeks before the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569957/the-witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-netflix-release-date-trailer"&gt;August 23rd debut&lt;/a&gt; of the animated film. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Midnight Mass is the next horror series from the mind behind Haunting of Hill House</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Midnight Mass" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-aAb3inL0QTbcXvn759u2_Dp6oQ=/281x0:3320x2026/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69699551/MMASS_102_Unit_04484RC.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Eike Schroter/Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sr4AU5"&gt;The mind behind one of Netflix’s most unsettling shows is back with a new series. &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; is a new seven-episode show from Mike Flanagan, perhaps best-known as the creator of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17911720/haunting-of-hill-house-review-netflix-shirley-jackson-mike-flanagan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Haunting of Hill House&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and its follow-up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21508362/haunting-of-bly-manor-review-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Haunting of Bly Manor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And while the new series — which stars the likes of Rahul Kohli, Zach Gilford, and Hamish Linklater — isn’t part of that anthology, the first trailer has some very similar, and creepy, vibes. Check it out above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvWeUV"&gt;Here’s the basic premise, from Netflix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="SX1Y32"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; tells the tale of a small, isolated island community whose existing divisions are amplified by the return of a disgraced young man (Zach Gilford) and the arrival of a charismatic priest (Hamish Linklater). When Father Paul’s appearance on Crockett Island coincides with unexplained and seemingly miraculous events, a renewed religious fervor takes hold of the community: but do these miracles come at a price?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VUMVIZ"&gt;The good news is that horror fans won’t have to wait all that long to binge Flanagan’s latest: &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; hits Netflix on September 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Harley-Davidson’s custom electric chopper is up for auction, and I must have it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-RUDh6ACTV9B0alApgXQy2n7Q48=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69699414/MOSH_CHOP_Left_Front.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2A6oEm"&gt;Serial 1, the electric bike company that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536726/harley-davidson-serial-1-electric-bike-ebike-specs-price"&gt;spun out from Harley-Davidson last year&lt;/a&gt;, is making one-of-a-kind, custom-built e-bikes and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.serial1.com%2Fproduct%2Fmosh-chopper%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F9%2F22616558%2Fharley-davidson-seral-1-electric-chopper-auction-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;auctioning them off online&lt;/a&gt;. The first one is the Schwinn Sting-Ray-inspired Mosh/Chopper, which the company describes as a “psychedelic, hand-painted banana seater,” and oh boy do I want it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBZvq7"&gt;Unfortunately, my chances are slim to none. First of all, Serial 1 is only making, well, one of these. The Mosh/Chopper is the first product from the company’s new 1-OFF series, in which it’s custom designing, building, and releasing single-edition (i.e. runs of just one) e-bikes throughout the year and auctioning them off online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d9kyfN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I desperately want to put baseball cards in its spokes and attach streamers to the handlebars&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k58I6o"&gt;The current bid is $6,700, which is a bit too expensive for my taste. The auction ends August 11th at 5PM, so there isn’t much time left to bid. Whoever ends up winning, please let me borrow it for a little while. I desperately want to put baseball cards in its spokes and attach streamers to the handlebars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="r5t44N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10692985"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5zjyBd"&gt;To be honest, I didn’t grow up in the 1960s, so I never owned a Sting-Ray, but damn if this isn’t a gorgeous homage to the cruisers of that era. Serial 1 unveiled the Mosh/Chopper at the 81st annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally last week, a sign that the company will be leaning into its motorcycle roots in future projects. Also, the bike was constructed by two Milwaukee-based chopper builders, Warren Heir Jr. and Kendall Lutchman of JR’s Fabrication and Welding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rMa3u"&gt;“Customization is such an important part of the motorcycle ownership experience,” says Aaron Frank, brand director at Serial 1, in a statement. “For decades, people have been modifying their motorcycles to reflect their unique style and taste. The 1-OFF Series applies this same spirit of individualization and personalization to eBikes, showing people just how much fun it is to create an eBike that suits their own unique personality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tffyDA"&gt;The Mosh/Chopper isn’t just a beautiful e-bike; it’s also packing a powerful drivetrain, thanks to Harley-Davidson’s design know-how and a bunch of well-sourced components. Much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22179185/harley-davidson-serial-1-ebike-test-hands-on-specs-price"&gt;Serial 1’s regular lineup of e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;, the Chopper has a Gates Carbon Drive belt, a German-made Brose mid-drive motor that’s capable of 250W of continuous power and hitting top speeds of 20mph. On top of that, the bike has hydraulic disc brakes, internally routed cables and wires, and integrated lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Kd5FPG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/583613796?byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oIyH9j"&gt;In addition, the Chopper is sporting many customized features: a long-and-low banana seat that’s supported by a custom stainless-steel sissy bar, and a high-rise handlebar that creates a comfortable riding position for laid-back cruising. The ‘60s-era “Street Freak” paint job, consisting of a silver micro-flake base coat covered in House of Kolor “oriental blue kandy,” is sure to look stunning under sunlight. And other finishings, like intricate panels, freak drops, hand-painted pinstripes, and single-stroke hand lettering, complete the package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSVl6l"&gt;So once again, if you happen to submit the winning bid for this bike, my email address is andrew.hawkins@theverge.com. Please reach out. I know I will never own it, but maybe I can ride it once. Just around the block?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNwiDr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahDTYY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5eZr84"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="se9vaK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft brings xCloud to Windows PCs with the Xbox app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GvJkA9NX53iLifyFpVGGKp-EVU=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69699406/xcloudwindowsxboxapp.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SrHdvc"&gt;Microsoft is bringing xCloud to Windows PCs through its Xbox app today. Xbox Insiders will be able to access a new updated Xbox app with Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) built in. Much like how xCloud works through the web, you’ll just need a compatible controller connected via Bluetooth or USB to access Xbox games from a Windows 10 PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHA5Xy"&gt;The updated Xbox app will include a new “cloud games” section, with access to all of the same games available on xCloud on the web. “We’ve also added some new features to help you get started, including easy-to-access information on controller and network status, social features to stay connected with friends, and the ability to invite people – even those also playing on cloud without the game installed – to join you in a game,” &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/08/09/xbox-cloud-gaming-beta-available-for-insiders-through-the-xbox-app-for-windows/"&gt;says Jason Beaumont&lt;/a&gt;, a partner director of Xbox experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jHv7jdq8X0xtuKRvhYi8gSPYmBw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22771357/p0O0qaM.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;xCloud inside the new Xbox app on Windows 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="af4Abt"&gt;Xbox Insider testers will be able to access the new Xbox app in 22 different countries through signing up to the “Windows Gaming” preview in the Xbox Insider Hub app. Cloud games will then be available in the Game Pass section of the app, allowing you to resume Xbox games that were started on a console or in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5Wj96"&gt;This new Xbox app also includes the ability to stream games from a local Xbox, allowing you to power on and off a console and play your games streamed from your own Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJeUgB"&gt;If you’re not an Xbox tester, you can still access xCloud over at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox.com%2Fplay&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F9%2F22616774%2Fmicrosoft-xcloud-windows-xbox-app-xbox-cloud-gaming-beta" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;http://xbox.com/play&lt;/a&gt;, and Microsoft will likely bring this full experience to the Xbox app on Windows in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Azun60"&gt;Samsung vice chairman Lee Jae-yong —known in the West as Jay Y. Lee— will be released from prison Friday after South Korea’s justice ministry granted him parole, the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3857903c-ed62-4203-8c32-eba0340b2bee"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported. The billionaire heir to the Samsung empire, Lee, 53, had served six months of a 30-month prison sentence for offering bribes to South Korea’s former president Park Geun-hye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FN5iDH"&gt;Lee was first sent to prison in 2017 in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/9/14867124/samsung-bribery-corruption-trial-chairman-lee-jae-yong"&gt;succession scandal&lt;/a&gt; that led to Park’s removal. He was accused of offering payments and horses as bribes to a friend of the former president to try to garner support for his succession at Samsung. Lee served just one year of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/25/16201360/samsung-lee-jae-yong-guilty"&gt;five-year sentence&lt;/a&gt; before a retrial was &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-29/south-korea-orders-retrial-of-samsung-s-lee-in-bribery-scandal?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;ordered in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. He was ordered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/18/22236716/samsung-lee-jae-yong-prison-bribery-ruling"&gt;back to prison in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRtxlX"&gt;In December, Lee offered a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249040/jay-y-lee-apology-samsung-heir-bribery"&gt;rare public apology&lt;/a&gt; for the succession plot. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-09/samsung-s-lee-receives-parole-after-jail-sentence-for-bribery?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Justice Minister Park Beom-kye said Monday that Lee’s “attitude during incarceration,” along with public sentiment and the economic impact of COVID-19 were all factors in the decision to grant Lee’s parole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X4HtvQ"&gt;That public opinion includes recent polls that show South Koreans mostly favored Lee’s release from prison, as did business leaders and members of President Moon Jae-in’s government, the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-south-korea-4d91344be72d7e3ed81625b0d769c0d0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associated Press &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. Moon has not commented on Lee’s release, but his office has said such a decision would be up to the justice ministry. Moon’s party is working to build support ahead of presidential elections in March, and Lee’s release is expected to work in his favor; as one political consultant told the &lt;em&gt;AP,&lt;/em&gt; some 5 million South Koreans own shares in Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vz1wrF"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jay-y-lee-samsungs-de-facto-leader-wins-parole-from-prison-11628503884"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it’s unclear how Lee, the grandson of Samsung’s founder, will be able to resume his work at the company once he’s released: South Korean law imposes a five-year employment ban on people who commit economic crimes, and people on parole are restricted from traveling overseas. Lee would need to seek an exemption from the employment restriction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0iAiuO"&gt;And following his release, Lee still could face jail time again, in a case involving a $3.9 billion accounting fraud at a Samsung subsidiary. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; reports Lee could also face charges for allegedly abusing the sedative propofol. Lee has denied all charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4i3bz"&gt;In July, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22599306/samsung-q2-2021-earnings-component-shortage-foldables"&gt;Samsung released its second-quarter earnings&lt;/a&gt;, which showed a 20 percent uptick in revenue and a 54 percent increase in operating profit from the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vodafone latest UK carrier to reintroduce roaming charges in Europe after Brexit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Masked customers queue to enter Vodafone Mobile Phone Store..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xzuy64efwhZV1QK-OQVpuhOlVa8=/0x164:5000x3497/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69698853/1234410114.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michael McNerney/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZNzbEa"&gt;Vodafone has announced it will &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vodafone.co.uk%2Froamingupdate22&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F9%2F22616543%2Fvodafone-europe-roaming-charges-price-tariff-brexit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reintroduce roaming charges&lt;/a&gt; in Europe for UK mobile customers from January next year. It’s the latest UK carrier to reintroduce the fees after the country’s departure from the European Union, and it follows a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548668/ee-uk-carrier-roaming-charges-european-union"&gt;similar U-turn from EE&lt;/a&gt; in June. All major carriers in the country &lt;a href="https://www.cityam.com/major-uk-mobile-networks-vow-not-reintroduce-roaming-charges/"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; they had no plans to introduce roaming fees in Europe after the Brexit vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glGRZq"&gt;The fees will apply to any Vodafone customers who sign up to or change their contract from August 11th, 2021, with the fees applying from January 6th, 2022. Costs are dependent on the specific plan, but most customers will pay £2 ($2.77) a day to use their UK allowance of calls, texts, and data in Europe, or £1 a day if access is bought in eight- or 15-day bundles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ohPej"&gt;Customers signed up to Vodafone’s “Unlimited Data Xtra plan with 4 Xtra benefits” or “Limited Data Xtra plan with 4 Xtra benefits” will pay no extra fee to use their UK allowance in Europe. All UK Vodafone customers traveling to the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state, will not have to pay any roaming fees regardless of their contract. Full details of the new payment plans can be &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vodafone.co.uk%2Froamingupdate22&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F9%2F22616543%2Fvodafone-europe-roaming-charges-price-tariff-brexit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ti7lO"&gt;Roaming charges were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15418776/eu-mobile-roaming-charges-date-june-15"&gt;abolished in the European Union&lt;/a&gt; on June 15th, 2017, but after the UK voted to leave the EU, it had to renegotiate its trade agreements with the bloc. These did not include free mobile roaming, allowing UK carriers to reintroduce fees if they wished. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s 2020 iPad Pro is $200 off at Best Buy today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-ilVCTgnPznFUnwDz1BK9zarRr4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69698679/bking_200322_3945_0023.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro 12.9&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Brennan King / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lAaqy9"&gt;If you’ve been waiting for a sale on last year’s iPad Pro now that the new models have been released, today is perhaps your day. Best Buy is taking $200 off all configurations of the 2020 iPad Pro, including both 11- and 12.9-inch sizes and cellular-equipped models. Not all of the configurations are in stock everywhere, but popular options like the 256GB Wi-Fi versions of the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748602930599677783#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11-inch&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748602966449170221#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch&lt;/a&gt; are available as of the time of publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3yBDL"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro features Apple’s A12Z processor, a 120Hz display, quad speakers, and a dual rear camera system with lidar. It’s compatible with the second-generation Apple Pencil, Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro, and Smart Keyboard folio for iPad Pro. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UPkqpx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10692708"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hq4jWI"&gt;Best Buy also has a sale on the last-generation Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones. These originally listed at $350 when they launched in 2018, but you can pick them up for $200 today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6iPDx6"&gt;The WH-1000XM3 are very similar to the newer XM4 model, with excellent battery life and noise cancellation. The main thing you’re giving up is the ability to pair to multiple devices at the same time, but that concession might be worth the savings for you. Check out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/11/17844914/sony-1000x-m3-review-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;review of the WH-1000XM3 here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="aBwIjh"&gt;If you’re looking for earbuds instead of over-ear cans, Amazon has a sale on a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/3114c908?showVariations=true&amp;amp;ref=deals_deals_deals-grid_slot-15_69e1_dt_dcell_tlt_2_3114c908" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wide range of 1More headphones&lt;/a&gt; today, including the top-of-the-line &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/1MORE-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphone-Calls-EHD9001TA/dp/B08J46PGHV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Active Noise Cancellation model for $100&lt;/a&gt;, a $50 discount. You can also get the awkwardly named but quite good &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/1MORE-ComfoBuds-Wireless-Cancelling-Bluetooth/dp/B08V5355R2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ComfoBuds Pro&lt;/a&gt; for as low as $75, down $25 from their usual price. &lt;strong&gt;Check out our reviews of the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/29/21157701/1more-true-wireless-anc-headphones-review-noise-canceling-earbuds-price-performance-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1More True Wireless ANC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345692/1more-comfobuds-pro-noise-canceling-earbuds-review-airpods" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ComfoBuds Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Samsung’s August Unpacked event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5LSJypPHZrnZSp5JxQeLknnqQlo=/151x0:1050x599/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69698607/E7Ow9IyXsAAEUyS.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1419674682543034370" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WleRDN"&gt;The next Galaxy Unpacked event is fast approaching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;on August 11th at 10AM ET / 7AM PT&lt;/a&gt; — but you might’ve already seen what Samsung has lined up, thanks to a copious amount of leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNoWn8"&gt;Samsung is expected to announce new additions to its high-end line of folding Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip phones. Based on leaks, both the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 seem more like refinements to Samsung’s existing designs with the newest specs. The new Fold and Flip should come with new color options and, in the case of the Flip, a reworked outside screen and camera housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9j18tO"&gt;Now that Samsung and Google have revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;their smartwatch partnership with Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;, it seems like Samsung might also launch two of the first smartwatches to run it. Leaks seem to suggest Samsung will show off a new Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic and Galaxy Watch Active 4. The company is also rumored to be updating its line of true wireless earbuds with the Galaxy Buds 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFmZuZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all of Samsung’s next foldable moves, but ahead of the event, here’s the breakdown of what we know so far.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qZULQKv1zeeuJKAzVV0v4dZAQrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679450/E4qkWBHXwAgIQ_W.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1408107239903223808?s=21" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass / Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (tweet now deleted)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 with S Pen stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="tv9Bmy"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is gaining a major Note feature: stylus support&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="r5IDMf"&gt;Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594685/samsung-z-fold-3-stylus-support-note-durability"&gt;has confirmed there won’t be a new Note in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is the latest flagship phone to gain access to the Note’s formerly exclusive stylus features. &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-3-s-pen-case-renders/"&gt;Leaked images from &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggest the Fold will get an optional case that holds Samsung’s S Pen stylus when you’re not using it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Leaked Galaxy Z Fold 3 case" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Df-Rb3lQUoCWfx8LGvHu7TVAxSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741284/Samsung_Galaxy_Z_Fold3_Samsung_S_Pen_case_render_03.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-s-pen-case-renders-exclusive/" target="_blank"&gt;91mobiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaked Galaxy Z Fold 3 case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4602QH"&gt;Bundled in its stylus reveal, Samsung also confirmed that the new Fold and Flip will feature improved durability, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594727/samsung-z-flip-3-fold-water-resistant-ipx8-pen-case"&gt;with rumors of IPX8 water resistance&lt;/a&gt; possibly supporting part of that claim. Otherwise, it seems like the new Fold will feel like a yet more refined version of the previous two models, offering three color options of green, black, and silver, and a Snapdragon 888 processor. The phone is also expected to have a 7.55-inch interior folding screen and a 6.23-inch external screen, with both rumored to be 120Hz high refresh rate displays, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-z-fold-3/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WihO95"&gt;For cameras, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1419674682543034370?s=20"&gt;prolific leaker Evan Blass suggests&lt;/a&gt; the Fold will feature three 12-megapixel rear cameras, one of which will be an ultrawide and the other telephoto, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The exterior selfie camera is expected to be 10 megapixels, while the inside selfie camera is rumored to only be 4 megapixels but possibly housed under the Fold’s inside panel. Samsung Display has teased its work with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230521/samsung-display-under-panel-camera-laptop-webcam-oled-bezels"&gt;under-panel cameras in the past for laptops&lt;/a&gt;, so it's possible the company could debut something similar with the Fold 3.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XUwp_n_ImCHiueUlb_cbu4yHlPc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22764805/E7zXe5GXEAAM7tj.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A leaked render of the yellow Galaxy Z Flip 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="1nyvu5"&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 has a tweaked design and larger cover screen&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="UKfSTW"&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is expected to feature a new exterior design with vertically stacked 12-megapixel rear cameras and a larger 1.9-inch cover display for notifications and selfie camera shots. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1422248661271162887?s=20"&gt;Leaked renders from Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt; show the device coming in at least four colors: light purple, light yellow, grayish-green, and black.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S9nVyY"&gt;The interior screen of the Flip 3 is rumored to be &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-z-flip-3/"&gt;the same 6.5-inch display size&lt;/a&gt; as the original Z Flip but with a new 120Hz high refresh rate display. The interior hole-punch selfie camera will reportedly sport a 10-megapixel sensor. This might not be a dramatic interior change from the first Galaxy Z Flip, but leaked renders suggest that Samsung may have also shrunk the bezels of the Flip 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wqpWTZ"&gt;Like Samsung’s other flagship phones, the Flip 3 will likely be powered by the Snapdragon 888 and, in the case of the Flip 3, the same 8GB of RAM as the first Flip, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-z-flip-3/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="jHlNxl"&gt;The new Galaxy Watches might fit more wrists&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="qrL1Cc"&gt;Samsung is expected to introduce at least two new smartwatches at Wednesday’s event. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic&lt;/a&gt; will reportedly feature a more traditional watch shape, with a rotating bezel and 42mm, 44mm, and 46mm sizes, which should at least give people more size options to play with. The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic is rumored to come in two finishes, aluminum or stainless steel, both of which will be water-resistant in depths of up to 50 meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOVAOg"&gt;The more sleek and modern &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546997/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-renders-leak-tizen-wear-os-smartwatch"&gt;Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt; (or Galaxy Watch 4 Active, it’s not entirely clear) will reportedly come with two side buttons and in either 40mm or 44mm sizes. &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-watch-4/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; suggests&lt;/a&gt; you’ll be able to choose from watches in either black, olive green, rose gold, or silver, with additional customizations for watch bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbtmPH"&gt;Both watches are expected to run Samsung and Google’s new co-developed Wear OS 3. Not much is known about it, but leaks have definitely seemed to show it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/1/22604862/samsung-galaxy-watch-photos-images-leaked-classic-4-wear-smartwatch-os-google"&gt;running on both of Samsung’s new watches&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung also showed some of what its skinned One UI version of Wear OS 3 would look like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch"&gt;at Mobile World Congress earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Leaked renders of Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="FtxMJ0"&gt;New Galaxy Buds 2 with improved sound in a variety of colors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="i9nhWr"&gt;Samsung’s next set of true wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/27/22552705/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-leaked-renders-four-colors"&gt;the Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;, don’t seem wildly different from its original pair in terms of design. They are, however, expected to come in new colors and feature improved noise reduction abilities, possibly helped by silicone ear tips similar to the ones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Samsung included in the Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFe3Ro"&gt;The Galaxy Buds 2 are rumored to come in green (some renders look like the inside of a pistachio), pink, black, and white. The new case for the Buds 2 also seems to lift some of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465651/google-pixel-buds-a-series-earbuds-review-features-price"&gt;the design elements of the Pixel Buds A-series&lt;/a&gt;: uniform white exterior, with a colored interior that matches the buds themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldX4YS"&gt;It’s not clear what kind of battery life gains the new Galaxy Buds 2 could pack in, but Federal Communications Commission filings &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/galaxy-buds-2-fcc-leak/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; show the device’s charging case has a 500mAh battery, and each earbud will have a 60mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve is working with AMD to make the Steam Deck Windows 11-ready</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8vC3yB"&gt;Valve is aiming to make its Steam Deck handheld gaming PC ready for Windows 11. While we’ve known for weeks that the Steam Deck &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578879/valve-steam-deck-handheld-pc-windows-support"&gt;can run Windows&lt;/a&gt;, it wasn’t clear how well this would be supported by Valve, or whether an option for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;Trusted Platform Modules (TPM)&lt;/a&gt; would be enabled to get Windows 11 on the Steam Deck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6WrWAX"&gt;Now, Valve has confirmed it has been heavily focused on Windows support. “There’s work looking at TPM just now,” says Greg Coomer, a Valve Steam Deck designer, in &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/steam-deck-windows-11-tpm-compatibility/"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ve focused so much on Windows 10, so far, that we haven’t really gotten that far into it. Our expectation is that we can meet that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKSqvN"&gt;Valve is working with AMD to make sure that TPM is supported at a BIOS level, and that the Steam Deck is ready for Windows 11. “So there’s nothing to indicate to us yet that there’ll be any issues with Windows 11,” explains Coomer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="shL8ef"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Valve’s new Steam Deck can run Windows and turn into a handheld Xbox ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578879/valve-steam-deck-handheld-pc-windows-support"},{"title":"Valve Steam Deck hands-on: the Nintendo Switch of PC gaming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VJvk98"&gt;That sounds encouraging for the ability to install Windows 11 on the Steam Deck once it launches later this year. While the handheld device will ship with SteamOS, a custom version of Linux, Valve will support Windows installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBaS1D"&gt;So why would you want Windows on the Steam Deck? Valve is still working on getting games with anti-cheat to run out of the box on this handheld, and it’s not guaranteed that titles like &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Gears 5 &lt;/em&gt;will work without Windows. “We’re working with BattlEye and Easy Anti-Cheat to get support for Proton ahead of launch,” &lt;a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/faq"&gt;says Valve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HldK20"&gt;The Steam Deck uses Valve’s Proton software to get a lot of officially unsupported Windows games to run on the device, but anti-cheat has been the biggest headache for Proton in recent years. Windows support avoids the obvious compatibility issues here, but it will bring with it an interface that isn’t tailored to a 7-inch screen, and lots of unknowns until we see just how well the OS works on the Steam Deck.&lt;/p&gt;
