    <title>Twitch chat is getting threaded replies</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kojdoV"&gt;Twitch users will be able to make threaded replies in Twitch chat starting today, the popular streaming platform announced. Threaded replies could make it a lot easier to have side conversations within Twitch chats, which are sometimes chaotic waterfalls of text with no easy way to tell who might be talking to another. Twitch is calling the new feature Chat Replies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDqw9F"&gt;To start a threaded reply, just hover over a message, click the arrow that will appear, and then type your message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnkGug"&gt;Twitch first launched threaded replies as a 30-day experiment to 50 percent of channels in August 2020, so you may have seen something like it during your travels around the site at the time. In response to that experiment, Twitch is including a few new features with the full release, such as the ability to customize how you want replies to appear in your chat window and keyboard shortcuts. Though chaotic, Twitch chat is a big art of how streamers build communities on the site, so any improvement to it could lead to more vibrant connections.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>College student sues Proctorio after source code copyright claim</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Coronavirus - Before Baccalaureate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Www6qWwd0MmN3hSdPzTwuHf7wU=/50x0:5950x3933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69169817/1232456637.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Marcus Brandt/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QEg3w5"&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has filed a &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/document/johnson-v-proctorio-complaint"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the remote testing company Proctorio on behalf of Miami University student Erik Johnson. The lawsuit is intended to “quash a campaign of harassment designed to undermine important concerns” about the company’s remote test-proctoring software, according to the EFF. It’s the latest legal battle for the software company, which has publicly sparred with online critics throughout the last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzQ9k6"&gt;The lawsuit intends to address the company’s behavior toward Johnson in September of last year. After Johnson found out that he’d need to use the software for two of his classes, Johnson dug into the source code of Proctorio’s Chrome extension and made a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ejohnson99/status/1303121786637373443"&gt;lengthy Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; criticizing its practices — including links to excerpts of the source code, which he’d posted on Pastebin. Proctorio CEO Mike Olsen sent Johnson a direct message on Twitter requesting that he remove the code from Pastebin, according to screenshots viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. After Johnson refused, Proctorio filed a copyright takedown notice, and three of the tweets were removed. (They were reinstated after &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/proctorio-dmca-copyright-critical-tweets/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported on the controversy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sK8Nb1"&gt;In its lawsuit, the EFF is arguing that Johnson made fair use of Proctorio’s code and that the company’s takedown “interfered with Johnson’s First Amendment right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgOb4R"&gt;“Copyright holders should be held liable when they falsely accuse their critics of copyright infringement, especially when the goal is plainly to intimidate and undermine them,” said EFF Staff Attorney Cara Gagliano &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-sues-proctorio-behalf-student-it-falsely-accused-copyright-infringement-get"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7SqdE"&gt;“I’m doing this to stand up against student surveillance, as well as abuses of copyright law,” Johnson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This isn’t the first, and won’t be the last time a company abuses copyright law to try and make criticism more difficult. If nobody calls out this abuse of power now, it’ll just keep happening.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nj7LRO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"University will stop using controversial remote-testing software following student outcry ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254631/university-of-illinois-urbana-champaign-proctorio-online-test-proctoring-privacy"},{"title":"An ed-tech specialist spoke out about remote testing software — and now he’s being sued ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9pKcoR"&gt;Proctorio is one of the most prominent software platforms that schools use to watch for cheating on remote tests. Its use exploded last year with the rise of remote learning; the platform proctored over 16 million exams. The software records students through their webcams as they work and monitors the position of their heads while they take exams. It flags “suspicious signs” to professors, who can review its recordings. It also enables instructors to track the websites students visit during the exam period and to bar them from functions like copying and pasting text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etbshw"&gt;Students and instructors around the country have volleyed numerous criticisms against Proctorio, claiming it violates student privacy and has the potential to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374386/proctorio-racial-bias-issues-opencv-facial-detection-schools-tests-remote-learning"&gt;discriminate&lt;/a&gt; against marginalized students. The Electronic Privacy Information Center filed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166023/epic-proctorio-examity-privacy-online-testing-school-lawsuit-proctoring"&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt; against the service (and four others) in December, calling it “inherently invasive.” A coalition of US senators, including Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ), cited similar concerns about Proctorio in an &lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-leads-call-for-virtual-exam-software-companies-to-improve-equity-accessibility-and-privacy-for-students-amid-troubling-reports"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7IrTuL"&gt;Proctorio has engaged critics in court before, although more often as a plaintiff. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus"&gt;Last October&lt;/a&gt;, the company sued a technology specialist at the University of British Columbia who made a series of tweets criticizing the platform. The thread contained links to unlisted YouTube videos, which Proctorio claimed contained confidential information. The lawsuit drew ire from the global education community: hundreds of university faculty, staff, administrators, and students have signed an &lt;a href="https://blog.communityofpraxis.ca/2020/09/03/in-defence-of-ian-linkletter/"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; in the specialist’s defense, and a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/stand-against-proctorio"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; for his legal expenses has raised $60,000 from over 700 donors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgbqJ1"&gt;“We disagree that sharing confidential information is the same thing as criticism,” Olsen told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;at the time. “Posting these kinds of things...it risks students learning how to circumvent the software, and it risks the safety and security of millions of students who use the software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXDX7n"&gt;Proctorio did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the EFF’s lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmuRhy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 22nd, 3:46PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Erik Johnson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch SpaceX’s third crewed mission to the ISS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tIviU0RLZsBKAKAFw9yl-Ndvhg8=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69171211/51130235765_cc815b0c41_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;(NASA/Joel Kowsky)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HXRZ6P"&gt;SpaceX is slated to launch its third crew to the International Space Station early Friday morning, ferrying two astronauts from NASA, one from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and the first European Space Agency astronaut to fly a private US spacecraft to orbit. The four-person crew will launch atop SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket at 5:49AM ET on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NuHIpk"&gt;The mission, dubbed Crew-2, marks the second operational mission under the Commercial Crew Program, NASA’s public-private initiative to revive its human spaceflight capabilities after a 10-year dependence on Russian rockets. It will mark the first time NASA astronauts fly a reused crew capsule — Crew-2’s ride first flew in May 2020 as SpaceX’s first astronaut mission, carrying Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BW7ogz"&gt;The crew includes NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough, the mission’s spacecraft commander, and Megan McArthur, serving as the pilot. JAXA astronaut Akihiko Hoshide and ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet, a French aerospace engineer, will serve as mission specialists. All the astronauts are in Florida ahead of the launch, and they’ll wake up at 11:09PM ET Thursday to prepare for flight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Imq9V"&gt;NASA’s live coverage of the mission will begin hours before liftoff, at 1:30AM ET Friday. Liftoff is at 5:49AM ET. The trek to the International Space Station will take a little less than a day — the crew is scheduled to dock with the space station at around 5:10AM ET Saturday, April 24th. They’ll spend six months on the station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BFPCCc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT TIME IS SPACEX’S CREW-2 LAUNCH?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="czmgig"&gt;SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket will take off on Friday, April 23rd, from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWQqcV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scheduled launch time:&lt;/strong&gt; New York: 5:49AM / San Francisco: 2:49AM / London: 10:49AM / Berlin: 11:49AM / Moscow: 12:49PM / New Delhi: 3:19 PM / Beijing: 5:49PM / Tokyo: 6:49PM / Melbourne: 7:49PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QcT0EO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO WATCH SPACEX’S CREW DRAGON LAUNCH LIVE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NLS82h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live stream:&lt;/strong&gt; NASA’s live stream coverage can be found &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive"&gt;on the agency’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TWn6N"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTdJ86"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ys4RyX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYJj59"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Congress resurrects push to allow thousands more autonomous vehicles on the road</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B8MEjpzG59r3S08ImUVsQ996FuI=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69171168/vpavic_4412_20210111_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oXIEWz"&gt;Robot cars are back in the spotlight on Capitol Hill after previous efforts failed to pass comprehensive legislation allowing more autonomous vehicles on the road.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzgxW0"&gt;US Sens. Gary Peters (D-MI) and John Thune (R-SD) plan to introduce an amendment to a funding bill that would grant federal regulators the power to exempt tens of thousands of vehicles from requirements to have traditional controls for human drivers, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-autonomous-congre-exclusive/exclusive-two-u-s-senators-make-new-push-to-advance-self-driving-cars-idUSKBN2C92D3"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uwqP3o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The power to exempt 15,000 vehicles per manufacturer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uO8AUC"&gt;The amendment would give the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) the power to exempt 15,000 vehicles per manufacturer from certain safety standards, with that number increasing to 80,000 in three years. The effect would be to grant more leeway to automakers like Ford and General Motors, as well as tech firms like Google and Amazon, to manufacture and deploy vehicles that lack traditional controls like steering wheels, pedals, and sideview mirrors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPpVIU"&gt;Today, the NHTSA is only legally allowed to grant 2,500 exemptions per manufacturer. The agency &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21125358/nuro-self-driving-delivery-robot-r2-fmvss-exemption"&gt;handed out its first autonomous vehicle exemption&lt;/a&gt; to a California-based company called Nuro in early 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iw7mOb"&gt;The autonomous vehicle industry praised the introduction of the amendment. A group called the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, which includes Uber, Lyft, Volvo, Ford, and Waymo as members, said it “welcomes Senators Peters and Thune’s amendment to support autonomous vehicle testing and deployment in the U.S.” The amendment will “pave the way for AV technology to save lives, unlock new economic and mobility opportunities, and promote American leadership and innovation in this globally competitive arena,” Ariel Wolf, general counsel of the coalition, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NxyE3Y"&gt;But some safety groups say the amendment &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133389/house-energy-commerce-self-driving-car-hearing-bill-2020"&gt;falls short similarly to previous legislation&lt;/a&gt;, like the AV START bill, which died after failing to muster enough support in the Senate. Along with trial lawyers and some local officials, they argue that the technology is not ready for prime time and want Congress to empower the NHTSA to require more data from autonomous vehicle operators, such as crash reporting and disengagements of the self-driving software. The trial lawyers, who have an enormously powerful lobbying group, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-transportation/2018/08/03/trial-lawyers-speak-out-on-senate-self-driving-car-bill-305093"&gt;have been blamed&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.justice.org/what-we-do/enhance-practice-law/publications/trial-magazine/proceed-caution"&gt;sinking the previous effort&lt;/a&gt; to pass legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cFZ9tk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The amendment fails to provide consumer protection”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f0Fwc9"&gt;“The amendment fails to provide consumer protection and instead essentially creates a fast-track process for manufacturers to attest that their driverless vehicle is no more safe than the least safe vehicle on the road today, before being permitted to sell tens of thousands of them and turning them lose in our neighborhoods,” Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said in an email. “Throwing open the door to more unregulated testing and underregulated sales without a strong oversight mandate is no way to bolster diminished public trust in driverless technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxWqBW"&gt;Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, said the amendment was “alarming,” and she opposed the effort to pass the legislation as an amendment rather than a standalone bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDDKXa"&gt;The Peters-Thune amendment would be attached to the Endless Frontier Act, a $100 million spending bill that aims to increase investments in science and technology in order to compete with China and other countries. Peters and Thune are hoping to win the approval from the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday when they take up the bill. The Biden administration has signaled its support for the Endless Frontier Act, but not specifically the autonomous vehicle legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNsDyX"&gt;The news of the new amendment comes during a week in which two other members of the Senate, Ed Markey (D-MI) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397826/tesla-autopilot-investigation-blumenthal-markey-nhtsa-ntsb"&gt;have requested a robust investigation&lt;/a&gt; into a fatal crash involving a Tesla Model S in which no one was behind the steering wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5BbTK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3QU19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Garmin’s new Venu 2 watches have better battery life and more features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Garmin’s new Venu 2 (left) and the smaller Venu 2S (right)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xyetjxsii5JQFc0TBe9XMMOR4Y8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69169899/garminvenu2series.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Garmin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4W9nLX"&gt;Garmin has upgraded its premium Venu smartwatch for 2021 (via &lt;a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/04/garmin-venu2-venu2s-smartwatch-review.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DC Rainmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/garmins-2-new-smartwatches-want-to-make-the-casual-athlete-more-advanced/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). It now comes in two sizes instead of a single 43mm-sized model. The 45mm Venu 2 houses a 1.3-inch 416 x 416 OLED screen. For smaller wrists (or those who just prefer a less wrist-dominating device), the 40mm Venu 2S has a 1.1-inch 360 x 360 OLED screen. Both watches have an optional always-on mode, and they &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fp%2F707538&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F22%2F22397488%2Fgarmin-venu-2-2s-smartwatch-fitness-tracking-health-sports-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are available now&lt;/a&gt; for $399.99, which is the same price as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/5/20848816/garmin-venu-vivoactive-vivomove-gps-sport-watch-price-date-specs"&gt;original Venu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LpzlUH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It doubles the battery life in some cases versus the original&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hZ1Pkp"&gt;Other than the differences in case sizes, there isn’t much else distinguishing the Venu 2 lineup visually from the predecessor. They’re slick-looking touchscreen wearables with Gorilla Glass 3-covered touchscreens that feature two buttons. One of the biggest gen-to-gen improvements is its battery performance. The original Venu could last five days in smartwatch mode, but Garmin’s bigger 45mm Venu 2 watch doubles it (and then some) to a claim of 11 days of operation if you’re just using it for getting phone notifications with light usage otherwise. If you’re using its built-in GPS and streaming music from the watch to your headphones via Bluetooth, Garmin predicts up to eight hours of battery life, up from six in the previous model. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="zaFDAK"&gt;Surprisingly, the smaller 40mm Venu 2S also has better battery life than the original, with 10 days of use expected in smartwatch mode or up to seven hours in GPS mode with music. &lt;a href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=A1gzB6SLZF6e9nnyZOfFM6"&gt;Garmin has a whole page that backs up how it makes predictions on battery life&lt;/a&gt;, telling you what to expect depending on the kind of activities you’re doing. Garmin is also touting faster recharging for both models, with 10 minutes of charging giving you up to one day of use in smartwatch mode or an hour of GPS usage with music. Both models can store up to 650 songs from Spotify, Amazon Music, or Deezer, up from 500 in the Venu and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451145/garmin-venu-sq-music-edition-smartwatch-gps-spotify-nfc-wearable-blood-oxygen"&gt;2020 Venu Sq&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdo9z1"&gt;The Venu 2 watches are packed with sensors, featuring a heart rate sensor, GPS (GLONASS and Galileo), a wrist-based pulse ox sensor to measure blood oxygen, a barometric altimeter for altitude, compass, gyroscope, accelerometer, thermometer, and an ambient light sensor. Each watch also features NFC for the Garmin Pay contactless payment feature. These watches work with iOS and Android, but only on Android can you respond to text messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPPPue"&gt;In terms of new software features coming to the watches, Garmin’s Sleep Score will give you an aggregate score based on tracking your sleep stages, heart rate, stress, respiration, and your blood oxygen levels. The Venu 2 series can estimate your “Fitness Age” based on your level of activity and can guide you through high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and advanced strength training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="facwfx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; We originally quoted a $319.99 price for the Venu 2 and 2S because Garmin’s site listed it at that price in error, according to a spokesperson. We were able to reach the checkout page with this price, but the company confirmed that the retail price of the watch is $399.99.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FCC wants your thoughts on improving the shorter National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CfOzMoNMRHyN50Gx6z1f9burIoY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69170974/akrales_180620_1777_0600.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GQSbaz"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FCC/status/1385250009092956161"&gt;has decided to look into&lt;/a&gt; letting people text the upcoming shortened National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number in a bid to increase accessibility and use of the service by those who need it most (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnHendel/status/1385243971044134920"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; reporter John Hendel&lt;/a&gt;). Last May, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328600/national-suicide-prevention-lifeline-number-dial-988-fcc"&gt;FCC approved the creation&lt;/a&gt; of a new short code, 988, that will act as an easier-to-remember phone number for the lifeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQGTdJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note that calling 988 will not connect you to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline until July 16th, 2022.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKURJ3"&gt;It’s worth noting that today’s approval is &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/rulemaking-fcc"&gt;just a first step&lt;/a&gt; and doesn’t mean that people will, for sure, be able to text the 988 number when it goes live in July 2022. However, it does mean that the FCC will be looking into making it a requirement for phone providers, and it will be accepting public comment on whether texting should be allowed. &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-lays-groundwork-text-988"&gt;According to its statement&lt;/a&gt;, the FCC would also like public comment on the implementation details before it starts drawing up actual rules, like what kinds of things people should be able to text the lifeline, what happens if a message bounces back, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="X1BwcY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:831613"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tAjrya"&gt;To provide a comment, you can go to &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/filings/express"&gt;the FCC’s express comment page&lt;/a&gt;. The proceeding is 18-336.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgVB5v"&gt;While being able to contact the lifeline via phone or SMS with an easily memorable number is undoubtedly a good thing, it’s also worth noting that the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline also has a chat feature &lt;a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;. The current hotline added the ability to accept text messages at 1-800-273-8255 in August 2020, but 988 is an easier number to remember, especially during times of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zYwg5"&gt;The proposal to add texting support to 988 wasn’t the only action the FCC took today to try to improve public safety. It also announced that it would be looking into increasing the reliability of the 911 emergency services network. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Can Apple get you to pay for podcasts?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yI6dGrsZAUdMc5nzX-oEDn2h16o=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69170854/VRG_ILLO_4546_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The world’s most popular podcast app gets subscriptions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CyXaHi"&gt;Beth Silvers credits paid subscriptions for making podcasting her full-time job. She and Sarah Stewart Holland host &lt;a href="https://www.pantsuitpoliticsshow.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pantsuit Politics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show that tries to turn political punditry into “grace-filled conversations.” The two of them launched the show in 2015 and then started experimenting with subscriptions two years later, first on their own website in the form of monthly contributions, and then, not long after, on Patreon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpYz2O"&gt;Three years later, they now have over 4,000 monthly subscribers who pay anywhere from $5 to $100 per month, employ a full-time listener-turned-employee, and fully focus their time on the show. Their revenue is now equally made up of advertising and memberships. “It was still a big risk [when we switched to Patreon],” Silvers says. “We weren’t quite at a sustainable point. We thought to get to sustainability, we’ve got to invest more time here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JWBcU"&gt;Now, the women are trying something new: Apple Podcasts subscriptions. They’re among the first creators who’ve signed up to try the service, which allows podcasters to offer paid subscriptions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;from within the Podcasts app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNCclH"&gt;The most popular podcasting app putting its weight behind subscriptions could be monumental. Apple has the chance to popularize paid subscriptions by making it easy to listen and subscribe in one place, and it could influence the industry to shift slightly away from its dependence on advertising at the same time. Plus, unlike other solutions, Apple will also allow listeners to try these subscriptions for free for a limited amount of time, giving people a chance to preview what they’re paying to access. Apple’s not precious about the content podcasters offer there, either. Shows and bonus content don’t have to be exclusive to the platform, and they can mix free and paid content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sRuoiNM2PxuTr4bDIIlEr1U9X7w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22462736/download.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Podcasts’ subscription product will let creators decide how much to charge for content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iEEODu"&gt;“When Apple does [subscriptions], it’s like flicking a switch,” says Jacob Weisberg, CEO of podcasting network Pushkin Industries, which author Malcolm Gladwell co-founded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47ZJC9"&gt;Even David Stern, the CEO of Supporting Cast, which runs a competing podcast subscription platform, sees Apple’s entrance as a turning point for the industry. “The number one challenge we have in getting podcasters to consider working with Supporting Cast is simply that people aren’t used to the idea of a paid podcast,” he said &lt;a href="https://www.supportingcast.fm/post/what-apple-podcast-subscriptions-means-for-supporting-cast-slate-and-our-podcasters-2"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. “Apple’s push into premium content will help the industry understand how much revenue they are leaving on the table by not giving their listeners something to pay for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0kGta"&gt;The potential upside for podcasters is huge. Apple Podcasts is the biggest podcast listening platform in the world, and listeners won’t have to leave the app to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6d4Qq"&gt;But the service does come with trade-offs. Most crucially, podcasters have to pay a flat fee of $19.99 per year to even offer subscriptions, and they then give Apple a 30 percent cut of revenue for each subscriber’s first year and 15 percent for the years following. Patreon, in contrast, &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/pricing"&gt;takes up to&lt;/a&gt; 12 percent of creators’ revenue. Apple Podcasts is also only available on iOS devices, which most of the world doesn’t use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tArcOr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple could make paying for podcasts mainstream&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B5rI0H"&gt;Those may be tough terms for podcasters, but it might pay off. Apple Podcasts’ marketing potential is massive, and it should make it far easier for hosts to promote a subscription. Right now, podcasters who offer exclusive or bonus content often do so through private RSS feeds, which require listeners to input a link into the listening app of their choice — a feature that some apps, like Spotify, don’t support. Podcasters might have to walk them through this process, and if someone cancels their membership, it generally falls on the podcaster to make sure their RSS link access is revoked. Getting listeners to pay also usually involves convincing them to sign up for another platform, like Patreon, a far bigger hurdle than tapping a button inside the app they’re already using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cu2p8h"&gt;This is why the &lt;em&gt;Pantsuit Politics&lt;/em&gt; team signed up for Apple Podcasts’ subscriptions, especially considering a majority of their listeners are on Apple Podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RcQd85"&gt;“We like giving our listeners options, and we feel like there are people who probably would like our bonus content who just don’t want to deal with the hassle of figuring Patreon out,” Silvers says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNr0N0"&gt;But they’re going to have to get creative with how they advertise their perks. Patreon is more fully built out to support creators who want various benefits. In &lt;em&gt;Pantsuit Politics&lt;/em&gt;’ case, subscribers not only receive bonus content, but also a community on Patreon itself where they can chat about episodes and participate in a book club where Silvers and Stewart Holland ship the books they plan to discuss. Silvers and Stewart Holland also receive their listeners’ personal information, like addresses, which help them decide where to tour. Their listeners’ emails, which they also receive, allow them to send FYIs about ticket sales or other content, like YouTube Lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nJQ1hW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The hurdle of signing up for an extra service might be too much for some listeners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3uuGmR"&gt;“We all just love convenience, like we love our stuff to just be in one place,” says Jessica Cordova Kramer, the CEO of Lemonada Media, which plans to use Apple Podcasts’ subscriptions in addition to existing subscription services. “And yes, there’s an extra hoop to jump through if you’re using something that’s outside the listening ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dH5GaL"&gt;Apple doesn’t yet seem interested in building the social aspect of podcasting communities, so if podcasters want to advertise their Discord or Patreon, they’ll have to shout out those perks and ask listeners to contact them for access — another hurdle. Apple also won’t give podcasters their listeners’ emails, names, phone numbers, addresses, or any personal information, so Apple ends up mediating all interactions and keeping the data. Apple does say it’ll give podcasters aggregated, anonymized analytics about their listeners, like where they’re based, but these tools likely won’t wholly replace the benefits of having subscribers’ emails or names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Elvcpq"&gt;“Having the Discord in our community has been so rewarding to us, the hosts, and the people that have joined it. Without being able to foster that ... is almost like a blocker for the Apple subscriptions,” says Matt Kolowski, a host of a show about movies called &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/70mm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;70mm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has around 140 subscribers on Patreon. “I’d really love for them to realize that a sense of community is such a huge part of creating a fun podcast experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubPsqH"&gt;In a comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about Apple’s push into subscriptions, Patreon’s chief revenue officer Kerri Pollard specifically called out its community features as a selling point. “We know creators see the value in our offering that serves them and their communities first, and will continue to use Patreon,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDf8jm"&gt;Community has become so important, in fact, that even Facebook justified &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391551/facebook-audio-podcasts-clubhouse-competitor-spotify-live-rooms"&gt;its push&lt;/a&gt; into audio and podcasting this week because of it. The company says 170 million people on Facebook are connected to a page that’s linked to a specific podcast, and more than 35 million people are members of fan groups around podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="41LJxw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some podcasters say, more than anything else, their subscribers value community&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nFoA8h"&gt;Another factor for podcasters to consider: more platforms means more administrative work. RSS promised one feed for all the apps, but the ecosystem of subscriptions isn’t shaping up that way. Kolowski and his co-hosts upload bonus and early access content to Patreon; their usual shows to their hosting provider, Anchor; and if they participate in Apple Podcasts, they’d need to separately post uploads there, too. If Spotify gets into the subscription game, they might have to manually upload content there as well — although being on Anchor, a Spotify company, might pay off in that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYsMQg"&gt;“Ultimately, I don’t really want like four places to upload a podcast to because selfishly, I don’t want to have that kind of legwork,” Kolowski says, adding that most of his show’s listeners are on Pocket Casts, not Apple Podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8Xli1"&gt;But for larger networks, Apple Podcasts’ subscriptions might be the right fit at the right time. Pushkin Industries &lt;a href="https://www.pushkin.fm/news/announcing-pushnik-premium-subscription-program/"&gt;is launching&lt;/a&gt; its first subscription program, PushNik, through Apple Podcasts, with plans to eventually make the bonus and exclusive content available on other apps. Pushkin CEO Weisberg helped &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; launch Slate Plus, a subscription program that includes ad-free podcasts, years ago, and says, at the time, there were no easy solutions for publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCgfDG"&gt;“It was so clunky to get the private RSS feed into whatever player you use,” he says. “It’s just a lot of steps, and to me it was really difficult, and the thing that I was always banging on about at Slate was we’ve got to reduce the number of clicks to get the bonus content for subscribers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUlcSH"&gt;Apple’s subscriptions solve that. Of course, in the years since &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; launched Slate Plus, Patreon has sprung up, as have other companies like Supporting Cast, which &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; launched to help other podcasters set up memberships. They don’t solve the one-click problem, but they at least provide the infrastructure and tech support to keep a subscription business running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GkvBfu"&gt;For these networks, a 30 percent initial cut that eventually goes to 15 percent might be worth it. Extra money is extra money. But for the smaller podcasters who’ve focused on community and creating a fan base of engaged listeners, Apple might not provide enough — especially if a show reaches a global audience that’s more Android-based than iOS. But it seems almost certain that with Apple supporting and caring about subscriptions, more people than ever before will be paying for shows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo’s leaked tracking tag has UWB and USB-C charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nWIO0bJ9_UhBom5LNcScHZKRTT8=/220x0:1462x828/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69170769/Screen_Shot_2021_04_22_at_1.45.55_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photos: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oppo-smart-tag-uwb-support-leak/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; / Digital Chat Station (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/KbWp4iUK7?ssl_rnd=1619068976.2363&amp;amp;type=comment#_rnd1619068991991" target="_blank"&gt;Weibo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oPjsBm"&gt;It looks like Oppo will be the next company to throw its hat in the Bluetooth tracking tag game, with a leak of the company’s new Smart Tag &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oppo-smart-tag-uwb-support-leak/"&gt;appearing over on &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(via Weibo leaker Digital Chat Station). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aX2vB5"&gt;Oppo’s tracker looks to distinguish itself in at least one key way from other major tracking tags by offering a USB-C port for recharging the tags, instead of requiring replaceable coin cell batteries (or even worse, nonremovable batteries, as is the case on some Tile trackers). That should make the new Oppo tags a bit more environmentally friendly, although it’s unclear what the impact on battery life will be compared to a more traditional battery system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pHDb7x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AirTag location trackers are smart, capable, and very Apple","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pFJ0tI"&gt;And while details are slim on the Oppo Smart Tag, the leak does confirm that the tracker will support ultra-wideband radio for more precise tracking, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;Apple’s recently revealed AirTag tracker&lt;/a&gt; and Samsung’s SmartTag Plus (which was released earlier in April). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSzq1c"&gt;Of course, a Bluetooth tracker is only as good as the network of devices that can support it.  Tile, the longtime leader in the tracking tag space, has spent almost a decade building up its network of tags, and Apple’s Find My network is able to leverage the hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads in the world to track down AirTags. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Twmgwz"&gt;With 9 percent of the global market share at the end of 2020 (according to &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartphone-share/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Counterpoint Research&lt;/em&gt;’s data&lt;/a&gt;), Oppo can likely make a good case that it has the market saturation to make its tags effective, too, but it’ll likely heavily depend on where users are in the world and how popular Oppo’s phones are in that area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWUQrW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla is being scrutinized by Senate Democrats for Autopilot misuse</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r4SucX"&gt;Two Senate Democrats are urging federal regulators to take “corrective actions” against Tesla to prevent further misuse of the company’s advanced driver assist feature. The request comes in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22390612/two-people-killed-fiery-tesla-crash-no-driver"&gt;the aftermath of a fatal crash&lt;/a&gt; in which two men from Texas were killed after their Tesla Model S crashed with no one in the driver’s seat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FALgL"&gt;In a letter sent to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Acting Administrator Steven Cliff, Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) implored the agency to determine the exact cause of this recent crash to “better inform” future legislation around advanced driver assist systems like Tesla’s Autopilot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1ub8X0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We strongly urge you to conduct a complete investigation into Saturday’s fatal Tesla vehicle crash”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xir4pc"&gt;“We strongly urge you to conduct a complete investigation into Saturday’s fatal Tesla vehicle crash and develop recommendations for improving automated driving and driver assistance systems,” Markey and Blumenthal write. “We look forward to working with you and the NTSB to implement policy changes that stop these preventable deaths from occurring and save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="GnYmWE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391890/tesla-driverless-crash-texas-nhtsa-investigation"&gt;A special crash team from NHTSA is investigating the crash&lt;/a&gt;, as well as investigators from the independent National Transportation Safety Board. On Monday, NHTSA said the agency is coordinating with local law enforcement to learn more about the incident and will “take appropriate steps” when investigators have gathered more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZ6ROo"&gt;The incident took place at 9PM local time in Spring, Texas. &lt;a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/tesla-spring-crash-fire/285-c28a4993-5b5f-43f4-a924-e39638390647"&gt;According to KHOU&lt;/a&gt; in Houston, investigators are “100 percent certain” that no one was in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash. Minutes before the crash, the wives of the men were said to overhear them talking about the Autopilot feature of the vehicle, which was a 2019 Tesla Model S, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/18/business/tesla-fatal-crash-texas.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The two victims were identified as Everette Talbot, 69, and William Varner, 59, a prominent local anesthesiologist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I5GlYb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not clear what direction NHTSA’s investigation will take&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6R0v9T"&gt;It’s not clear what direction NHTSA’s investigation will take. In the past, the agency has been &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/26455/nhtsas-flawed-autopilot-safety-study-unmasked"&gt;criticized for misrepresenting Autopilot’s safety record&lt;/a&gt; and for giving the company a pass when it comes to the possibility that its customers could misuse the technology in its vehicles. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-crash/u-s-safety-agency-reviewing-23-tesla-crashes-three-from-recent-weeks-idUSKBN2BA2ML"&gt;NHTSA recently disclosed&lt;/a&gt; that it has opened 27 investigations into crashes of Tesla vehicles, 23 of which remain active. Tesla CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1384580105649885188"&gt;recently tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that “NHTSA is great.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xp0I29"&gt;NTSB, on the other hand, has proven more willing to point fingers at Musk’s company. An NTSB investigation into the 2018 death of a Tesla owner in California said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21153320/tesla-autopilot-walter-huang-death-ntsb-probable-cause"&gt;Autopilot was partly to blame&lt;/a&gt;. Musk has been much more hostile toward the agency, at one point &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/05/elon-musk-hung-up-on-ntsb-chief-during-call-about-tesla-crash-probe/"&gt;hanging up on the chairman of NTSB&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7IjCS"&gt;Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment, likely because the company has dissolved its press office and typically doesn’t respond to media requests anymore. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1384254194975010826?s=21"&gt;In a recent tweet&lt;/a&gt;, Musk claimed that “data logs recovered so far” indicate that Autopilot was not engaged, nor had the vehicle owner purchased the company’s “Full Self-Driving” option that may have allowed the use of Autopilot on local roads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eK7MJM"&gt;Tesla owners have shown that Autopilot can be used on roads without lane markings, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397546/tesla-autopilot-consumer-report-test-no-driver"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; recently conducted a test&lt;/a&gt; proving that Tesla’s vehicles can easily be tricked into thinking there is someone behind the wheel, even when there’s not. &lt;/p&gt;
