    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Voice control provides unique opportunities for accessibility — and some complicated setup&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Zzd014"&gt;As both a software engineer and an avid player of strategy games, chaosparrot struggled to reckon with the damage his work and hobbies had done to his hands. By 2017, the consistent pain of his repetitive stress injuries was bad enough that he could no longer type comfortably or enjoy the games he loved to play. While searching for solutions, he came across a video of someone using speech recognition software to code. He decided to try using the same tech — not for coding, but for playing games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEUO47"&gt;“I started the process of trying to play the old games that I couldn’t play anymore with sounds instead,” chaosparrot says. The project started in Python, which he used to create a full voice control program that enables him to play games hands-free. And it worked: he was able to reach just one tier below the rank in &lt;em&gt;Starcraft&lt;/em&gt; he had attained before his injuries, and he also beat &lt;em&gt;Hollow Knight&lt;/em&gt;, a twitchy game that’s likely to frustrate players even with a traditional controller, using just his voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q9Kv0t"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HwN5ttEm7nc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zOu3iX"&gt;Games have slowly gotten more accessible over time, but when features are missing or controls don’t work, the onus falls on disabled players to find their own ways to play. Many disabled players use a combination of adaptive hardware — such as mouth-operated controllers and specially designed joysticks — and various apps to enable features like eye tracking, screen resizing, or voice control. Chaosparrot’s use of voice is just one of the many customizable, bespoke solutions players have turned to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1XIFI0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have to make it ourselves”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RvnJLg"&gt;“That’s like life when you have a disability. Anything that I kind of want, or need, and it’s not available, we have to make it ourselves,” says Kyle Abbate, who runs &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZVtZMQ7UB4EgSi862BYBug"&gt;onehandmostly&lt;/a&gt;, a YouTube channel focused on accessibility in games. That might be a cup holder for his wheelchair, attachments for his keyboard and mouse, or the software setups he uses to play games. “A lot of stuff for disabled people is trial by error, and making your own accessible tech, and whatever works for you, and experimenting and trying to find what’s best.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XaalB3"&gt;Chaosparrot’s program, Parrot.Py, was inspired by &lt;a href="https://talonvoice.com/"&gt;Talon Voice&lt;/a&gt;, a freely available voice recognition software for writing, coding, and theoretically any other computing task. By teaching Parrot.Py specific clicks, hisses, and clucks and associating them with button inputs in a game, chaosparrot is able to vocalize commands — selecting units in &lt;em&gt;Starcraft&lt;/em&gt; or attacking and dashing in &lt;em&gt;Hollow Knight &lt;/em&gt;— in addition to using eye tracking for movement. He hopes to get it working in a variety of game genres, and has even tested it while playing &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, though that involved explaining to friends why he was hissing into his mic on the way to electric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NFYo3h"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CkF6nlC86so?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=4567&amp;amp;start=4567" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OQJdBg"&gt;There are other players who use older, preexisting voice control programs like &lt;a href="https://voiceattack.com/"&gt;VoiceAttack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://baykovr.github.io/gavpi.html#"&gt;GAVPI&lt;/a&gt; as viable alternatives to typical controllers. But regardless of the program, there are still hurdles that come with voice as a control method. Voice controls create a time delay between giving a command and the move being executed in the game, which makes for a more difficult gameplay experience, especially in games that call for fast reaction times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecRQ74"&gt;There’s also more mental labor involved in setting up voice commands before diving into a game. Both VoiceAttack and GAVPI require more tech literacy than just running a game by itself, and Parrot.Py requires at least a basic familiarity with coding. Using any of these programs involves extra steps on top of the existing barriers that come with playing as a disabled person. “It’s gonna be hard to bridge that gap,” says chaosparrot. Like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAaJMHQah0E&amp;amp;t=158s"&gt;Abbate has done for VoiceAttack&lt;/a&gt;, he plans to make videos explaining how to use his program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPiJFz"&gt;Beyond the quirks of setting up voice controls, some games are just more difficult to play than others. A game like &lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt;, which requires fast decision-making and movement, presents a challenge, but is more playable &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/43kadm/celeste-assist-mode-change-and-accessibility"&gt;thanks to a built-in assist mode&lt;/a&gt; that allows for adjustments in speed, stamina, and invincibility. For games without an assist mode, adjusting elements like health or attack damage with a program like &lt;a href="https://www.cheatengine.org/index.php"&gt;Cheat Engine&lt;/a&gt; can make the game adapt to the player, meeting them in the middle between what they’re capable of and what the game requires. “I think if you look at the future of accessibility, I think [an assist mode] is a great thing to add, at least to single-player games,” says chaosparrot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nouw2u"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qxc2xOJF6r0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rrZ0ed"&gt;Inclusive design requires time, careful consideration, and a willingness to solicit feedback from people with a variety of disabilities. Developers don’t always have adaptive play styles in mind, and don’t necessarily have the best track record for considering how disabled people might interact with their games, from button-mashing triggering chronic pain flare-ups to flashing lights &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163783/cyberpunk-2077-epileptic-seizure-warning-permanent-fix-cd-projekt-red"&gt;potentially causing seizures&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYwSyT"&gt;Improvements in gaming accessibility have often been the result of disabled people advocating for themselves. Microsoft’s&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/17/17363528/xbox-adaptive-controller-disability-accessible"&gt; Xbox Adaptive Controller&lt;/a&gt; was developed with guidance from advocacy groups like &lt;a href="https://ablegamers.org/"&gt;AbleGamers&lt;/a&gt; to better address the needs of disabled players. A letter from a disabled player is what pushed Naughty Dog’s team to consider accessibility in their games. They &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21274923/the-last-of-us-part-2-accessibility-features-naughty-dog-interview-ps4"&gt;prioritized accessibility in &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as a result, and the game was praised for its wide range of customizable options like remappable controls and audio cues for players with low vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5OfDq7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The disabled community on social media has been growing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vlREc6"&gt;Those pushes for more accessible features are also found on social media platforms, where disabled people band together to bring awareness to what’s missing in games and what fixes have been made. “The disabled community on social media has been growing and becoming more and more vocal,” says Courtney Craven, founder of &lt;a href="https://caniplaythat.com/"&gt;Can I Play That&lt;/a&gt;, an accessible game review site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPvyPj"&gt;Players continue to advocate for accessibility in games by reaching out to developers and showcasing and sharing the kinds of solutions they use. Chaosparrot’s Parrot.Py is designed to address his needs, but he and other players know that accessibility will never be one-size-fits-all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="UHu5Qd"&gt;“I encourage devs to take a look at their game and their mechanics, and then think about ‘how do we make these accessible,’’’ says Abbate. “And then when you’re making your next game, ‘how can we iterate again, and make those changes, make it even better.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPtJ4t"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hP9BMF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump’s Moon program survived a transfer of power, so what’s next?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Holds Virtual Call&amp;amp;nbsp;To NASA JPL Perseverance Team" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7rs35AsirwKOnuJVOOlkaJKyrJw=/0x0:8192x5461/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68954731/1231520649.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;President Biden has been silent on his plans for NASA but excited about the agency’s recent successes — here, he virtually congratulates the team that landed NASA’s Perseverance rover on Mars last month.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3uRe0n"&gt;The Trump administration’s Moon-to-Mars program has already dodged the fate of many past presidential space programs: cancellation under new leadership. Last month, White House press secretary Jen Psaki announced the Biden administration’s support for Artemis, NASA’s flagship lunar agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R06M3H"&gt;It was a rare passing of the baton between two administrations at odds with one another in virtually every other area. And it quelled some industry fears that Biden would shelve the moonshot plan entirely. While still in its infancy, the Artemis program unleashed a wave of industry momentum, partially thanks to an energizing, yet wildly unrealistic target date of 2024 for planting boots on the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ne2EFI"&gt;To get a sense of what’s next for Artemis and NASA&lt;em&gt;, The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Bhavya Lal, NASA’s acting chief of staff and currently the agency’s most senior Biden appointee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UZD7rY"&gt;Artemis survived the transfer of power — what now? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="P7N9Hx"&gt;The program is getting a thorough review. The group of eight scientists and space policy experts tasked with reviewing NASA for Biden’s transition team lifted the hood on Trump’s speedy moonshot plan, announced by then-Vice President Mike Pence in early 2019. The experts came up with a list of things within Artemis that should stay &lt;em&gt;in &lt;/em&gt;and things that should stay &lt;em&gt;out &lt;/em&gt;to inform the NASA team’s review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LxvvtO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We weren’t going to just throw away everything that had happened in the last many years and start over.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lf57br"&gt;“One thing that was absolutely in was continuity of purpose,” says Lal, who has advised past administrations on space policy and was the Biden team’s top space expert during the transition. “We weren’t going to just throw away everything that had happened in the last many years and start over.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVa489"&gt;Lal joined NASA in February and is now helping lead the ongoing Artemis review inside the agency, carrying out the guidance she helped draft during the transition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0AFyb"&gt;That review covers every pillar of Artemis, including the agency’s long-delayed and staggeringly over-budget Space Launch System (SLS), the behemoth rocket that will launch the first astronaut crews to the Moon in the Orion capsule. It also includes reviewing the program’s timeline, international partnerships, and coming up with a budget that Congress will like. The review will also refine planned activities on the Moon and identify spots where more commercial activities can get involved, Lal says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVH1EI"&gt;Nothing is set in stone yet. The review is ongoing, and Biden, almost two months into his presidency, has yet to pick his NASA administrator. That’s no surprise — it took Trump nearly eight months to nominate his administrator, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240908/jim-bridenstine-nasa-chief-transition-artemis"&gt;Jim Bridenstine&lt;/a&gt;, and almost another eight months to win Senate confirmation. It was four months before Barack Obama named Charles Bolden, and about ten months before George Bush tapped Sean O’Keefe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="M0kGwn"&gt;Getting to the Moon — just not by 2024&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="elexfg"&gt;NASA aims to continue its investment in SLS and Orion while keeping an eye on private sector rockets for help if needed. “SLS and Orion will be providing initial transportation to and from lunar orbit beyond Artemis, and any proven commercial transportation can make up gaps if there are any,” Lal says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2itjO3"&gt;By the time the Boeing-built SLS flies for the first time (likely sometime next year, almost three years later than planned), the agency will have spent nearly $20 billion on the program, NASA’s inspector general reported last year, with each launch thereafter coming out to about $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUOJBa"&gt;Cheaper commercial rockets built by firms like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and the United Launch Alliance exist but currently are only poised to launch uncrewed pieces of the Artemis program to space. SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket will launch the first two elements of NASA’s Lunar Gateway, a planned space station orbiting the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4TMi2"&gt;Where possible, NASA needs to “maintain multiple providers of launch vehicles, landers, spacecraft, across the enterprise so the US isn’t overly reliant on one system or provider,” Lal says. That’s the spirit set out in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22258815/nasa-moon-lander-awards-biden-spacex-blue-origin-moonshot"&gt;NASA’s human lunar landing system&lt;/a&gt; program, the centerpiece of Artemis that aims to pick two different landers capable of ferrying astronauts to the lunar surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v1bX2d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With short funding from Congress, “2024 wasn’t realistic.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zlGYJt"&gt;But Congress, though roundly supportive of the Artemis program, balked at the Trump administration’s request for $3.3 billion to fund speedy development of those landers. Instead, it gave NASA $850 million for lander development, pounding the last nail in the coffin for Trump’s 2024 goal, which many in the space industry viewed as unachievable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0RofGi"&gt;Biden’s NASA will set a more manageable timetable, Lal says. “One of the transition team findings was that 2024, given the appropriations from Congress at least in the last two years, 2024 wasn’t realistic.” Setting a new date is tied to coming up with a palatable budget for Congress, “which is a question mark” at this point, Lal says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fdZWri"&gt;International partnerships, with Artemis and beyond&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GmXFV7"&gt;“Honoring commitments made to international partners” was a key principle of the transition team’s findings, says Lal, whether on the International Space Station or in the Artemis Accords, a set of multilateral agreements with US allies that aims to set legal standards of behavior in space. Those partners include Russia, a US adversary but a longtime NASA partner on the ISS, where the shared goal of keeping an orbital laboratory healthy supersedes the messy tensions back on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2dhobS"&gt;But the NASA-Russia relationship is changing. Roscosmos, Russia’s space agency, has been reluctant to extend its alliance with NASA to the Moon, and last year the US sought to exclude Russia from early talks on the Artemis Accords. This week, Russia made good on its claims to ditch Artemis by announcing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321114/lunar-moon-space-station-russia-china-agreement-nasa"&gt;new agreement with China&lt;/a&gt; to build a rival Moon base and space station in lunar orbit, cementing a new front in an increasingly polarized race into deep space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETc8lS"&gt;NASA is courting its own allies for Artemis, but it’s barred from collaborating with China, thanks to a 2011 law called the Wolf Amendment, named after the now-retired Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA). But as Beijing ups its game on the Moon, some of Biden’s space advisors have argued against the Chinese exclusion policy. “Trying to exclude them I think is a failing strategy,” former astronaut Pam Melroy &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/20/biden-china-space-448529"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; last year, before joining Biden’s NASA transition team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CszFKq"&gt;Lal tamps down prospects of NASA-China cooperation under Biden’s NASA: “I don’t expect China collaborations, at least on the Artemis program, in any way shape or form.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsERgx"&gt;She says the NASA-Russia relationship, on the other hand, should continue for the foreseeable future. “There’s no reason we shouldn’t be collaborating with them in deep space activities.” Despite Russia bowing out of NASA’s Lunar Gateway program, NASA said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Wednesday that “they did offer to continue exploring interoperability and we welcome such a discussion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sudb0x"&gt;International relations could extend to NASA’s climate science operations, a quieter side of the space agency that is expected to grow under Biden. Last month, NASA’s Acting Administrator Steve Jurczyk had a phone call with Russia’s space chief Dmitry Rogozin, where Jurczyk discussed NASA’s “focus on climate change studies with the help of space technology,” according to a Roscosmos statement. Rogozin “supported the idea of cooperating in this field,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZQLRN"&gt;Lal says it is too early to discuss what specific plans are in the works for boosting NASA’s role in Biden’s sweeping climate agenda. But she says it’s not just about expanding current programs or upping the workload for NASA’s existing fleet of weather satellites — it’s also about starting new programs on both domestic and international fronts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyvQ2w"&gt;“Climate is an area where we’re joined at the hip,” she says. Like the space station, where astronaut safety overrides geopolitics, “it may be necessary to even work with some of our adversaries” on an agreement for sharing crucial climate data.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best wireless earbuds to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bYiolYMHc_o81A5Rh272VmcNUGo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67005648/budsguide.6.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Whether you’re looking for an everyday pair or something for fitness, these are the best picks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="96Mp4M"&gt;The true wireless earbuds market has never been more crowded than it is in 2021. With so many to choose from, finding the best earbuds can seem daunting. But the vast selection is actually a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing: not only are there excellent picks for everyday buds to carry in your pocket, but you’ve also got a slew of options that prioritize things like noise cancellation, fitness, lengthy battery life, and comfort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktn8kt"&gt;Even if you don’t consider yourself any kind of audiophile, it’s important to find a set of earbuds that sound good to you. This means different things depending on the person: do you want head-rattling bass or something more balanced with an immersive soundstage? You’ll want to find a pair with a good, reliable Bluetooth connection — all of the below picks check off that box — and enough battery life to last you through a normal day of intermittent listening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZpkO2"&gt;Remember that getting the most out of earbuds requires a good seal in your ear. Always try the various ear tip sizes that come with whichever buds you purchase — and don’t be afraid to experiment with different sizes in each ear. Ears are funny like that. Many of these earbuds have apps you can install on your phone to further personalize their sound and controls the way you want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c35LSu"&gt;If you’re looking for the overall best noise-canceling earbuds, you’ll be very happy with Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds. They have best-in-class noise cancellation and sound great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PcI69T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386455"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tVD5bj"&gt;But if you’ve got other priorities, there is a range of great options from Apple, Beats, Jabra, Sennheiser, and Ultimate Ears that won’t disappoint. This guide covers higher-end wireless earbuds. If you’re on the hunt for more affordable options, check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575716/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds-budget"&gt;the best cheap wireless earbuds to buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="pNy3BT"&gt;The best wireless earbuds in 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="4hCfqL"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ds_HnWvvgrCsv6J7sKcYODjSnto=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21946559/IMG_0720-1.0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds are the best noise-canceling wireless earbuds you can get.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cp52EH"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507552/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-best-noise-cancellation"&gt;Bose QuietComfort Earbuds&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="f3y5ZM"&gt;Best noise-canceling earbuds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JzPVlZ"&gt;The QuietComfort Earbuds offer very powerful active noise cancellation, but what’s equally nice about them is how customizable the ANC is. You can choose between 11 different levels of noise cancellation (based on how much of the outside world you want mixed in) and set three favorites to cycle between when you double-tap the left earbud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6H0xo"&gt;Bose’s premium earbuds put out fantastic audio with punchy bass. Their transparency / ambient mode is second only to Apple in how natural it sounds. And even the voice mics work well, so you really get the whole package — as you should for this kind of money. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Pro remain the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners because some of their best features only work with other Apple products.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ht0eFb"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;Apple AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QpmRPm"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for the iPhone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lNbhRr"&gt;There’s no beating the interplay between AirPods and Apple’s other devices like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The AirPods Pro don’t offer the best sound quality of our top picks, but it’s perfectly satisfactory to many people. And the active noise cancellation is right up there with Bose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMXRmM"&gt;But it really all comes together if you’re in Apple’s ecosystem and also own a Mac or iPad. The AirPods Pro can automatically hop between devices based on which one you’re using, and on iPhone or iPad, spatial audio delivers immersive surround sound when watching streaming video apps. They’re fantastic for making calls with, and Apple continues to pull ahead of competitors when it comes to ease of use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3Tv5p"&gt;Here’s a tip: if none of the included ear tips get you a perfect seal, I recommend a set of memory foam tips like those from &lt;a href="https://www.complyfoam.com/products/app-comply-foam-tips-compatible-with-airpods-pro/"&gt;Comply&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1565954-REG%2Fdekoni_audio_etz_app_md3_airpods_pro_tips.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21309820%2Fbest-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dekoni&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Jabra Elite 75t are the best wireless earbuds if you want to pair with two devices simultaneously.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W40xtb"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative"&gt;Jabra Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="uDVgDy"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for multitasking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6ukiqM"&gt;Jabra is pretty much the only company making true wireless earbuds that support “multipoint” for two simultaneous Bluetooth connections. So you can pair them up with a phone and your laptop or tablet at the same time. Jabra’s mobile app offers a ton of customization over the controls, EQ, and even includes bonuses like white noise or nature sounds if you’ve got situations where they’d be handy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h8gk6p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWBz4q"&gt;The newer Elite 85t earbuds add more effective noise cancellation to the mix, but the 75ts are on sale so frequently that they’re still the go-to pick if multitasking is important to you. They pack a wallop when it comes to bass — but not to the point where it overwhelms the rest of the mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2B4Zz0"&gt;Jabra backs them with a two-year warranty in the event you experience any hardware issues. (I’ve had a 75t bud stop taking a charge out of nowhere, so it can happen.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="K2kK8C"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Powerbeats Pro have been around for some time now, but they still rank as the best wireless earbuds for fitness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MMAYVS"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8xKAQg"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for fitness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="H4ocO9"&gt;Nothing has managed to unseat the Powerbeats Pro as the best fitness earbuds since their release in 2019. Their ear hook design keeps them planted on your ears during intense exercise, they can endure your sweatiest workouts, and the nine hours of continuous battery life should get you through just about any marathon. And the sound quality is killer, with plenty of bass to keep you motivated and moving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QnM1Ez"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386623"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QtSWeK"&gt;And since Beats is owned by Apple, the Powerbeats Pro can also take advantage of features like audio sharing, auto device switching (like the AirPods Pro), and a dead-simple pairing process.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus can last for up to 11 hours on a single charge, which blows away many competitors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mRgq3W"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for battery life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KxKFD0"&gt;They can last 11 hours on a single charge. That’s what I consider marathon battery life for true wireless earbuds, and few other companies have managed to keep up with the longevity of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus. They lack active noise cancellation, so that helps them keep playing for longer, but even then, 11 hours is quite a feat. Like the Jabras, these are often on sale and easy to grab at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N4SqQ0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386734"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 2 are the best wireless earbuds in terms of sound quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Oe6jW4"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for sound quality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="VBO6Vu"&gt;Sennheiser’s second swing at true wireless earbuds improve on the original Momentums with a more comfortable fit and the addition of active noise cancellation. But everything about these earbuds is second fiddle to their sound quality: the Momentum True Wireless 2 earbuds put out dynamic, expressive, and wonderfully detailed audio. They’re the sort of buds that will bring out things in your favorite music you haven’t noticed before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdAurp"&gt;But that upgraded sound quality comes for a hefty $300 price. If you want arguably the best sound that true wireless earbuds can deliver, these are it. But all of these other picks sound plenty good in their own right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Bd9TxW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386636"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’re not going to find any silicone ear tips that can match the UE Fits and their custom tips, which mold to match your ear shape in seconds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ldQHSa"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537150/ue-fits-review-wireless-earbuds-review-custom-fit-ear-tips"&gt;UE Fits&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4qWQZj"&gt;Best wireless earbuds if comfort is everything&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Wq4SD9"&gt;If you often have difficulty finding ear tips that fit your ears comfortably, it doesn’t really get better than the UE Fits. These earbuds include special tips that mold to the shape of your ear during a 60-second fitting process that you activate with UE’s app. They get warm during molding (but not uncomfortably so) and you can feel them adapting to the contours of your ear canal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZxyrc"&gt;Once the process is done, you’re left with custom earbuds with a fit that’s as close to perfect as you’ll ever find — unless you visit your local audiologist for a professional mold, and that gets expensive fast. Ultimate Ears has a fit “guarantee” and will send you a second set of tips should your first molding attempt go awry. The UE Fits are quite good, last for up to eight hours of continuous playback, and they’re rated IPX4 for water resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These LED dice could electrify your next DnD campaign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lCPNP7fXvDSm6mD5YVeP-olD1_4=/0x0:575x383/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68954375/4bd809d32eab0a5b57fb7a635770f0b5_original.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dice are equipped with RGB lights and can communicate via Bluetooth.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Systemic Games / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pixels-dice/pixels-the-electronic-dice/" target="_blank"&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="esToTz"&gt;Sometimes it’s nice to get away from technology for a bit, settle down with some friends, and play an entire role-playing game using just pen, paper, and lots of dice. But if that’s a little low-fi for you, then there’s always &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pixels-dice/pixels-the-electronic-dice/"&gt;Pixels&lt;/a&gt;, a new set of electronic dice with built in Bluetooth and RGB LED lighting. The dice have launched on Kickstarter, with prices starting at $39. As of this writing, over 14,000 people have already backed the project for a total of over $2 million pledged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NmClN"&gt;The main attraction here is obviously the colorful RGB lighting, which creator Systemic Games promises will be customizable and programmable via a companion app. The Pixels are also waterproof, charge wirelessly via companion charging cases, and can go for around five hours on a charge, or more if you’re willing to live without the lighting. A range of die styles are available, including D20, D12, D10, D8, D6, and D4.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5V5XEXRz5a8Ho0amjh3ZZoDHePI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22365024/2tKpnK0BehxWS_wI2JARGQp0rY_D5oAmdLvANrmVhl4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Systemic Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;RGB lighting illuminates the dice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UALxwR"&gt;But for me, the most interesting thing about the dice is how they’ll apparently be able to communicate with Roll20, Foundry, and other online platforms that let you play tabletop games over the internet. At the moment a service like Roll20 relies on either virtual dice rolls, or rolling a traditional dice and then reporting back to your games master. In contrast, the Pixels could offer the best of both worlds, by letting you roll a physical die and automatically reporting the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgyML8"&gt;Yes, there are a lot of obvious jokes to be made about not being able to play a pen-and-paper RPG because your dice aren’t charged. But if you like the thought of having Bluetooth-enabled dice that light up like Christmas trees, then the Pixels are available to back on Kickstarter until April 8th. One die (including charger) starts at $39, or you can get a set of seven dice and a charging case for $199. All of the usual warnings about backing Kickstarters apply, but if all goes to plan the Pixels &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;ship in around 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google says Chrome 89 keeps your Mac cooler, and saves ‘significant memory’ on Windows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_Qbv-BhNmDXkyxvfQK2gdsr3vY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68954158/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WGWwQ1"&gt;Google has detailed the efficiency improvements it made with Chrome 89, the latest version of its browser released earlier this month. Depending on whether you’re using the browser on Windows, macOS, or Android, &lt;a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/03/advanced-memory-management-and-more.html"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; the browser should use less resources, launch quicker, and feel more responsive to use. There’s no mention of any improvements specifically for users on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKCGGw"&gt;The exact benefits vary by OS. Across platforms, Google says Chrome is able to reclaim as much as 100MiB (or over 20 percent on some sites) by using foreground tab memory more efficiently, and on macOS it’s saving up to 8 percent of its memory usage based on how it handles background tabs (something which Chrome already does on other platforms). Google says these improvements on macOS have benefited the browser’s Energy Impact score by as much as 65 percent, “keeping your Mac cooler and those fans quiet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AXUPsh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Benefits vary by platform&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="juPHtz"&gt;On Windows and Android, the browser is also using a more advanced memory allocator across more areas to further reduce memory usage, and increase browser responsiveness. On Windows, Google says it’s seeing “significant memory” savings of up to 22 percent in the “browser process,” 8 percent in the renderer, 3 percent in the GPU, and that overall browser responsiveness is improved by up to 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfkZj9"&gt;There are also a host of improvements specific to Android, which google says result in 5 percent less memory usage, fewer crashes, 7.5 percent faster startup, 2 percent faster page loads, and a 13 percent faster startup. High-end Android devices running on Android 10 and newer with at least 8GB of RAM should also load pages 8.5 percent faster, and be 28 percent smoother to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QkvGUi"&gt;Google has made similar promises about previous Chrome releases. For example &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571832/google-chrome-2020-speed-memory-improvements"&gt;it said Chrome 87&lt;/a&gt;, released at the end of last year, was “the largest gain in Chrome performance in years.” Under-the-hood performance improvements were said to improve everything from CPU usage, power efficiency, and startup times. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Almost a fifth of Facebook employees are now working on VR and AR: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MGq5s7i3wdwj1cX2qiTydCgCAb4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68954014/akrales_200904_4160_0158.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0HJRLR"&gt;Facebook has nearly 10,000 employees in its division working on augmented reality and virtual reality devices, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-people-with-power-at-facebook-as-its-hardware-commerce-ambitions-expand"&gt;report in &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; based on internal organizational data. The number means the Reality Labs division accounts for almost a fifth of the people working at Facebook worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7oIaw"&gt;This suggests that Facebook has been significantly accelerating its VR and AR efforts. As &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/5-percent-facebooks-employees-working-vrar/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; noted in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, the Oculus VR division accounted for over a thousand employees at a time when Facebook’s headcount was 18,770 overall, indicating a percentage somewhere north of five percent. &lt;/p&gt;

The $299 Quest 2 was preordered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541535/oculus-quest-2-preorders-sales-developers-zuckerberg"&gt;five times as much as its predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, with developers seeing a boost in sales of their existing titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04wIzA"&gt;“Today, most of what Facebook does is…we’re building on top of other people’s platforms,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg told &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; in an &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mark-zuckerberg-on-mind-reading-apple-and-the-race-to-mainstream-vr"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; this week on Facebook’s VR and AR ambitions. “I think it really makes sense for us to invest deeply to help shape what I think is going to be the next major computing platform, this combination of augmented and virtual reality, to make sure that it develops in this way that is fundamentally about people being present with each other and coming together.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <updated>2021-03-11T20:39:16-05:00</updated>
    <title>Los Angeles movie-goers will soon be able to visit a theater for the first time in a year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="AMC movie theater logo (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pnTzIzt6s_l3rW0m-52bhwY0pJ0=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68952793/amc-movie-theater-logo_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m7ej3k"&gt;Los Angeles theaters will be &lt;a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=3014"&gt;allowed to reopen at 25 percent capacity&lt;/a&gt; next week, according to the LA Department of Public Health (&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/la-movie-theaters-reopening-25-percent-capacity-1234928619/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The restrictions are being lifted, almost &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/coronavirus-movie-theaters-new-york-close-1203532292/"&gt;exactly a year after&lt;/a&gt; they were put in place, because Los Angeles County believes it will reach the number of vaccinations required by California to move into the next phase of reopening. The movie capitol’s theater re-opening comes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295880/new-york-city-movie-theaters-open-cuomo"&gt;a few weeks after New York’s&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that two of the biggest movie markets will once again be uncapping their projectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4UaPK2"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;notes, this doesn’t mean that the theaters will be able to open as soon as the ban lifts — they’ve been closed for so long that they’ll have to re-hire and train staff, which could take a week or two. The theaters will also have to ensure that they can meet the safety and cleaning requirements required by California, and will have to set up a reservation system if they don’t already have one — any theater reopening will be required to have moviegoers book their seats in advance. Attendees will also be required to wear masks, and groups will have to be at least six feet apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tila7y"&gt;Theaters will also have to figure out which movies to show (a somewhat important part of the moviegoing experience), as most major releases &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243496/bond-uncharted-ghostbusters-movie-delays"&gt;have been pushed back to the second half of the year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmFbaN"&gt;The future was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504536/movie-theaters-close-regal-cineworld-amc-cinemark"&gt;looking grim for movie theaters back in October&lt;/a&gt;, with many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/3/21500538/regal-cineworld-theaters-shut-down-james-bond-us-uk"&gt;theater chains shutting down all their locations&lt;/a&gt; in the US and UK, some permanently. The picture has been looking brighter since then, with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22279023/covid-19-vaccine-appointment-how-to"&gt;arrival of the vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324053/amc-theaters-earnings-fourth-quarter-stock-movies-vaccine-streaming"&gt;AMC said yesterday that it believes it’ll be able to weather the storm&lt;/a&gt; until most Americans are able to see movies again. Whether the public will rush back to movie theaters remains to be seen, as some of the year’s most anticipated films &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;will be released side-by-side on streaming&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden: ‘all American adults will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1st’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Address To Nation On Covid-19 Pandemic" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aqhh3o_h12KCo8lv8vfpuWEqzSg=/0x0:3936x2624/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68952717/1231655585.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yXHuzy"&gt;President Joe Biden just announced that he will direct states to make all adults eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations by May 1st. He also said that the federal government will launch a website on May 1st that will let people check where they can get a vaccine near them. He made both announcements during his first prime-time televised address as President on Thursday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxvMFb"&gt;“All American adults will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1st,” says Biden. “That doesn’t mean everyone’s going to have that shot immediately. But it means you’ll be able to get in line beginning on May 1.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="6asIdq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jM5Q0n"&gt;The administration also plans to increase the number of places administering vaccinations and expand the group of medical professionals who can give the shots. All these steps should help states get shots in arms, increasing the likelihood that the country will hit its vaccination targets, and return to something resembling normalcy. The US will have enough doses available to vaccinate every adult in the country &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22316094/covid-19-vaccine-supplies-us-antivirus-newsletter"&gt;by the end of May.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lxpThf"&gt;Biden says the goal is for families to be able to celebrate together again by the Fourth of July, but made no promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IUgN3Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“you’ll be able to get in line beginning on May 1.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="picIxx"&gt;This isn’t the first time a US president has promised a large-scale website as part of its efforts to fight COVID-19. In March 2020, as the nation was coming to terms with the fast-spreading virus, former president Donald Trump announced that Google had 1,700 engineers working on a nationwide website that people could use to determine if they should get tested and where they could do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ifUO0"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21197026/trump-coronavirus-testing-website-plan-google-covid-19"&gt;wasn’t true&lt;/a&gt;, however — Verily, another company owned by Google parent Alphabet, was in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179118/google-coronavirus-testing-screening-website-drive-thru-covid-19"&gt;the early stages&lt;/a&gt; on a testing website that was intended to serve parts of California. And that 1,700 number reportedly came from a list of Google employees &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/politics/trump-google-coronavirus.html"&gt;who said they would volunteer&lt;/a&gt; for the project. Trump’s promised website never launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FzzQs1"&gt;Biden also said that his administration will deploy teams to help states in need of support for their own vaccine-scheduling websites. The government will also establish a call center to help &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/11/us/joe-biden-news#in-his-prime-time-speech-biden-will-direct-states-to-make-all-adult-americans-eligible-for-vaccine-by-may-1"&gt;people without internet access&lt;/a&gt; make a vaccine appointment. The announcements follow Biden’s signing of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/10/22320350/stimulus-bill-covid-19-passes-house"&gt;earlier on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, which includes $1,400 stimulus checks for many Americans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7AIOU"&gt;Vaccines are slowly becoming more available in the US, but it is still a challenge for many to get them or even book an appointment. That has led to the homegrown development of services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320344/dr-b-covid-vaccine-standby-list-coronavirus-immunization-overflow"&gt;Dr. B&lt;/a&gt;, which notifies people about thawed vaccines that would otherwise go to waste, and &lt;a href="https://nycvaccinelist.com/"&gt;NYC Vaccine List&lt;/a&gt;, which can help people book vaccine appointments in the NYC area. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also offers a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/reporting/vaccinefinder/about.html"&gt;vaccine finder website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neaCKi"&gt;If you’re looking to score a vaccine appointment ahead of May 1st, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22279023/covid-19-vaccine-appointment-how-to"&gt;check out our guide&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s ‘culture fit’ is the focus of a discrimination complaint, report says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZO9S4xs2UARQy9XgLuVb-1ibRyw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68952281/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X5Kywb"&gt;A Black woman who interviewed at Facebook last year says she was told the company was “looking for a culture fit” before being rejected, &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/11/facebook-hiring-racism-eeoc/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; She’s now one of four people who’ve recently complained to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) about allegedly racist hiring and promotion practices at the tech giant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="002qf0"&gt;The woman says she was well-suited to the managerial position on Facebook’s Global Impact Partnerships team due to her work experience and relevant doctoral degree, &lt;em&gt;The Intercept &lt;/em&gt;reports. Yet she alleged that during in-person meetings, she “sensed that the interviewers were not prioritizing her interviews because all of the interviews seemed rushed after making her wait for several hours.” &lt;em&gt;The Intercept &lt;/em&gt;agreed not to use the woman’s real name as a condition of receiving the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWIcI7"&gt;All the interviewers were white,&lt;em&gt; The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; reports. Only 3.9 percent of Facebook’s US workforce is Black, &lt;a href="https://diversity.fb.com/read-report/"&gt;according to a recent diversity report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzlsJy"&gt;The news comes on the heels of an EEOC investigation into allegations of racial bias in Facebook’s hiring and promotion processes. The probe has been categorized as “systemic,” meaning the agency “suspects” these policies “may be contributing to widespread discrimination,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-workers-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-agency-probes-facebook-for-systemic-racial-bias-in-hiring-promotions-idUSKBN2AY006"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNzk6d"&gt;The woman also alleged that one Facebook staffer told her “There’s no doubt you can do the job, but we’re really looking for a culture fit.” The term is widely used in the tech industry to refer to job applicants who staffers would want to have a beer with. But experts say it’s a “misguided hiring strategy” that can contribute to a lack of diversity, “since very often the people we enjoy hanging out with have backgrounds much like our own,” &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/how-to-hire"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcrBmB"&gt;The complaint alleges that the company’s discrimination against Black applicants is partly predicated on its “strong consideration of ‘culture fit’ in hiring, without providing sufficient objective guidance to managers and other employees on how to determine which applicants and employees will be a good ‘culture fit’ at Facebook,” &lt;em&gt;The Intercept &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfCb7B"&gt;Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4SObh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft says the latest Xbox Series X update fixes controller disconnect issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MfJ7O76VTZRgrZIjR96rgiRN8VI=/9x0:2631x1748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68952172/twarren_xboxseriesxcontroller_VLS_3616_2_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x4lfJQ"&gt;Microsoft released a &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/09/march-xbox-update-details/"&gt;new Xbox update&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that brings toggles for Auto HDR and FPS Boost and improvements to better support the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285247/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-release-date-price-features"&gt;Xbox Wireless Headset&lt;/a&gt;. But there was another big feature that wasn’t mentioned in the official release notes: the update also fixes “many” of the Xbox Series X controller disconnect issues that have cropped up, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jronald/status/1369696666278711298"&gt;according to the Xbox team’s Jason Ronald&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eKXYNw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Lots of Xbox news this week, but in case you missed it we released our March Xbox System Update yesterday. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to the new features, this release also fixes many of the controller disconnects players have reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep the feedback coming.&lt;a href="https://t.co/bltTsL6Lty"&gt;https://t.co/bltTsL6Lty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Ronald (@jronald) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jronald/status/1369696666278711298?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Iwj24H"&gt;Players began reporting disconnect issues with the controllers just days after the console’s launch, and you can see some of those reports in this &lt;a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/xba_console/xbox-series-x-controller-keeps-disconnecting/16d9f462-57c0-4b6c-93fd-b03711e632ee?page=1"&gt;89-page thread on Microsoft’s support forums&lt;/a&gt;. In January, however, Microsoft acknowledged that it was aware of the issues and said that fixes were coming “in a future update” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215289/microsoft-xbox-series-x-controller-disconnect-update"&gt;in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CE9M9E"&gt;We haven’t tested the new update ourselves to see if it fixes issues that people have seen. But if you have been experiencing controller disconnects, it sounds like the new update could address them for you.&lt;/p&gt;
