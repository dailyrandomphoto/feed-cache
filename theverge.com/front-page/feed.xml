    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GtC8jn"&gt;President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are set to make history today when they will be sworn into office as president and vice president. Because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and heightened security following this month’s deadly attack on the Capitol, Inauguration Day will be unlike any other before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N00qxb"&gt;Here’s how to watch and participate in the historic day’s events from home:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WBwyMg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When is the presidential inauguration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PRkbao"&gt;The inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will begin on Wednesday, January 20th, in Washington, DC. Soon after Biden takes his oath of office, he will deliver an inaugural address outlining his vision for the next four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DR6uV3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What time does the inauguration start?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eu3URr"&gt;The inauguration will officially begin at 12PM ET. But other events, like the national anthem, will start before the official event at 11:30AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gPwmt5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can you watch the inauguration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dozqET"&gt;The Biden Presidential Inaugural Committee will host a free stream of the inauguration at &lt;a href="http://bideninaugural.org"&gt;bideninaugural.org&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/bideninaugural"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wt5Xig"&gt;&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/live"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://foxnews.com/"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="http://msnbc.com"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt; News, &lt;a href="http://cnn.com"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://pbs.org"&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt; will all host live streams of the event on their websites as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iZjlMS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is performing at the inauguration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iGtsiX"&gt;Lady Gaga is set to perform the national anthem, and Jennifer Lopez will provide a musical performance as well. For people watching from home, the inaugural committee has planned for a “virtual parade” that will feature additional musical guests and other performances “paying homage to America’s heroes on the front lines of the pandemic” as the new president makes his way to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwGpZc"&gt;At 8:30PM ET Wednesday, the inauguration will be followed by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/arts/music/biden-inauguration-performers.html"&gt;a primetime television event&lt;/a&gt; hosted by Tom Hanks. Other celebrities like Justin Timberlake, Demi Lovato, and Jon Bon Jovi will perform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hYuV5j"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who will attend the inauguration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpXBS4"&gt;George W. Bush, Laura Bush, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Bill Clinton will all be in attendance, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/inauguration-day.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. President Donald Trump will not be attending the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgwKPH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vscC4l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve and five game publishers fined millions for geo-blocking Steam games in EU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TqUsHnAk32gPbM7hCGGPxnuGPyg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68693777/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x9WwKp"&gt;Valve and five PC video game publishers have been fined a total of €7.8 million (around $9.5 million) &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_170"&gt;by the European Commission&lt;/a&gt; for restricting cross-border game sales in the European Economic Area. The Commission said that the companies geo-blocked around 100 PC video games, preventing them from being activated and played outside certain EU countries. This broke the EU’s Digital Single Market rules which prohibit those types of barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJIq40"&gt;The European Commission says the geo-blocking was to prevent games being activated outside Czechia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Geo-blocking prevents gamers living in EU countries with higher average incomes from being able to save money buying them in EU states where they’re cheaper and then activating them on Steam. Activation keys were geo-blocked between 2010 and 2015, the European Commission said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TFQa6N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Under EU competition law, companies are prohibited from contractually restricting cross-border sales”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P7l35j"&gt;“Today’s sanctions against the ‘geo-blocking’ practices of Valve and five PC video game publishers serve as a reminder that under EU competition law, companies are prohibited from contractually restricting cross-border sales,” the European Commission’s head of competition policy said. “Such practices deprive European consumers of the benefits of the EU Digital Single Market and of the opportunity to shop around for the most suitable offer in the EU.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wG9oQL"&gt;Five publishers were fined in total. Focus Home was fined almost €2.9 million (around $ 3.5 million), ZeniMax over €1.6 million (around $2 million), Koch Media almost €1 million (around $1.2 million), Capcom €396,000 (around $480,000), and Bandai Namco €340,000 (around $410,000). Because each of these companies cooperated with the investigation, their fines were reduced by between 10 and 15 percent. Valve, however, chose not to cooperate, and was fined over €1.6 million (around $1.9 million).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWM1gz"&gt;The European Commission opened its formal investigation into the practice of geo-blocking back in 2017, and formally asked Valve to stop the practice &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18296527/european-commission-valve-antitrust-objections-games-price"&gt;back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Valve has previously argued that only a small number of games used region-locked activation keys, and argued it shouldn’t be liable for region locks requested by publishers. It said it ended the practice in 2015, with limited exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new Chrome 88 update improves dark mode, removes FTP and Adobe Flash</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MAF2XnNaP3FgzeEStm_2ai2Wkfk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68693638/acastro_200207_3900_chrome_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qUXTXZ"&gt;Google is releasing a new version of Chrome this week that will improve its dark mode support, alongside removing FTP and Adobe Flash support. The dark mode improvements can be found on both Windows and Chrome OS. There are refinements to both the light and dark modes in Chrome OS, with the themes updated for the app launcher, quick settings, and shelf parts of Chrome OS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhN4ML"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/709576/whats-new-in-chrome-88-available-today/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How To Geek &lt;/em&gt;also reports&lt;/a&gt; that the Windows 10 dark mode is improved with Chrome 88, with scroll bars finally appearing dark. Unfortunately, these are currently limited to the settings, bookmarks, history, and new tab pages of Chrome 88 and not across all websites with dark themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUT3HW"&gt;Elsewhere, Google is also removing some old web technology in Chrome 88. The File Transport Protocol (FTP) is officially disabled with this latest version, removing support for a protocol that has been used for decades to send files across the web.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jucvsj_JiAao9HxESoCGChkbkM4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247087/P7oLa5S.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrome’s new tab search feature.&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7dIT7E"&gt;Adobe Flash is also being fully removed from Chrome 88, after being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/15/11679394/chrome-to-block-flash-later-2016"&gt;initially blocked&lt;/a&gt; and then disabled in recent years. The removal of Flash from Chrome marks the end of an era, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/31/22208190/adobe-flash-is-dead"&gt;Adobe’s discontinued support on December 31st&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsdpUi"&gt;Google is also experimenting with some new features for Chrome. Both tab search and less intrusive website permission requests can be found hidden away in Chrome 88. You’ll need to enable the new tab search using &lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;chrome://flags/#enable-tab-search&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, and it will appear as a new drop down arrow in the Chrome tab UI. Smaller permission prompts can also be enabled from &lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;chrome://flags/#permission-chip&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is investigating another top AI ethicist</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0yjBmbhDOf2wv7QYCf18yMSXH1s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68693538/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LrMBeF"&gt;Google is investigating artificial intelligence researcher Margaret Mitchell, who co-leads the company’s Ethical AI team, and has locked her corporate account, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-google-is-investigating-the-actions-of-another-top-ai-ethicist-50030739-ea3d-4ea2-b452-c228b4fc9773.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The news comes a little over a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;another prominent AI ethicist&lt;/a&gt;, Timnit Gebru, said she was fired by the company. Mitchell’s account has now reportedly been locked for “at least a few days” but she hasn’t been fired, according to a tweet from Gebru. Mitchell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dHkiQ"&gt;In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;, Google said it was investigating Mitchell after its systems detected an account had “exfiltrated thousands of files and shared them with multiple 	external accounts.” According to an &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; source, Mitchell had been using a script to go through her messages, finding examples of discriminatory treatment of Gebru. Last week, Mitchell tweeted to say she was documenting &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1349994887031054337"&gt;“current critical issues from [Gebru’s] firing, point by point, inside and outside work.&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="twSFEs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just after midnight. Hit 10 pages documenting current critical issues from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@timnitGebru&lt;/a&gt; 's firing, point by point , inside and outside work. For Jeff Dean and whoever might actually read it (no one?). Wistfully remembering when I used to do research.&lt;/p&gt;— MMitchell (@mmitchell_ai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1349994887031054337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcPnxd"&gt;Google said its security systems automatically lock corporate employee accounts “when they detect that the account is at risk of compromise due to credential problems or when an automated rule involving the handling of sensitive data has been triggered.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jS4TqL"&gt;“We explained this to the employee earlier today,” Google said, “We are actively investigating this matter as part of standard procedures to gather additional details.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="r4mzT0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;She's not fired **yet**. But apparently they've told her she will be locked out for at least a few days. &lt;a href="https://t.co/H1ibkgNQHM"&gt;https://t.co/H1ibkgNQHM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Timnit Gebru (@timnitGebru) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1351713824295038980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HWtWHb"&gt;Mitchell has previously tweeted in support of Gebru, and has been critical of Google and other big tech companies for their approaches to diversity and systematic bias. Yesterday she &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1351619240982319107"&gt;tweeted to criticize&lt;/a&gt; Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s approach towards workplace diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Et4cn"&gt;Google faced widespread criticism after Gebru left the company. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-20/google-sidelines-second-artificial-intelligence-researcher"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that thousands of internal employees and external academics and campaigners signing a petition in support of the AI researcher. The company has faced ongoing criticism for its work on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/6/17086276/google-ai-military-drone-analysis-pentagon-project-maven-tensorfow"&gt;Project Maven&lt;/a&gt;, an AI project designed to improve military drone strikes. Opposition to the project was named as a key reason when Google employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212347/google-employees-contractors-announce-union-cwa-alphabet"&gt;announced plans to unionize&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG considers exiting smartphones in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6rYe3nGzf14NboHm3NHAY_lXxSc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68693536/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s Wing smartphone.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7oHyWw"&gt;LG is considering exiting the smartphone market in 2021. After losing around $4.5 billion over the past five years, LG’s smartphone business has been struggling to compete with rivals. Now LG CEO Kwon Bong-seok has notified employees that the company is considering making big changes to its smartphone business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAxPp8"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210120000992"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Korea Herald &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Kwon Bong-seok sent out an internal memo to staff on Wednesday, hinting at a change in direction for LG’s phone business. “Since the competition in the global market for mobile devices is getting fiercer, it is about time for LG to make a cold judgment and the best choice,” says an LG official in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Korea Herald&lt;/em&gt;. “The company is considering all possible measures, including sale, withdrawal and downsizing of the smartphone business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spmpoo"&gt;LG confirmed the internal memo was genuine in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, noting that nothing has been decided yet. “LG Electronics management is committed to making whatever decision is necessary to resolve its mobile business challenges in 2021,” says an LG spokesperson. “As of today, nothing has been finalized.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="LG’s Rollable phone." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rBRVGC5zKuEfIfeolgy1-9csSGM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227268/lgrollable.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s Rollable phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oW7JbP"&gt;This new internal memo follows a now-deleted report from Korean outlet &lt;em&gt;TheElec &lt;/em&gt;earlier this month that claimed LG was planning to exit the smartphone business. LG branded that report “completely false and without merit,” &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/15/no-lg-isnt-exiting-the-smartphone-business/"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;just a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obyGsF"&gt;LG has previously promised “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058238/lg-smartphone-profitable-2021-apple-samsung-ces-mwc"&gt;wow factors&lt;/a&gt;” to try and attract consumers and make its flagging mobile division profitable. LG has tried multiple times with the G7, the V40, the G8, and the V50 to compete with Samsung and Huawei, but it’s not been enough to push its market share in the right direction. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304097/lg-velvet-phone-review-price-us-specs-camera"&gt;LG’s latest Velvet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;Wing smartphones&lt;/a&gt; have attempted to try something new, but neither were well received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T40dIU"&gt;Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, Vivo, and Apple all continue to dominate worldwide smartphone shipments, &lt;a href="https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor"&gt;according to IDC&lt;/a&gt;. LG is now turning its focus to its Rollable phone, in an effort to differentiate it from the competition. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224591/lg-rollable-phone-extending-display-teaser-ces-2021"&gt;LG teased the Rollable device&lt;/a&gt; again at the Consumer Electronics Show last week, with a “unique resizable screen” that extends from a phone to become a small tablet display. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz unveils EQA electric crossover with less than 300 miles of range</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Mo57urRsnSsGZUSVbTjoFuyZkI=/0x0:1280x853/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68693490/20C0579_036.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Mercedes-Benz&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kpNnyW"&gt;Mercedes-Benz threw back the curtain on the EQA crossover, its latest electric vehicle as part of a slate of new EVs that are being planned for the coming years. The compact SUV will have a range of less than 300 miles, a 66.5kWh battery pack, and a net list price of €39,950 ($48,442). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHD54Y"&gt;The EQA, which is based on the German automaker’s GLA-class of SUVs, is scheduled to go into production this year in Europe, but likely won’t make it to the US anytime soon. That said, a spokesperson for Daimler, Mercedes-Benz’s parent company, said the EQA is still being considered for the US market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QE8318"&gt;American car buyers would do better waiting for the EQB electric crossover, which will be closely related to the boxier GLB-class vehicle. The EQB is also scheduled to go into production later this year. Meanwhile, the EQS and EQE models will be the first EVs built on Mercedes’ new modular electric vehicle platform. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AcTPgKBR7__di3zJZOjR4FygtHA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22246022/20C0579_042.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dN0mHF"&gt;The EQA is built on the same vehicle platform as the $68,000 EQC SUV, which was supposed to start shipping in the US at the start of 2020 but was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21024073/mercedes-benz-eqc-electric-delay-us-launch-2021"&gt;pushed to 2021&lt;/a&gt;. And like with the EQC, Mercedes is relying on the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) to make a range estimate of 486 kilometers (300 miles) for the EQA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUkHyt"&gt;That’s unfortunate because the NEDC standard is widely considered to be outdated and is in the process of being replaced with the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) that is supposed to be a bit more stringent. The US Environmental Protection Agency performs its own testing to set range estimates for electric cars, which tended to be lower than the NEDC and are considered to be closer to real-world performance. If and when the EQA comes to the US, it’s very likely that its EPA-estimated range will be less than 300 miles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neieWH"&gt;The EQA, which is launching as “EQA 250,” will have a 66.5kWh battery pack, which is slightly above average for the EVs on the road today. Tesla’s biggest battery is 100kWh, available in the Model S and Model X, which is one of the biggest batteries currently available. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jljbcHETe7OGJgXEu79zximmvIA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22246023/20C0579_057.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7aJumO"&gt;The EQA will start in Germany at €47,540.50. Mercedes says it plans to release additional variants of the crossover, including an all-wheel drive version with an additional electric powertrain that increases the power output to 200kW or more, while also offering a version with a range of more than 500 kilometers (310 miles) based on the WLTP standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bai4ro"&gt;Interested buyers will have some options when it comes to the EQA’s interior. They can either choose two 7-inch displays for both the instrument cluster and main infotainment screen, or a widescreen variant with two 10.25-inch displays. It won’t have Mercedes-Benz’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217267/mercedes-benz-hyperscreen-size-specs-eqs-ces-2021"&gt;recently revealed&lt;/a&gt;, mammoth, pillar-to-pillar, 56-inch touchscreen that will debut in the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504049/mercedes-benz-eqs-electric-sedan-eqe-suv"&gt;EQS luxury electric sedan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6khG9Y"&gt;The EQA will come standard with the automaker’s second-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21316700/mercedes-benz-mbux-second-generation-infotainment-system-touchscreen-hey-mercedes"&gt;MBUX infotainment system&lt;/a&gt; that eschews physical buttons in favor of a completely digital (and voice-controlled) in-car user experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFRXzm"&gt;Mercedes-Benz sees the EQA as an “entry point” into the automaker’s growing family of electric vehicles. More modestly priced than the EQC SUV, the new crossover is sure to find its fair share of interested buyers. The question is whether the German automaker can compete for EV-curious shoppers when Volkswagen, Tesla, BMW, and others appear to be progressing at a faster pace. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump pardons convicted ex-Google engineer Anthony Levandowski</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Anthony Levandowski In Court For Bond Hearing After Being Charged With Stealing Google Trade Secrets" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j9ZGx_kUSbwk1Zaofz11W5N-Pak=/0x0:3587x2391/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68693341/1172284877.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9UnvaV"&gt;One of President Trump’s final acts in office is to pardon a former Google engineer who was convicted of stealing trade secrets. Anthony Levandowski worked for Google’s self-driving car division, now called Waymo, before leaving to found Otto, a self-driving truck company that was acquired by Uber. He was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354906/anthony-levandowski-waymo-uber-lawsuit-sentence-18-months-prison-lawsuit"&gt;sentenced&lt;/a&gt; to 18 months in prison in August, with judge William Alsup describing the incident as the “biggest trade secret crime I have ever seen.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVD8zv"&gt;Levandowski was found to have downloaded thousands of files to his laptop before he left Google and entered into sale discussions. Uber ultimately fired him after Google sued, and Levandowski remains in a legal battle with the ride-hailing company, claiming it should be liable for the $179 million he was ordered to pay Google. In a separate suit, Levandowski has argued Uber owes him billions of dollars in lost value from the Otto deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HuwXgF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My family and I are grateful for the opportunity to move forward, and thankful to the President and others who supported and advocated on my behalf.&lt;/p&gt;— Anthony Levandowski (@antlevandowski) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/antlevandowski/status/1351802927883587586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2Ywbap"&gt;Levandowski never began his sentence, as Alsup allowed it to be delayed indefinitely because of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-executive-grants-clemency-012021/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the White House, Levandowski’s pardon was supported by figures from the tech industry including controversial billionaire investor Peter Thiel, fellow Founders Fund partner Trae Stephens, Thiel Capital COO Blake Masters, Hollywood agent and Palantir advisor Michael Ovitz, and Oculus and Anduril founder Palmer Luckey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhPO1v"&gt;Alongside Levandowski, Trump has pardoned 72 other individuals and commuted the prison sentences of 70 more. The list includes rappers Lil Wayne, who pled guilty to a firearms possession charge last year, and Kodak Black, who is currently in prison on weapons charges. Trump also granted a pardon to Steve Bannon, the former Breitbart News boss who served as chief strategist to Trump until his acrimonious departure in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ucwYxu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, Jan 20th, 3.45AM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added Levandowski’s tweet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkEOKj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; a previous version of this story misidentified a company co-founded by Palmer Luckey. It is Anduril, not Palantir. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk’s flamethrower was not a flamethrower, but that isn’t stopping police</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9_9n4_v4m-g450qb2-PLhw7wZE8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68692290/llopatto_180609_2658_0068.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by random stranger in the crowd&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FD3rzo"&gt;Mark Harris has put together &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/elon-musk-said-it-was-not-a-flamethrower/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;an amazing report&lt;/a&gt; for TechCrunch on the legal troubles that have befallen buyers of the Boring Company’s flame-throwing device. Part of what makes it worth a read is that it digs up stories you may have not heard about yet: a police raid in London, an American doing time in an Italian prison, and how they’ve turned up in narcotics hauls alongside real guns and bags of cocaine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1RJ2qE"&gt;While the Not a Flamethrower name &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17445838/boring-company-flamethrower-elon-musk-tweets-party"&gt;may actually be accurate&lt;/a&gt;, the story shows that when police the world over see you with a gun-shaped device, especially one that shoots flames, they may not join you in laughing about Elon’s zany project ideas. They may just end up arresting you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E7okhT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s a toy they sell to children.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E7okhT"&gt;The biggest “what the heck” moment of the story for me was when a lawyer says of the Not a Flamethrower: “It’s a toy they sell to children.” Please, if you were one of the people who got this device — do not give it to a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiueNt"&gt;While the product may be Boring, the article certainly is not, and you should definitely &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/elon-musk-said-it-was-not-a-flamethrower/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;go give it a read&lt;/a&gt;. I promise you won’t get burned.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mojang is retiring the old Minecraft Dungeons launcher</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8HAUj73llPEwcDdRCsObD9WdN4M=/375x0:7625x4833/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68692176/Screenshot_Combat_HiRes.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="awck9Y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft Dungeons&lt;/em&gt;’ dedicated launcher on PC is being retired &lt;a href="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360053351331"&gt;in favor of a new “Unified Launcher”&lt;/a&gt; that lets you launch &lt;em&gt;Dungeons&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft: Java Edition &lt;/em&gt;from the same place,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reducing the number of places where you can play &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; on PC by one (via &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-unified-launcher-now-available-offers-access-minecraft-and-minecraft-dungeons-pc?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wmexperts+%28Windows+Central%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XErjdg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft Dungeons&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270311/minecraft-dungeons-reviews-xbox-pc-switch-ps4"&gt;the hack-and-slash loot collecting cousin of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that, until this change, had its own launcher unless it was purchased from the Microsoft Store. As of January 18th, the non-Microsoft Store version of &lt;em&gt;Dungeons&lt;/em&gt; on PC can only be launched from the new Unified Launcher (which itself is an update to the Java launcher). Mojang says the change shouldn’t affect save files and that either a Microsoft account (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21527647/minecraft-microsoft-account-mojang-java"&gt;soon to be required to play on PC&lt;/a&gt;) or a Mojang account can be used to log in to the launcher.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tODDe9zbSNKZzOkYv2OGwxA9u5w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22246238/UnifiedLauncher.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An account screen from the new unified Minecraft launcher.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="52VdNP"&gt; Here are the remaining ways and places you can play &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; on PC after the changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="DwS1Yz"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Minecraft Windows 10 Edition&lt;/em&gt; (sometimes just called &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Minecraft: Bedrock Edition&lt;/em&gt;) is managed through the Microsoft Store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pb80oh"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Minecraft: Java Edition&lt;/em&gt; is managed through the Unified Launcher, but you can also play without updating, for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nY3qok"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Minecraft: Education Edition&lt;/em&gt; (the specialty version of the game for schools) is managed through its own launcher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="M7IbPj"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Minecraft Dungeons&lt;/em&gt; (a &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;spin-off) is either managed in the Unified Launcher or the Microsoft Store if you’re using Xbox Game Pass for PC or you bought it from there. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="U8a9OP"&gt;Consolidating where you launch two &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; games doesn’t do much to help confusion over the many different types of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, but for any person who enjoyed playing both &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Dungeons&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft: Java Edition&lt;/em&gt;, it’s now a little bit more convenient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xw55XS"&gt;You can find out more information about the change and how to download the new launcher on &lt;a href="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360053351331"&gt;Mojang’s &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; Help Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Storytelling incubator Wattpad is getting bought for over half a billion dollars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4--JaeOqjDNoFWullF7axPog96M=/0x34:1440x994/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68691965/126866607_1781483032008933_7991615642394760692_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;After We Collided&lt;em&gt;, a sequel to a film adaptation that came from a Wattpad author.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Aviron&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JDjztp"&gt;Last week, we told you how Wattpad has become a place where budding authors can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22215052/wattpad-authors-fanfiction-netflix-hulu-streaming-movies-romcom-teen-drama"&gt;sometimes turn their work into Hollywood film and TV&lt;/a&gt;, with Hulu, Netflix and others adapting Wattpad writers’ labors into titles like &lt;em&gt;The Kissing Booth, Light as a Feather &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;After We Collided&lt;/em&gt;. But it looks like Wattpad may no longer be trying to become an entertainment tastemaker all on its own — South Korean web company Naver is buying Wattpad for over $600 million, &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/webtoon-parent-naver-announces-approval-of-agreement-to-acquire-wattpad-301211308.html"&gt;the companies announced today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teMxsS"&gt;While details are scarce, it seems like Naver already sees Wattpad as a natural pairing with one of its other brands — Webtoon, an online webtoon publishing portal that similarly allows artists to upload their own work and similarly spawns TV and anime adaptations.(Here’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_Webtoon#Adaptations"&gt;a handy list of those adaptations from Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0ZfAml"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A new chapter in our story is about to be written, and we're not writing it alone... We’re thrilled to announce our board has approved an agreement to be acquired by Naver, home of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/webtoonofficial?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@webtoonofficial&lt;/a&gt;! Read the exciting news → &lt;a href="https://t.co/xgwGtD4nVz"&gt;https://t.co/xgwGtD4nVz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/fzoIJyTWrp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fzoIJyTWrp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Wattpad (@wattpad) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wattpad/status/1351676903363645441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wbp2I8"&gt;Wattpad’s press release explicitly mentions Webtoon, and &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/webtoon-parent-naver-announces-approval-of-agreement-to-acquire-wattpad-301211308.html"&gt;Webtoon was the one to issue a press release&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of its parent company Naver as well. Here’s how Webtoon describes the buyout:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Y73BlD"&gt;With the backing of Korean technology giant, NAVER, WEBTOON and Wattpad will collaborate to create a stronger and connected ecosystem across visual and textual storytelling content, with a combined reader base of over 160 million monthly users globally. WEBTOON’s innovative monetization model and Wattpad’s massive library of diverse stories will provide each prospective affiliate with new levers for growth, creating a stronger foundation to fund an aspiring generation of young, creative talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dUVU2I"&gt;However, Wattpad co-founder Allen Lau &lt;a href="https://betakit.com/wattpad-to-be-acquired-by-south-koreas-naver-corp/"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;BetaKit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that his company will continue to operate independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozQV9q"&gt;Naver is a popular search engine in South Korea, and competes with the likes of Google and Facebook in other ways too.
