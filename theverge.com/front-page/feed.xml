    <title>The Moto G Stylus 5G is a step-up version of our favorite budget stylus phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y6xaGFnsQTnJYX_FLp51TJpPa0Y=/0x84:2000x1417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69427223/moto_g_stylus_5G_Cosmic_Emerald_Hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Stylus 5G features a 6.8-inch screen and a large 5,000mAh battery.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9MXtRt"&gt;Motorola has announced the Moto G Stylus 5G, a new version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311690/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-review-price-specs"&gt;very good, non-5G budget-friendly stylus phone&lt;/a&gt;. It offers broadly similar hardware to the 4G version, with notable exceptions in the new Snapdragon 480 5G chipset with sub-6GHz 5G connectivity and a bigger 5,000mAh battery. Priced at $399, it’s at the higher end of the budget range and will go on sale June 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rH8DV4"&gt;Like its 4G peer, the G Stylus 5G features a large 6.8-inch 1080p screen, ready for your notes and doodles courtesy of a built-in stylus. It includes 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and ships with Android 11. There’s a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a charging brick is included in the box. The Stylus 5G is a little bigger and heavier than the 4G version, but not by much — it’s about four grams heavier and 0.3mm thicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iVBHoG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10597540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSK7b6"&gt;The G Stylus 5G offers a rear triple-camera array that’s very similar to the 4G G Stylus’, with a 48-megapixel f/1.7 standard wide, 8-megapixel ultrawide, and 5-megapixel macro, plus a 2-megapixel depth sensor. Around front, there’s a 16-megapixel selfie camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IitoSD"&gt;The G Stylus 5G isn’t the most aggressively priced 5G phone in the budget market. OnePlus says its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522711/oneplus-n200-5g-specs-screen-price"&gt;upcoming N200 5G&lt;/a&gt; will cost less than $250, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370189/samsung-galaxy-a52-a42-a32-5g-a12-a02s-price-specs-price"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; is currently selling for $279. It’s also surprising to see the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;Snapdragon 480 5G chipset&lt;/a&gt; used here, since it’s intended for more affordable 5G devices well under the Stylus 5G’s $400 price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaIEjl"&gt;On the other hand, the G Stylus 5G is quite a bit cheaper than the other prominent 5G phone with a built-in stylus, the $999 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506471/samsung-galaxy-note-20-review-price-stylus"&gt;Galaxy Note 20&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to look at things that way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The classic Simpsons arcade cabinet is getting rereleased thanks to Arcade1Up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mb-qEnQ9OvGZ78uNVN_dMR5WeV0=/0x148:1400x1081/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69427226/The_Simpsons_Lifestyle__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcade1Up’s &lt;/em&gt;The Simpsons &lt;em&gt;arcade machine.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Arcade1Up&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uVzVNb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Simpsons &lt;/em&gt;arcade game, a classic four-player brawler that I personally spent an untold amount of quarters on growing up, is getting a rerelease in celebration of the game’s 30th anniversary thanks to Arcade1Up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYFfc7"&gt;In the game, which was first released by Konami in 1991, you and up to three of your friends fight waves of oncoming baddies as Homer, Marge, Bart, or Lisa Simpson in a quest to save Maggie. I always liked &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/-BFYzVNgRRQ"&gt;playing as Bart&lt;/a&gt; because you traveled around on your skateboard &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; used it as a weapon, which I thought was the coolest thing ever when I was a kid. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BzUjHw5T67vqdJOaB5naBUF1jMU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646312/Simpsons__5_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Arcade1Up&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m not sure I’d put this right next to a couch, personally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qsBD4B"&gt;If you decide to get the machine, you should know that it actually comes with &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; games: &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; and a bonus game that will be announced when preorders start on July 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kfFfyg"&gt;Arcade1Up hasn’t announced pricing for the cabinet, but the company’s four-player &lt;em&gt;NBA Jam&lt;/em&gt; machine &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Ftoys-collectibles%2Fcollectibles%2Fseasonal-items-novelty-gifts%2Fproducts%2Fnba-jam-wi-fi-enabled-arcade-cabinet-with-riser-and-stool%2F11100302.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $499.99 from GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s possible &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; could be similarly priced. While that might seem expensive, vintage arcade cabinets can cost thousands of dollars, so Arcade1Up’s rerelease could be a comparably affordable way to get &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; machine for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti review: a loss to AMD</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A solid 1440p card, but only entry-level 4K&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xV8vq7"&gt;When I reviewed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21534142/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-review"&gt;Nvidia’s RTX 3070 last year&lt;/a&gt;, I called it the sweet spot for 1440p gaming. At $499, it arrived as a more budget-friendly option for those not ready to move to 4K. Now, Nvidia has another option: the $599 RTX 3070 Ti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6cbB1"&gt;Compared to the standard version, the RTX 3070 Ti has been redesigned and comes with 8GB of newer and more efficient GDDR6X RAM instead of GDDR6. Like all of Nvidia’s 30-series cards, the RTX 3070 Ti also supports ray tracing and AI-powered DLSS technology to improve frame rates and maintain image quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="An2n21"&gt;The bump to performance is small, though. I spent the last week testing out the RTX 3070 Ti at both 1440p and 4K, and in most titles, it falls behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"&gt;AMD’s cheaper RX 6800&lt;/a&gt; card. I wasn’t expecting the RTX 3070 Ti to come close to the RTX 3080, but there’s a big enough performance gap here where it makes more sense to buy AMD’s RX 6800 or be willing to pay extra for the RTX 3080.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2W4HD"&gt;None of this pricing really matters, though. We’re in the middle of a global chip shortage that’s driving GPU prices to ridiculous levels way beyond $1,000 a card. You’ll probably end up buying whatever GPU is available to buy at your ideal price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ky3ivY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10597382"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="onjV0a"&gt;Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sfgoEx"&gt;Nvidia has turned the RTX 3070 Ti into what looks like a smaller version of the RTX 3080. It’s a design bump over the RTX 3070, which results in the 3070 Ti being slightly longer and requiring more power. The RTX 3070 Ti has one fan on either side of the card, with a push-pull system in place. The bottom fan pulls cool air into the card, which then exhausts on the opposite side that’s closest to your CPU cooler and rear case fan. A traditional blower cooler also exhausts the hot air out of the PCIe slot at the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmFmrj"&gt;It’s the same system found on the RTX 3080, and it keeps the RTX 3070 Ti humming along quietly. Just like the RTX 3070 before it, Nvidia is using its new 12-pin single power connector. It’s designed to replace existing 6- or 8-pin connectors, and there’s an adapter in the box. Due to the new power requirements, you’ll need to use two single 8-pin connectors with the adapter. I’d highly recommend just getting a single new cable (they’re around $20) from your PSU supplier to connect directly to this card, as it’s way less clunky than the included adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/COGhx0VuigFq6wgi2BvIbTw4AMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645494/twarren_20210607_4625_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RTX 3070 Ti looks more like a RTX 3080.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cgV6HW"&gt;The RTX 3070 Ti has all the ports you’d expect to find on a modern GPU. There’s a single HDMI 2.1 port and three DisplayPort 1.4a ports. While the RTX 3070 design was simple, I much prefer the look of the 3070 Ti. It doesn’t have light-up LEDs like the RTX 3080, but it still looks great inside a case with a window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rHDuuN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 review: the 1440p sweet spot","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21534142/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-review"},{"title":"Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 review: 4K PC gaming finally makes sense","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"},{"title":"AMD Radeon RX 6800 review: entry-level 4K","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wx10qo"&gt;Unfortunately, the RTX 3070 Ti requires more power than the RTX 3070. The RTX 3070 Ti pulls up to 290 watts by itself, a more than 30 percent jump over the RTX 3070. This also means Nvidia is recommending a 750W power supply here, instead of the 650W requirement for the RTX 3070. That pushes the 3070 Ti up to the same power supply requirements as the RTX 3090, even though it consumes far less power. It’s a big jump considering the RTX 2070 only needed a 550W power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pkNoBZQbnVFI2v96kXtxvJQ9Lds=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645496/twarren_20210607_4625_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RTX 3070 Ti and RTX 3070.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zkzT01"&gt;1440p testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="rBTfbO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10528861"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5bOs47"&gt;I’ve been testing the RTX 3070 Ti with Intel’s latest Core i9 processor. For 1440p tests, I’ve also paired the GPU with a 32-inch Samsung Odyssey G7 monitor. This monitor supports refresh rates up to 240Hz, as well as Nvidia’s G-Sync technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qhyQ2a"&gt;I compared the RTX 3070 Ti with the previous RTX 3070, the RTX 3080, and AMD’s RX 6800 to figure out where it fits into the $599 price point. I tested a variety of AAA titles, including &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Control, Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, and many more. You can also find the same games tested at 4K resolution below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgzD1Z"&gt;All games were tested at max or ultra settings on the RTX 3070 Ti, and nearly all of them comfortably exceeded 60fps, with some reaching 100fps and beyond. &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; saw the biggest gains over the RTX 3070 here, with more than 10 percent improvement each. But &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; were the same or very close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qdvFeh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10597405"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eoO0c2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; were the best performing games at 1440p, and with DLSS enabled, both exceeded 150fps averages. The RTX 3070 Ti is extremely capable at 1440p, and if you’re willing to lower settings in favor of high frame rates, then this card will pair very well with 144Hz or faster monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPgc4W"&gt;Where the RTX 3070 Ti really disappoints is when you compare it to the AMD competition. AMD’s RX 6800 beats the RTX 3070 Ti in nearly every game at 1440p, with &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt; being the rare exceptions. Some of AMD’s beats here are significant, with &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; both seeing more than 20 percent performance increases. I tested all cards with Nvidia’s Resizable Bar enabled and AMD’s Smart Access Memory enabled. Both are identical technologies designed to boost frame rates, and it’s clear certain games favor AMD’s card here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HNicSMTpG1jZXmFSUfS-ijEJP4I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645495/twarren_20210607_4625_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RTX 3070 Ti uses a push-pull cooling method.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1M5c75"&gt;4K testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SPiIye"&gt;Over on the 4K side, performance is less impressive. I used Acer’s 27-inch Nitro XV273K, a 4K monitor that offers up to 144Hz refresh rates and G-Sync support for all of the testing. None of the games came close to maxing out the 144Hz refresh rate, and if you really want high frame rate 4K gaming, then you’ll need an RTX 3080 or RTX 3080 Ti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5qPYw"&gt;Only half of the games I tested managed to hit 60fps or beyond at 4K, and you’ll need to drop settings to high or mid levels to achieve playable frame rates. Like always, DLSS helps, but ray tracing alone is too much for this card at 4K. &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; ran at just 10fps and was unplayable at ultra settings and with ray tracing on. DLSS helped bump that to a slightly more playable 26fps, but that’s still not a very smooth experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RYgQyI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10597408"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UPXPoZ"&gt;Much like at 1440p, AMD also beats Nvidia here with the RX 6800. &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; all manage more than 20 percent improvements over the RTX 3070 Ti. Where the RTX 3070 Ti really excels against AMD is when you enable DLSS, but with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462659/amd-dlss-fidelityfx-super-resolution-fsr-supersampling-release-date"&gt;AMD’s answer to DLSS&lt;/a&gt; arriving later this month, that could soon change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6niyes"&gt;Some of the gaps in performance between the RTX 3070 Ti and RX 6800 are likely down to AMD’s Smart Access Memory performing well in certain titles, compared to Nvidia’s more limited Resizable BAR support. I also noticed during &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; tests that the average frame rate varied heavily during tests, in what could be some type of driver or game bug. Nvidia is currently investigating whether this is a bug or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dHml5jxsunJVvSFwvvWLPXoG1BI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645492/twarren_20210607_4625_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s RTX 3070 Ti keeps quiet during demanding games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hEDBhm"&gt;With a $599 retail price, I was expecting more from the RTX 3070 Ti. AMD’s RX 6800 is still technically priced lower than the RTX 3070 Ti, and my tests showed it surprisingly outperformed the Nvidia card. On the Nvidia side, you get the addition of DLSS and with that better ray-tracing performance if you couple them together. Nvidia’s NVENC and professional tooling support is also extremely useful if you’re video editing or streaming to Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BzMyR"&gt;But for games, AMD’s RX 6800 takes the edge at this price point. Nvidia’s RTX 3070 Ti also only ships with 8GB of VRAM, compared to the 16GB found on the RX 6800. I can’t help but feel like 8GB will be challenging at some point during the lifetime of this card, so it’s a shame Nvidia only bumped the memory spec and not the size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uusm0y"&gt;Not that the retail pricing of either card really matters right now. The chances are very slim that you’ll be able to find the RX 6800 or RTX 3070 Ti in stock this week. That means, once again, the best GPU you can buy right now is often whatever you can actually buy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="gCRRF5"&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;much-anticipated WWDC session&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, June 7th, Apple introduced a load of new features for its upcoming update of its iOS mobile operating system: iOS 15. The developer’s beta is now available for anyone who’d like to download it — and who is a registered developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXuH7Q"&gt;First, the obligatory warning: this version of iOS 15 is going to be very new and very beta. If you’re a developer, you know all this, but it’s worth repeating: it’s best to install this on a phone that isn’t the one that you rely on. In addition, remember that Backups Are Your Friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="81kWuD"&gt;You can find the developers beta of iOS 15 on &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/"&gt;Apple’s Developers Website&lt;/a&gt;. You will, of course, have to sign in (we’re assuming you’ve paid your $99 for a developer’s account). You may be asked to register your device if it isn’t registered already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NiJBjy"&gt;Find the iOS 15 profile by choosing Downloads (either from the button on the upper right corner, or by using the two-line drop-down menu on the upper left).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rxypZu"&gt;Look for the iOS profile, and allow the download.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1Uk9rC"&gt;Once the profile is downloaded, go to the Settings on your device, find “Profile Downloaded,” and follow the instructions. You will eventually be told to reboot, and then should be able to install the update that is available in Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Software Update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="MmG9Dh"&gt;If you’re not enrolled as an Apple developer, don’t be downhearted — there will be a public beta available for download sometime in July. When it’s available, we’ll let you know where to find it and how to install it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSkEdx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em7HR0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSRbsl"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAVqQV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A brief chat with the star of Marvel’s latest streaming series&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="363gmi"&gt;Despite a decade of playing &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1084177/9358?subId1=VergeLoki&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Floki%2F6pARMvILBGzF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Loki&lt;/a&gt; in various Marvel films, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523186/loki-review-episode-1-2-disney-plus"&gt;and now a TV show&lt;/a&gt;, Tom Hiddleston isn’t tired of the role. “There’s always something new to find,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LivfSv"&gt;This week sees the premiere of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; on Disney Plus, a six-episode series that marks the character’s first leading role. It’s a story of time travel and branching timelines, as Loki is captured by an organization called the Time Variance Authority (TVA). It mixes action, humor, and some good old-fashioned detective work, while touching on serious subjects like the nature of free will. There are also some fresh faces on board, as Hiddleston is joined by Marvel newcomers Owen Wilson, who plays a TVA agent named Mobius, and director Kate Herron, best-known for her work on the first season of &lt;em&gt;Sex Education&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVYWcN"&gt;Ahead of the show’s premiere, I had a chance to chat with Hiddleston about his time as the character, a presentation that made him feel like an “amateur academic giving a thesis on Loki,” working with Wilson and Herron, and whether our lives are predetermined. Typical Marvel stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2SnWre"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="m3vOMs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Loki’s first two episodes are a blast","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22523186/loki-review-episode-1-2-disney-plus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7ZXbhL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re now at a decade of you playing Loki. How have your feelings about the character changed or grown over that time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98RR8n"&gt;I’m honestly just grateful to still be here. I find myself always surprised and delighted that I get to have another crack at it. Long before I was cast, Loki was just the most fascinating and complex character who has such depth and range, and he’s been around in Marvel comics for 60 years in different iterations, and he’s been around in our minds, in stories that we tell as human beings, for hundreds if not thousands of years. I find that, even though it’s been 10 years, every time I come back, there’s always more to discover. There’s always more to excavate because these tricksters are kind of mercurial and shapeshifting. So there’s always something new to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pGHXUc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Loki is out of control. He’s a man on the run.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pQvg0C"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were you looking forward to exploring with this, now that you have this six-episode series focused on Loki? What were you hoping to dig into?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4nadT"&gt;I think really opening up and externalizing his many different identities and facets. In my preparation to play the character, I’ve always seen that he has so many different and seemingly contradictory characteristics. You think, “How can all of these characteristics exist in one person, in one being?” And yet they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcqbNx"&gt;Loki, across the MCU movies, has always been a character who seems to be very controlled. He seems to know which cards are in his hand and how he’s going to play them. And Loki, in the TVA — this organization that governs time — Loki is out of control. He’s a man on the run. And he’s motivated by a desire to understand. Suddenly, he finds out there’s all of this information that he doesn’t have, and he needs to get ahold of it. And that gives the series an amazing momentum actually. Loki is on the back foot, everybody else knows more than he does, and seeing how he adapts, seeing how he improvises after that — if improvisation is possible in the TVA. That’s a question that we try to throw up, whether you have any free will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sgDxrs6PbPfvVzRKYRi2iiWTIpw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22644981/TPL1005_101_TRL_comp_v010.1063__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DT0XUj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I read about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ew.com/tv/tom-hiddleston-loki-digital-cover/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Loki school&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; that you led to prep the team on the history of the character. How did you prepare for that? Did you just sort of know it all, or did you have to do a lot of research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtpCYB"&gt;I wanted it not to be 10 hours long. I knew I had to condense what I thought was useful to tell the crew. It came about because of Kate Herron, our director who has done an extraordinary job on this whole series, and thought it might be a good idea to get everybody together because there were so many heads of departments, different crew — production design, costume design, cinematography, camera, sound, stunts — and wanting to make sure that everyone had the same information about Loki, and that it might be useful to listen to my experience. I was trying to explain how we had constructed Loki’s arc over the six movies that he’s in in the MCU and work out what in that arc was useful and what we could leave behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFLiS5"&gt;I suddenly found myself feeling extremely nervous, as if I was some amateur academic giving a thesis on Loki. You’ll have to ask the others if it was useful at all. But at least we synchronized watches and we were starting from the same place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cjKynF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If I were highly skilled enough to use PowerPoint, I could retire and become a professor full-time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hmS3Bj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So is there a PowerPoint file somewhere that will leak out one day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvGXGE"&gt;If I were highly skilled enough to use PowerPoint, I could retire and become a professor full-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQ9CAf"&gt;I did have a few clips. I thought there were some clips from the movies that might be helpful. It was interesting, even if it was about how the costume had changed over the years and why. And when does Loki wear the horns? Are the horns a casual thing? Are they a ceremonial thing like a crown? Is it an extension of some interior intention? Do the horns come out when he’s being particularly malevolent? Why is the hair different? Sometimes he’s wearing a cape, sometimes not. Sometimes he’s using magic, sometimes he’s using his own body to fight in combat. All of these questions that people were curious about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Q5kfk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know this was meant for the rest of the crew, but was it helpful for you to go over this stuff again while preparing to jump back into the role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CAXqII"&gt;Oh yeah, absolutely, just to refresh myself on certain decisions that we had made and why certain things were adapted… sometimes you’re trying to bring very elaborate and beautifully illustrated comic book panels into a physical reality on a film set and working out how to merge these two worlds. It was interesting. I got some amazing questions about how he moves the way he does and where certain things in stunts came up, and certainly in hair, makeup, and wardrobe, how the clothes changed, and why we made those choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKBD7k"&gt;It was interesting to refresh myself on the extraordinary input because I’m carrying the inspiration of amazing people. [&lt;em&gt;Thor&lt;/em&gt; director] Kenneth Branagh and Alexandra Byrne, our costume designer; Bo Welch who designed the first &lt;em&gt;Thor&lt;/em&gt; movie; Charlie Wood who was a production designer on &lt;em&gt;The Dark World&lt;/em&gt;; the whole crew from &lt;em&gt;Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;; Mayes Rubeo, the costume designer from &lt;em&gt;Ragnarok; &lt;/em&gt;and people like Douglas Noe, who’s done makeup on Loki for a long time. So there was a lot to unpack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CmCBG2E5G5sr7UBAUY38IAsHbsc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22644983/TRA8660_105_TRL_comp_v004.1092.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QHn5xN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both Kate Herron&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and Owen Wilson are newcomers to the Marvel machine. Is it useful to have that kind of outside perspective?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZXZiT"&gt;Absolutely. Both Kate and Owen came in with so many questions because they hadn’t lived inside Loki’s head for 10 years. They have a fresh take on it. Kate was so well-prepared and so well-researched; she actually brought some new material from Marvel Publishing that I had never seen before, about Loki’s interior world. Owen came in and just asked me lots of questions about my experience. I remember he said, “Tom, why do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; love playing Loki?” And I found myself saying, “Well, he’s just got all this range. He can play the lighthearted keys, but he can also play the heavy keys in the bass clef. And somehow the character contains both.” And he loved that way of thinking about that. He said, “I think I might say that in the show.” And so it was really his very intelligent question that led us somewhere else in the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwJueP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Given the themes of the first two episodes, I have to ask: do you believe in free will?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRLogT"&gt;I hope so. Free will is such an interesting, forever question. I think human beings have been asking to what extent we have the power of self-determination, self-realization, choice over our actions, and whether we can govern the course of our lives. It goes back to evolutionary or psychological arguments about nature and nurture and why we are who we are. Perhaps it’s the journey of a lifetime to figure it out, to truly take the wheel of your own life. Because in our childhood, we’re set on a path, I guess, often by accident — the accident of birth, where we’re born and when — and we’re driven forward by the unconscious in lots of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="2TD8Ab"&gt;That’s a complex answer. It’s a complex question. So I hope so. I hope truly free will is possible. But for all of us, I think it can be a long journey of self-discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The pandemic might cut down e-waste but widen the digital divide </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="INDIA-ECONOMY-E WASTE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kBixcfaRJ5th8GFJ1PJMBmKYYfY=/0x0:4032x2688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69426984/1231850837.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6OHec8"&gt;We now have evidence that staying home to game or stream and chill during the pandemic was pretty much a first-world problem (or privilege, depending on how you look at it). The proof is in a &lt;a href="https://www.unbonn.org/node/13588"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; published today by the United Nations University and UN Institute for Training and Research that looks at where drops in electronics sales and associated e-waste took place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4QDkdn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;4.9 million fewer metric tons of e-waste&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OZn30A"&gt;The report looked at electronics consumption in the first few quarters of 2020, and then used that to estimate future e-waste. It projects that worldwide, we’ll have discovered that 4.9 million fewer metric tons of e-waste were generated compared to a “business as usual” scenario without the pandemic. But that drop was uneven across the globe, the authors found. Electronics sales are estimated to have fallen 30 percent in low and middle-income countries, compared to just 5 percent in richer nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9aYBw"&gt;“The so-called digital divide is increasing,” report co-author Ruediger Kuehr said in a statement. “The ability to adapt to digitisation and earn a living or simply to own and benefit from electronics is decreasing in some parts of the world.” Countries in Northern Africa, Western Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Central Asia will be the hardest hit, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LPAf8c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;high-income countries are projected to be solely responsible for a slight uptick in game console, cell phone, laptop, and electrical ovens&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dzX7GR"&gt;On the other hand, high-income countries are projected to be solely responsible for a slight global uptick in game console, cell phone, laptop, and electrical oven purchases last year. In those countries, it seems people did indeed turn to screens (and maybe baking?) to while away their time during pandemic lockdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKGz3H"&gt;Tech companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348652/pandemic-earnings-antitrust-google-facebook-apple-amazon"&gt;still managed to profit&lt;/a&gt; during the hellscape of 2020. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334725/microsoft-q4-2020-earnings-azure-surface-xbox-gains-growth-profits-sales"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252663/apple-q1-2021-earnings-iphone-12-mac-sales"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; raked in the dough from gaming and computers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253844/samsung-earnings-q4-fy-2020-profits-covid-display-mobile"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; made more money last year than it did the year before. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348368/amazon-q2-2020-earnings-covid-19-coronavirus-jeff-bezos"&gt;doubled its profit&lt;/a&gt; near the onset of the pandemic. And the 2020 lull in tech spending among low and middle-income countries is expected to be temporary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEYsD5"&gt;As more people buy more gadgets, e-waste piles up, and can leach harmful materials like mercury into the environment. E-waste reached a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309776/record-amount-ewaste-2019-global-report-environment-health"&gt;record high&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, and just 17 percent was recycled. A lot more can still be done to prolong each gadget’s lifespan, increase recycling, and make companies responsible for collecting the products they generate so that e-waste doesn’t trash the environment, advocates say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFEGHA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok hired some of its best animators for an anti-bullying campaign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2v1Hc6iREZrkA1_K-aqeGBz0h6M=/0x1:1693x1130/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69426948/tiktikbullying.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Moments from three of the animators’ videos. From left to right: Kelly Emmrich, AmyRightMeow, Rosie.gif. | Images: TikTok&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8xLv63"&gt;Starting today, you might see some beautiful new animations posted to TikTok’s accounts. The company has partnered with six of its platform’s popular animators — several of whom were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21436768/tiktok-cartoons-animators-creators-king-science-tootymcnooty-maddi-winter-alex-rabbit"&gt;featured in &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; — to make videos for &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/create-kindness-on-tiktok"&gt;a campaign against bullying&lt;/a&gt;. The videos were all written and created by the animators and are meant to offer their perspective on the pressures faced by creators on the platform, even ones who are blowing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Edqe9"&gt;The spots also highlight TikTok’s vibrant animation community. The platform has been a boon for animators, who have found that its short format makes it possible for them to create good and consistent output that stands apart from the pack and that hooks viewers. One of the creators, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@king.science?lang=en"&gt;King Science&lt;/a&gt;, has 11.6 million followers, putting him among the platform’s most followed users. The campaign also features &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@amyrightmeow?lang=en"&gt;AmyRightMeow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@recokh?lang=en"&gt;Recokh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kellyemmrich?lang=en"&gt;Kelly Emmrich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rosie.gif?lang=en"&gt;Rosie.gif&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@milkymichii?lang=en"&gt;milkymichii&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ZSoZER"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktoktips/video/6971557466991545606" data-video-id="6971557466991545606" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@tiktoktips" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktoktips"&gt;@tiktoktips&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friendly reminder that one positive comment can make someone’s day &lt;a title="createkindness" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/createkindness"&gt;#CreateKindness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - TikTok Tips" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6971557331838438149"&gt;♬ original sound - TikTok Tips&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HHYElH"&gt;TikTok views the campaign as one part of its strategy to combat harassment. While teams of moderators may be the first thing that comes to mind, TikTok says another flank is the tone and expectations the company sets for its community. The company wants to make sure that users know the rules, so that if your video gets taken down it’s “not the only time you’re thinking of what community guidelines are, so it’s not like you’re in the principal’s office,” Tara Wadhwa, director of policy for TikTok US, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Z4mGu"&gt;The company has made a number of updates to its app over the past year to improve its anti-harassment measures. There’s now a pop-up that’ll &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322814/tiktok-inappropriate-or-unkind-comments-warning-pop-up-anti-bullying"&gt;warn users&lt;/a&gt; if it detects they’re posting a mean comment, and creators now have the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444278/tiktok-bulk-harassment-reporting-feature-announced"&gt;report and block users and delete comments in bulk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4lkhH"&gt;Those measures aren’t necessarily going to protect every creator — the platform is filled with amorphous communities sharing vulnerable stories, and it can rocket someone to stardom overnight. “None of this is gonna be the silver bullet,” Wadhwa says. “It’s where do we want our community to go … and what are the range of strategies we can use to get there?”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kabuto’s giant smart suitcase announced for Hot Vax Summer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ewqHBbE0-_iwxMIe2sQa04X2GUQ=/47x0:554x338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69426846/Kabuto_GIF.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kabuto Trunk and optional Pocket in action.&lt;/em&gt; | Video: Kabuto&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jlSX2z"&gt;Smart luggage maker Kabuto is now selling a 95L &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kabuto/kabuto-fingerprint-locked-trunk-expandable-backpack/description"&gt;Trunk with magnetically attachable Backpack&lt;/a&gt; that itself can double in capacity from 9L to 18L. The hard shell trunk includes a TSA-approved fingerprint lock, removable battery to charge your gadgets, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/15/14613310/magnetic-latches-rule-velcro-drools"&gt;magnetic Fidlock fasteners&lt;/a&gt;, just like those found on the &lt;a href="https://mykabuto.com/products/kabuto-smart-luggage-4-wheels?variant=31771823046737"&gt;Kabuto Smart Carry-On bags&lt;/a&gt; launched on Kickstarter in 2019. Both bags should begin shipping by the end of summer as vaccine-fueled travel begins again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O8JU7e"&gt;The $629 (early bird pricing) Kabuto Trunk measures 72 x 36 x 37cm (28 x 14 x 14.5 inches) and weighs 4.7kg / 10.4lb. It can be configured with a $29 30W 10,000mAh battery for smartphones or a beefier $79, 60W, 20,000mAh battery that can also charge most USB-C laptops. The batteries can be stored in an optional $69 Pocket that magnetically attaches to the front of the Trunk and charges devices stored inside or out thanks to an external charging hub. That means you can sit down, wheel the trunk in front of you, plug in your laptop, and place it on the boxy Trunk for a mobile workspace on the go. When you check the Trunk, just pop off the Pocket to keep all your valuables (and battery) with you on the plane. The Trunk is available in black / copper or blue / silver color combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehJ6bb"&gt;The fingerprint sensor can store up to 10 fingerprints, making it suitable for sharing with family or friends. Like the Carry-On, the Trunk’s fingerprint sensor has its own dedicated replaceable battery that will warn you when the charge is getting low. Nevertheless, you’ll also get a set of slim back-up keys that can be carried in a wallet or purse. Kabuto claims the sensor is fast. I tested the sensor on the 2019 Kabuto Carry-On and that’s already very fast — equivalent to what you’d expect unlocking a modern smartphone. Assigning fingerprints is also quick, although you’ll likely need to relearn the steps should you ever share the bag as it’s not entirely intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qpPSIF"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j-Vy_Fn39ng?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vscjSx"&gt;The $299 (early bird pricing) Kabuto Backpack includes a USB-C hub on the side. It doubles in capacity using hidden magnets that incrementally expand the sides of the bag as pressure builds. And like the Pocket, it snaps onto the Kabuto Trunk using a magnetic Fidlock mechanism that Kabuto says can securely hold up to 10kg / 22lb. The Trunk remains upright with the help of four “tires” that Kabuto claims are “the most silent wheels ever.” The Backpack is available in silver, blue, grey, and a nude beige.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgMWhM"&gt;The Trunk / Backpack combo is available for $929 via early bird pricing. Kabuto bags are covered by a lifetime warranty and are expected to begin shipping in September at the tail end of Hot Vax Summer, just as the world &lt;em&gt;hopefully&lt;/em&gt; emerges from our collective traveling funk.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will stop charging search providers for chance to be Android default in Europe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hmf_uk4O-EKkA4wdpaMhmT2DVq0=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69426645/google_search_choice_screen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen will now show up to 12 providers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KLfT93"&gt;Google is changing how its Android search engine choice screen works in Europe, following complaints from rivals about its pay-to-play model, the company has &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/changes-android-choice-screen-europe/"&gt;announced in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. The selection screen appears for users when they first set up an Android device, and is designed to offer a choice of search engines after Google was hit by a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17580694/google-android-eu-fine-antitrust"&gt;record $5 billion antitrust fine&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. From September, the search giant is making it free for search engines to be included, and is increasing the number of services that’ll be shown on the selection screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PdNnl"&gt;Currently, the selection screen includes a choice of just four search providers. One is Google, and the other three are chosen through a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/2/20751353/google-auction-android-search-choice-screen"&gt;sealed-bid auction process&lt;/a&gt;. Search providers each “state the price that they are willing to pay each time a user selects them from the choice screen” and Google then selects the three highest bidders over a minimum bid threshold, and displays them in a random order on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NYGWD9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Up to 12 search providers will now be shown&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YSi4fd"&gt;After the changes, which will apply to all devices sold in the European Economic Area and the UK, Google will display up to 12 providers on its search selection screen, and none will have to pay to be included. The first five will be the most popular search engines in a given country, as determined by the web analytics service StatCounter, displayed in a random order. Below these, Google will show up to seven more providers in a random order. If there are ever more than seven other providers to choose from, then Google says it’ll randomly display a selection of seven whenever the choice screen in shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NB8jt"&gt;Although providers won’t have to pay to be included, Google has detailed a number of eligibility requirements &lt;a href="https://www.android.com/choicescreen/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Providers must offer a “general search service,” which means results can’t be limited to a single topic, they need to offer a free app on Google Play, and they need to be correctly localized in a country to be visible on its selection screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vz5uNJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Google is now doing what it should have done 3yr ago: a free search preference menu on Android in the EU: &lt;a href="https://t.co/M9XmB1VuGr"&gt;https://t.co/M9XmB1VuGr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it should be on all platforms (e.g., also desktop Chrome), accessible at all times (i.e., not just on factory reset), and in all countries. &lt;a href="https://t.co/HcIrE8KJx3"&gt;https://t.co/HcIrE8KJx3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Gabriel Weinberg (@yegg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yegg/status/1402258047737774082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lhU4UF"&gt;Responding to the news, DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg cautiously welcomed the changes, but criticized Google for not having made them three years ago. He said they should also apply to more devices and in all countries, and that the selection screen should not be limited to the first time a user sets up or factory resets an Android device. In &lt;a href="https://www.android.com/choicescreen/#:~:text=When%20will%20a,again%20during%20setup"&gt;its FAQ&lt;/a&gt; Google confirmed that users will only see the choice screen once per device, during setup. Last year, Weinberg criticized the auction process, and called it “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494316/microsoft-bing-android-google-search-alternative-option-download"&gt;fundamentally flawed.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x65PMa"&gt;But in comments &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/google-bows-to-eu-rivals-with-android-choice-screen-tweaks?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;given to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, EU officials welcomed the “positive” move that addressed complaints from rivals. “Users will have even more opportunities to choose an alternative,” the European Commission said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max update fixes the worst of its Apple TV woes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ShSffe4iCzq3nBcS3gixmzmCj4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69426541/wjoel_200527_1777_hbomax_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uHisVp"&gt;HBO Max has updated its Apple TV app as it attempts to fix the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525177/hbo-max-apple-tv-broken-button-controls"&gt;myriad issues&lt;/a&gt; that have been plaguing the software since last week. The update &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOMAX/comments/nvl4yq/fixed/"&gt;fixes significant problems&lt;/a&gt; with basic features like fast-forwarding and rewinding, which had been introduced after the software switched away from using the native tvOS video player. The software update brings the native player back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boCiIG"&gt;“We just released an update to our Apple TV app, restoring the native tvOS video playback experience you know and love, with more improvements to come,” HBO Max &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HBOMaxHelp/status/1402484711423975426"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “Ensuring HBO Max viewers have a quality experience is our top priority and we missed the mark here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gEKmLc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We just released an update to our Apple TV app, restoring the native tvOS video playback experience you know and love, with more improvements to come. Ensuring HBO Max viewers have a quality experience is our top priority and we missed the mark here. Thank you for your patience.&lt;/p&gt;— HBOMaxHelp (@HBOMaxHelp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HBOMaxHelp/status/1402484711423975426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uA2VlS"&gt;Although the worst of the issues appear to have been fixed, users on the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOMAX/comments/nvl4yq/fixed/"&gt;HBOMax subreddit&lt;/a&gt; are reporting that some bugs remain after the new update. One user reports that they’re finding their subtitles keep &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOMAX/comments/nvl4yq/fixed/h14cg1l?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;reverting back to Spanish&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Thankfully, as another user has pointed out, the new update makes it easier to switch subtitles back, a process which the previous update had made &lt;a href="https://www.screentimes.net/article/hbo-max-tvos-update-breaks-several-key-features-degrading-experience-significantly#:~:text=turning%20on%2Foff%20subtitles%20requires%20pressing%20pause%2C%20swiping%20down%20then%20across%20to%20subtitles%2C%20pressing%20again%20then%20scrolling%20to%20your%20desired%20option%2C%20pressing%20yet%20again%20then%20resuming%20playback.%20before%2C%20you%20could%20swipe%20down%2C%20select%20your%20choice%2C%20then%20swipe%20up%20again%20-%20the%20standard%20tvos%20way."&gt;significantly more difficult&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXzQuQ"&gt;Questions remain about how such broken software was able to be released to users in the first place. Responding to a tweet from &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; editor in chief Nilay Panel, HBO Max’s EVP and general manager Andy Forssell admitted that this was “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aforssell/status/1401955206233923595"&gt;the zillion dollar question&lt;/a&gt;” and that the company would be investigating the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7Reh2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TdiB1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
