    <title>Super Pumped gets a new, longer teaser with more Uber shenanigans</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Travis Kalanick in the show’s first season.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Showtime&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T9tNdD"&gt;There’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfuFRgGVM8U"&gt;a new teaser&lt;/a&gt; for the first season of &lt;em&gt;Super Pumped&lt;/em&gt;, Showtime’s upcoming anthology show about Silicon Valley startups that hit it big. As we saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/2021/12/23/22851481/uber-showtime-series-super-pumped-trailer-joseph-gordon-levitt"&gt;in the teaser from December&lt;/a&gt;, season one will revolve around Uber and its former CEO Travis Kalanick, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOWKPE"&gt;The show’s first story will be based on the book that’s also named &lt;em&gt;Super Pumped&lt;/em&gt;, which was written by &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reporter Mike Issac. It’ll follow the, in the trailer’s words, “wild, loud, cocky, shady, reckless, excessive, ridiculous, damaging, outrageous” story of Uber’s founder, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/21/15844836/uber-ceo-resigns-travis-kalanick"&gt;resigned from his role as CEO in 2017&lt;/a&gt; after investors demanded change following a series of controversies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Uy6gqz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NfuFRgGVM8U?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QZFa10"&gt;This new trailer contains some quotable moments, including one where someone asks “is this legal?” and is met with laughter. Then, there’s the line delivered by Kyle Chandler, who plays early Uber investor and former board member Bill Gurley:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6iKq8Y"&gt;The best thing about Travis is that he is willing to run through walls to win. The worst thing about him is he thinks everything is a wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ivxsxJ"&gt;And, of course, there’s the line delivered by Gordon-Levitt himself, where he name-drops the show. “Are we super pumped?” he yells at a cheering crowd. If you’re super... excited for the show, it premieres on February 27th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite is getting a hotfix for the game’s epic but frustrating 12-player matchmaking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c9HInsU4CzaqMauVIRmGkXJMpXM=/0x0:1796x1197/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70372705/halo_infinite_keyart_primary_horiz_9e788e276ba740e3af6451ef073fd3de.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ML7gN1"&gt;Having trouble connecting to a big game of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer with a bunch of your friends in the game’s 12-person Big Team Battle mode? That will hopefully soon be a thing of the past: developer 343 says it’s not only aware, it believes it has “a fix in hand for the core issue” and will release a special hotfix specifically for it. “It’s a little too soon to give an ETA yet but please know our goal is to release this as soon as we can,” &lt;a href="https://forums.halowaypoint.com/t/halo-infinite-update-btb-and-more-jan-10/490385?u=ske7ch"&gt;write the developers in an official blog post&lt;/a&gt;,” adding that “It won’t be this week, but we hope it’s not too much further out and we’ll share an update as soon as we have line of sight on a release date (once we clear ‘cert’ we are then ready to ship).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vmuwV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is the best thing that’s happened to me and my gaming buddies in years. It doesn’t matter how many people are down, it doesn’t matter if they’re on PC or console, and it doesn’t cost a cent — the game’s free cross-platform Big Team Battle multiplayer mode lets &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;of us dive into an epic game filled with plasma explosions, grappling hooks, nail-biting gunplay and vehicular mayhem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FE1Ge"&gt;Theoretically, anyway. Most of the time we’re twiddling our thumbs, waiting for a match to load, only for Microsoft’s servers to spontaneously disconnect (or even ban) a couple members of our fireteam because the matchmaking service can’t seem to connect the dots — and doing that again and again until we magically luck out. Yesterday evening, we finally made one of our friends the fireteam leader and &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; got six of us together in matches, but even then the servers split some of us up with randos instead of friends. Once one of us quit for the evening, another player weirdly didn’t make it into the game. When we quit in solidarity, our fireteam leader got banned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Q93Dp2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Cheaters are already ruining Halo Infinite multiplayer games","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807663/halo-infinite-cheating-hackers-aimbot-wallhacks-problems"},{"title":"Halo Infinite’s creators say your wildest stunts are part of the series’ DNA","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22827053/halo-infinite-developers-wild-stunts-series-dna"},{"title":"Halo Infinite campaign review: playing the hits","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ml2zHH"&gt;Can’t wait for this to get fixed! Most of my group’s favorite multiplayer games require precisely 3, 4 or 6 players to work properly, so Halo’s been a breath of fresh air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCwSy2"&gt;343 says it’s also planning on a second patch in mid-February that should address “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807663/halo-infinite-cheating-hackers-aimbot-wallhacks-problems"&gt;some issues with instances of cheating&lt;/a&gt;” and possibly “wonkiness with the ranked experience” among other things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCQ6eZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; already added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829744/halo-infinite-playlists-slayer"&gt;some additional multiplayer playlists&lt;/a&gt; for four-player fireteams; I’m hoping once the Big Team Battle bugs are worked out, we can get some more variety in 12-player games, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta will require employees to have a COVID-19 booster to return to the office</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4IggudM6TmEGJXtCpAHx_VgZji8=/0x1:6056x4038/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70372683/verge_vjeran_pavic_meta_3_20211028.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The company has announced changes to its office reopening plans.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jeGIxq"&gt;Meta, the parent company of Facebook, will require staffers to have received a COVID-19 booster shot to be able to work from its US offices, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-owner-to-mandate-covid-19-vaccine-boosters-for-office-workers-delay-reopening-11641852001?st=dpc5i90mrknpv99&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Meta had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598818/facebook-vaccine-requirement-us-office-employees"&gt;already said&lt;/a&gt; that US office employees would have to be vaccinated against COVID-19 when they returned to the office, but beginning March 28th, they’ll also need proof of a booster vaccine, Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The company is also delaying its full office reopening until March 28th, pushing back a return that had been previously set for &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-will-offer-office-deferral-program-for-employees-unready-to-return-11638920387?mod=article_inline"&gt;the end of this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EustQ8"&gt;Not all Meta employees will have to return to the office on March 28th. Those who want to come back can defer their return by three to five months, a policy that was first announced &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/rto-meta-lyft-delayed"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also letting staffers request &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2020/5/21/21265699/facebook-remote-work-shift-workforce-permanent-covid-19-mark-zuckerberg-interview"&gt;to work remotely full time&lt;/a&gt;. Employees will now have until March 14th to decide if they want to come back to the office, defer their return, or request full time remote work, Clayton said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5ysKAQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The changes are being announced as COVID-19 case counts are surging across the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HR2mKi"&gt;The changes are being announced as COVID-19 case counts &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/01/09/us-case-count-live-covid-updates/9146794002/"&gt;are surging across the US&lt;/a&gt;, forcing companies and organizations to shift their plans for in-person gatherings. The rising cases caused many companies to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;pull their physical presences from this year’s CES&lt;/a&gt;, and the conference itself was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/31/22861669/ces-2022-ends-early-covid-january-7"&gt;closed a day early&lt;/a&gt;. Last week, both the Grammy Awards and the Sundance Film Festival &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22869140/grammys-sundance-film-festival-postponed-virtual-omicron-coronavirus"&gt;announced changes&lt;/a&gt;; the Grammys have been postponed due in part to concerns about the omicron variant, while Sundance canceled the in-person programming for its 2022 event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InWd7Z"&gt;Other big tech companies have also recently shifted their office reopening plans. Apple indefinitely delayed its return to work &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22838471/apple-delays-office-reopening-date-covid-19"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;, pushing back a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789631/apple-employees-return-offices-february-1st-hybrid-work-pilot"&gt;previously-set February 1st reopening&lt;/a&gt;. Google had planned to keep in-office work voluntary until today, January 10th, but the company pushed that back &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814879/google-return-to-office-covid-omicron-hybrid-work-plans-2022"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;, saying it would wait until 2022 to make more return to office plans. Microsoft gave up predicting an office reopening date &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664284/microsoft-office-reopening-plans-us"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;, and Amazon announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721096/amazon-work-from-home-policy-teams-decide-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt; that it would let individual teams decide when they would return to offices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google exec says Apple is ‘holding back’ customers who text</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4LltNBE5S-g1C6kXU8Tt28q8GVI=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70372410/vpavic_190508_3403_0377.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ubml4b"&gt;On Saturday, Android boss Hiroshi Lockheimer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876067/google-apple-ios-android-imessages-bullying-lockheimer"&gt;accused Apple of “using peer pressure and bullying as a way to sell products&lt;/a&gt;,” after &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-apples-imessage-is-winning-teens-dread-the-green-text-bubble-11641618009"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; revealed how US teens have turned Apple’s iMessage into a social status symbol that locks Android users out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mC6YMP"&gt;Now, Lockheimer is taking a slightly less abrasive stance: the Google executive &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1480663650775883777"&gt;said Monday&lt;/a&gt; that “we’re not asking Apple to make iMessage available on Android. We’re asking Apple to support the industry standard for modern messaging (RCS) in iMessage, just as they support the older SMS / MMS standards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hhiPL1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re not asking Apple to make iMessage available on Android. We’re asking Apple to support the industry standard for modern messaging (RCS) in iMessage, just as they support the older SMS / MMS standards.&lt;/p&gt;— Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1480663650775883777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="alkhQP"&gt;“By not incorporating RCS, Apple is holding back the industry and holding back the user experience for not only Android users but also their own customers,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1480663659135176705"&gt;adds Lockheimer&lt;/a&gt;, later in the Twitter thread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qgvZlc"&gt;That’s still a big accusation, but one that pulls the conversation back into familiar territory: will Apple &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1446193676883922953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1446193676883922953%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22715696%2Fsvp-android-invitation-apple-rcs-texting-iphone"&gt;accept Google’s olive branch&lt;/a&gt; to make iMessage more compatible with Android, or will it continue to use lock-in to sell more iPhones? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HOt9Oq"&gt;On the lock-in front, there’s little question about Apple’s motivation. Thanks to the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;the world has now seen confidential emails&lt;/a&gt; between Apple executives that show  the company is intentionally withholding iMessage in favor of lock-in. “I am concerned the iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones,” &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21043920-2013-april-federighi-and-schiller-tell-cue-not-to-bring-imessage-to-android-lockin/#document/p2"&gt;wrote Apple exec Craig Federighi in April 2013&lt;/a&gt;, adding “I think we need to get Android customers using and dependent on Apple products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWOCzA"&gt;“Joz and I think moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us, this email illustrates why,” &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21043935-2016-march-phil-schiller-why-imessage-lockin-is-important/#document/p1"&gt;wrote Apple’s Phil Schiller in March 2016&lt;/a&gt;, forwarding an email from Beats Music co-founder Ian Rogers about how he “missed a ton of messages from friends and family” after switching to an Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCGNOG"&gt;What’s less clear is whether RCS, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22783220/vergecast-podcast-rcs-explainer-google"&gt;the next-gen replacement for SMS that’s championed by Google&lt;/a&gt; and incorporates popular features common to iMessage, has any convincing reason for Apple to sign on. That’s likely why Google is creating a little peer pressure of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6U1Fmm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Let’s chat about RCS","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22783220/vergecast-podcast-rcs-explainer-google"},{"title":"The moral case for iMessage on Android","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18171021/moral-case-imessage-android"},{"title":"Why I turned on iMessage","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18677644/imessage-iphone-apple-secure-encrypted-chat-moral-imperative-signal-rcs-hangouts"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="nMgnBN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715696/svp-android-invitation-apple-rcs-texting-iphone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has asked Apple if it intends to support RCS &lt;em&gt;literally years &lt;/em&gt;with no comment&lt;/a&gt;, so we’re not holding our breath. We’ve also made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18171021/moral-case-imessage-android"&gt;the moral case&lt;/a&gt; that a company that claims privacy is a human right has a duty to bring encrypted messaging to the world, not just its own customers, and we’ve written about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18677644/imessage-iphone-apple-secure-encrypted-chat-moral-imperative-signal-rcs-hangouts"&gt;the personal plight of dealing with Apple’s inaction&lt;/a&gt;. (And when I say “we”, I mean Dieter, because RCS is his jam, I’m writing this post because he’s on vacation, and Dieter srsly why are you reading these words, aren’t you supposed to be on a socially distanced beach somewhere?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvKptQ"&gt;But maybe now that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22828277/apple-3-trillion-market-cap-company-earnings"&gt;is basically a three-trillion dollar company&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s under loads of regulatory scrutiny, and its dirty laundry (in the form of emails) has been aired in front of the world, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22807871/apple-frontline-employees-retail-customer-service-pandemic"&gt;its employees are speaking out&lt;/a&gt;, and pieces like the &lt;em&gt;WSJ’s&lt;/em&gt; are coming out, and its CEO Tim Cook is likely looking for a legacy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;larger than simply scaling up the company&lt;/a&gt; to become the most valuable in the world with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22871202/tim-cook-2021-pay-package-compensation-proxy"&gt;a fat pay package&lt;/a&gt; as the reward... perhaps bringing iMessage to Android or RCS to iMessage is the kind of small concession that Apple might actually make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IrmWgg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, 7:48PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Dieter informs me Apple did actually reply to our requests for comment on RCS. Their reply was “No comment.” I regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Associated Press is starting its own NFT marketplace for photojournalism</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Lb3R8D"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ap.org/press-releases/2022/ap-to-launch-nft-marketplace-built-by-xooa"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt;, has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s starting &lt;a href="https://apmarket.xooa.com/p/join-waiting-list"&gt;a marketplace&lt;/a&gt; to sell NFTs of its photojournalists’ work in collaboration with a company called Xooa. It’s billing its foray into NFTs as a way for collectors to “purchase the news agency’s award-winning contemporary and historic photojournalism” and says that the virtual tokens will be released at “broad and inclusive price points” (though it’s hard to tell what types of prices resellers will want on the &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; marketplace).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yU7r2Y"&gt;The news outlet says its system will be built on the “environmentally friendly” Polygon blockchain and that the NFTs will “include a rich set of original metadata” to tell buyers when, where, and how the photos were taken. It says its first collection, launching January 31st, will include NFTs featuring photos of “space, climate, war and other images to spotlights on the work of specific &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; photographers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rtdZob"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Other journalistic enterprises have experimented with NFTs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q52GQ2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the first journalistic enterprise to use or express interest in NFTs. &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1984094/quartz-is-selling-the-first-ever-nft-news-article/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quartz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350663/new-york-times-nft-auction-half-million-dollar-article-charity"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have sold copies of their articles as NFTs, and Getty Images’ CEO Craig Peters &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-12-10/getty-images-ceo-talks-nft-aspirations-after-4-8-billion-deal-with-blank-check-company"&gt;said in December&lt;/a&gt; that there’s “a real opportunity” for the company when it comes to NFTs. We probably won’t see people debating whether to get a Getty or an &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; NFT anytime soon, though, as the former seems to be taking a more wait-and-see approach, with Peters saying that he didn’t feel the need to race into the space. So far, though, this does seem like one of the largest NFT-related efforts from a major news source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDCRHT"&gt;It doesn’t seem like &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; is trying to sell its NFTs as a metaverse tie-in (either as part of a virtual museum or as decorations in &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/accounting-firms-scoop-up-virtual-land-in-the-metaverse-11641599590"&gt;an online accounting office&lt;/a&gt;), like other media executives &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/plugged-in-executives-metaverse/"&gt;in the music industry may be interested in doing&lt;/a&gt;. Its announcement and &lt;a href="https://apmarket.xooa.com/p/faq"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; make no mention of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;the metaverse&lt;/a&gt; (outside of mentioning that Xooa also works with brands on “metaverse strategies” in the “About Xooa” section), and the project seems entirely aimed at collectors who want to, as the press release puts it, “seamlessly buy, sell and trade official &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; digital collectibles through the marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="zw4RP2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Pulitzer Drops” will “have increased scarcity to preserve their status”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7K4Mrn"&gt;Buyers will be able to pay for NFTs from the market using either credit cards or Ethereum — &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; says the MetaMask will be the first wallet supported but that there are plans to add support for others. There will be virtual queues to buy NFTs as they’re released by &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt;, with “Pulitzer Drops” containing more limited-edition NFTs happening every two weeks — the FAQ says these particular images will “have increased scarcity to preserve their status.” Buyers will be able to resell those NFTs on the site’s secondary market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlCVP3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; says that the proceeds from the NFTs’ sale will be used to fund its journalistic endeavors. It’ll also get revenue whenever they’re resold on its marketplace — the FAQ says there’s a 10 percent fee associated with reselling, and Xooa spokesperson Lauren Easton told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email that the two companies would share that fee. (The transaction fees, or “gas” fees, that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22800995/constitutiondao-refund-progress-steep-gas-fees-cryptocurrency"&gt;Ethereum is infamous for&lt;/a&gt; shouldn’t add too much to the price of sales, as they’re significantly lower on Polygon.) Easton also told us that the “photographers will share in all revenue collected,” but didn't specify what their cut would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="LpjPKh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The marketplace has an early access waitlist scheme&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GGIuPM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; says its marketplace is set to open on January 31st, but it does seem to be offering a sort of early access scheme; the landing page for the marketplace says you can get on a waitlist and that you can get “priority access” and a higher waitlist ranking if you refer others to sign up. If you’re the type of collector &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; is targeting with these offerings (or you’re someone interested in how this type of marketplace will work), it’s worth doing a thorough read of &lt;a href="https://apmarket.xooa.com/p/faq"&gt;the FAQ&lt;/a&gt; — it gets into how Xooa is planning on adding support for moving the NFTs to other marketplaces, talks about how the drops will work, and has tons of detail about the marketplace, account system, and the seller verification processes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LAPD officers fired for catching a Snorlax instead of a burglar denied appeal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rer0PyatBZDHTwHsSZHjCujTaaQ=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70372301/pokemoncop.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SDv3HK"&gt;Two LAPD officers who were fired from their jobs in 2017 for playing Pokémon Go while on duty have had their appeal for reinstatement denied by a California judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QL48om"&gt;The officers’ squad car video camera showed the two officers, Louis Lozano and Eric Mitchell, ignored a request for backup to play the game, according to court documents. The pair were stationed near a robbery in progress, and after the responding officers put out a call for backup, Lozano and Mitchell seemingly ignored the call and left the area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBxO2u"&gt;When asked later why they hadn’t responded to the call, the two officers said they were in a loud area and couldn’t hear their radio. Lozano and Mitchell’s supervisor was skeptical of their explanation and checked the in-car recording system (commonly known as a dashcam), which revealed the two had heard the call and chose to go elsewhere as they didn’t want to help. The supervisor reported the incident, which opened a formal investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAhf2Q"&gt;According to court filings, an extensive review of the in-car video system revealed that shortly after leaving the scene of the robbery, the two officers could be heard discussing Pokémon Go, including a Snorlax that had appeared and the best route to intercept and catch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="y4Q0BC"&gt;For approximately the next 20 minutes, the [in-car video system] captured petitioners discussing Pokémon as they drove to different locations where the virtual creatures apparently appeared on their mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="slfX0b"&gt;When confronted, the officers denied they were playing Pokémon Go and said they were just having a conversation. They tried to appeal on the grounds that the in-vehicle recordings were not meant to be used to monitor officers’ “private conversations,” but a judge ruled that that premise was ”flawed” and denied the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOXESz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile appears to be blocking some iPhone users from turning on Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a679SQQpMlD7hp-oo9jH_r4cJPA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70372164/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4lX89e"&gt;T-Mobile appears to be blocking some iPhone users from enabling iCloud Private Relay, a feature that lets you hide the websites you visit from third parties, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/t-mobile-block-icloud-private-relay/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5ygsEB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TMobileHelp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TMobileHelp&lt;/a&gt; What the hey?  Why are you keeping us from using &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; ‘s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/icloud?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#icloud&lt;/a&gt; private relay? &lt;a href="https://t.co/EtdxkVSpWh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EtdxkVSpWh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Guidry (@guidryjd) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guidryjd/status/1480599787577696260?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O7jGLS"&gt;Private Relay is still in beta in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, and it isn’t turned on by default. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;You have to go into your iPhone’s settings to switch it on&lt;/a&gt;, which is where some T-Mobile customers have noticed a strange message popping up. As shown in the above tweet, the user is presented with the message, “Your cellular plan doesn’t support iCloud Private Relay. With Private Relay turned off, this network can monitor your internet activity, and your IP address is not hidden from known trackers or websites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z095du"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guidryjd/status/1480631410239094797?s=20"&gt;a reply to that tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the user shows what happens when you click the “Learn More” button below the initial message — there, Apple explains why T-Mobile might be blocking the feature. “Networks that require the ability to audit traffic or perform network-based filtering will block access to Private Relay,” it reads. “Your cellular provider may be providing network-based services, such as Parental Controls, requiring them to view the traffic on your network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6uDEp"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;VPN-like Private Relay&lt;/a&gt; hides your web activity from any outside sources — including Apple and your carrier — and prevents anyone from identifying you or the sites you access. It’s currently available &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;via a subscription to iCloud Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4ZROa"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/european-carriers-seek-to-block-iphone-private-relay-feature/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;iPhone users in Europe were the first to notice that access to the Private Relay feature had been blocked. T-Mobile, Vodafone, and Telefonica added their names to an open letter published in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fbusiness%2F2022%2F01%2F09%2Fapple-fire-iphone-encryption-tech%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F10%2F22877211%2Ft-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that criticizes the feature. Carriers argue that Private Relay “will impair others to innovate and compete in downstream digital markets and may negatively impact operators’ ability to efficiently manage telecommunication networks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7LADr"&gt;If you’re a T-Mobile customer, you might not see the block on Private Relay just yet (it was still available on the T-Mobile iPhones we tested). It’s currently unclear if this is intentional, if this will affect all T-Mobile customers, or if it is limited to certain plans. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to T-Mobile and Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Take-Two wants to pay nearly $13 billion for the maker of FarmVille</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KyRclHyYMWHQQaizHomgF6xvPP4=/73x0:3300x2151/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371692/654_3840.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take-Two wants to bring its franchises to mobile, and Zynga can help.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Rockstar Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="apVcTs"&gt;Take-Two Interactive just announced its intent to buy &lt;em&gt;FarmVille&lt;/em&gt; developer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876184/take-two-interactive-zynga-acquisition-deal"&gt;Zynga for $12.7 billion&lt;/a&gt; in what could be the biggest acquisition in video game history. It’s an absolutely massive deal; to put it in perspective, the acquisition would be $5 billion &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;Microsoft’s $7.5 billion purchase&lt;/a&gt; of the parent company of &lt;em&gt;Skyrim &lt;/em&gt;maker Bethesda Softworks. You could throw in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/30/3577656/disney-buys-lucasfilm-plans-to-release-star-wars-episode-7-in-2015"&gt;the money Disney paid for Lucasfilm&lt;/a&gt; and still have cash left over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvwnMe"&gt;So what is Take-Two getting for its money? Yes, big Zynga games like &lt;em&gt;FarmVille&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Words With Friends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440209/tiktok-baddie-games-high-heels-nail-woman"&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Heels!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will join Take-Two’s own roster of franchises that includes &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt;. But perhaps more importantly, Take-Two will now be able to use Zynga’s expertise building hugely popular free-to-play mobile titles so it can make new hit games based on its own properties. In fact, Zynga will be the new brand for Take Two’s mobile efforts, and current Zynga CEO Frank Gibeau will lead that organization, indicating the potential direction of Take Two’s mobile future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Cxa7vh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Developers across the industry have been bringing big franchises to mobile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OaGLwg"&gt;Developers across the industry have been bringing big franchises to mobile and earning a lot of money doing so. &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; was the top-grossing mobile game worldwide in November 2021, earning “close to” $254 million, &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/top-mobile-games-by-worldwide-revenue-november-2021"&gt;according to Sensor Tower&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;League of Legends: Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;, the mobile-optimized version of the hit PC MOBA, was in the top ten for App Store revenue that same month. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; brought in more than $5 billion in revenue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565654/pokemon-go-5-billion-fifth-anniversary-revenue-analytics"&gt;as of its five-year birthday in July&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pokemon-go-five-billion-revenue"&gt;Sensor Tower reported&lt;/a&gt;. The Tencent-owned studio that makes &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22367089/tencent-timi-studios-call-of-duty-mobile-10-billion-2020"&gt;reportedly earned $10 billion in 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuNetj"&gt;And some of the biggest publishers have been buying their way into the space for years, with Activision Blizzard buying &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; maker King for $5.9 billion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/2/9662214/actvision-blizzard-buys-candy-crush-king-5-9-billion"&gt;in 2015&lt;/a&gt; and EA buying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273187/ea-glu-mobile-acquisition-kim-kardashian-hollywood"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kim Kardashian: Hollywood&lt;/em&gt; developer Glu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547324/ea-golf-clash-playdemic-acquisition-warner-brothers-games-mobile"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt; maker Playdemic&lt;/a&gt; in 2021. Mobile games are big business, and it’s not hard to see Take-Two releasing free-to-play mobile versions of its biggest franchises with the help of Zynga. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHIa8P"&gt;Take-Two was fairly explicit Monday on its intention to take this path. “We see tremendous untapped potential to bring Take-Two’s renowned console and PC properties to mobile, a high-priority initiative that will be energized by the addition of Zynga’s leading development, publishing, and live operations teams,” Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said in an investor call Monday. Take-Two also noted that the acquisition offered a “clear path to bring Take-Two’s console/PC games to mobile” in an investor presentation (&lt;a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/23d9f00c-d7e7-4992-b16d-84e67dc58622"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). (The deal is expected to close in Take-Two’s first fiscal quarter of 2023, which ends on June 30th, 2022.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rW2iy4"&gt;The Zynga acquisition doesn’t mean that Take-Two will be bringing its franchises to mobile for the first time. Right now, you can download and play &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vice City&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;San Andreas&lt;/em&gt; on your phone, for example. But those are &lt;em&gt;paid&lt;/em&gt; titles on the iOS App Store and likely aren’t nearly as lucrative as some of the huge free-to-play hits on the market right now. (Take-Two already has some experience in that space, with its microtransaction-laden version of &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K&lt;/em&gt; for mobile.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="D99u4V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not hard to imagine Take-Two wanting to translate the massive success of ‘GTA Online’ to mobile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0lCCL0"&gt;And speaking of &lt;em&gt;GTA&lt;/em&gt;, it’s not hard to imagine Take-Two wanting to translate the massive success of &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; onto mobile platforms with Zynga’s expertise. Despite being released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/1/4790206/grand-theft-auto-online-early-server-issues"&gt;in 2013&lt;/a&gt; — and requiring that you own &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; to play it (&lt;a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/3938k3oo9883o8/gtav-and-gta-online-coming-to-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-x-s-march"&gt;well, for now&lt;/a&gt;) — &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; has remained hugely popular. In February 2021, Take-Two said the game “had more players in every month and for the entirety of calendar 2020 than in any other year since its launch,” &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-has-sold-more-than-140-million-copies/1100-6487267/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It also offers in-game currency for real-world money that has proven to be lucrative; Take-Two cited the game as one of its largest contributors to its revenue as recently as its November earnings release (&lt;a href="https://ir.take2games.com/node/28206/pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djQnwr"&gt;In addition to the very obvious business opportunity there — it’s hard not to see some sort of free-to-play&lt;em&gt; GTA&lt;/em&gt; being an absolutely massive hit — Zynga also brings expertise in supporting games for years at a time. Zynga still offers multiple free-to-play versions of &lt;em&gt;Words With Friends&lt;/em&gt;, including both a “classic” version and a sequel, &lt;em&gt;Words With Friends 2&lt;/em&gt;, which seems like a better way to generate long-term revenue from a franchise than one-offs like 2K Games’ expensive and &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-24-2k-games-bioshock-ios-bye-bye.html"&gt;short-lived iOS port of &lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine Take-Two and Zynga replicating the long-term model for &lt;em&gt;GTA&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt;, and the rest of its titles, and you can start to see why Take-Two decided to pay as much as it did for the &lt;em&gt;FarmVille&lt;/em&gt;-maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcrh07"&gt;The deal isn’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; about turning Take-Two games into mobile hits. Take-Two highlighted how its “expertise in console/PC can be applied to Zynga’s cross-play ambitions;” Zynga is set to put its toe into console gaming with &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Hunters, &lt;/em&gt;which is coming to Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22674204/star-wars-hunters-trailer-nintendo-switch-mobile-zynga"&gt;sometime this year&lt;/a&gt;. Take-Two plans to use Zynga’s Chartboost ad platform to “acquire new users more efficiently and optimize mobile ad inventory.” And yes, there may be something with NFTs in the future — Gibeau said during Monday’s investor call that “the idea that players will play-to-earn or play-to-own is a very compelling idea that we think will have legs as the industry develops,” &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/90103/grand-theft-auto-maker-take-two-zynga-web3-nfts"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Decrypt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qx1dai"&gt;But it seems likely that the biggest shift following the acquisition is that Take-Two will start expanding its most important franchises into the lucrative world of free mobile games. While we don’t know exactly when the first games from the Take-Two / Zynga tie-up might be released, the acquisition could mean the next &lt;em&gt;GTA&lt;/em&gt; might not be as far off as fans have worried — it just might be on your phone instead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber is the latest popular app to bail on the Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8tO0RhQCW8p8IiZWXBtxzHJEPm4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371662/DSCF7013.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XGd3fO"&gt;Uber has quietly shut down its Apple Watch app, with the software now showing a message that instructs people to “please switch to the Uber mobile app.” The company is “no longer supporting the Apple Watch app,” according to the text, which ends with Uber apologizing for any inconvenience caused by the app’s discontinuation. There’s also a sad face emoji to drive that sentiment home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJRJLv"&gt;As noted by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/10/uber-apple-watch-app-discontinued/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Uber hasn’t yet removed the Apple Watch app from its &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uber-request-a-ride/id368677368"&gt;App Store listing&lt;/a&gt;, where it still gets its own tab and screenshots. Presumably, that will all be history once the company releases its next update to the iOS app. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out to Uber for more details, and if I had to guess, the company is likely to cite low usage as the main reason for its Apple Watch exit. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HdCfqjmn-JlpSN4rJ-ePN6taq4M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159195/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_3.42.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Uber&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uber’s Apple Watch app offered basic ride-hailing functionality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="scOYWz"&gt;On the one hand, this is another example of smartwatches continuing to shed apps — even those that are massively popular and borderline essential on a phone — that aren’t core to their purpose(s) of fitness tracking, notifications, music playback, and so on. I’ve long had Uber installed on my Apple Watch, and I don’t think there was a single occasion where I hailed a ride from my wrist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ys7XYG"&gt;Uber ended support for its WearOS app more than two years ago, so it’s not like Google’s platform fared much better with user engagement. Lyft has been out of this game since 2018. Perhaps it’s a case where the form factor just isn’t the right match for the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48SE9i"&gt;The Apple Watch app provided barebones ride-hailing functionality, with more advanced options like splitting fares and sharing an ETA reserved for the full mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jT3X_bQX7t5a0-1eIimEZhvSoS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159213/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_3.47.20_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has previously highlighted Uber for the Apple Watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gcFfKc"&gt;But it also goes to show that, in some ways, smartwatches are only moving further away from being able to serve as a standalone smartphone fill-in — even temporarily. Maybe barely anyone took advantage of Uber on the Apple Watch, but the fact that it no longer exists on the platform at all feels notable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfDX8y"&gt;Want to leave your phone at home for the day and rely on your cellular Apple Watch? You can’t hail an Uber in that scenario anymore. And it’s a use case that Apple itself once highlighted, as you can see above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIWlc8"&gt;Uber continues to offer its primary app for iPhone and a larger version for the iPad. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SEC charges ‘decentralized’ Amazon Web Services competitor with scamming investors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/49S4Um5V-5vgiffkDm-5ZfCT5FE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371608/blockchain.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T3BkhT"&gt;The US Securities and Exchange Commission has &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-3?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery"&gt;charged the would-be creator&lt;/a&gt; of a “decentralized” Amazon Web Services alternative with scamming investors out of millions. The SEC announced a complaint on Friday against Australian citizen Craig Sproule, the CEO of cryptocurrency startup Crowd Machine, which promised a global cloud computing network built on users’ computers. In reality, Sproule allegedly sent $5.8 million to South African gold mines as investors’ cryptocurrency tokens became worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aa7JpR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.390193/gov.uscourts.cand.390193.1.0.pdf"&gt;An SEC complaint&lt;/a&gt; says that Sproule collected at least $33 million through an initial coin offering (or ICO) to build a decentralized “Crowd Computer” platform, which he claimed was “battle-tested” by Fortune 500 companies. He compared the service to AWS and Microsoft’s Azure and said that Crowd Machine Compute Tokens (CMCTs) could be worth between $10 and $600 apiece. But the complaint says he made false and misleading statements, and this platform was never built as advertised. Instead, Crowd Machine hosted its system on centralized servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hs1hDm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The decentralized network allegedly ran on a centralized computer system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lqp99e"&gt;The ICO itself allegedly wasn’t registered with the SEC and Crowd Machine didn’t verify whether investors were accredited as required by law. And as Sproule attempted to raise money, Crowd Machine allegedly sent $5.8 million of the funds to gold mines in South Africa without informing investors. It described the transfers as loans or purchases of equity interest — but the gold mining operations, the complaint reports, “returned no revenue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GP5Fm4"&gt;Crowd Machine ran into trouble several months after it began raising money. In mid-2018, it reported that &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/09/26/the-crowd-machine-crypto-token-theft-what-we-know-so-far/"&gt;hackers had stolen a large number&lt;/a&gt; of CMCTs — halting trading and sending the price of the coins tumbling. Two men were &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-sim-swappers-arrested-for-cmct-hack/"&gt;later arrested&lt;/a&gt; for the hack. Ultimately, “the secondary market for CMCTs all but disappeared, along with any value that CMCTs might once have held for token holders,” the complaint notes. The tokens were sold for between $0.03 and $0.22 per token and never traded for higher than $0.18 on a secondary market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYgXkc"&gt;Following the complaint, Sproule &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.390193/gov.uscourts.cand.390193.5.0.pdf"&gt;agreed to terms&lt;/a&gt; set by the SEC. The agreement doesn’t require him to admit wrongdoing, but it permanently bars him from offering securities, including cryptocurrency assets. He must also pay a civil penalty of $195,000 and agree to permanently disable any CMCTs that he owns.&lt;/p&gt;
