    <title>Latest iOS 15 beta fixes the Safari address bar and lets you move it back to the top</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RQiZaXf28tT68EDKnF3rm01iCgY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69738014/acastro_200207_3900_Safari_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tq7nN6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-15-beta-release-notes"&gt;Apple has updated Safari’s design&lt;/a&gt; in the latest iOS 15 beta (Developer Beta 6), making the address bar look and act more like what users are used to and giving you the option to put it at either the top or bottom of the screen. Safari’s redesign, especially on iPhones, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577475/apple-safari-macos-monterey-ios-15-developer-beta-3-change-design"&gt;been controversial&lt;/a&gt; since it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;was first announced&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems like Apple is starting to walk back the floating design that’s persisted throughout the beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mj0QLp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacStories&lt;/em&gt; founder and podcaster Federico Viticci has posted screenshots of the new design on Twitter, showing off the changes. If the user chooses to have the address bar on the bottom, it sits above a row of controls, including back and forward buttons, a share button, and the tab button. (In previous versions of the beta, these buttons were one with the address bar.) If the user chooses the option to have the address bar at the top, Safari will look similar to how it did in iOS 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9wNWNe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We did it everyone:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Safari in iOS 15 beta 6 features a new address bar at the bottom that sits below page content. A toolbar with buttons is back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And we can put the address bar back at the top again   &lt;a href="https://t.co/dbCvauXoDy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dbCvauXoDy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Federico Viticci (@viticci) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1427683610031702017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hzlfWB214q6IXC-JQKxypW0vLhk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788122/IMG_2284.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For comparison, this is Safari’s UI in the previous beta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DMjLV0"&gt;Apple has been tweaking and changing Safari’s new design since it made its debut in the first beta. The updates have been relatively small — buttons were added back into the address bar (making it a minefield of touch targets), and Apple &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/qtUKzWab71Q?t=256"&gt;made the address bar easier to get to when you’re typing in a URL or search term&lt;/a&gt;. However, the incremental updates haven’t appeased those calling for a return to a more traditional design, one that doesn’t include a floating element that hovers above a webpage’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2SaYo3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Options should help please those who (kind of) liked the change, and those who didn’t&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cRKvPp"&gt;The option to change where the address bar resides should please those who thought its new place at the bottom was a good one (regardless of how its actual design was executed), as well as those who prefer to have it at the top. It may make things tough for web designers, who will have to deal with the possibility of something butting up against either the top or bottom of their webpage, but it’s a nice option for users to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCHIpb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1427685686849769472?s=20"&gt;According to Viticci&lt;/a&gt;, the iPad version of Safari hasn’t changed with this update, though Apple introduced an option that more or less &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596478/apple-ios-15-beta-safari-tabs-compact-optional"&gt;let you go back to a traditional design&lt;/a&gt; in Beta 4.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EVgo launches new pricing plans and a rewards program</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SOfGP7X6zVuRIgNjekL5Eebf6r8=/0x0:5231x3487/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737960/B069C1F8_5E6C_495D_8097_017F02BD9DCF.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g9rSNR"&gt;EVgo is &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210816005630/en/EVgo-Announces-New-Nationwide-Plan-Options-New-Loyalty-Program-and-Innovative-Pricing-Pilot-in-California"&gt;changing how it prices the electricity&lt;/a&gt; that gets doled out on its electric vehicle charging networ, and is launching a nationwide rewards program for its customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlgfKA"&gt;Starting in September, the company will start offering &lt;a href="https://www.evgo.com/newpricing/"&gt;three ways to pay&lt;/a&gt; for charging on its network across the country. There’s the typical pay-as-you go option, which has the highest price-per-minute of charging and requires a $1.99 fee for each charging session. There’s a basic membership program that requires $4.99 per month of pre-payments toward charging, but which waives the session and (in most locations) offers per-minute rates that cost a few cents less. And now there’s a higher-tier $6.99 per-month subscription plan called EVgo Plus that drops the session fees and offers even more affordable pricing, and waives the $3 fee for reserving a charging stall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbn65Q"&gt;In California, however, EVgo will no longer charge per minute of charging in order to &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/01/07/update-californias-ban-on-per-minute-billing-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;comply with new state regulations&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it will charge per kilowatt-hour (kWh). There will be three different pricing windows throughout the day: “early-bird” (12AM-8AM local time), “on-peak” (4PM-9PM), and “off-peak” (8AM-4PM and 9PM-12AM). The idea with these is to incentivize drivers to charge at hours when electricity is not only more affordable, but also when the grid is less stressed. EVgo says it may expand this windowed pricing structure to other states down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBPDfG"&gt;“We want to make sure that we’re maximizing the positive impact of the grid and give customers choice,” EVgo’s chief commercial officer Jonathan Levy tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If you want to charge when it’s peak [hours] then that’s your choice, but there’s an economic reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hJ7tpM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Charging company EVgo is going public via SPAC merger","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22243080/evgo-chargin-spac-public-cris-david-crane-cathy-zoi"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9cIi4T"&gt;EVgo is also trialing new location-based pricing adjustments in San Francisco and Los Angeles that will factor in “environmental and social justice considerations,” congestion, and “other market dynamics.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oX2v6R"&gt;Along with the new pricing structures, EVgo will give out five “points” for every dollar spent on charging, which the company says can be used toward free charging sessions. Users of any of the three pricing plans can earn these points, though EVgo didn’t say how many would be required to unlock a free charging session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leQpPJ"&gt;“Reliability has been such an important facet for electric vehicle drivers, so we want to make sure that they’re rewarded for continuing to be loyal to us and coming back to those EVgo chargers they know they can count on,” Levy says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6Dxh8"&gt;The changes come as EVgo recently became a publicly traded company, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22243080/evgo-chargin-spac-public-cris-david-crane-cathy-zoi"&gt;a merger with a special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt;, or SPAC. It’s not alone — ChargePoint went public earlier this year after &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210301005278/en/ChargePoint-Becomes-the-World%E2%80%99s-First-Publicly-Traded-Global-EV-Charging-Network"&gt;merging with a SPAC&lt;/a&gt;, while others like EVBox and Wallbox have similar mergers in the works. These mergers are helping to bring a fresh round of investment to companies like EVgo, which could help make public EV chargers more ubiquitous. Expanding EV charging networks is a priority of the Biden administration and a focus of the infrastructure bill working its way through Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6fm5v"&gt;EVgo is also making these changes as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22596337/tesla-supercharger-elon-musk-open-network-charging-stations"&gt;Tesla is getting ready to potentially open up&lt;/a&gt; its own Supercharger network to non-Tesla EVs, something that would make the company eligible for government subsidies under the infrastructure bill. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter launches new process for reporting COVID misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JOR5shwF0-aU9ukrxB1rgkeFw-4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737830/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="euxgUJ"&gt;On Tuesday, Twitter announced that it will begin testing a new reporting feature for users to flag tweets containing possible misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYkvnT"&gt;Starting today, users will be able to report misinformation through the same process as harassment or other harmful content, through the dropdown menu at the top right of every tweet. Users will be prompted to select whether the misleading comment is political, health-related, or falls into another category. The politics category includes more specific forms of misinformation like content related to elections. The health category will also include an option for users to flag COVID-19-specific misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQcwqx"&gt;The new feature will be available on Tuesday for most users in the US, Australia, and South Korea. Twitter said it expects to run this experiment for a few months before deciding to roll it out to additional markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XGfbHy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not every report will be reviewed &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3hl0iZ"&gt;Twitter said that not every report will be reviewed as the platform continues to test the feature. But the data obtained through the test will help the company determine how it could expand on the feature over the next few weeks. The test could be used to identify tweets containing misinformation that have the potential to go viral as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxkvLZ"&gt;Last month, the Biden administration took a stronger stance against misinformation as new variants of COVID-19 have continued to spread. President Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580620/biden-facebook-vaccine-misinformation-platforms"&gt;told reporters&lt;/a&gt; in July that social media platforms like Facebook were “killing people” with vaccine misinformation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="916uUj"&gt;The statement followed a coordinated campaign from the White House pressuring platforms to more aggressively remove coronavirus misinformation. The US Surgeon General’s office &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578431/white-house-surgeon-general-facebook-youtube-twitter-covid-19-misinformation-vaccines"&gt;published a report&lt;/a&gt; outlining new ways platforms could counter health misinformation. The report called for “clear consequences for accounts that repeatedly violate” a platform’s rules and for companies like Facebook and Twitter to redesign their algorithms to “avoid amplifying” false information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQUHIY"&gt;Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588903/covid19-misinformation-section-230-facebook-joe-biden-white-house"&gt;introduced a bill&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year that would remove Facebook and other social media platforms’ Section 230 liability shield if they amplified harmful public health information. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon removed Hub lockers from two Chicago parks after public outcry</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f_efPfqG5MR83nWxsJlKrAxhAVY=/0x131:2016x1475/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737633/AmazonHubLockerChicaog.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Alderwoman Rossana Rodriguez&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bqdLdl"&gt;Amazon has removed two of its Hub lockers from parks in Chicago after public outcry over blocked sidewalks, &lt;a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/08/14/amazon-removes-delivery-lockers-from-chicago-parks-after-furor-over-installing-them-on-sidewalks/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Book Club Chicago&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. While they offer a convenient place to pick up packages and drop off returns, a locker making a public park less accessible might not be the kind of tradeoff even a devoted Amazon customer is comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkvVEF"&gt;Photos shared by the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RossanaFor33/status/1426215483288788995?s=20"&gt;33rd Ward Alderwoman Rossana Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt; make it pretty clear how egregious the placement was, at least in Brands Park. Technically, you could still roll by the locker and get to the rest of the park, but that possibility goes away as soon as someone stands in front to get something out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="80TtXv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; I’ve spent a good part of my morning handling the placement of an Amazon box at a park in my ward. On this instance apparently it was installed in the wrong spot &amp;amp; will be moved. But the fact that Amazon gets to use our public parks for this because of austerity is enraging. &lt;a href="https://t.co/5Rbabgcwt7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5Rbabgcwt7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alderwoman Rossana Rodriguez    ✊    (@RossanaFor33) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RossanaFor33/status/1426215483288788995?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E6raE5"&gt;The natural response was outrage, including comments that the locker placement looked too absurd to be real. &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/chicago-park-district-remove-amazon-from-parks-keep-public-spaces-community-focused?utm_content=cl_sharecopy_30321202_en-US%3A4&amp;amp;recruiter=12705437&amp;amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;amp;utm_campaign=share_petition"&gt;An online petition followed&lt;/a&gt;, and ultimately both &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RossanaFor33/status/1426976743592710144"&gt;the Brands Park locker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://nadignewspapers.com/2021/08/13/amazon-hub-locker-to-be-removed-from-forest-glen-park-at-alderman-nugents-request-lockers-also-installed-at-rosedale-wilson-other-area-parks/?fbclid=IwAR223XuvVcGUOAV28bqlbtv1uiEH86AZ7v7Q9jHia4e3G8c9GW5mMj-5Yzo"&gt;another locker at the Forest Glen Playlot&lt;/a&gt; were removed. Amazon also confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it plans to review future locations to prevent other problems. According to Amazon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yF3h0Q"&gt;We value the community’s feedback and took immediate action to respond to these concerns, working with the Chicago Park District to remove the Amazon Locker. We are also reviewing our other Locker installations in partnership with Chicago Park District to ensure they are all located in appropriate areas that serve both customers and the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="o8sNZa"&gt;What’s not entirely clear is how something like this happened. The Chicago Parks District tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it reviewed all of Amazon’s location choices beforehand “to ensure they met park needs,” but maybe sidewalk accessibility wasn’t a top priority? There’s also the larger question of why the city is cutting deals to put the private property of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17819160/amazon-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value"&gt;trillion-dollar companies&lt;/a&gt; in public parks in the first place. Rodriguez suggested to &lt;em&gt;Book Club Chicago&lt;/em&gt; that lockers popping up in parks is a result of underfunding: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5XsF5t"&gt;When you have public institutions that are not well-funded, and can’t function with the budget they’re provided by the government, they need to look for other sources of revenue. This is how we get a company like Amazon to have a presence in our public parks. It’s disheartening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pECZU3"&gt;Whatever the reason, the slow creep of the private and paid into public goods like parks always feels icky. It seems like the Chicago Parks District still plans to move forward with its Amazon deal, but hopefully, future placements are more thoughtful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGmjIC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBawjB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ME9nRr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nerf just made the iconic Aliens Pulse Rifle into a badass foam blaster</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EPwRB1yHQPSMmmqBJdPsTw84WaY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737604/Nerf_LMTD_Aliens_M41_A_3_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1JeqBn"&gt;That huge carry handle, pump-action underbarrel grenade launcher, and digital ammo counter on the side: is there a more iconic sci-fi weapon than the &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt; M41A Pulse Rifle? Now, it’s about to become an iconic Nerf blaster as well, because Hasbro has just announced a $95 version that flings&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;foam darts — enough of them that it might actually be viable in a stock Nerf war! &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uli7jYcmdqpnpsPpR_wOimuGN48=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787876/aliens_nerf_pulse_rifle_spin_2.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="f8dSCU"&gt;You see, unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22153843/the-mandalorian-rifle-nerf-star-wars-amban-phase-pulse-blaster"&gt;Nerf’s $130 blaster rifle from &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or most of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/6/17657140/nerf-overwatch-guns-foam-shooting-blasters-blizzard"&gt;its &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; toys&lt;/a&gt;, this 28-inch long blaster isn’t just a prop with a few token foam projectiles inside: it’s a fully-automatic blaster that takes Nerf Elite-sized dart magazines a la &lt;a href="https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/RapidStrike_CS-18"&gt;the fan-favorite RapidStrike&lt;/a&gt;, powered by four C batteries, plus “movie-inspired blast sounds.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OV2waa"&gt;Oh, and Hasbro tells me that’s a genuine digital ammo counter on the side: it actually counts darts even if you hold the trigger down! The standard mag contains 10 darts, but it should fit less screen-accurate aftermarket ones to increase your capacity, and you can set the ammo counter as high as 99. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l7OGTna9zErJffeJvv-EgCo6Qs4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787903/aliens_nerf_pulse_rifle_4.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gL8jbo"&gt;That underbarrel grenade launcher actually fires Nerf Mega darts (one at a time) and has a genuine spring-loaded plunger tube inside connected to a secondary trigger you can actually pull — unlike, say, the pitiful underbarrel rocket launcher on &lt;a href="https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/Demolisher_2-In-1"&gt;Nerf’s old Demolisher&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/HAMP"&gt;similar blasters&lt;/a&gt; where you had to pull hard on a manual plunger to pop a rocket out. There doesn’t seem to be an internal magazine for additional Mega darts, though, so you might have to keep those in a pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4NXY6VqAn5jRFCNnNk2tl49FhXk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788025/Hasbro_Nerf_Aliens_Open2_FINAL.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uaEXJ7"&gt;For years, toy blaster fans have been trying to replicate the features and functionality of the iconic &lt;em&gt;Aliens &lt;/em&gt;Pulse Rifle, converting their Thompson airsoft replicas and Nerf blasters into full-scale props. They’d often zip-tie or meld Nerf’s own blasters beneath their RapidStrikes or Stryfes to get an underbarrel blaster like this. My favorite so far is Campbell Nerf Works’ &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4569308"&gt;Stryfle, a 3D-printed set of parts&lt;/a&gt; you can use to combine a Stryfe and a handleless &lt;a href="https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/Magnus"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; to great effect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="czKkO0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DreGO7bXpRQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xaHtIA"&gt;I’m actually working on a “Vitamin C Edition” of the Stryfle &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1427700378070503424"&gt;myself.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hh7SZL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My in-progress Stryfle &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZFLKeUHGTZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZFLKeUHGTZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1427700378070503424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s3kmW8"&gt;But now, you don’t need to be a modder to have a fully functioning &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt; Pulse Rifle that fires Nerf darts and looks far more the part. Well, at least you don’t once &lt;em&gt;October 2022&lt;/em&gt; rolls around, because today’s preorders aren’t expected to ship for a very long while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HpGKyK"&gt;And while $95 is a lot, it’s a good bit less than many of Hasbro’s other licensed collectibles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18760160/nerf-overwatch-soldier-76-blaster-hasbro"&gt;like the $130 Soldier 76 pulse rifle from &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not every day Hasbro gets a licensed blaster right (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22153843/the-mandalorian-rifle-nerf-star-wars-amban-phase-pulse-blaster"&gt;I lay out some examples here&lt;/a&gt;), but this feels like it might be one of them. You can find preorders &lt;a href="https://hasbropulse.com/products/nerf-lmtd-aliens-m41-a-blaster"&gt;at Hasbro Pulse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=Verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Ftoys-games%2Fnerf%2Fproducts%2Fnerf-aliens-lmtd-aliens-m41a-pulse-blaster%2F11155847.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, with EB Games Canada to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says SharePlay won’t be part of initial iOS 15 release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MLV1QOYraAdCGnrD9LKF3x-VKrc=/13x0:2032x1346/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737506/D3743FFE_9B62_4074_ADC3_50C2232BB74A.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nCkPhu"&gt;One of iOS 15’s marquee new features, SharePlay, has been delayed and now won’t be rolled out until after the major update is released this fall. &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/"&gt;Apple has informed developers&lt;/a&gt; that SharePlay will be disabled in the next betas of iOS 15, iPadOS15, tvOS 15, and macOS Monterey. SharePlay allows people to enjoy entertainment (TV shows, movies, music, etc.) together at the same time and syncs everything up across devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vlzp23"&gt;The company has confirmed that this feature will be absent in the official release of iOS 15 when it widely rolls out in the fall. Apple now says that SharePlay will return “in future developer beta releases and will launch to the public in software updates later this fall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xOg5i"&gt;“We’re thrilled with the high level of enthusiasm we’ve seen from the developer community for SharePlay, and we can’t wait to bring it to users so that they can experience your apps with their friends and family in a whole new way,” Apple said in its update to developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4G10w"&gt;This is the first major new aspect of iOS 15 to be pulled back from the launch release, but it will undoubtedly raise questions about which other features might also have to wait for a later update. Apple has yet to include Universal Control, one of the most impressive tricks it showed off at WWDC, in any of this summer’s beta releases. Universal Control will allow iPad and Mac owners to work seamlessly across both products with the same keyboard and mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaLdpC"&gt;Apple has held back some of its promised features from previous major iOS releases until they were more polished and ready to go. As just one example, Group FaceTime was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17684154/apple-group-facetime-chats-delay-ios-12"&gt;delayed from the initial release of iOS 12&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 until a smaller update that rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18040034/apple-ios-12-1-release-date-october-30-features-group-facetime-beautygate"&gt;at the end of October&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUAdXX"&gt;Check out our preview of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;iOS 15 and iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt; for a rundown of all the new features that Apple says will be available — at some point, anyway — later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thrilling new trailer for Star Wars’ anime anthology series is filled with action and style</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SEyH5zBawmDceiZJ9RimJi59lQs=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737205/star_wars_visions_trailer_tall_28fja0_1_1024x576.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S4Fx6o"&gt;Disney has shared an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtAsl-0o3O0"&gt;impressive trailer for &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Visions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, its anime anthology series premiering September 22nd on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1128412/9358?subId1=Verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus.&lt;/a&gt; The trailer oozes style and flair, and it looks like the series will tell some thrilling new stories in the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTxk8H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; will feature nine animated shorts from seven anime studios. Disney also revealed the English dub voice cast, which features some big names including Alison Brie, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, David Harbour, Neil Patrick Harris, Lucy Liu, and Temuera Morrison (who is reprising his role as Boba Fett). You can see more of the cast here on &lt;a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-visions-trailer-and-cast"&gt;the official &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;. And Disney says that you’ll be able to watch the series both with the English dub cast and the original Japanese voice cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nTtHZ9"&gt;The series is the latest &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; show to hit Disney Plus. &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: The Bad Batch&lt;/em&gt; premiered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418964/star-wars-the-bad-batch-disney-plus-streaming"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt;, and there are a lot of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; series on the horizon, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188516/boba-fett-disney-plus-show-2021-release-date-mandalorian-finale"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a spinoff starring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168641/star-wars-andor-cassian-disney-plus-2022-diego-luna"&gt;Diego Luna as Cassian Andor from &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones appear again in leaked promotional photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-F405X-1BdHBLozQ7-qZT3RG88s=/0x0:1025x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737199/1DCA3BF9_1097_47CE_BF94_B3A57331EC07.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,124669.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rfMEWb"&gt;After first surfacing last month in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583264/bose-quietcomfort-45-headphones-qc45-fcc-filing-leak"&gt;an FCC filing&lt;/a&gt; (which Bose quickly withdrew), the company’s upcoming QuietComfort 45 headphones have now been leaked more extensively &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,124669.html"&gt;courtesy of &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Set to be priced at $329, the QC45s certainly look the part of a successor to the popular QC35s. The overall design is very similar, with some modern refinements like a USB-C port thrown in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoVaAr"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;, the QC45s will offer active noise cancellation, an Aware Mode for piping in outside noise, and be tuned with Bose’s signature Active EQ. Battery life is expected to be up to 24 hours of continuous playback. A quick 15-minute charge will give the headphones 2.5 hours of listening time. Multipoint pairing to two devices at the same time will be supported. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-N2iBnHsDVWeDgAcbRgCixkB970=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787786/CB3B0436_173C_43FB_9B53_DD2757BB905F.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,124669.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The QC45s looks very similar to the prior QC35II headphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zT8MDP"&gt;Bose’s last flagship headphones, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Noise Cancelling Headphones 700&lt;/a&gt;, introduced a much different, more premium design than the QC35s. They also gave customers more control over the balance of noise cancellation and ambient sound. But they came with their own set of tradeoffs. The headphones couldn’t be folded down for compact storage, and they couldn’t match the airy comfort of Bose’s prior cans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOCgLy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t know how strong the ANC on the QC45s will be, but Bose has every reason to exceed expectations. With the QC35 and QC35II headphones, there was a long saga where some customers insisted that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20696186/bose-qc35ii-headphones-worse-noise-cancellation-problems"&gt;noise cancellation had been rendered less effective&lt;/a&gt; after a firmware update. There were enough complaints for Bose to conduct an in-depth examination of the perceived problem, and it even sought out independent third-party testing. But the company ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21209974/bose-qc35-qc35ii-noise-canceling-investigation-firmware"&gt;concluded that its firmware hadn’t caused any ANC degradation&lt;/a&gt; and pointed to “hardware related issues with ear cushions, aftermarket parts, or mechanical integrity” as the reason some customers ran into problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOs2xF"&gt;With the QuietComfort 45s leaking to this degree, it seems an official release can’t be that much farther off. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES 2022 to require proof of vaccination for attendees, exhibitors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inside The 2017 Consumer Electronics Show" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/on9xFC5AOs8eX89IBNpF98XI8sA=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737042/631003660.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U9okc1"&gt;After an online-only event this year, the CTA is still planning to put on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407494/ces-2022-in-person-conference-event-tech-show-las-vegas-january"&gt;CES 2022&lt;/a&gt; as a hybrid event with in-person and digital components. Today &lt;a href="https://www.ces.tech/News/Press-Releases/CES-Press-Release.aspx?NodeID=c2667de6-cc7d-4887-beb7-e216f165a584"&gt;the CTA announced&lt;/a&gt; that if you’re planning on showing up in Las Vegas, then you will need to provide proof of vaccination against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="uv8nzp"&gt;PROOF OF COVID-19 VACCINATION REQUIRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHhcSr"&gt;On August 17, CTA announced that all attendees and exhibitors will need to show proof of vaccination in order to attend CES. CTA continues to monitor guidelines for health safety measures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Nevada and Clark County. CTA will follow applicable federal, state and local laws, adapting CES plans accordingly and sharing updates with you and other CES audiences. We are also working closely with the Las Vegas community, including the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, exhibit venues and hotels, and if they adjust their plans, we will communicate that as well. While the situation will continue to evolve over the coming months, read the information below for just some of the precautions we will implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DBYUtc"&gt;Navigating the CES show floor without picking up an infectious disease is tricky even when there isn’t a global pandemic, so the guidelines shouldn’t come as a surprise. The announcement comes at the same time as New York City rolls out its&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607882/key-to-nyc-pass-covid-vaccine-proof-new-york-city"&gt; Key to NYC Pass&lt;/a&gt; plan, and concert promoter &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/live-nation-updates-covid-19-vaccination-negative-test-1212323/"&gt;Live Nation says it will require vaccination or a negative test&lt;/a&gt; for attendees and crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdLSeL"&gt;As far as those who are not vaccinated, whether by their own choice or because they live somewhere without access to vaccines, the CTA says it’s “assessing the acceptance of proof of a positive antibody test as an alternative requirement.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MJLmB"&gt;It’s also unknown how this will apply to events happening beyond the show floor and keynote ballrooms, or outside the CTA’s umbrella entirely. We expect to hear more details about all of this long before the CES 2022 media days start on January 3rd, or when the show floor opens on January 5th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Platforms struggle with Taliban policy amid chaotic US withdrawal</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Four men facing away from the camera carry military rifles along an empty street, flanked by concrete barriers." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v_pSXXPwdkdbfc9uWZERh8hz0LI=/0x0:4783x3189/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69736955/1234727262.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Taliban fighters patrol a road in Kabul | Photo by WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ywR2hD"&gt;Social platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are coming under new scrutiny for the way they treat Taliban accounts, as the militant Islamist group emerges as the dominant power in Afghanistan in the wake of the US withdrawal. While none of the platforms have publicly changed their policies on the group, moderation practices have come under close scrutiny, and many are shifting resources to ensure the policies are appropriately enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRAVaz"&gt;A particular question &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/17/technology-202-facebook-twitter-youtube-face-high-stakes-question-whether-recognize-taliban/"&gt;raised by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is whether the group will be allowed to wrest control of the official Facebook and Twitter accounts for the government of Afghanistan. While the Taliban has seized effective control over the government, granting access to official accounts could be seen as legitimizing their control over the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6TRkkB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook does not make decisions about the recognized government in any particular country”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JisP0r"&gt;Despite a number of official bans, Taliban forces appear to have embraced tech platforms when reclaiming territory. Early Monday, an official spokesperson for the Taliban &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Zabehulah_M33/status/1427126736026836995"&gt;used Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to claim control of the capital city of Kabul, saying the situation there was “under control.” &lt;a href="https://freebeacon.com/national-security/taliban-leaders-used-twitter-and-whatsapp-to-help-capture-kabul/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Free Beacon&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Taliban officials were circulating WhatsApp numbers that could be used by former regime members to coordinate surrender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGljGP"&gt;The Taliban is officially banned from all Facebook services, including WhatsApp, but the service’s end-to-end encryption makes it easy for Taliban accounts to avoid moderation action. A WhatsApp spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; that moderators take action against violating accounts when moderators become aware of them — but without access to user communications, it is rare that WhatsApp would become aware of a Taliban account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmBSEg"&gt;Twitter does not have a blanket policy on Taliban activity, but told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it takes action against accounts violating existing rules against violent content or platform manipulation. “The situation in Afghanistan is rapidly evolving,” a spokesperson said. “We’re also witnessing people in the country using Twitter to seek help and assistance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IVHW1g"&gt;Reached for comment by The Verge, YouTube said it terminates all Taliban-linked accounts based on its interpretation of US sanctions law. “YouTube complies with all applicable sanctions and trade compliance laws, including relevant &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20061219"&gt;U.S. sanctions&lt;/a&gt;,” a representative said. “As such, if we find an account believed to be owned and operated by the Afghan Taliban, we terminate it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7Czo5"&gt;Facebook has designated the Taliban as a dangerous organization, which means it removes accounts representing the group and prohibits praise or support of it in user posts. The company has devoted more resources to enforcing that policy in light of the ongoing unrest in Kabul. Still, the company said it is waiting for guidance from outside organizations as to whether the Taliban should be recognized as the de facto government of Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YnF7yh"&gt;“Facebook does not make decisions about the recognized government in any particular country but instead respects the authority of the international community in making these determinations,” a Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Regardless of who holds power, we will take the appropriate action against accounts and content that breaks our rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hswf54"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1:10pm: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from YouTube spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
