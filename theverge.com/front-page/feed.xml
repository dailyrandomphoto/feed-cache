    <title>Clean energy faces its own supply chain crisis </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="riKV7J"&gt;The future of energy in America will depend on whether the US can break free from its dependence on other countries that dominate clean energy supply chains. To reach the Biden administration’s energy and environmental goals, the US will have to dramatically scale up its mining and manufacturing, lawmakers argued today during a joint &lt;a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-securing-americas-future-supply-chain-solutions-for-a-clean"&gt;hearing&lt;/a&gt; of the House Energy Subcommittee and the Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee. They also raised serious concerns about the US’s ability to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yzpDE"&gt;“The sustainable economy of the future will definitely need to be built and manufactured. The question that remains to be seen is whether it will be manufactured by Americans,” said Congressman Paul Tonko (D-NY) in his opening statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ToGwIG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The question that remains to be seen is whether it will be manufactured by Americans.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H450wl"&gt;Joe Biden has pledged to get the US on a path to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, a key target that climate scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; as necessary to stave off catastrophic effects of climate change. On the way there, Biden envisions a 100 percent “clean” power sector by 2035. He also wants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22610501/biden-2030-ev-goal-trump-emissions-rollback"&gt;half of all new cars&lt;/a&gt; sold in 2030 to be electric or hybrid vehicles.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XG5tuP"&gt;Those ambitions, however, will depend on the US’s ability to get enough solar panels, wind turbines, lithium-ion batteries, and other critical clean energy technologies and raw materials. But supply chains for these technologies, and for the raw materials like lithium and cobalt that underpin them, are largely concentrated overseas. This was already creating challenges for the US before the pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22757240/global-supply-chain-management-shortage-covid"&gt;screwed up supply chains&lt;/a&gt;, and there are even bigger hurdles to overcome now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gidJ0J"&gt;The supply chain for solar panels is an illustrative example. Only 3 percent of solar photovoltaic modules shipped around the world in 2020 were made in the US. Mining and manufacturing for solar power technology is concentrated in China. &lt;a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/Briefing%20Memo_ECCENG_2021.11.16_0.pdf"&gt;Sixty-three percent of polysilicon, a key material in solar panels, is produced in China. Seventy-nine percent of solar cells are built in China.&lt;/a&gt; The US mines some polysilicon but, without domestic facilities, sends it to China to be processed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9leP0"&gt;By 2020, the International Energy Agency had crowned solar energy “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514902/solar-energy-cost-historic-low-energy-agency-outlook-2020"&gt;the new king&lt;/a&gt;” of electricity supply because of falling costs and its projected growth over the next several years. But pandemic-induced inflation and supply chain bottlenecks now threaten that progress, according to an October &lt;a href="https://www.rystadenergy.com/newsevents/news/press-releases/most-of-2022s-solar-PV-projects-risk-delay-or-cancelation-due-to-soaring-material-and-shipping-costs/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by Rystad Energy. Rising costs now jeopardize more than half the projected capacity of new utility-scale solar projects planned for 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frnBX0"&gt;Other clean energy technologies and raw materials are similarly vulnerable to global shocks and are dominated by China or a handful of other countries. This includes the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-faces-uphill-climb-to-rival-chinas-rare-earth-magnet-industry-11618133603"&gt;rare earth elements&lt;/a&gt; used in electric vehicle motors and wind turbines and the lithium inside electric car batteries.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The Department of Energy released a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22524663/us-lithium-battery-supply-chain-broken"&gt;national blueprint&lt;/a&gt;” to boost domestic production of lithium batteries back in June. Without any interventions, a previous &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/FCAB%20National%20Blueprint%20Lithium%20Batteries%200621_0.pdf"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that US battery production capacity&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;wouldn’t be able to meet even half of the projected demand for lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles in 2028 as more people leave gas-powered cars behind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PknZkV"&gt;Republicans and Democrats sparred with each other and with experts who gave testimony over the feasibility&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;of Biden’s timeline for a clean energy transition&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;given the supply chain challenges. “We can produce more and more of these products that we use for renewable energy, but we can’t get it done on the timelines that are being put out,” Congressman Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) said. Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) described the clean energy transition as a “rush to green radical agenda.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="KsDnOd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are well behind on a transition that’s taking place around the globe.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gTktap"&gt;“Only here in the US is this viewed as a rush,” Ethan Zindler, head of Americas at energy research firm Bloomberg New Energy Finance, who gave expert testimony, shot back. “We are well behind on a transition that’s taking place around the globe,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kRl5d"&gt;To achieve its energy aims, Biden signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill into law this week that invests in electric vehicle charging stations and funds a big overhaul of the US electric grid. If Democrats manage to pass an even larger spending bill languishing in Congress, an even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759985/biden-budget-reconciliation-infrastructure-bills-power-grid-climate"&gt;bigger investment in clean energy&lt;/a&gt; could be on the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tiKl4P"&gt;Republicans slammed Democrats for boosting spending for clean energy while Americans face higher costs for oil and gas during a global supply pinch. Democrats defended the infrastructure legislation, calling it a “counter-inflationary” measure that would create jobs and make the US competitive against China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7Fzov"&gt;Another point of contention was whether the US should dig up more critical minerals on its own land. That would decrease dependence on outside sources, but it poses potential threats to the local environment and nearby communities. The largest lithium resource in the US, for example, sits on land and a potential gravesite &lt;a href="https://grist.org/protest/native-opposition-to-nevada-lithium-mine-grows/"&gt;held sacred by &lt;/a&gt;members of the &lt;a href="https://grist.org/protest/native-opposition-to-nevada-lithium-mine-grows/"&gt;Fort McDermitt Paiute-Shoshone Tribe&lt;/a&gt; in Nevada. Activists are also &lt;a href="https://www.sierranevadaally.org/2021/05/20/people-of-red-mountain-statement-of-opposition-to-lithium-nevada-corps-proposed-thacker-pass-open-pit-lithium-mine/"&gt;concerned&lt;/a&gt; that a proposed mine at that site, called Thacker Pass, could harm local wildlife and exacerbate a water shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UK3YRd"&gt;“We’re restricting mining in America to acquire these critical minerals that we need for renewables, but you don’t like getting them from China or the Congo,” Representative David McKinley (R-WV) said. “I have to say you can’t have your cake and eat it, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jIVaqk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You can’t have your cake and eat it, too.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LvPz9O"&gt;An expert from Redwood Materials, a lithium battery recycling company founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, advocated for building up the US’s battery recycling capacity as an alternative solution to the US’s supply chain woes. “Quickly ramping a domestic battery material supply chain using the highest possible percent of local recycled raw materials is the best way we can help meet the US’s energy goals,” said Jackson Switzer, director of business development at Redwood Materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EZNni"&gt;The hearing went on for over four hours as lawmakers probed everything from China’s history of &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-xinjiang-solar/"&gt;labor abuses tied to solar panels&lt;/a&gt; to how to ensure that clean energy comes with good jobs in the US. While Biden has made well-paid jobs a central talking point of his clean energy agenda, witnesses reminded lawmakers that all the talk still needs to turn into action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcz8TZ"&gt;“I’ve spent a lot of time over the last 15 years testifying and speaking on panels about the hope of the clean energy economy for my members and really for domestic industry,” Roxanne Brown, international vice president at large for United Steelworkers, said in her expert testimony. “And it’s been too long to be having this conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon to ban Visa credit cards in the UK in battle over payment fees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Visa logos appear on credit and debit cards arranged for a p" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S-8RtHfyYOpPRFRhQ-Y7S07kJMk=/148x0:3045x1931/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70153572/94970658.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nkIhaT"&gt;Amazon will stop accepting payments from Visa credit cards issued in the UK from January 19th, 2022. Customers will still be able to use Visa &lt;em&gt;debit&lt;/em&gt; cards issued in the UK, as well as credit cards issued by MasterCard, American Express, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GFBWMNXEPYVJAY9A"&gt;other firms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzpF8J"&gt;Amazon is blocking UK credit cards from Visa as part of an ongoing battle over “interchange” fees — levies charged by card issuers to a merchant’s bank for each transaction. Visa’s interchange fees for transactions between the UK and the European Union (where Amazon UK processes payments) were previously capped at 0.3 percent by EU law. But since the UK left the EU, Visa has been able to &lt;a href="https://thepaypers.com/online-payments/visa-raises-interchange-fees-for-uk-based-cardholders--1247923"&gt;hike that fee&lt;/a&gt; to 1.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QPO5fP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not clear why Visa is being singled out by Amazon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7e4liK"&gt;However, Visa isn’t the only company to make such a change. MasterCard made an &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/39f553a0-00c5-48ad-a8ee-0b9fd75554b0"&gt;identical increase&lt;/a&gt; to its interchange fees before Visa, but it hasn’t been blocked by Amazon. It’s not entirely clear why Visa has been singled out. It may simply be a strategic decision on Amazon’s part — to hurt one company instead of taking on an entire industry. Or there may be specific complications in Visa’s payment policies. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/amazon-will-stop-accepting-visa-credit-cards-issued-in-the-u-k?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that the company has increased interchange fees for e-commerce sites, while reducing fees in other areas, like education and real estate purchases. It’s not clear if policies from MasterCard or other card issuers make similar distinctions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxVhvQ"&gt;In a statement from an Amazon, the company said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="7D13fU"&gt;“The cost of accepting card payments continues to be an obstacle for businesses striving to provide the best prices for customers. These costs should be going down over time with technological advancements, but instead they continue to stay high or even rise. As a result of Visa’s continued high cost of payments, we regret that Amazon.co.uk will no longer accept UK-issued Visa credit cards as of 19 January, 2022. Customers can continue to use all debit cards (including Visa debit cards) and other non-Visa credit cards to shop on Amazon.co.uk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xFSPJK"&gt;While a spokesperson for Visa &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-59306200"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UAQPoS"&gt;“UK shoppers can use their Visa debit and credit cards at Amazon UK today and throughout the holiday season. We are very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future. When consumer choice is limited, nobody wins. We have a long-standing relationship with Amazon, and we continue to work toward a resolution, so our cardholders can use their preferred Visa credit cards at Amazon UK without Amazon-imposed restrictions come January 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Sonos finally adds DTS audio support to its home theater lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/etXtoJcBH1K_lTpON8gdOua5W3k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70153469/cwelch_290921_4780_5672.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The second-generation Sonos Beam soundbar.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yVmXab"&gt;Sonos’ &lt;a href="https://support.sonos.com/s/article/3521?language=en_US&amp;amp;ver=134"&gt;latest update&lt;/a&gt; contains big news for surround sound fans: the addition of DTS audio support for its home theater speakers. These include not just newer speakers like the second-generation Beam and Arc, but also older devices like the first-gen Beam, the Playbase, and even the Playbar that originally launched in 2013. Even the Sonos Amp is getting in on the DTS action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNyObw"&gt;For those unfamiliar with the technical nightmare that is home cinema audio, DTS is a rival surround sound format to Dolby Digital. So DTS support means that Sonos users can benefit from surround sound across more sources, like Blu-ray discs that use the DTS format. The release of the update comes a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22764957/marvel-disney-plus-imax-expanded-aspect-ratio"&gt;Disney announced&lt;/a&gt; that DTS audio support will be coming to its Disney Plus streaming service in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8q6UFZxSeqxnfaKdU7QGfr3lRQ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021345/6LXPooz.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/qvcc4s/comment/hkvu1d1/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3" target="_blank"&gt;u/No_Author_4413&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A “DTS Surround 5.1” badge appears when compatible audio is being played.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oh7pfI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/qvcc4s/dts_digital_surround_now_supported_with_latest/"&gt;Users on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; who’ve tried out the functionality report that Sonos only seems to support standard DTS Digital Surround, so you won’t be able to get the most out of sources that use the higher specced DTS-HD and DTS:X formats. If you try and play DTS-HD, it reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/qvcc4s/comment/hkwobw2/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;comes through as regular DTS&lt;/a&gt;. The Sonos app shows a small “&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/a/H18wYZW"&gt;DTS Surround 5.1&lt;/a&gt;” badge when a speaker system is playing the format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GYRq3"&gt;Other niggles you might need to watch out for are whether your TV supports DTS audio. LG’s popular &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/lg/cx-oled"&gt;CX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/lg/c1-oled"&gt;C1&lt;/a&gt; OLED TVs, for example, don’t support DTS, which means you’ll run into issues if you’re passing DTS audio through them via HDMI. Sending audio directly from an external source to your Sonos equipment &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; work, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1yZSa"&gt;Other new features introduced as part of the 13.4 update include a new Battery Saver mode for portable Sonos products like the Roam which, when activated, will automatically turn the speaker off after 30 minutes to conserve battery life. By default it currently just goes into a low-power sleep mode. The Now Playing screen in the Sonos app on iOS includes a new shortcut to access EQ settings and a new HD badge that will appear when “higher quality audio” is being played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hD60Uy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LA’s Staples Center will be renamed ‘Crypto.com Arena’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Utah Jazz v Los Angeles Lakers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/81r94hs0Gkg4m1PMc59nuMXMbb8=/4x0:4252x2832/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70153268/521074336.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Juan Ocampo/NBAE via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3yoJ9c"&gt;The Staples Center, home to Los Angeles sports teams including the Lakers, Clippers, Kings, and Sparks, is getting a new name: “Crypto.com Arena.” Yes, Crypto Dot Com Arena. The cryptocurrency exchange paid more than $700 million for 20-year naming rights, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-11-16/crypto-staples"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, making it one of the largest such deals ever. Staples paid $100 million for the rights for 10 years in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="263h0N"&gt;The logo will reportedly be revealed on Christmas Day for the Brooklyn Nets’ game with the Lakers, and Staples Center branding should be phased out by June. “In the next few years, people will look back at this moment as the moment when crypto crossed the chasm into the mainstream,” Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek tells the &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt;. “This is just such a brilliant move from the guys at [venue owner] AEG, because the next decade belongs to crypto.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLntaO"&gt;The Clippers’ star forward Paul George is less convinced by the move. “I grew up with ... Staples Center being the place to play and the place to be,” he says in comments &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BenGolliver/status/1460856127722115074"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;’s Ben Golliver&lt;/a&gt;. “It will definitely be weird. It’s the same location, but it‘s kind of stripping the history here… Good thing we won’t be here too long.” The Steve Ballmer-owned Clippers are moving to a new arena called Intuit Dome in 2024; the Staples Center is currently the only arena shared by two NBA teams.&lt;/p&gt;

The company has ventured into sports sponsorship before, including a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/29/formula-1-strikes-100-million-cryptocurrency-sponsorship.html"&gt;$100 million deal with Formula 1&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year and various partnerships with teams including Paris Saint-Germain, the Philadelphia 76ers, and the Montreal Canadiens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1kp7g"&gt;The NBA, of course, is no stranger to blockchain technology, having partnered with Dapper Labs to launch the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;Top Shot trading card platform&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most mainstream implementations of NFTs to date. And earlier this year, the Miami Heat’s home American Airlines Arena was renamed after crypto exchange FTX.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fujifilm announces film-digital hybrid Instax Mini Evo camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AKgexFZeZclhJ3g8NU71w4guqA0=/0x3:1500x1003/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70153095/thum_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sx6hD5"&gt;Fujifilm has &lt;a href="https://www.fujifilm.com/jp/en/news/hq/7203"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the Instax Mini Evo, a new digital camera that prints to Instax Mini film. The company describes it as a new Instax flagship that has been “designed with a premium and classical touch;” and it has several retro elements including top-mounted dials and a print control that works like a film advance lever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GULfVN"&gt;Like other hybrid Instax cameras, the Mini Evo has an LCD screen to help you frame your digital shots before printing. The Mini Evo includes ten lens effects that can be combined and applied to photos, and Fujifilm says that it has twice the exposure resolution of previous models. Image quality from Fujifilm’s previous hybrid Instax cameras &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/2/15725890/fujifilm-instax-sq10-review-instant-polaroid-digital-camera"&gt;hasn’t been great&lt;/a&gt;, so we’ll have to see how this one works out in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/41ukrRRfAzMhC4ZIdvVn9qFsyJo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021017/thum_03.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4rXmA8"&gt;The Mini Evo also works as an Instax printer, meaning you can print out pictures from your smartphone wirelessly. In the opposite direction, Fujifilm has added a new feature to let you save printed Mini Evo photos to your phone complete with embedded Instax frames, so you can share them as digital Instax snaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGlZfn"&gt;Fujifilm will release the Instax Mini Evo in Japan on December 3rd, but it won’t make its way to the US until February. It’ll cost $199.95.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s new Kaira Pro headset will bring the bass to PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Kaira headset for PS5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WoXnARwsGBKRYyxUE-jcZ4E2qLk=/0x0:7244x4829/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70152884/kairaprops5hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kaira lineup for PS5 has leatherette-covered ear cups.&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hRXwbL"&gt;After releasing a fleet of gaming products geared toward Xbox and PC, Razer is finally giving the PS5 a little love with two new Kaira wireless headsets, the $99.99 Kaira and the $199.99 Kaira Pro. They aren’t carbon copies of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21545683/razer-kaira-pro-xbox-wireless-gaming-headset-series-x-s-one-pc-microsoft-usb-c"&gt;Xbox versions&lt;/a&gt;, either. Razer made a color palette swap to a white / black colorway, and there’s leatherette covering the ear cups, as opposed to a piece of breathable mesh fabric. But that’s not all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLVE3x"&gt;The more expensive Kaira Pro is the only one of the two models to have HyperSense haptics, which will deliver jolts of vibration to make your games and other content more immersive. Razer recently announced that this feature’s coming to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22736367/razer-kraken-v3-gaming-headset-design-features-haptics-price"&gt;new (and similarly priced) Kraken V3 Pro&lt;/a&gt; that is also made to support PlayStation consoles, in addition to PC and the Nintendo Switch dock. I’ve yet to experience the HyperSense haptics myself, but it could make for an alluring feature stacked on Sony’s 3D Audio tech on the PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Kaira headset for PS5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q3NSgzl2erb19uOonQbvBkyGUaw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018607/kairasmartswitch.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the Kaira and Kaira Pro for PS5 support 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NdSS5K"&gt;Razer claims to have dipped the TriForce 50mm drivers in titanium for enhanced audio quality in the Kaira Pro. Regarding the microphone, you’ll get a HyperClear supercardioid mic with the Kaira Pro compared to a cardioid mic with the standard Kaira.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93xTRc"&gt;Aside from those perks that come with paying more for Kaira Pro, these headsets have several traits in common, including a SmartSwitch wireless feature that lets them connect to a 2.4GHz dongle or low-latency Bluetooth and a 3.5mm jack for wired mode. They both include the USB-C HyperSpeed audio transmitter, with a USB-A adapter for broader compatibility. I like what Razer’s done here with its new USB-C transmitter; it shifted the jack from the middle (where it was located &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kcecA4cBpX8dZ1P9-ZvM6u-xafA=/0x0:2040x1360/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22703920/cfaulkner_210706_4660_0003.jpg"&gt;in a previous iteration&lt;/a&gt;) nearly all the way to one side, so you can utilize the PS5’s other front-facing USB-A port for a different accessory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer USB-C dongle" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6X0EoC8WzsWLd8BvdBJtU21fsDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018594/razerkairaprousbdongle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C jack placement means this dongle won’t extend over the PS5’s USB-A port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjzcJT"&gt;I anticipate testing these soon, and we’ll see if they give Sony’s $100 Pulse 3D headset a run for its money. The market for made-for-PlayStation headsets is finally heating up, as SteelSeries recently launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22726734/steelseries-arctis-7-7p-plus-battery-life-usb-c-features-price-compatibility"&gt;$169.99 Arctis 7P Plus with USB-C charging and better battery life&lt;/a&gt;. Though, this Kaira line might get the edge over both of those if you want dual wireless connectivity via 2.4GHz and Bluetooth. The Kaira is available now. As for the Kaira Pro, Razer will begin taking preorders on November 30th, and is aiming to ship them in December.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Theranos drained $96 million from an experienced investor — plus some blood</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Attends Criminal Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QDsIbbtgu9UPVEwcYjyxY8FP3xU=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70152537/1235841861.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;In their meetings, Elizabeth Holmes did most of the talking &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="LZBPBi"&gt;Brian Grossman had 20 years of experience in the healthcare space — but his firm, PFM Health Sciences, invested $96 million in Theranos anyway. On the stand, he explained that his firm had relied on Elizabeth Holmes’ information about Theranos, as well as financial models provided by the company, to make the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rMS0S"&gt;Taken as a whole, Grossman’s testimony in US v Elizabeth Holmes was damning. Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783989/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-investor-testimony"&gt;the investors from family offices&lt;/a&gt;, he’d visited Theranos’ facilities, had his blood drawn, and sent emails with extensive due diligence questions. He had experience in healthcare. He’d checked out Walgreens’ public statements about the company. But because he’d relied on Theranos’ representations of its technology, he was misled — and he singled out Holmes as being the source of much of the misleading information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uidwK7"&gt;Holmes told him that Theranos could match anything its much-larger competitors, Quest Diagnostics and Labcorp, could do. That was “a really big statement” about how much the company had accomplished, Grossman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNFUxz"&gt;Grossman, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783989/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-investor-testimony"&gt;other investors&lt;/a&gt; testifying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747918/theranos-devos-due-diligence-fraud-trial"&gt;before him&lt;/a&gt;, had been impressed by Theranos’ work with the military; he was told that Theranos’ tech was used on the battlefield and in medivacs. And when he heard that Theranos’ tests were used by drug companies to validate experimental products, that dazzled him too. He knew that getting drugs through the pipeline into approval was crucial to pharma companies’ businesses — so for Theranos’ tech to be used for that was a high mark of approval. The financial projections Theranos provided to him had an estimated $30 million coming from pharma companies in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pv3rPQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Holmes did most of the talking in their meetings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Py6OXH"&gt;Of course, neither of these things were true. Theranos devices weren’t used &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/15/ex-theranos-employee-edlin-says-holmes-told-him-to-conceal-part-of-lab.html"&gt;on medivacs or on the battlefield&lt;/a&gt;. And while Theranos &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; worked with pharma companies, none of them chose to use the tests to validate experimental products, largely because preliminary &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701542/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-celgene-bickering"&gt;studies showed the tests sucked&lt;/a&gt;. The revenue projection was weird, partly because Theranos had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674657/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-wire-fraud-financial-witness"&gt;&lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; revenue, from pharma companies or otherwise, in 2012 or 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4FyPLO"&gt;Grossman says that Holmes, former CEO of Theranos, and her co-defendant, Sunny Balwani, who is being tried separately, told him Theranos tests took only four hours to produce a result. In a slide deck, a graphic specifically pointed out the consistency of Theranos’ vitamin D tests — which was one of the tests &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676789/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-wire-fraud-erika-cheung-whistleblower"&gt;whistleblower Erika Cheung&lt;/a&gt; had worried &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674657/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-wire-fraud-financial-witness"&gt;wasn’t accurate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmAVYb"&gt;And Holmes did most of the talking in their meetings, Grossman testified. (This matched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22689083/elizabeth-holmes-trial-james-mattis-testimony-theranos-fraud"&gt;other investor testimony&lt;/a&gt;.) That’s bad news for Holmes’ defense, which has been trying to argue that Holmes naively trusted Balwani and that he was the real villain at Theranos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U4BQ73"&gt;Grossman followed up after the meeting with a long list of due diligence questions. He wanted to know, for instance, what the limitations on the tech were. Holmes and Balwani were “emphatic” that their devices were labs shrunk down to the size of a box, he said. Holmes was “very clear that this technology was not a point-of-care test, not a point-of-care testing platform, it was a miniaturized lab,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFAusA"&gt;That was very exciting — a hugely disruptive technology. Grossman was told that the entire Phoenix market for Theranos could be supported in a lab of 200 square feet; a competitor lab at Quest Diagnostics, which he’d toured, was hundreds of thousands of square feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="IxOm4q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Balwani was squirrely when Grossman wanted to speak to representatives from Walgreens&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kYo9YZ"&gt;Throughout the course of the meetings and email exchanges, neither Holmes nor Balwani mentioned that the Theranos technology was used for just a handful of tests. No one mentioned that they used third-party equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYthWG"&gt;The Walgreens deal also bolstered Grossman’s confidence, though Balwani was squirrely when Grossman wanted to speak to representatives from Walgreens. He told Grossman that it wouldn’t look good and he was “uncomfortable with that,” Grossman testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXDIuG"&gt;He was also told that there was a deal with UnitedHealthcare, which suggested legitimacy to Grossman. He wanted to talk with them about the Theranos partnership. “We highly value their ability to vet technology and new companies,” Grossman said. But Balwani nixed that idea, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Pl4Ir"&gt;Those denials “forced us to rely on the representations they made to us,” Grossman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwu6fX"&gt;Grossman went and talked to Channing Robertson, a Stanford professor who’d helped Holmes start Theranos. Robertson told Grossman there was no technical risk associated with the company — the only risk was making sure consumers had a good experience. He also said that the technology was so advanced that even if it fell into the hands of competitors, it would take them years to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HnAozK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Grossman’s blood test gave us a peek behind the curtain at Theranos&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X7hXoC"&gt;Grossman toured the HQ. He toured the clinical lab, where he saw only Theranos analyzers and none of the modified third-party devices the company was actually using. He toured the manufacturing facility. He even went to a Palo Alto Walgreens to get his blood drawn — a venous draw, one that took more than a day to get results. Balwani told Grossman that was because his doctor ordered an unusual test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owxRmp"&gt;Grossman’s blood test gave us a peek behind the curtain at Theranos. The prosecution showed an email to Theranos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22692600/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-bad-tests-complaints"&gt;whistleblower Adam Rosendorff &lt;/a&gt;and some other workers in Theranos’ lab, asking them to speed up work on a “VIP” test — Grossman’s. “This is on the Immulite, right?” an employee replied, referencing a competitor’s machine. That was confirmed by another employee. (Grossman said in court that if he’d known competitors’ devices were being used, he would have asked even more questions of Theranos.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iWnPs"&gt;So Grossman decided to invest. Sure, Theranos had been weirdly secretive and security-focused when he’d visited, but Grossman shrugged that off. Yes, it was odd that he’d been discouraged from talking to Theranos’ partners, but he shrugged that off too — hadn’t a Stanford professor told him the tech was amazing? Wasn’t Walgreens touting it in their quarterly earnings calls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="J8eILq"&gt;And now, of course, one of his investments underpins a count of wire fraud against Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spider-Man: No Way Home’s latest trailer brings back all the bad guys</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fqimi6AN7ndTuRIq13Iau3NcJ9w=/0x9:1150x776/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70152399/Screen_Shot_2021_11_16_at_5.35.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony Pictures Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5SZbcM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVOs4VSpmA"&gt;The latest trailer&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; has arrived, bringing with it some big surprises for Spider-Man’s latest MCU outing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRPZIY"&gt;If you’re trying to go into the latest adventure of the web-slinging hero without spoilers, you’ll probably want to skip hitting play here (or reading the rest of this post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCR0KK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: Far From Home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; below: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73BP60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638877/spider-man-no-way-home-first-trailer"&gt;As revealed in the first trailer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; picks up right where &lt;em&gt;Far From Home&lt;/em&gt; left off: with Peter Parker’s secret identity as Spider-Man revealed to the world, something that Peter tries to enlist Doctor Strange’s (Benedict Cumberbatch) assistance in rectifying. Magical multiverse hijinks ensue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWdKJs"&gt;Things appear to go wrong, though, resulting in appearances from a plethora of Spidey rogues from Sony’s past Spider-Man franchises (before the MCU was ever around), including &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;’s Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man 2&lt;/em&gt;’s Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina), and &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&lt;/em&gt;’s Electro (Jamie Foxx). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTXezy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; hits theaters on December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 DIY screen replacements don’t break Face ID in iOS 15.2 beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u11MpV1qW74-jkRK0vySgc-cvBw=/0x0:1995x1330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70152317/vpavic_210916_untitled_0031.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GqHPpW"&gt;Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772433/apple-iphone-13-screen-replacements-face-id-software-update"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; that it would be rolling out a software update to iPhone 13 devices to make it easier to replace their screens without breaking Face ID, but it didn’t specify when that update might arrive. Fortunately, we may not have to wait long, as repair experts say they have successfully completed the easier screen swaps on iPhone 13 handsets running the iOS 15.2 beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQBnMV"&gt;Before the update, keeping Face ID working after swapping the screens also required moving over a microcontroller from the original phone to the new one. Doing so is a complex process, and having to do it for every iPhone 13 that needs a new screen could make things difficult for indie repair shops. (You can read all about the issue &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F54829%2Fapples-new-screen-repair-trap-could-change-the-repair-industry-forever&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F16%2F22786274%2Fapple-iphone-13-screen-replacement-face-id-ios-15-2-beta-fixes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in an article from &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) But on an iPhone 13 loaded with the iOS 15.2 beta, &lt;em&gt;iCorrect&lt;/em&gt; says Face ID &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f9oFrfXq5o"&gt;still worked&lt;/a&gt; after a screen swap &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; without having to bring over the microcontroller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NreKtM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0f9oFrfXq5o?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UTblbM"&gt;Although Face ID still works, the screen-swapped iPhone 13 does show an “Important Display Message” warning that the device can’t verify is the screen is a “genuine Apple part” — even though &lt;em&gt;iCorrect&lt;/em&gt; says the screen actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a genuine part. This isn’t entirely out of the norm for Apple, though, which shows similar warnings on some iPhones following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/14/20805744/apple-iphone-battery-replacements-ios-safety-statement-unauthorized"&gt;battery replacements&lt;/a&gt; from unauthorized repair shops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xG67U"&gt;Apple didn’t reply when we asked if it could confirm that iOS 15.2 is the version that will allow for the easier screen replacements when it’s released publicly. But given that the less-intensive screen swaps appear to work on the beta, it seems likely they will work in the final release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Star Trek: Discovery is leaving Netflix tonight before heading to Paramount Plus</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rAm0Au"&gt;Paramount Plus is grabbing back its &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt; series from Netflix, where it’s been streaming to international viewers for three seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dw8uZ"&gt;The series lived on Paramount Plus (fka CBS All Access) for US viewers and on Canada’s CTV Sci-Fi Channel, but the move will bring old and future seasons of the series under a single streaming umbrella for folks outside of those regions. Season 4 of &lt;em&gt;Discovery&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/star-trek-discovery-season-4-trailer-premiere-date-1235084921/"&gt;had previously been set&lt;/a&gt; to debut on Paramount Plus in the US, CTV Sci-Fi Channel, and on Netflix elsewhere on November 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7ssWu"&gt;The show will leave Netflix at 12AM PT in regions where it had previously been available to stream. (It will remain on Bell Media’s CTV Sci-Fi Channel and stream on the Crave in Canada.) All seasons of the show will become available to international viewers in 2022, the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/11/star-trek-discovery-netflix-deal-paramount-viacomcbs-1234875466/"&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="07CZqw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To our international &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StarTrekDiscovery?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StarTrekDiscovery&lt;/a&gt; fans... &lt;a href="https://t.co/QATQzHxepK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QATQzHxepK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Star Trek on Paramount+ (@StarTrekOnPPlus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarTrekOnPPlus/status/1460714359588483074?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z337vx"&gt;The plan to grab back some of its IP comes as the company focuses on a wider international expansion heading into next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRSDPt"&gt;“As we rapidly expand our global streaming footprint, we are bringing more of our top titles home to ViacomCBS for Paramount+ markets around the world,” Kelly Day, president of streaming for ViacomCBS Networks International, said in a statement. “We have a strong global and local content pipeline that positions us for success across our regions, and repatriating beloved series like &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt; for Paramount+ is another step forward as we bring fans more must-watch series worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCfpdS"&gt;According to the company, &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt; will become available internationally to Paramount Plus subscribers in 2022 in regions where the service is currently available. Paramount Plus is currently available in 25 countries but says it plans to expand to 45 markets by the end of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nNqgj"&gt;Uniting — for the most part — its &lt;em&gt;Discovery&lt;/em&gt; series in a single hub for international audiences doesn’t quite fix the fractured state of the sprawling Star Trek library, however. &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Picard&lt;/em&gt; will still be on Amazon for streamers outside Canada and the US. As stated, &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt; will continue to stream on non-Paramount Plus channels in Canada. And lastly, &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Lower Decks&lt;/em&gt; will stay on Amazon outside of Latin America, Canada, and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
