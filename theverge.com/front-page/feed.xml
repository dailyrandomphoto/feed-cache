    <title>Elon Musk just showed how Clubhouse can succeed</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6txraP"&gt;Hey, did you hear &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/31/elon-musk-goes-live-on-clubhouse-but-with-the-room-full-fans-stream-audio-on-youtube/"&gt;Elon Musk went on Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4332o1"&gt;The media and venture capital worlds were abuzz this weekend in advance of, during, and after Musk’s appearance on the not-quite-year-old audio social network. Musk is not exactly a recluse — he gives interviews more or less regularly to a variety of mainstream outlets, and will sit down with NBC tomorrow — but his arrival on Clubhouse served as validation for the company and the idea of live, interactive audio streaming more generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRFlgz"&gt;Despite beginning at 1AM ET on Monday, Musk’s room quickly hit the Clubhouse cap of 5,000 concurrent listeners — as did one overflow room hosting a broadcast of his appearance, and then &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; overflow room after that. All day long, hustlers and hucksters sought to get in on the action, hosting pre-show discussions, post-show recaps, and in at least one case, a cash giveaway sponsored by Square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHvaZV"&gt;The only social-networking moment I can compare it to in recent years would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8234769/how-meerkat-conquered-all-at-sxsw"&gt;the 2015 South by Southwest festival&lt;/a&gt;, when the streets of Austin were briefly overrun by people broadcasting themselves on Meerkat. Then, as now, the once-stable field of social networks hummed with a fresh sense of possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLBxUI"&gt;On Clubhouse, Musk appeared on &lt;em&gt;The Good Time Show&lt;/em&gt;, a roughly three-week-old late-night event hosted by the husband-and-wife team of Sriram Krishnan and Aarthi Ramamurthy. Guests and co-hosts on their show often include the partners of Andreessen Horowitz, Clubhouse’s lead investor and most prominent public cheerleaders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SA8mhJ"&gt;I’ve known Krishnan and Ramamurthy since 2012, when I interrupted their coffee date at the Creamery in San Francisco to interview them for &lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/restaurants/article/Creamery-is-deal-central-for-SF-techies-3707983.php"&gt;a story about the cafe’s emergence as a hub for tech-boom dealmaking&lt;/a&gt;. Krishnan went on to work in product roles at Facebook, Snap, and Twitter, and Ramamurthy started an e-commerce company and now works at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMkcnZ"&gt;The tone of their show is lightweight by design — successful tech people getting together after they put their kids to bed to discuss the news of the day, without ever being too critical of anyone involved. In this aspect, the show is tonally consistent with the mission that Andreessen Horowitz laid out last week &lt;a href="https://a16z.com/2021/01/25/doubling-down-marketing-update-new-media/"&gt;in its blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing that it would create “a new media property” aspiring to be “&lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; go-to place for understanding and building the future, for anyone who is building, making, or curious about tech.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3RqRxn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A16z spotted a gap in the mainstream tech coverage market, and now seeks to fill it with rational optimism&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4yCyrk"&gt;Mainstream tech coverage in recent years has become, &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/clubhouse-is-a-unicorn-clubhouse-versus-podcasts-monetization-moderation-and-monopoly/"&gt;in the sharp framing of Ben Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, dominated by rational skeptics; A16z spotted a gap in the market, and now seeks to fill it with rational optimism. A16z can serve that audience by creating its own media empire out of blog posts and podcasts, which is already performing quite well under the leadership of Sonal Chokshi.  But it can also serve that audience by funding and promoting services like Clubhouse, which enable optimists like Krishnan and Ramamurthy to build miniature properties of their own and “go direct” to an audience eager to hear a chummy conversation with the heroes of capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0STyUG"&gt;At least, that’s how it seemed before news came out on Monday that Krishnan himself &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/37008f"&gt;had recently become a general partner at A16z&lt;/a&gt;. And that the firm &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/a16z/status/1356340470633422856"&gt;is releasing the conversation officially as the first episode in a new live podcast series&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RsiETf"&gt;In the television industry, a “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_pilot#Backdoor_pilot"&gt;backdoor pilot&lt;/a&gt;” is a kind of proof of concept of a full series: an episode of an existing show that introduces characters who go on to have their own show. There are a bunch of ways to think about Clubhouse, but I think it is notable and will be consequential that one of the first successful uses of Clubhouse was to create a backdoor pilot for a venture capital firm’s end run around the mainstream media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pckQji"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II. What Clubhouse discovered&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Bu46YF"&gt;This is not the most &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; way of thinking about Clubhouse, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqJhXV"&gt;In 2016, a startup called Anchor launched with a product its founders hoped would “democratize radio.” It offered some dead-simple creation tools for recording audio, a place to host that audio, and some social features to let you find and follow other creators. The team struggled to find product-market fit — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/7/14845902/anchor-app-audio-snapchat-stories"&gt;maybe the recordings should feel more like Snapchat stories&lt;/a&gt;, it asked, fruitlessly, at one point? — and few hit podcasts emerged from the platform. Still, Spotify ultimately &lt;a href="http://www.insideradio.com/podcastnewsdaily/revealed-exactly-how-much-spotify-paid-for-gimlet-anchor-and-parcast/article_9bc972f2-b549-11e9-b27e-0f4f38c967f8.html"&gt;bought Anchor for $150 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3KQHfV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Spotify is paying podcasters tens of thousands of dollars to buoy its own sponsorship tool ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22241066/spotify-anchor-sponsorships-ad-money-spend-podcasting"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="87xAOD"&gt;I haven’t listened to a ton of Anchor podcasts, but most that I listened to were terrible. It turns out that podcasts do not lend themselves easily to a do-it-yourself approach. It’s hard to record pristine audio; it’s even more tedious to edit. And the podcast market is now robust enough that there are almost certainly numerous professionally recorded podcasts, hosted by celebrities in their field, that would be more fun to listen to than any DIY project uploaded to Anchor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aX8Bh5"&gt;Fast-forward to 2021, though, and I’m spending real time on Clubhouse. Yes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/8/21316172/clubhouse-content-moderation-taylor-lorenz-harassment-abuse"&gt;I’ve had my concerns about Clubhouse’s early inattention to moderation&lt;/a&gt;. But the company &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/welcoming-more-voices"&gt;now seems to be taking those concerns appropriately seriously&lt;/a&gt;. And while I’m tempted to blame the 30- and 40-minutes stretches I’ve spent listening to people talk about various aspects of tech and life on an 11-month quarantine, I also want to acknowledge that Clubhouse has hit upon something genuinely compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlHoQA"&gt;Unlike the median Anchor show, the median Clubhouse room isn’t unbearable to listen to. Because you’re literally on the phone while you use it, the mediocre audio quality doesn’t grate as much — it just sounds like a phone call. (Albeit one you could join at any time.) And because the conversation is live, you’re less sensitive to the fact that it’s unedited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlBMwC"&gt;As Musk’s appearance highlighted, there’s a serendipity about Clubhouse that makes it compelling. The most interesting part of his talk wasn’t the first half-hour or so, where he fielded softballs about colonizing Mars and his favorite memes, but later, when he invited Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev onto the stage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GsoX8"&gt;Robinhood had, of course, had a hell of a week, and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/02/01/elon-musk-robinhood-clubhouse-gamestop/"&gt;Musk has been vocally skeptical about the company’s moves to stop users from buying GameStop stock&lt;/a&gt;. “Everyone wants to know, did something shady go down here?” Musk asked Tenev. In response, Tenev explained how regulators had required Robinhood to increase its deposits to cover the risks associated with market volatility. Essentially, Robinhood had enabled a mob whose trades it could briefly not afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TyCTHN"&gt;This was not exactly investigative journalism on Musk’s part, and Robinhood PR had posted a variation of this explanation on its blog earlier this weekend (though without as much detail). And A16z is a major investor in Robinhood, as it is with Clubhouse, giving the whole thing the feel of a stunt. As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EricNewcomer/status/1356356405817712641"&gt;Eric Newcomer put it&lt;/a&gt;: “So undisclosed future a16z partner hosts event with a16z partner where a16z portfolio company does crisis PR but it’s billed as this big organic thing with Elon Musk?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="35ORWu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;so undisclosed future a16z partner hosts event with a16z partner where a16z portfolio company does crisis PR but it's billed as this big organic thing with Elon Musk?&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Newcomer (@EricNewcomer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EricNewcomer/status/1356356405817712641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P4J1hi"&gt;It’s a fair point, but it also skips over the absolute novelty of the world’s richest man lightly interrogating the CEO of the week’s most controversial company in a live, free broadcast. From Facebook to Twitter to Twitch, streaming video tools have been available for years now, but we’ve never seen them used quite like this. There’s something more approachable about an audio-only broadcast that seems to have enabled entirely new uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtfjKk"&gt;I thought about this last week when my friend Maran Nelson and I started a room to talk with Newcomer about &lt;a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/the-unauthorized-story-of-andreessen"&gt;his recent piece on A16z and its independent media ambitions&lt;/a&gt;. Before I knew it, roughly a thousand people were there, including Marc Andreessen himself, and a number of other A16z partners. Two of them, Margit Wennmachers and Andrew Chen, came on stage along with Chokshi to respond to our questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6leWZa"&gt;This isn’t &lt;em&gt;shocking&lt;/em&gt;, exactly — I have met all these people in person various times over the years — but the serendipity of it all took me by surprise. I pondered for a moment how long it would have taken to schedule a call with me, four Andreessen partners, and the dozen-plus tech reporters who showed up to listen. Years, I imagine. But on Clubhouse, Maran and I just tapped a few buttons on our phones and immediately we were having a productive discussion about the increasingly fraught relationship between some VC firms and prominent journalism outlets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fR7R1K"&gt;By the diminished standards of pandemic-era social life, I found it exhilarating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wgOnHa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like Medium, Clubhouse is there when Musk needs it, and never needs to be thought about otherwise&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MpDMig"&gt;When Medium launched in 2012, two things about it struck me immediately. The first was that the design, particularly of its content management system, was radiant. The second was that it filled an obvious hole in the media market: it gave people a place where they could blog &lt;em&gt;without any expectation that they would keep blogging&lt;/em&gt;. In the 2000s, every person’s second blog post began with an apology for having taken so much time to write it after the first one. Medium made that forever unnecessary by telling people they could just write whenever inspiration struck, and it would promote them when they did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5X82i6"&gt;Today we are absolutely awash in podcasts. By now it seems that every person of note has been interviewed by every other person of note on one podcast or another. And yet if you want to reach the sort of person who listens to podcasts, starting a regular podcast and building up its audience over time has really been your only option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpaSqx"&gt;That’s fine for dedicated podcasters. But if you’re Elon Musk, and just want to ask Vlad Tenev a few questions in front of an audience? Well, now you go on Clubhouse. Like Medium, it’s there when he needs it, and never needs to be thought about otherwise. It offers him all the distribution upside of a podcast without the planning or editing that recording an actual podcast would entail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGtsXj"&gt;It’s what Anchor tried to become and never quite did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sOdSFx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III. Robinhood’s big mistake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mWgHoT"&gt;And what of Robinhood?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCWAof"&gt;It’s amazing how, given how conspiracy-laden last week’s most viral posts about the company were, how mundane the explanation for everything seems to be. Robinhood has to keep a certain amount of money in reserve to enable its platform; that amount of money rose tenfold amid meme stock mania; the platform shut down purchases of those meme stocks while it worked to resolve the imbalance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhIEZo"&gt;As of Monday, it had raised two new rounds of funds. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-raises-another-2-4-billion-from-shareholders-11612197680"&gt;The first was $1 billion; the second was $2.4 billion&lt;/a&gt;. It is &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/robinhood-raises-trading-limit-on-gamestop-shares-to-4-from-1.html"&gt;gradually letting people buy stocks again&lt;/a&gt;. And while thousands of people appear to have quit Robinhood over the momentary inconvenience, hundreds of thousands more people signed up to use Robinhood for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9WbpL"&gt;Given the situation, lots of folks are asking why Robinhood didn’t say more about what happened when it first halted sales of GameStop stock. Perhaps the company was simply embarrassed — “we built a platform we can no longer afford” is admittedly a funny thing to tell your user base — but it’s also easy to imagine an official company Reddit post headlined “LOL you crazy bastards literally broke Robinhood” being showered in upvotes and karma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qjMas"&gt;Instead, by trying to hide a liquidity crisis, Robinhood created a brand crisis. A liquidity crisis is easy for a company like Robinhood to get out of — you just raise more money from the people who are lining up to hand it to you. A brand crisis, though, is a much trickier proposition to navigate. Robinhood told users that it existed to “democratize” finance; in the end, like so many other platforms, it turned out to be a monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBZO1d"&gt;I’m interested to see how the company will fare now that the jig is up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The writing’s on the wall for Google Stadia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/parymsi5Aps0_nVfb2dkgSjOk0M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68754616/akrales_191113_3779_0317.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E8M46y"&gt;After fourteen months, Google has decided it doesn’t want to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964386/google-stadia-pre-launch-editorial-cloud-gaming"&gt;a game company&lt;/a&gt; anymore. Where once it had its own cloud-based console, controller, and the promise of homegrown triple-A games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;it no longer wants to build its own games&lt;/a&gt; as of today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIY1l0"&gt;And though a Google spokesperson emphasizes that the company continues to “remain committed to Stadia as a platform,” it’s looking increasingly likely that platform won’t be a service where you sign up with Google to buy and rent cloud games.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omavzt"&gt;Stadia boss Phil Harrison announced that Google was shutting down the company’s game studios in a memo today, and I think the exact wording of that memo is extremely telling. &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/stadia/focusing-on-stadias-future-as-a-platform-and-winding-down-sge/"&gt;Go read it for yourself&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPFDxz"&gt;Back? Good. Did you see the part about how Stadia is now a platform for Google’s partners? It’s pretty hard to miss: Harrison brings it up no fewer than &lt;em&gt;five times&lt;/em&gt; in four paragraphs. In all but the very last paragraph, “partners” — not gamers — come first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qr9dJe"&gt;This suggests Google has realized an important truth: Stadia, like so many of Google’s other businesses, is optimally one where you aren’t the customer. The paying customers, if Google can get them, are game publishers themselves, and possibly ISPs that would like to deliver a cable-like bundle of games to go along with their cable-like bundles of shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuGTYI"&gt;Today, Harrison defines Stadia as a “technology platform for industry partners” — which suggests to me that he’s talking about turning Stadia into a white-label cloud gaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYN4PO"&gt;If you’ve been following the cloud gaming space, you know white-labeling isn’t a new idea — this is how cloud gaming platforms worked from the start. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/16/4442372/inside-gaikai-how-to-make-cloud-gaming-as-easy-as-watching-youtube"&gt;The pitch&lt;/a&gt; for OG game streaming service Gaikai, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"&gt;years before Sony squashed it into the form of PlayStation Now&lt;/a&gt;, was to sell companies like Electronic Arts on hosting racks of dedicated servers that would beam free, instantly accessible demos of their games from the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2IOID"&gt;(Phil Harrison knows this; he sat on Gaikai’s advisory board. Jack Buser, Stadia’s head of business development, ran Sony’s PlayStation Now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="aKKg2n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Sony bought, and squandered, the future of gaming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oKi5LQ"&gt;Nvidia wound up selling so-called “GeForce Grid” servers to do the same thing, some of which wound up being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/16/3023502/ubitus-cloud-gaming-service-gtc-2012"&gt;white-labeled by companies like Ubitus&lt;/a&gt; to stream Assassin’s Creed games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18293458/nintendo-switch-japan-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-odyssey"&gt;to the Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt; and Final Fantasy games to iPhones &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ubitus-launches-final-fantasyxiii-on-chromecast-in-japan-300253725.html"&gt;and Chromecasts&lt;/a&gt;, among other screens. Several cellular carriers in Asia currently offer white-labeled versions &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/03/23/kddi-geforce-now-japan/"&gt;of GeForce Now as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BswcW3"&gt;There’s nothing inherently wrong with white-labeling. Done properly, it might even unlock one of the most magical things about cloud gaming: the ability to instantly try a game no matter where you are. While companies like Google already claim games are “instantly available,” what they really mean is “after you sign up, log in, and sometimes buy a game.” That’s partly due to the complex web of licensing agreements that game publishers make cloud services sign. But if game publishers were in charge of their own games, they might feel differently. They could give you Gaikai-esque instant access game demos again, ones where you could tap a YouTube advertisement for a game and &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; start playing it, no friction whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNUu5L"&gt;But moving to a white-labeling model would likely mean the end of one of Stadia’s biggest advantages compared to other cloud streaming platforms. Stadia promised you’d eventually be able to use the full horsepower of &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; cloud servers to offer gameplay and graphics that were never possible with a single game system in your home. But it seems incredibly unlikely that an Activision Blizzard or Electronic Arts would build a game that requires multiple Stadia servers for a white-labeled service — the risks of lock-in there would simply be too high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nV49Vx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's a damn shame we'll never see the "only possible in the cloud" game concepts that might've made Stadia exciting to people who already own/planned to buy game consoles and PCs. &lt;a href="https://t.co/urmgKJVE9f"&gt;https://t.co/urmgKJVE9f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dan Stapleton (@DanStapleton) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanStapleton/status/1356326448164872192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lUx53W"&gt;I’ve interviewed a bunch of cloud gaming leaders, but Google was the first to do more than hint at this kind of multi-server platform — it actually promised to build those games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18272996/google-stadia-studio-games-entertainment-exclusives-gdc-2019"&gt;poaching former leads&lt;/a&gt; behind the &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164801/google-stadia-shannon-studstill-playa-vista-studio-sony-santa-monica-god-of-war"&gt;and &lt;em&gt;God of War &lt;/em&gt;franchises&lt;/a&gt; to make it happen. Google had an incentive to do it too, since it needed killer apps to sell you on a Stadia subscription, but other publishers already have a huge install base of partner consoles waiting for whatever games they build. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjBQpF"&gt;Exclusive, cloud-first games were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21454917/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming-comparison-google-stadia-microsoft-xcloud-game-pass-geforce-now"&gt;one of the things that set Google apart from Amazon Luna&lt;/a&gt;, Nvidia’s GeForce Now, Sony’s PlayStation Now and the rest. Now, not so much. Google still has some of the best streaming quality and impressive latency to entice partners, but it requires them to port games to Linux right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kkt9Jy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Amazon’s Luna cloud gaming service compares to Stadia, xCloud, and GeForce Now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21454917/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming-comparison-google-stadia-microsoft-xcloud-game-pass-geforce-now"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="lcqfKG"&gt;Today’s message, if I’m reading it right, is an olive branch to the game publishers who weren’t properly committed to Stadia before. “Come partner with us; we don’t plan to compete with you anymore.” At the same time, it’s diplomatically worded not to piss off existing Stadia players. Prospective partners don’t want to hitch themselves to a public failure — which is what Stadia might look like if Google shut down the game service now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHjUOB"&gt;But ask yourself: given Google’s track record of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21012505/google-decade-failed-projects-discontinued-wave-glass-daydream-vr"&gt;axing niche projects&lt;/a&gt;, and the current level of interest in Stadia (versus, say, next-gen consoles), how much longer do you think Google will continue to offer and promote a consumer-facing cloud gaming service?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H66PyC"&gt;Google has never released Stadia sales or subscriber numbers, so we can’t say for sure how many people have ever seriously tried it, but I’m wondering if today’s announcement tells us everything we need to know. Google just launched &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; — the hottest game of the year — on Stadia, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575100/google-stadia-one-year-anniversary-cloud-gaming-cyberpunk-2077-launch-test"&gt;we called &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;a make-or-break moment for the service&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; had everything going for it on Stadia, including solid performance at a time when next-gen consoles and GPUs have been impossible to find &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167303/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-console-google-stadia"&gt;and last-gen consoles struggled to play the game at all&lt;/a&gt;, plus a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/19/21572301/cyberpunk-2077-google-stadia-free-premiere-kit-preorder-deal"&gt;complimentary hardware kit&lt;/a&gt; if you purchased the game. Did Google look at &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk’s&lt;/em&gt; sales, grimace, and wonder if a future Google-produced game could do any better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5DXqd"&gt;Harrison’s blog post is titled, in part, “focusing on Stadia’s future as a platform.” That’s exactly what Google appears to be doing. Consumers trying to decide where they should purchase their next game might want to “focus on Stadia’s future as a platform,” too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will pay $2.5 million to underpaid female engineers and overlooked Asian applicants</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oJYif5BeRXU8cbYLYwDRLl5wIJw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68754412/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fQsPrY"&gt;Google has agreed to pay $2.5 million to more than 5,500 employees and job applicants impacted by alleged systematic pay and hiring discrimination. &lt;a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20210201"&gt;The US Department of Labor found&lt;/a&gt; that female software engineers were being underpaid. It also identified “hiring rate differences that disadvantaged female and Asian applicants” for Google engineering positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMdHBv"&gt;As part of &lt;a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OFCCP/foia/files/2021-01-15_Google_ERCA_PA_Redacted.pdf"&gt;the settlement&lt;/a&gt;, Google will hand over $1,353,052 in back pay and interest to 2,565 female engineers. It will also pay $1,232,000 in back pay and interest to 1,757 female engineering applicants and 1,219 Asian engineering applicants for “engineering positions not hired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyMWk9"&gt;The alleged disparities impacted employees at Google offices in Mountain View, Seattle, and Kirkland, Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jq08gl"&gt;Google will also set aside $1,250,000 for pay-equity adjustments, for a total of $3.8 million to resolve this issue. That $1.25 million is earmarked for engineers in Mountain View, Seattle, Kirkland, and New York, which house 50 percent of Google’s engineering staff in the US, according to the Department of Labor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmUhaB"&gt;The news comes after years of conflict between Google workers and management. In 2018, more than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18057716/google-walkout-20-thousand-employees-ceo-sundar-pichai-meeting"&gt;20,000 employees walked out of work&lt;/a&gt; to protest the company’s handling of sexual harassment allegations. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html"&gt;roughly 230 employees and contractors formed a minority union&lt;/a&gt;. The organization, the Alphabet Workers Union, now has more than 800 members. AWU specifically wanted contractors to be part of the union, as they typically get left out of the high salaries and benefits enjoyed by full-time employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIiiWL"&gt;“Pay discrimination remains a systemic problem,” said Jenny R. Yang, director of the office of federal contract compliance programs. “Employers must conduct regular pay equity audits to ensure that their compensation systems promote equal opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uo4GEn"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Google spokesperson said: “We believe everyone should be paid based upon the work they do, not who they are, and invest heavily to make our hiring and compensation processes fair and unbiased. For the past eight years, we have run annual internal pay equity analysis to identify and address any discrepancies. We’re pleased to have resolved this matter related to allegations from the 2014-2017 audits and remain committed to diversity and equity and to supporting our people in a way that allows them to do their best work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cv00OJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXv94w"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ctg6U9v5jr9RrXkzgL82pqnQOXQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67735830/vpavic_4261_20201023_0084.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For the early adopters of next-gen hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cyuvuR"&gt;Just over two months after their release, the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S continue to be some of the most desirable gadgets in the world. While it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult&lt;/a&gt; to get your hands on a new console, those lucky enough to own one can enjoy something unprecedented in modern gaming history. For the first time, next-gen console owners can take their existing library — whether it’s physical, digital, or a mix of the two — and bring it to a next-gen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNh3ro"&gt;That gives consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play and what performance benefits are worthwhile enough to upgrade. And technologies like cross-platform play and now even cross-generation support will allow people to still play with their friends, even if they don’t upgrade to the latest gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uXjX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CveWHl"&gt;Yes, both consoles arrived within seven years of the last generation of console hardware. And while it’s likely within the first year of both consoles’ lifespan that many of the hottest titles may launch on last- and current-gen simultaneously, there’s still a good chunk of games that will be exclusive titles playable only a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79IWA"&gt;Besides 4K, the solid-state drives, and other spec changes, Microsoft and Sony have pledged to support close to every title in the existing console platforms’ libraries. Every Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One game currently playable on existing Xbox One hardware (minus Kinect games) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326805/xbox-series-x-xbox-one-game-support-backward-compatible-feature-kinect"&gt;will be playable on the Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, while Sony is supporting a “vast majority” of PS4 games, totaling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan"&gt;more than 4,000 titles&lt;/a&gt;. With both consoles early into their lifespan, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;easy for many to return to older games&lt;/a&gt; to help fill the gap in between long wait periods for more titles to be added to each console’s library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwgnjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new consoles let you take a majority of your existing libraries with you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlnZM"&gt;This changes the calculus a bit with regard to buying a new console. No longer do you have to abandon what you were playing on your old device and start anew. And thanks to some genuinely consumer-friendly initiatives like Xbox Smart Delivery and similar upgrade programs, plenty of the games we own now or are planning to buy in the next couple of months will not only work on the new platforms, but in most cases, they’ll also come with free upgrades from the standard PS4 and Xbox One versions. Sony also introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a library of PS4 games available for free with its online subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmWX6y"&gt;That leaves us with one big issue: how do you know what new games are coming out for which platforms and when? There’s also the painstaking process of parsing whether a game company is giving out a free next-gen upgrade of a cross-gen title, charging a little extra, or releasing a next-gen-only game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsrpjD"&gt;2021 is packed full of new releases and full optimizations of cross-gen games that should further pad out what’s available to play on your new system of choice. We’ve compiled the list below to help you understand every game coming out during the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM3UJT"&gt;This excludes games without release dates that may have been previously announced — like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Fable &lt;/em&gt;reboot, for example — and any games that were released for either console in 2020, including launch titles. We’ve also chosen only to list release dates for games where the publisher has chosen a concrete date with both day and month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hTe555"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:9552771"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQEqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 2020, 12:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that &lt;/em&gt;ARK: Survival Evolved&lt;em&gt; recently released an Xbox Series X enhancement update that will be available to new console owners on launch day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC6OMy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated &lt;/em&gt;Haven &lt;em&gt;would be a PS5-only release and that &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder &lt;em&gt;would be Xbox Series-only at launch. Those are incorrect; Haven is also coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox One and as part of Game Pass at launch, and &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is slated for PS5 mid-November. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPYdhq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add additional titles releasing in 2021 and update any games that may have been delayed into this year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yywDTp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n76LJk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix and a famed film author already optioned movies about GameStop, Reddit and Wall Street</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X3XGClZ8xlrF8jJsLXChkUo-P9M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68754168/acastro_210128_1777_stonks_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WgKD6z"&gt;It looks like we’ll be spoiled for choice when it comes to movies about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22253363/wall-street-bets-verge-stories-gamestock-reddit-discord"&gt;WallStreetBets / GameStop saga&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; is reporting that both &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/mgm-ben-mezrichs-the-antisocial-network-wall-street-1234684378/"&gt;MGM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/netflix-gamestop-stock-movie-screenwriter-mark-boal-noah-centineo-scott-galloway-makeready-1234684568/"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; have plans to make one, before the dust has even settled (via &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/someone-already-sold-the-movie-rights-to-an-unpublished-1846173930"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/1/22260573/netflix-gamestop-stock-movie-wallstreetbets"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you weren't paying attention to the stock-spikes, short squeezes, and diamond hands that were going on last week, we have an explainer that should &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL2p85ltIvg"&gt;get you caught up on the big picture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlksSW"&gt;MGM’s version of the movie is set to based as a book that hasn’t yet been written. The author of that book is Ben Mezrich, who wrote &lt;em&gt;The Accidental Billionaires&lt;/em&gt;, which was the basis for David Fincher’s 2010 movie &lt;em&gt;The Social Network&lt;/em&gt;. Mezrich was apparently inspired by Fincher’s title, as he’s calling his new book &lt;em&gt;The Antisocial Network&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YeAEAF"&gt;Netflix is trying to get Mark Boal, the screenwriter and a producer on &lt;em&gt;The Hurt Locker&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Detroit&lt;/em&gt;, to write its adaptation. (Does this mean we could see Kathryn Bigelow directing? Please say yes.) The company is also planning on having &lt;em&gt;To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before &lt;/em&gt;star &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/netflix-gamestop-stock-movie-screenwriter-mark-boal-noah-centineo-scott-galloway-makeready-1234684568/"&gt;Noah Centineo play a major role&lt;/a&gt;. Who he’ll be depicting is anyone’s guess, because the story literally isn’t done unfolding in real life yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZK6CWZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Trading on Robinhood is a big part of the story, but is hard to show on screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZP7gMd"&gt;I can imagine it’s hard to be a movie producer tasked with turning the WallStreetBets story into a movie, because on one hand you want to get it done ASAP so the movie is still topical, but on the other you have to wait until the story is done before you can really start working on it. Even now we’re seeing new developments as WallStreetBets starts &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-day-traders-are-moving-into-spacs-11612175401"&gt;to target SPACs&lt;/a&gt; (shell companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;meant to help private companies easily&lt;/a&gt; go public) and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/reddit-users-fuel-rally-in-silver-11612182810"&gt;silver commodities&lt;/a&gt;. It would be a tragedy if a movie didn’t include a scene of a Redditor having to take delivery of 300 bars of silver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twMG8s"&gt;There’s also the question of how big a role trading platform Robinhood will play in the movies. The platform created a firestorm of controversy and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"&gt;user anger&lt;/a&gt; when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;halted the buying of WallStreetBets’s favorite stocks&lt;/a&gt; last week, but &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; reports that the app is &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizahaverstock/2021/02/01/exclusive-robinhood-secures-another-1-billion-in-funds-and-is-in-talks-for-more-as-downloads-hit-record-1-million-per-day/?sh=309e88133005"&gt;still getting a million downloads a day&lt;/a&gt;. It’s something that would be hard to put into a movie, but is obviously a big part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFHEGG"&gt;Neither movie has a release date yet (again, because it’s hard to tell when this whole thing will be over), or much talent attached to speak of, but I’m excited to see how they turn out. Hopefully one of these adaptations could be like &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt;, staring Michael Cera &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256582/roaringkitty-deepfuckingvalue-keith-gill-profile-gamestop-wallstreetbets-wsj"&gt;as u/DeepFuckingValue&lt;/a&gt;, and, if I’m really dreaming here, maybe they’ll both be released the same week like Netflix and Hulu’s &lt;a href="https://www.tvguide.com/news/which-fyre-fest-documentary-should-you-watch-hulu-netflix/"&gt;competing Fyre Festival documentaries&lt;/a&gt;. Such weirdness would only be fitting for the absolute roller coaster that the GameStop stock ride has been, and will likely continue to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5Q5zlV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How r/WallStreetBets gamed the stock of GameStop ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"},{"title":"How many stocks will Robinhood let you buy?

  &lt;p id="S9L3Nl"&gt;Investment app Robinhood has plummeted back down to a one-star rating on Google Play, thanks to a flood of thousands of new negative reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhbLzV"&gt;The latest low rating comes just days after Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"&gt;salvaged the app’s rating&lt;/a&gt; by removing nearly 100,000 reviews, following a flood of negative ratings after the Robinhood &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;blocked purchases of popular stocks&lt;/a&gt; from Reddit’s /r/WallStreetBets like GameStop or AMC last week. Google confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time that it was actively removing negative reviews on the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RliLVA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google salvaged Robinhood’s one-star rating by deleting nearly 100,000 negative reviews","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="E6itFZ"&gt;The review rollercoaster for Robinhood’s rating has been nearly as up-and-down as GameStop’s stock price. When users began to review bomb the app last Thursday, Robinhood reached a one-star rating with nearly 275,000 reviews. Google then removed nearly 100,000 of those reviews, putting the app back at a four-star average with roughly 180,000 reviews. But as of the publication of this article, Robinhood has returned to a new high of almost 305,000 reviews, along with a 1.1-star rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ok4qiB"&gt;Google’s Play Store policies &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/about/comment-posting-policy/"&gt;do explicitly ban reviews&lt;/a&gt; that are intended to “manipulate the rating” of an app; the company had previously removed earlier Robinhood reviews because it felt that they violated that policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ru3iN8"&gt;A Google spokesperson did confirm to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the current reviews — which were not the ones deleted in last week’s purge — are compliant to Google’s policies, and won’t be removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vADLp3"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Google commented that &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Google Play’s app review systems are designed to provide a genuine and trustworthy view of an app’s user experience, and we take action on any inauthentic or coordinated activity aimed at artificially raising or lowering an app’s overall score. To be clear, this is not done to shield an app from negative reviews, but to help protect app developers from things like coordinated review bombing and to safeguard our systems from being artificially manipulated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMTDRH"&gt;The low review rating is one that’s unique to Google’s Play Store, at least for now. The iOS version of Robinhood still boasts a 4.0-star rating on Apple’s storefront, although there has been an uptick of negative reviews in the past few days for that version of the app, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood is facing dozens of lawsuits over GameStop stock freeze</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jNSFJi"&gt;Stock trading app Robinhood is facing dozens of lawsuits after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;restricted several stocks&lt;/a&gt; popular on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit. At least 30 parties across 10 states have sued the company in federal court, many seeking class action status. They allege that Robinhood users lost millions of dollars because they were unable to buy or sell stock during the freeze, and that the company chose to “manipulate the market” to help other financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w824Bt"&gt;Robinhood, which bills itself as a democratizing force in the stock market, helped facilitate an unprecedented boom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;around a handful of “meme stocks”&lt;/a&gt; last month. But on January 28th, it infuriated users by freezing trades on several of these stocks. That included GameStop ($GME) as well as AMC ($AMC), BlackBerry ($BB), Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond ($BBBY), and Nokia ($NOK). The company &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility"&gt;defended the move&lt;/a&gt; in a blog post, calling it a “risk-management decision” undertaken in the face of “extraordinary circumstances.” The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254857/robinhood-gamestop-amc-shares-sold-surprised-users"&gt;denied reports&lt;/a&gt; that it had sold some users’ shares without permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XY3Dg1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Robinhood says it restricted trading under “extraordinary circumstances”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5ghlqT"&gt;The answer didn’t satisfy users. Robinhood user Brendon Nelson &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.553175/gov.uscourts.nysd.553175.1.0_3.pdf"&gt;filed the first lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; in New York state that day, accusing the company of negligence and breaching its contract with traders. More suits have followed, spread across courts in New Jersey, California, Texas, Florida, and other states. Some plaintiffs simply complain about missing a potential windfall, but others lay out more specific damages: Patryk Krasowski of Illinois, for instance, claims he lost $220,000 because Robinhood wouldn’t let him exercise GameStop purchase options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69II79"&gt;“Robinhood has completely blocked retailer investors from purchasing [GameStop stock] for no legitimate reason,” reads Nelson’s complaint. It claims Robinhood “failed to provide adequate explanation” about pulling a profitable stock from its platform and “knowingly put their customers at a disadvantage compared to customers who used other trading apps.” Robinhood has lifted the blanket freeze on GameStop and other stocks, but it’s maintained &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys"&gt;strict trading limits&lt;/a&gt; for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S0Zkky"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An unrelated class action lawsuit was certified last week&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YaMCwG"&gt;Nelson requested that courts force Robinhood to reinstate full access to trading GameStop stock, in addition to paying financial damages for any Robinhood users who were unable to execute GameStop stock trades. Other parties made similar pleas, and several are seeking class action status. Some suits also targeted other institutions, including the financial services companies &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/29/robinhood-citadel-gamestop-reddit/"&gt;Citadel Securities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-trading-restrictions-blamed-on-wall-streets-clearing-firm-by-online-broker-11611867105"&gt;Apex Clearing&lt;/a&gt;, which have worked with Robinhood to execute trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmdTQF"&gt;The cases were filed only days ago, and they may not be heard until the GameStop stock bubble has deflated. While a Washington judge did&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;certify a class action suit against Robinhood last week, that case &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16464992/parties/gordon-v-robinhood-financial-llc/"&gt;dates to 2019&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/tcpa/1006590-robinhood-class-action-lawsuit-certified-over-refer-a-friend-texts-washington-state/"&gt;concerned the app’s&lt;/a&gt; “refer a friend” program. &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/some-furious-robinhood-users-are-suing-but-theres-potentially-a-big-road-block-in-their-way-to-court-11611950777"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;MarketWatch&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, any lawsuit might also be stymied by Robinhood’s arbitration clause — a section of the user agreement that demands conflicts be settled out of court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3Fboh"&gt;Disgruntled users aren’t the only threat for Robinhood, however. The company’s decision drew bipartisan condemnation from lawmakers, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and others &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254584/gamestop-robinhood-short-reddit-wallstreetbets-aoc-ted-cruz"&gt;calling to investigate the company’s decision&lt;/a&gt;. And CEO Vlad Tenev is &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/01/robinhood-ceo-testify-maxine-waters-464491"&gt;expected to testify&lt;/a&gt; in a February 18th hearing before the House Financial Services Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX announces first ‘all-civilian’ mission to space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fHrFBJOXCs7kIyOJq0lE-KxBkBk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68753590/elon_musk_tesla_3036.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oow6VM"&gt;Elon Musk’s SpaceX is planning to send its first “all-civilian” crew to space at the end of 2021 in a charity-focused mission commanded by tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman. The company said in a press release it’ll pick three people to ride alongside Isaacman to orbit aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8CisNc"&gt;Isaacman, a trained pilot and the chief executive of Shift4 Payments, said he donated $100 million to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and wants to help raise $200 million more by inviting people to donate at least $10 to St. Jude for a chance to get picked. Three people will be chosen “to represent the mission pillars of leadership, hope, generosity and prosperity,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005905/en/World%E2%80%99s-First-All-Civilian-Mission-to-Space-Will-Usher-in-New-Era-of-Commercial-Space-Exploration"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; — though one person was already picked, Isaacman said during a press call on Monday. The full crew “will be announced in the weeks ahead,” SpaceX said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDogwm"&gt; “This is an important milestone towards enabling access to space for everyone,” Musk told reporters on the call, adding that it’s part of SpaceX’s broader goal to “bring the cost down over time and make space accessible to all.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jAcrMZ"&gt;The mission, named Inspiration4, will launch from SpaceX’s 39A launch site at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida atop the company’s Falcon 9 rocket. Prior to flight, crew members will get special training from SpaceX with “a specific focus on orbital mechanics, operating in microgravity, zero gravity, and other forms of stress testing.” The four-person crew will spend up to five days in the acorn-shaped Crew Dragon capsule as it orbits Earth every 90 minutes “along a customized flight path,” SpaceX and the contest’s official rules said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdX7OL"&gt;“The mission parameters are up to Jared,” Musk said. The mission could last anywhere from two to four days long, “but if you wanna stay up longer that’s fine too,” he added. Musk and Isaacman offered scant details on the kind of training the crew members will go through, but it’ll be long enough for the participants — three strangers — to get to know each other before spending a few days confined to Crew Dragon’s tight cabin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGVBTg"&gt;“We are all going to know each other incredibly well, long before we ever strapped into Dragon, I can promise you that,” Isaacman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UF4hO3"&gt;Crew members must be “physically and psychologically fit for training,” under 6 feet and 6 inches tall and weigh less than 250 pounds, per the fundraiser’s official rules (a person who’s able to ride the Incredible Hulk roller coaster in Florida would be a perfect fit, Musk said). If the mission gets delayed past 2022, crew members will each get an “alternate prize” of $150,000, the fine print added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JiFhRq"&gt;SpaceX has launched two crews to space already, but those were with trained NASA astronauts — including one astronaut from Japan’s space agency — on government-funded trips to the International Space Station. The Inspiration4 mission marks SpaceX’s latest private astronaut mission to be announced: The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250327/space-tourists-axiom-private-crew-iss-price"&gt;Ax-1 mission&lt;/a&gt;, also planned for the end of 2021, hosts a crew of four private astronauts paying $55 million each for an eight-day trip to the ISS. And in 2018 Elon Musk announced Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa will hitch a ride around the moon on SpaceX’s new rocket system Starship, which is in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLHuGZ"&gt;SpaceX developed its Crew Dragon capsule with a more than $2 billion contract under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, the agency’s initiative to spur private spacecraft development. Kathy Lueders, who led the crew program and is currently NASA’s human spaceflight chief, tweeted after the Inspiration4 reveal on Monday she was “excited to see one of the original goals of @Commercial_Crew come to be with the expansion of new commercial activities beyond our own in low-Earth orbit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JokAlA"&gt;Isaacman told reporters the mission kicks off the biggest fundraiser ever for St. Jude, a children’s hospital with an already massive fundraising reach. “If we’re going to continue making advances up there in space, then we have an obligation to do the same down here on Earth,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NYU researchers find no evidence of anti-conservative bias on social media</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Donald Trump’s Twitter Account Suspended" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AJ135c4NSdZq0GgUYH-Awe5eA6g=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68753500/1230490709.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZuAdEy"&gt;A new report finds that claims of anti-conservative bias on social media platforms are not only untrue but serve as a form of disinformation. The &lt;a href="https://bhr.stern.nyu.edu/bias-report-release-page"&gt;report from NYU’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; says not only is there no empirical finding that social media companies systematically suppress conservatives, but even reports of anecdotal instances tend to fall apart under close scrutiny. And in an effort to appear unbiased, platforms actually bend over backward to try to appease conservative critics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMtqBd"&gt;“The contention that social media as an industry censors conservatives is now, as we speak, becoming part of an even broader disinformation campaign from the right, that conservatives are being silenced all across American society,” the report’s lead researcher Paul Barrett said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This is the obvious post-Trump theme, we’re seeing it on Fox News, hearing it from Trump lieutenants, and I think it will continue indefinitely. Rather than any of this going away with Trump leaving Washington, it’s only getting more intense.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yetijO"&gt;The researchers analyzed data from analytics platforms CrowdTangle and NewsWhip and existing reports like the &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/26/censorship-conservatives-social-media-432643"&gt;2020 study from Politico&lt;/a&gt; and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, all of which showed that conservative accounts actually dominated social media. And they drilled down into anecdotes about bias and repeatedly found there was no concrete evidence to support such claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ceJWs8"&gt;Looking at how claims of anti-conservative bias developed over time, Barrett says, it’s not hard to see how the “anti-conservative” rhetoric became a political instrument. “It’s a tool used by everyone from Trump to Jim Jordan to Sean Hannity, but there is no evidence to back it up,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUG3Yf"&gt;The report notes that the many lawsuits against social media platforms have “failed to present substantial evidence of ideological favoritism — and they have all been dismissed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BEJlZE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Twitter was taking the lead and setting the example.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tFjffq"&gt;This is not to suggest that Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and others have not made mistakes, Barrett added; they have. “They tend to react to crises and adjust their policies in the breach, and that’s led to a herky-jerky cadence of how they apply their policies,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6exNGz"&gt;Twitter in particular has historically been more hands-off with moderation, proud of its image as a protector of free speech. But all that changed in 2020, Barrett said, in response to the pandemic and the anticipation that there would be a bitter election campaign cycle. “Twitter shifted its policies and began much more vigorous policing of content around the pandemic and voting in general,” he notes. Among social media companies, “Twitter was taking the lead and setting the example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uK0jkY"&gt;And in the aftermath of the January 6th riots at the Capitol, Barrett says, Twitter and other platforms were well within their policies against inciting violence when they banned former President Trump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDGKY0"&gt;The report has several recommendations for social media platforms going forward. First: better disclosure around content moderation decisions, so the public has a fuller understanding of why certain content and users might be removed. The report authors also want platforms to allow users to customize and control their social media feeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gf5IRG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The secret lives of Facebook moderators in America","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NVpfOZ"&gt;Hiring more human moderators is another key recommendation, and Barrett acknowledges that the job of content moderator is highly stressful. But having more moderators — hired as employees, not contractors — would allow Facebook and other platforms to spread out moderation of the most challenging content among more people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2UsS6"&gt;The report also recommends Congress and the White House work with tech companies to dial back some of the hostility between Washington and Silicon Valley and work on responsible regulation. He doesn’t recommend repealing Section 230, however. Instead, he’d like to see it amended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWnhez"&gt;“Make it conditional: If companies want to enjoy the benefits of 230, they need to adopt responsible content moderation policies. Let people see how their algorithms work, and why certain people see material others don’t,” he said. “No one expects them to show every last line of code, but people should be able to understand what goes into the decisions being made about what they’re seeing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YjP1rB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e81ZDm"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This DIY project turns an iPod into a click wheel-powered Spotify player</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qY1430B9FKY0A7KtQXj_959cF0c=/0x6:2995x2003/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68753287/9709381611420439726.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Guy Dupont&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="23TvnZ"&gt;Classic iPods have their fans, but they’re not built for the modern age of music streaming — except for this one, which has been turned into a Spotify player by tinkerer Guy Dupont. While it may look like an iPod from the outside, inside, it’s got a Raspberry Pi loaded with software custom-built by Dupont to interface with Spotify, while still keeping the classic iPod style. He calls it the sPot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Y7175"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxdhG1OhVng"&gt;In a video&lt;/a&gt; showing off the project and the process behind it, Dupont says he was inspired when his mother-in-law gifted him the old iPod. In a Hackaday post, he says he “had forgotten how good it feels to hold and use one of these things,” but he wanted to update it with some modern features, including (obviously) Spotify streaming, Bluetooth audio, and search. That’s right, the device can search the entirety of Spotify’s library and stream it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gyFW7-qaIEFCta6y5s_r9cj4UG0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22273865/2933361611439284872.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We don’t need an iTunes library where we’re going.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2VdATS"&gt;Dupont put a Raspberry Pi Zero W inside the iPod because Spotify requires an internet connection — something most iPods don’t support. It also allows for the custom interface and Bluetooth audio. The sPot also needs a larger battery to power the Pi, but all of the hardware still fits inside the original iPod case.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gw7DaV"&gt;Dupont was able to keep the scroll wheel interface — and he even managed to improve it. There’s now haptic feedback when scrolling, instead of just the audible click. But while many of the original buttons are present, they haven't all been as faithfully preserved as the click wheel has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSir5i"&gt;The hold switch now controls the power, instead of locking the iPod to prevent pocket-scrolling. And while the headphone jack is still there, it no longer does anything (RIP to a real one), as audio output is handled by Bluetooth. It also ditches the original 30-pin connector for an easier-to-find-in-2021 Micro USB port that handles charging. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The headphone jack is now just for decoration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That beautiful scroll wheel action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zKddII"&gt;If you wanted to make one of these yourself, Dupont has &lt;a href="https://github.com/dupontgu/retro-ipod-spotify-client"&gt;posted all of the code you’ll need on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. He also &lt;a href="https://hackaday.io/project/177034-spot-spotify-in-a-4th-gen-ipod-2004"&gt;created a Hackaday page&lt;/a&gt; detailing the other software that’s needed to get Spotify working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pa3ExI"&gt;If you’re like me and are wishing for your own sPot, the video should give you pretty much all you need to get started. Doing the quickest of searches for the parts he’s listed, the project will cost around $100, plus the price of the iPod if you don’t already have one. But even if you have no desire to make one of these, the video is totally worth a watch just to experience the glory of what a modern iPod could look like and to see this really cool project come together. &lt;/p&gt;
