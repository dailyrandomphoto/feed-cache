    <title>Polestar is building a zero-emissions car without ‘cop-out’ carbon offsets</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6O0HIn"&gt;Swedish electric performance automaker Polestar says it will build the world’s first truly zero-emissions vehicle without relying on carbon offsets, which it described as a “cop-out.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SEIDg"&gt;The company, which was spun out of Volvo and Volvo’s parent company Geely, framed its effort to cut carbon emissions by changing the way its cars are made as a “moonshot goal” that would result in the world’s first carbon neutral vehicle by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cc0x9"&gt;Carbon offsets, like tree planting, have become a standard way for car companies and other businesses to write off their carbon emissions by investing in renewable energy or conservation projects aimed at bolstering forests’ ability to naturally store carbon. But there’s &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-nature-conservancy-carbon-offsets-trees/"&gt;growing evidence&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://features.propublica.org/brazil-carbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work-deforestation-redd-acre-cambodia/"&gt;offsets haven’t succeeded&lt;/a&gt; in slowing global warming and have instead given companies license to keep polluting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s9D982"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s growing evidence that offsets haven’t succeeded&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HElRP3"&gt;“Offsetting is a cop-out,” says Thomas Ingenlath, Polestar CEO, in a statement. “By pushing ourselves to create a completely climate-neutral car, we are forced to reach beyond what is possible today. We will have to question everything, innovate and look to exponential technologies as we design towards zero.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3sFw9r"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311210/fedex-carbon-neutral-2040-2-billion-electric-vehicles-planes"&gt;FedEx&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169798/united-airlines-emissions-carbon-capture-climate-change-goal"&gt;United&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137782/delta-carbon-neutral-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climate-change-airlines"&gt;Delta&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-climatechange/uber-jetblue-join-amazon-backed-climate-pledge-idUSKBN28C24H"&gt;JetBlue&lt;/a&gt; said they would eliminate all of their emissions over the next several decades. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427196/uber-promise-100-percent-electric-vehicle-ev-2030"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294040/lyft-electric-vehicle-ev-100-percent-2030"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt; have pledged to go carbon neutral within a similar timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDobFs"&gt;The automaker makes two cars: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16487290/polestar-volvo-hybrid-electric-revealed"&gt;the $155,000 hybrid coupe Polestar 1&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;all-electric fastback sedan Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt;. The Polestar 3, an electric crossover SUV, is expected to be released in late 2021. After its first vehicle, the company has said it will only produce electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wbwzAs"&gt;The real challenge for Polestar will be the elimination of carbon emissions from its production process and supply chain. Several major automakers have pledged to phase out gas-powered vehicle production by a certain target date, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21300974/ford-carbon-neutral-2050-climate-change-fuel-efficiency"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, and Polestar’s parent company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20915841/volvo-xc40-recharge-electric-suv-specs-miles-range-reveal"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;. But automobile production, including the mining of the rare earth minerals that go into lithium-ion batteries, is an intensely carbon-heavy process. Even reducing those emissions, to say nothing of eliminating them, will be a hugely consequential task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NKDul"&gt;Polestar, as a boutique operation, may have more flexibility to achieve its goals than other larger — and thus, less nimble — companies. The company announced its so-called Polestar 0 project as part of its first annual review, in which it also said that sustainability declarations would be applied to all future Polestar models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRKyxU"&gt;Sustainability declarations, popular in industries like &lt;a href="https://www.sustainablefoodtrade.org/declaration-of-sustainability/"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fglobal-sustainability-declaration-fashion-industry-dr-anna-brismar%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F7%2F22370302%2Fpolestar-carbon-neutral-electric-car-no-offsets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fashion&lt;/a&gt;, is a checklist of all the carbon emissions and waste associated with a product or process. Starting with the Polestar 2, the company says it will list on its website the carbon footprint and traced risk materials associated with the production of each of its vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5RarFE"&gt;“Today, Polestar 2 leaves the factory gates with a carbon footprint,” Ingenlath said. “In 2030 we want to present a car that does not.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fujifilm’s new Instax Mini 40 is a $100 vintage-looking toy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q-82uPh6kdH1o4wPpWGf_N9GmZk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69087526/bfarsace_20210405_4506_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Instax Mini 40 is an entry-level instant film camera with only two settings and two buttons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A8bKM7"&gt;Fujifilm has announced the newest addition to the Instax Mini line of instant cameras, the Mini 40. Much like the Instax Mini 11, which was released last March, the Mini 40 is an entry-level instant film camera with only two settings and two buttons. But what sets this camera apart is its vintage film camera look, complete with a plastic faux leather body and metallic-looking plastic rails. It’s a $100 toy camera that instantly creates printed memories — and of course, it’s a blast to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EtQVw"&gt;Beyond the vintage camera look, the Mini 40 has the same mechanics as the $70 Mini 11. Pushing the large silver button under the lens compartment will pop the lens out and turn the camera on. Selfie mode is activated by pulling the outermost part of the lens out about half an inch more. And when you’re ready to pack it away, push the lens back into the camera to turn it off. The camera’s all-plastic housing makes it very light and easy to take anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/su1HmM-B_pPOPcaevCGWCc7xzZU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425061/bfarsace_20210405_4506_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To turn on the Instax Mini 40, you push the silver button under the lens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RfRu2DE4CJY_g-ro5UNnEyNF5LQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425063/bfarsace_20210405_4506_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Instax Mini 40 has a plastic faux leather body and metallic-looking plastic rails.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AHh0LG"&gt;There are two shooting modes on the Instax Mini 40: normal and selfie. Selfie mode adjusts the focal distance of the camera to allow subjects closer to the lens to be in focus. Beyond that, you have very little control. The flash will fire with every shutter press, and an Instax Mini film sheet will roll out to a mechanic hum. The results are unpredictable beyond knowing the printed photo will be slightly soft with a high contrast and be bound within the icon Polaroid frame. The magic comes when you place the print on a table, forget about it, and are reminded of a great memory no less than a minute and a half later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xulc3"&gt;When using any Instax camera, I can’t help but notice the amount of plastic used in each one of the 10-photo film cartridges. Although there is a recycling logo on the cartridge, it is in Japanese, and I am unable to tell what number plastic it is made from. In the US, many municipalities have specific plastic numbers they can and cannot recycle, and without this number clearly labeled on these photo cartridges, I was unable to know if I would be able to recycle them here in Brooklyn, New York. I reached out to Fujifilm for more information and will update this article if I get it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nbWXmmjRiKuMibtY6ZEiOipn3oY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425059/bfarsace_20210405_4506_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Selfie mode is enabled by pulling out the frontmost element of the lens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vwTT52"&gt;Play both informs my creative style and relieves me of stress — which, as a person who is tasked with reviewing cameras, is hard to always satisfy when using a camera. But the Mini 40, much like the Mini 11, has so few options, a very lightweight feel, and, at times, such unpredictable results that I can sit back and just have fun when using it. Any further thought about photographic theory while using the Mini 40 is excessive and rarely yielded me better results. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F19V-VpmCbHsym-J75kFYokFILg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425058/bfarsace_20210405_4506_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The shutter button is located under the viewfinder on the front of the camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dQJUBC"&gt;At $100, the Mini 40 is a tad more expensive than the almost-identical Mini 11. Besides its new vintage look, there would be little reason to spend the extra $30. But if looking the film photographer part is important, the Mini 40’s design will stand out. Once Fujifilm addresses the amount of plastic used in every one of the 10-shot film packs, I will really be able to have a carefree experience with this camera.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NIU announces its first electric kick scooter starting at $599</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iQ_6VAu9d8prknMW2CFerPG9_os=/419x0:3301x1921/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69087400/NIU_Kick_Scooter_Regenerative_Braking.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1O7r5S"&gt;NIU, maker of popular, affordable electric mopeds, showed off its first-ever electric kick scooter. The new two-wheeler will be available starting this summer in China, Europe, and North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQ4wNq"&gt;The NIU Kick Scooter will come in two variants, Pro and Sport. In the US, the Pro scooter will have a top speed of 19.8mph, while the Sport version will have a top speed of 17.4 mph. In Europe, both versions will have a regulated top speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph). The Pro will have a range 31 miles (50 km) on a single 7.5-hour charge, while the Sport will have a range of 25 miles (40 km) on a single 5.5-hour charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9hhwKo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The NIU Kick Scooter will come in two variants, Pro and Sport&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gf3Hui"&gt;For the drivetrain, NIU is offering a 350W motor and 486Wh lithium-ion battery pack for the Pro kick scooter, while the Sport will be powered by a 300W motor and 365Wh battery pack. Both scooters are water resistant, foldable, and come with app connectivity via Bluetooth and regenerative braking. The cheapest version of the scooter will start at $599, though NIU has yet release any more details about pricing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RqgUrC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10432850"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fjF29e"&gt;NIU is mostly known in North America for its popular $2,000 electric mopeds, which have been used by shared mobility companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/16/18677586/revel-mopeds-scooter-nyc-review"&gt;Revel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22248805/lime-electric-moped-scooter-niu-washington-paris"&gt;Lime&lt;/a&gt;. The mopeds are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21051352/china-niu-electric-scooters-mopeds-ces-2020"&gt;available for purchase&lt;/a&gt; in a handful of US cities, including San Francisco, San Diego, Austin, Chicago, Washington, DC, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Honolulu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fpiabm"&gt;A pre-sale for the kick scooter starts in June 2021, with delivery scheduled in the US and Europe in July 2021. Global retail sales will begin in August 2021, with the scooter able to be purchased online or in any of NIU’s dealerships and stores in Europe and North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUb4Ea"&gt;Electric scooters are plentiful in the US, with models from Segway-Ninebot, Inokim, Acton, Unagi, and others widely available from a number of different retailers. Battery-powered mopeds, however, are a bit harder to come by in North America. Major manufacturers, like Gogoro, tend to focus sales on higher volume markets like China, while the US is left to languish thanks to its car-centric infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pac-Man 99 is a new battle royale game for the Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b6AUzNPOlkNOWWIs5fLA5BAwGvc=/203x0:2354x1434/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69086990/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_10.32.31.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nvPKq1"&gt;Nintendo has announced &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man 99&lt;/em&gt;, a new multiplayer game that’ll be included with its Nintendo Switch Online subscription service. Like &lt;em&gt;Tetris 99&lt;/em&gt; and the recently departed &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros. 35&lt;/em&gt;, the game pits dozens of players against each other in a battle royale-style fight to the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPcVGU"&gt;The game looks similar to the classic arcade original Pac-Man, but you can make it more difficult for opponents by munching on power pellets, eating ghosts, and sending “Jammer Pac-Man” over to their screens. There are eight different preset strategies you can use to screw with other players, for example by speeding up their game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZS5x4p"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;PAC-MAN™ is back in a new 99-PAC-MAN battle royale! PAC-MAN™ 99 goes live 4/7 at 6 PM PST, exclusively for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitchOnline?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NintendoSwitchOnline&lt;/a&gt; members! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PACMAN99?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PACMAN99&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;a href="https://t.co/mnzEYXJnBl"&gt;https://t.co/mnzEYXJnBl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/1qOsEEvbHD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1qOsEEvbHD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1379602342744571906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iXjguS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man 99 &lt;/em&gt;also has various themes available for purchase that change up the music and visuals based on other Namco games like &lt;em&gt;Galaga, Xevious,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dig Dug&lt;/em&gt;. There are 20 in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lg6atT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man 99&lt;/em&gt; will be available to download tomorrow, April 7th, and it’ll be free for anyone with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. The game is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s latency-reducing tech is live for all Overwatch players with the company’s GPUs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Overwatch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A1LYkWNsHM1_eD4-ywZ4yeyLbM0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69086820/OVR_PR_Switch_GameplayShots_XA_031_A_png_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgEkgF"&gt;Nvidia &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Foverwatch-reflex-out-now%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F6%2F22370662%2Fnvidia-latency-reduction-reflex-overwatch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is launching its latency-reducing tech&lt;/a&gt;, Reflex, for anyone who has a Nvidia graphics card and plays the PC version of &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;. The company tested the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/13/22328366/overwatch-latency-reduction-nvidia-reflex-beta"&gt;in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch’&lt;/em&gt;s PTR servers in March&lt;/a&gt;, but now Reflex is live and theoretically available for competitive play. Nvidia claims Reflex reduces the time between pulling the trigger in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; and the game rendering the shot on screen by as much as 50 percent, and now you can easily test that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5i9NNy"&gt;Latency can be caused by a variety of things (internet speed can be a big factor in competitive play) but Reflex is focused on reducing latency caused by computer hardware. The longer the delay between a click and the game reacting, the better chance whatever the player was responding to is already out of frame. In this case, Nvidia’s tech isn’t new, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; is just the latest esports title to be fully added to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Ftechnologies%2Freflex%2Fsupported-products%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F6%2F22370662%2Fnvidia-latency-reduction-reflex-overwatch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the small collection of 15 games&lt;/a&gt; that support Reflex so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mvwwqk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VsFhdr5jGEE?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=5&amp;amp;start=5" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xmFGPf"&gt;I can’t say how well the feature might actually work without trying it, but if &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsFhdr5jGEE"&gt;Nvidia’s video demonstration&lt;/a&gt; is to be believed, it might only be noticeable to a professional player who can feel the microsecond difference in latency. Nvidia does suggest that in some cases, that small difference could drastically change the result. According to Nvidia’s demo, enabling Reflex could be the difference between a critical hit and missing entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzqceL"&gt;Your mileage may vary, but if you have a Nvidia graphics card — Reflex works on cards as old as the GTX 900-series — and a G-Sync monitor, you should be able to give the low latency feature a try. Enabling Reflex requires the newest version of Nvidia’s drivers and an updated copy of whatever game you want to use it in. In &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s case, if you have an updated game, a supported graphics card, and the new driver, you can enable Reflex in Video Settings. The company has also partnered to create &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418080/nvidia-g-sync-reflex-360hz-refresh-rate-gaming-monitors-alienware-msi-asus-acer"&gt;specific monitors that include a Reflex Latency Analyzer feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jimmy Fallon played Among Us with streamers and the cast of Stranger Things in Twitch debut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B5Pupw69-gOXMqis6_aENTeZWoo=/0x15:1016x692/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69084365/image__2_.10.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZpQzLf"&gt;Jimmy Fallon streamed &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; on Twitch with a star-studded group in his debut on the platform Tuesday evening. The stream lasted about an hour, and near the end, more than 125,000 people were watching live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5IYuv"&gt;Fallon was joined by The Roots’ Questlove, Tariq Trotter, and Kirk Douglas; &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things &lt;/em&gt;stars Noah Schnapp (who plays Will Byers) and Gaten Matarazzo (who plays Dustin Henderson); streamers Sykkuno and Rachel “Valkyrae” Hofstetter; YouTuber Corpse Husband; and &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; developer InnerSloth’s community director, Victoria Tran. Parts from the stream will air on &lt;em&gt;The Tonight Show&lt;/em&gt; next week, &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jimmy-fallon-tonight-show-twitch-among-us-stranger-things"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnP1pj"&gt;You can catch &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/978024828?filter=archives&amp;amp;sort=time"&gt;a replay of the stream&lt;/a&gt; on Fallon’s Twitch channel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zGLcyk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=978024828&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B819Hy"&gt;Fallon also raised money for &lt;a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/"&gt;Feeding America&lt;/a&gt; during the stream. Donations from viewers totaled more than $17,000, and Fallon said he’d cover the rest of the donations to reach the $25,000 goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQyg5p"&gt;The group played on &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;’ classic Skeld map and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22362177/among-us-airship-update-map-sneaky-crewmate-imposter"&gt;huge new Airship map&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338782/among-us-airship-map-accounts-update-innersloth"&gt;was released on March 31st&lt;/a&gt;. (The game also now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353088/among-us-airship-update-poop-hat-chocolate-ice-cream"&gt;has a poop hat&lt;/a&gt;, which I didn’t see anyone wearing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6A0SKh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 6th, 7:53PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Fallon’s stream has ended, so we have made adjustments to the headline and article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google seemingly reveals Pixel Buds A in marketing email</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vx1ENvvEjC0bBWBN8dp7lDYS51Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69086220/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CUGdoW"&gt;As we approach Google I/O 2021, the rumor mill has started pointing to new hardware, including a Pixel 5A and Pixel Buds A, a lower-cost set of true wireless earbuds that would slot in below the company’s main pair. Google seems to have gotten ahead of itself, however, as, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/06/google-email-inadvertently-leaks-green-pixel-buds-a/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new email contains an image of olive green Pixel Buds that aren’t part of the current lineup. The interior of the case is also color-matched to the buds, which isn’t the case with the second-gen Pixel Buds. Another clue that these are new is that the inside-facing part of the earbuds is also the same green. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIJubi"&gt;So with those things considered, we’re likely seeing the upcoming Pixel Buds A in this image. They look practically identical to the regular Pixel Buds, though the second LED inside the charging case is either gone or just not visible in this shot. There’s always the chance that someone went off and messed with the color tint here so it better matches the Pixel 5, but that’d be a little unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/__V-r-jemnA7PQf1AEoKlZbHuis=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425253/067497D5_C6AF_4CCF_89AF_33FDF8D18F5E.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/06/google-email-inadvertently-leaks-green-pixel-buds-a/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="p1EBPS"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/23/new-google-pixel-buds-incoming-fcc/"&gt;recent filing at the Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; is likely for these earbuds. We’ll have to wait for Google’s eventual announcement to see which features have been cut if the company indeed plans to sell these at a notably lower price than the standard Pixel Buds. With those going for $179, maybe Google will aim to hit a $99 or $129 price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIjFpX"&gt;Google’s second-gen Pixel Buds had some connection stability issues when they first shipped, which the company tried to address over the course of several firmware updates. But some customers continue to encounter issues like dropouts and other bugs, so hopefully Google will say a thing or two about connection strength when it does get around to announcing these Pixel Buds A.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gazelle brings back its phone trade-in program two months after discontinuing it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12, in blue." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0wTxK49NyoGux2ayro6iaVNjl9U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69086084/vpavic_4243_20201018_0121.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hj8AnD"&gt;Trade-in provider Gazelle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206779/gazelle-smartphone-used-trade-in-program-shut-down"&gt;exited the online trade-in business&lt;/a&gt; back in February, and now the company says it’s changing its mind. Gazelle is back to accepting online trade-ins of iPhones, Samsung phones, Google Pixel devices, and iPads and other tablets on its website, the company confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The program resumed accepting new offers on April 5th, a Gazelle representative clarified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDePCQ"&gt;“Earlier this year, we announced that we will no longer be offering our trade-in option on Gazelle. After careful consideration, including feedback from customers like you, we have decided to keep Gazelle Trade-In going. Today, we are happy to say, ‘We’re back, baby!’” reads an email Gazelle sent to prospective customers and shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Gazelle Trade-In is a pioneer of the electronics trade-in space and we are happy to continue building on our legacy by offering a simple process and immediate payouts for those unwanted devices.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bk0Fcj"&gt;Gazelle emerged as one of the leading trade-in providers of the smartphone era. But its business model didn’t fare as well when the US mobile phone business underwent major shifts away from two-year contracts and outright device purchases and toward phone leasing and carrier and device maker trade-in programs like Apple’s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8v5QVq"&gt;Gazelle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206779/gazelle-smartphone-used-trade-in-program-shut-down"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; back in December of last year it would end its online phone trade-in program on February 1st, 2021, though the company said at the time it would continue to operate its in-person trade-in kiosks through parent company ecoATM. Gazelle did confirm in the email sent to customers that it will not be bringing back its rewards program. “We will continue to evaluate the market conditions and will inform you if this changes,” the email reads. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s new gaming phone looks like a Transformer sandwich</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hCm38ReLQr5oa9S-kYJneqenSng=/0x60:1440x1020/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085854/thescarylenovophone.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not a big fan of the design of this rumored Lenovo gaming phone, to be honest. Kind of looks like a Transformer in disguise. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Weibo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f3E0yE"&gt;Lenovo’s next gaming phone has leaked, with a design that looks like a Michael Bay Transformer and a gaming PC merged together. It’s unlike anything I have ever seen on a phone before. I’m not sure if I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BkmBqj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4622920313473303"&gt;Pictures of what appears to be the phone&lt;/a&gt; were shown on the social media service Weibo recently, and I am speechless. Specifically, the dual-camera setup is located at the dead center of the phone, and there’s a built-in active cooling fan. It reminds me a lot of a Transformer, as you can see from the photo below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EQEFJx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10432513"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3M4Ub"&gt;Now, Lenovo is not the first company to stick a cooling fan in a gaming smartphone. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/29/18522625/nubia-red-magic-3-gaming-phone-release-date-cooling-price-specs-features"&gt;Nubia’s Red Magic 3&lt;/a&gt; had a cooling fan placed inside of the device. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fglobal.blackshark.com%2Fproducts%2Ffuncooler-pro&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F4%2F6%2F22370308%2Flenovo-phone-2-pro-release-date-price-design-leaked" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Black Shark FunCooler Pro&lt;/a&gt; is an external cooling fan designed for people who game on their phones. Not to mention Asus’ &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/power-protection-gadgets/docks-dongles-and-cables/aeroactive-cooler-5-model/"&gt;AeroActive Cooler 5&lt;/a&gt;, an external fan designed to cool down its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; gaming phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdKVLA"&gt;But the biggest concern I have for the recent images of the rumored Lenovo phone (which is rumored to be called the Legion Phone 2 Pro) is that gaming phones may continue to include more ridiculous designs. Lenovo’s first gaming phone, which launched last year, already had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333138/lenovo-legion-duel-pro-gaming-phone-pop-up-selfie-cam-side-landscape"&gt;an absurd design by placing a pop-up camera on the side of the phone&lt;/a&gt;. But new model looks to escalate things even further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjCF6J"&gt;According to the leaks, Lenovo’s Legion Phone 2 Pro is rumored to launch on April 8th in China first, but it's unclear if the phone will release anywhere else. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>eBay’s app will soon be able to scan Pokémon cards to sell them more easily</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OcJxFl5d1MbZRrS0JIF8IOznhD8=/9x0:1991x1321/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085848/Image_Listing_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;eBay Inc.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V0NuaD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ebay-cuts-listing-time-in-half-for-trading-card-sellers-with-new-feature-coming-april-2021-301254869.html"&gt;eBay has announced&lt;/a&gt; a new addition coming to its mobile app: soon, you’ll be able to scan trading cards from popular games like Pokémon, Magic: The Gathering, and Yu-Gi-Oh! to more easily sell them on the online auction site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4hOQF"&gt;The new card scanning feature is set to arrive at the end of April, but it’ll only support Magic: The Gathering when it launches. Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh! are planned to be added in May, with sports cards and “other collectible card games” on the docket for later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NYeBd"&gt;Using the new scanning option, sellers will be able to just scan a card, at which point eBay will use the card’s details to help automatically build the listing. Sellers will still have to add additional information, like photos of the actual card, its condition, the price they wish to sell it for, and any other details. But the automatic identification process should make it easier for sellers to create their listings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLjrxB"&gt;In addition to the new scanning feature, eBay is adding a few other improvements to the trading card purchasing process for both sellers and buyers. Sellers will no longer have to offer the option to return purchases in order to qualify for eBay’s Top Rated seller program. And the company is working on “reviewing its buyer protection policy for trading cards” to better both sellers and buyers in the current market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9uU14"&gt;Trading cards — specifically, Pokémon cards — &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/10/22276531/pokemon-card-game-company-reprinting-high-demand"&gt;are in high demand these days&lt;/a&gt;. And the number of people looking to cash in is skyrocketing — to the point where appraisal company Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA) has been &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22360269/pokemon-card-psa-rating-services-halted"&gt;forced to suspend submissions&lt;/a&gt; while it &lt;a href="https://www.psacard.com/articles/articleview/10367/psa-customer-update-april-2021"&gt;works through its backlog&lt;/a&gt;. And given that popularity, it’s not a surprise that eBay is looking to make it easier for sellers to use the platform to list their cards. &lt;/p&gt;
