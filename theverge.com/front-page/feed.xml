    <title>Messy NFT drop angers infosec pioneers with unauthorized portraits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zyZq5g-eplnmB1P3ZAMNXj7WtXA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70321294/acastro_210319_1777_nft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NrAAQa"&gt;An unauthorized NFT drop celebrating infosec pioneers has collapsed into a mess of conflicting takedowns and piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brOs38"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IBCDAO/status/1474725664741756931"&gt;Released on Christmas Day&lt;/a&gt; by a group called “ItsBlockchain,” the “Cipher Punks” NFT package included portraits of 46 distinct figures, with ten copies of each token. Taken at their opening price, the full value of the drop was roughly $4,000. But almost immediately, the infosec community began to raise objections — including some from the portrait subjects themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="vaGhnt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O99BKc"&gt;The portrait images misspelled several names — including EFF speech activist Jillian York and OpenPGP creator Jon Callas — and based at least one drawing on a copyright-protected photograph. More controversially, the list included some figures who have been ostracized for harmful personal behavior, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/21/16807116/infosec-community-sexual-predators-weinstein-assault"&gt;Jacob Appelbaum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://selamjie.medium.com/remove-richard-stallman-appendix-a-a7e41e784f88"&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnWcLz"&gt;Responding on Twitter, York tweeted a link to her own portrait and said simply, “I don’t approve of this whatsoever and would like it removed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxn3gO"&gt;Removing the NFTs has been more complicated than it might seem. The ItsBlockchain team apologized on Twitter for not obtaining likeness rights in advance and said it has removed 28 NFTs from the group and burned two others. But there’s no clear procedure for removing tokens that have already been sold, and ItsBlockchain is mostly counting on the central OpenSea platform to remove the tokens and resolve the issue. ItsBlockchain has appealed to the platform for guidance, but so far it has received little guidance. (OpenSea did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9NavJ"&gt;“We have been trying to resolve this issue ... we want to take it down,” the group said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “OpenSea involvement would make the job easy at this stage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RsA1TQ"&gt;The incident is a reminder of the potentially thorny legal issues around NFTs, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22809090/nft-create-opensea-rarible-cryptocurrency-ethereum-collectibles-how-to"&gt;norms of permissionless innovation&lt;/a&gt; often clash with likeness rights and intellectual property law. Typically, US laws around publicity rights hold that a person’s name and identity can’t be used for promotion without their consent — although it’s unclear how such a lawsuit would work in practice when applied to NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Batman’s latest trailer introduces the Riddler as a FaceTime troll</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vc3BlHrId9W7dr04djpfzd66B40=/0x16:1300x883/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70321283/enigma_coffiee.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Warner Bros. Pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TX7OmT"&gt;A new trailer for &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt; gives us a glimpse at Catwoman’s “thing” for stray cats and the Riddler’s affinity for FaceTime. What’s promised as an even grittier take on &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt; stars Robert Pattinson as Batman, Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman, and Paul Dano as the Riddler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5RaTA"&gt;The two-and-a-half-minute teaser, appropriately titled “The Bat and the Cat,” highlights the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle, who don’t always appear to get along. In one scene, Batman is commenting on the — apparently concerning — number of cats Catwoman has in her home, and in the next, the duo is sparring in a low-lit office. The pair comes together by the end of the trailer, with both battling the same bad guys.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Kegmeni7GGP3a9pyW9Pg7qqSi8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128475/batman_trailer_facetime.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Warner Bros. Pictures&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Batman answers the Riddler’s video call.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xrNKA8"&gt;Not to mention that the trickiest villain in the &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt; universe, the Riddler, seems to be a FaceTime aficionado — well, at least for trying to scare his enemies. After Batman accepts a call from an unknown contact, a chalky question mark symbol appears on his screen, with a figure that’s presumably the Riddler quickly entering the frame. A separate scene shows the Riddler gazing into his phone’s camera with a single goggle-covered eyeball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XULdkk"&gt;The action-packed trailer gives us a taste of everything to come in &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt; — action-packed car chases in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164886/batmobile-batman-matt-reeves-robert-pattinson-motorcycle-suit"&gt;the Batmobile&lt;/a&gt;, a possible romance between Batman and Catwoman, and the Riddler’s bizarre FaceTime calls. &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt; was originally slated for release this year, but delays caused by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21503618/the-batman-matrix-4-release-dates-warner-bros"&gt;pandemic pushed it back until March 4th, 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola will try foldable phones again with a third-generation Razr</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Razr’s Quick View display is convenient" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PhCz_aJGzCQ-mAa_V9F0tn229UM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70320913/dbohn_201023_4260_0008.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not pictured: a beloved phone.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qgFVqx"&gt;Motorola is working on a new version of its Razr foldable smartphones, according to a Weibo post &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/motorola-razr-3-3079713/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/5517268716/L7wJbmcFk"&gt;The post&lt;/a&gt; is from Chen Jin, the general manager of the Lenovo Mobile Business Group in China (Lenovo is currently in charge of Motorola’s smartphone business), and describes how the company has been quietly working on a new addition to its lineup of foldable phones. It doesn’t have big shoes to fill — Motorola’s first two modern foldables were mediocre phones with hefty price tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7hOxN"&gt;We ran Jin’s post through a few translation sites, and while some parts didn’t make the jump to English, there are consistent details that show up in all the translations. The post mentions that the phone will have a better processor, better interface, and a tweaked appearance. At this early stage, though, it’s hard to say how different the third-gen device will be from the last one — the second-gen Razr was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;more of a spec bump that added 5G&lt;/a&gt;, rather than a marked improvement from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;original Razr foldable&lt;/a&gt; announced in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k3wjvnG52T1oiKg_NhAI7LThbdY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128380/Screen_Shot_2021_12_27_at_12.11.59.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s translation of Jin’s Weibo post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VwPyMK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Will the third time be the charm?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9iTVZO"&gt;Perhaps the third attempt at a foldable will be a charm — its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;previous two attempts&lt;/a&gt; have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;hard to recommend&lt;/a&gt;, even before Samsung released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;the exceptional Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; for $1,000. Today’s news, though, plus the fact that it’s still providing Android updates for them (albeit at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623902/motorola-razr-foldable-android-11-software-update-in-2021"&gt;a pretty slow pace&lt;/a&gt;), makes it seem like Motorola hasn’t given up on Razr revival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OnCMET"&gt;&lt;a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;text=%E6%97%B6%E5%85%89%E5%9B%9E%E5%88%B02019%E5%B9%B411%E6%9C%8814%E5%8F%B7%EF%BC%8C%0Amotorola%20%E6%96%B0razr%20%E4%B8%8A%E5%B8%82%EF%BC%8C%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%BA%E4%B8%9A%E5%86%85%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%BE%E7%AB%96%E5%90%91%E6%8A%98%E5%8F%A0%E5%B1%8F%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E6%89%8B%E6%9C%BA%EF%BC%8C%E5%86%8D%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%A1%E5%BC%95%E9%A2%86%E4%BA%86%E8%A1%8C%E4%B8%9A%E5%88%9B%E6%96%B0%E3%80%82%0A%E8%81%94%E6%83%B3%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E9%99%A2%E7%8B%AC%E7%AB%8B%E7%A0%94%E5%8F%91%E7%9A%84%E6%98%9F%E8%BD%A8%E8%BD%AC%E8%BD%B4%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%EF%BC%8C%E6%98%AF%E5%BD%93%E6%97%B6%E5%85%A8%E7%90%83%E5%94%AF%E4%B8%80%E6%8A%95%E5%85%A5%E9%87%8F%E4%BA%A7%E7%9A%84%E6%97%A0%E7%BC%9D%E6%97%A0%E6%8A%98%E7%97%95%E9%93%B0%E9%93%BE%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E3%80%82%0A%E6%88%91%E8%AE%A4%E4%B8%BA%E5%88%9B%E6%96%B0%E6%B0%B8%E8%BF%9C%E6%98%AF%E8%A1%8C%E4%B8%9A%E7%9A%84%E9%A9%B1%E5%8A%A8%E5%8A%9B%E3%80%82%0A%E6%88%91%E5%B8%8C%E6%9C%9B%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E4%B8%8D%E6%98%AF%E5%8F%A3%E6%B0%B4%EF%BC%8C%E8%80%8C%E6%98%AF%E8%A1%8C%E5%8A%A8%E6%9B%B4%E5%A4%9A%E4%B8%80%E4%BA%9B%EF%BC%8C%E5%8C%85%E6%8B%AC%E9%BB%98%E9%BB%98%E7%94%A8%E5%BF%83%E5%9C%B0%E5%87%86%E5%A4%87%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%89%E4%BB%A3razr%20%E6%8A%98%E5%8F%A0%E5%B1%8F%E6%89%8B%E6%9C%BA%3A%E6%9B%B4%E5%85%88%E8%BF%9B%E7%9A%84%E8%8A%AF%E7%89%87%E7%AE%97%E5%8A%9B%EF%BC%8C%E6%9B%B4%E4%BC%98%E7%A7%80%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%BA%0A%E6%9C%BA%E7%95%8C%E9%9D%A2%EF%BC%8C%E5%BD%93%E7%84%B6%EF%BC%8C%E8%BF%98%E6%9C%89%E6%9B%B4%E5%A4%A7%E6%B0%94%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%96%E8%A7%82%E3%80%82%0A%E8%BF%99%E6%AC%BE%E4%BA%A7%E5%93%81%EF%BC%8C%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E5%BD%93%E4%BB%81%E4%B8%8D%E8%AE%A9%E4%BC%9A%E5%9C%A8%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BA%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E4%B8%8A%E5%B8%82%EF%BC%81&amp;amp;op=translate"&gt;One translation&lt;/a&gt; of Jin’s post indicates that it could release in China first, which is backed up by the announcement appearing on Weibo. We’ll be keeping our eyes out for more details or an announcement of this phone to see if it’s truly a notable upgrade or just another iteration of a forgettable foldable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcUQZd"&gt;Manuella Foz, a Motorola spokesperson, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company “cannot comment on future devices” in response to an emailed request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVt53W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction December 27th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The original version of this article incorrectly stated that &lt;/em&gt;Android Police&lt;em&gt; spotted Jin’s Weibo post. The post was actually found by &lt;/em&gt;Android Authority&lt;em&gt;. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California is suing Walmart over alleged improper disposal of e-waste and other hazardous materials</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Walmart store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vYHQ2OMUWcWXm073Q-hC2zkykTI=/0x43:1000x710/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70320602/Walmart_Store.1419979890.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Walmart store&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zF1xKr"&gt;Last week, the California attorney general and 12 state officials &lt;a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-announces-statewide-lawsuit-against-walmart-illegal"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Walmart, saying it allegedly illegally disposed of electronic and hazardous waste, compromising local landfills.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjdYJ6"&gt;California Attorney General Rob Bonta alleges in a statement the company violated state environmental laws with their practices, and the waste included materials like lithium and alkaline batteries, insect killer sprays, aerosol cans, LED lightbulbs, and more.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FX8Y3Q"&gt;State investigators conducted 58 inspections across 13 counties from 2015 to 2021 and said they found classified hazardous and medical waste in each store’s trash compactors, as well as customer information that should have been rendered indecipherable. The California DOJ estimates that Walmart’s unlawfully disposed waste totals 159,600 pounds or more than 1 million items each year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLvL4M"&gt;“We have met with the state numerous times to walk them through our industry-leading hazardous waste compliance programs in an effort to avoid litigation, but instead, they filed this unjustified lawsuit,” Walmart spokesperson Randy Hargrove said in a statement. “The state is demanding a level of compliance regarding waste disposal from our stores of common house-hold products and other items that goes beyond what is required by law. We intend to defend this company.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sf9kuH"&gt;Hargrove said that the compactor waste audits “conducted or overseen by the California attorney general have shown that the compactor waste contain at most 0.4% of items of potential concern,” comparing it to the 3 percent statewide average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVa9sv"&gt;This is not the first time Walmart has tangled with the state over its alleged waste practices. In 2010, Walmart reached a $25 million settlement with the California attorney general’s office for illegally disposing of hazardous waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXnLod"&gt;Hargrove says the court was “prepared to relieve Walmart of its obligations” from its 2010 settlement, but “the attorney general’s office launched a new investigation with new rules in hope that Walmart would enter another settlement requiring another substantial financial payment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gB1XpA"&gt;The company also paid $1.25 million to Missouri in 2012 for a similar incident and &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/wal-mart-pleads-guilty-federal-environmental-crimes-admits-civil-violations-and-will-pay-more"&gt;pleaded guilty in 2013&lt;/a&gt; for negligently discharging a pollutant into drains in 16 counties in California, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-lawsuits-california-sacramento-hazardous-waste-6ac265da9f2cb150e8a73c7a5cc7e01b"&gt;the&lt;em&gt; Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-walmart-lawsuit-llegal-hazardous-waste-landfills/"&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7Miks"&gt;“Despite repeated enforcements against Walmart over the past two decades, it consistently - and knowingly - fails to comply with California’s environmental protection laws,” director Meredith Williams of the Department of Toxic Substances Control in California said in the press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPybRu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction December 27th,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:25PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story stated that Walmart had to pay a fine of $125 million in 2012. They only had to pay $1.25 million. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B3hUXA"&gt;Zoom has acquired the Zoom-based broadcast tools created by the startup Liminal, along with two of the company's co-founders, the videoconferencing platform announced in &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-future-of-events-expanded-offerings-acquisition-of-liminal-assets/"&gt;a post on its blog&lt;/a&gt;. Liminal’s add-ons, &lt;a href="https://www.liminalet.com/zoomosc"&gt;ZoomOSC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.liminalet.com/zoomiso"&gt;ZoomISO&lt;/a&gt;, are built for creating professional virtual events, which Zoom will likely natively integrate into its software as part of the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2NoM1B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The acquisition will help “bridge” the gap between “emerging” and “traditional” forms of event control tools&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u2Z9QB"&gt;As noted on Liminal’s site, ZoomOSC is designed to enhance professional meetings and events using the Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol, enabling you to integrate Zoom with third-party software, hardware controllers, and media servers. Meanwhile, ZoomISO allows you to export each participants’ video feed as a separate output to professional production hardware, five of which you can choose to output in HD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gtbp3p"&gt;By acquiring these assets from Liminal, Zoom says it will help the platform “bridge” the gap between “emerging” and “traditional” forms of event control tools, which should come in handy for broadcast studios, theaters, and other organizations that want to create professional streams. The platform took the dive into large-scale virtual events when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442919/zoom-live-events-paid-tickets-conferences-chat"&gt;first announced its Events feature&lt;/a&gt; in May and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22585980/zoom-apps-events-launch-onzoom"&gt;officially rolled it out in July&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href="https://events.zoom.us/"&gt;Events&lt;/a&gt;, organizers can create event hubs, sell tickets, and create multiple livestream sessions throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJqMHv"&gt;Zoom spokesperson Candace Dean told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Liminal’s existing tools will remain available through Liminal’s site, however, as Zoom expands on those tools and builds something similar into the platform, there will no longer be a need for them as separate add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toEQ7W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 27th, 3:45PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added a statement from a Zoom spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy XVI’s next big reveal won’t come until spring 2022 after six months of COVID-19 delays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GMOkcdq8HOzu8uvRpMM5TMmdeOY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70320383/Ele1vVZXEAEatX8.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MJTpCq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21438708/final-fantasy-xvi-trailer-ps5-playstation-5-sony"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XVI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the latest game to be hit by COVID-related development delays, with the game’s producer Naoki Yoshida announcing in a letter posted to Twitter that work on the upcoming PlayStation 5 RPG has been set back by about six months. Furthermore, Yoshida announced that the next major reveal for the upcoming title — originally promised for sometime in 2021 — is now being pushed out to sometime in spring 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nom9Zj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="pt" dir="ltr"&gt;A message from Final Fantasy XVI producer Naoki Yoshida. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FF16?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#FF16&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FFXVI?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#FFXVI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/qtfJUUp6LA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qtfJUUp6LA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FINAL FANTASY XVI (@finalfantasyxvi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/finalfantasyxvi/status/1475335618905669635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lMXQnJ"&gt;It’s not too surprising that &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XVI&lt;/em&gt; has been hit by delays. As the first flagship &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; game for a next-generation console, the development process is a massive effort spanning development teams around the world. “In an effort to offset the effects of COVID-19, we’ve had to decentralize that workforce by permitting staff to tackle their assignments from home,” Yoshida’s letter explains. “This has unfortunately hampered communication from the Tokyo office, which, in turn, has led to delays in — or in extreme cases, cancellations of — asset deliveries from our outsource partners.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vjcf9j"&gt;Still, the delay means that what’s already been a long wait for &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; fans eager to see more of the upcoming title will be stretching even longer, especially considering that &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XVI&lt;/em&gt; was first revealed in September 2020, before the PlayStation 5 had even launched. Since that initial reveal, there still hasn’t been a new trailer, any more information on the game, or even an estimated release window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vIESql"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2tBnBAkHv9M?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JO6DvV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV &lt;/em&gt;— the last numbered release in the main series of the franchise — was released over five years ago in November 2016. Square Enix has kept players busy in the interim, though, with more recent releases like &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; and the ongoing expansions for its online MMO, &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; — whose most recently expansion, &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;, is in such high demand that Square Enix had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22839415/final-fantasy-14-sales-suspended-servers-over-capacity-digital-physical"&gt;suspend sales of the games to try to mitigate server queues&lt;/a&gt;. (Yoshida is also the producer and director for &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;, in addition to his work on &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XVI&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvLGMn"&gt;Still, there is hope on the horizon for &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; fans: Yoshida’s letter notes that the team has spent most of 2021 addressing its COVID-related delays and plans to “better focus” on things like improving the game’s graphics, combat mechanics, cutscenes, and more going forward, ahead of its “next big reveal” in spring 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>XPG imagines a gaming mouse that can also store 1TB of games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N6uX6Wt9WSefd-OlDCuX_VUjht8=/0x3:1500x1003/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70320363/xpg_peripheral.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Vault” is an appropriate name.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: XPG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Pqy4f"&gt;XPG &lt;a href="https://www.xpg.com/us/news/960"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; the XPG Vault, a “concept” mouse that has a built-in SSD to let you carry around your mouse and storage in one package (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/xpg-mouse-with-ssd-inside-210055310.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). While lots of gaming mice have some built-in storage to let you easily carry macros and preferences from computer to computer, and the concept of a mouse doubling as a flash drive has &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/usb-storage-mouse-does-double-duty/"&gt;been around for over a decade&lt;/a&gt;, XPG is aiming a little higher. It’s promising “to make your gaming libraries conveniently portable,” right from your mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fW0tVV"&gt;There aren’t many details for the Vault in XPG’s press release, but XPG says the “current prototype can integrate up to 1TB of Solid State memory running at 985MB/s” and connects with USB-C. Given that it’s a wired mouse, that performance seems possible — and it’d imply that you could actually play games stored on the Vault. There’s certainly enough room for a few titles, as long as one of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22302057/call-of-duty-warzone-black-ops-modern-warfare-500gb-size"&gt;isn’t &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oL4DtG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The press release is light on details, but it’s still intriguing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8zcaJA"&gt;However, it’s unclear what other levels of storage are available and if it’ll be upgradable (that seems hard to imagine, but it’s easy to wish for). There’s also no data about the SSD, though it’d probably be a safe bet that it’s made by ADATA, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22851422/samsung-adata-pcie-5-0-ssd-ces-speed-date"&gt;the memory and SSD company&lt;/a&gt; that owns XPG. The press release also doesn’t include any specs that people serious about mousing will care about, like the Vault’s DPI or sensor. The company’s post does, however, also announce the XPG Alpha mouse, which looks a lot like the Vault. That one will use Pixart’s PAW3335 sensor and will have wireless capabilities at the cost of not having built-in storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jv9P6w"&gt;XPG says that visitors to its CES booth will get a “peek” at the Vault, so it’s always possible we’ll hear more details about it soon — it’d be interesting to know how heavy it is, whether you can actually play games off it, if there’s any difference in responsiveness when you’re using the SSD versus when you’re not, etc. Since &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; won’t be doing CES in person this year (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;along with many other companies&lt;/a&gt;), we reached out to XPG to see if we could get any more information and will update if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnkvF7"&gt;Given that this is being billed as a “concept” and “prototype,” it’s possible this is the most we’ll ever hear about this mouse — that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22225459/best-tech-ces-2020-where-are-they-now-what-happened-next"&gt;not exactly uncommon for things announced at CES&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s an interesting idea that doesn’t seem completely improbable; even if XPG doesn’t end up making this exact product, it’s possible we could have a future where you walk up to the LAN party with just your mouse, and that gives you access to all your games. You know, when LAN parties are safe to have again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spyware scandal rocks Polish government</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Polish Politics" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/krNidajv99SY_bnWrQwm3nZREWc=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70320191/1127310221.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Polish opposition leader Krzysztof Brejza | Photo by Mateusz Wlodarczyk/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbJbsw"&gt;Several members of political opposition groups in Poland have produced evidence that they were hacked by Pegasus spyware, raising alarming questions about the Polish government’s use of the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcHthG"&gt;The most alarming case involved the leader of Poland’s Civic Platform party, Senator Krzysztof Brejza, whose phone was compromised a total of 33 times in the six months leading up to the 2019 election, as reported by &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-middle-east-elections-europe-c16b2b811e482db8fbc0bbc37c00c5ab"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. During the campaign, Polish state media published damaging text messages obtained from Brejza’s phone, leading to concerns that spyware had been used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="okQB4p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;a threat to “the rules-based international order”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eZawPy"&gt;The compromises were discovered by Citizen Lab, a spyware research group based at the University of Toronto, which has done extensive work on Pegasus. Citizen Lab previously found evidence linking the Pegasus spyware to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848485/pegasus-spyware-jamal-khashoggi-murder-nso-hanan-elatr-new-analysis"&gt;the killing of Jamal Khashoggi&lt;/a&gt; and a separate campaign &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/10/new-york-times-i-was-hacked-the-spyware-used-against-me-makes-us-all-vulnerable/"&gt;against a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; journalist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuupgV"&gt;In the Polish case, Citizen Lab &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-poland-hacking-warsaw-8b52e16d1af60f9c324cf9f5099b687e"&gt;also found evidence&lt;/a&gt; of spyware compromises targeting a lawyer representing Polish opposition groups and a prosecutor involved in a case against the ruling Law and Justice party. In both cases, traces of Pegasus spyware were found on the targets’ devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygdCZC"&gt;Despite the evidence, the Polish government has steadfastly denied any use of spyware, either for intelligence gathering or domestic surveillance. “The Pegasus system is not used by the Polish services,” the Deputy Defense minister said recently, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-opposition-politician-accuses-government-phone-hack-krzysztof-brejza/"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;Politico Europe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It is not used to follow or investigate anyone in our country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXqYg3"&gt;Still, the scandal is likely to have significant consequences for Poland’s standing in the European Union and build the case for further technical protections against Pegasus. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22798917/apple-nso-group-spyware-pegasus-cybersecurity-research"&gt;In November&lt;/a&gt;, Apple filed a federal lawsuit against NSO Group (which develops and sells Pegasus), seeking a permanent injunction against the company’s use of Apple products and services. Amazon Web Services has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583523/amazon-web-services-bans-nso-group-pegasus-spyware-infrastructure"&gt;blocked all accounts linked with NSO Group&lt;/a&gt;, and the US Treasury Department has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761565/nso-group-pegasus-spyware-entity-list-us-government-human-rights"&gt;moved to block exports or other transactions with the company&lt;/a&gt;, calling it a threat to “the rules-based international order.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deck out your new Oculus Quest 2 with discounted accessories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZkEcKycLv292wsL9QmIPiknPUuY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70320035/akrales_200904_4160_0135.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gNjXUu"&gt;During the Christmas holiday, it was easy to pick up on the theme on Twitter that &lt;em&gt;many &lt;/em&gt;of you either bought or received an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2 virtual reality headset&lt;/a&gt;. Well, in perfect timing, Oculus has discounted many of its official accessories for the Quest 2, which can help to protect your headset, as well as make it more comfortable to wear. We’ve seen promotions that discount these add-ons when you purchase a headset, but never by themselves, so that’s why they’re prominently featured today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnLZic"&gt;Best Buy has the best deal on the Elite Strap that replaces the fabric strap that comes with your Quest 2. It distributes the weight of the headset more evenly on your head, with adjusters on the top and rear of the Elite Strap. Normally $49, it’s just $39 at Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="my6nUQ"&gt;I recently bought one, and I’m about to buy another — not because I love them &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;much, mind you. Based on my experience, they tend to last about a year under normal wear-and-tear, with the plastic side arms eventually breaking. Thankfully, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176820/oculus-quest-2-elite-strap-extended-warranty-quality-problems"&gt;Oculus now offers a two-year warranty on this product&lt;/a&gt;, and the company can replace broken straps free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8EKSeH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10298202"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5nghmP"&gt;I also recommend the Oculus Quest 2 zip-up case, which provides a safe place for your headset and controllers to reside when they aren’t in use. We’re also seeing this product discounted for the first time, from $49 down to $39.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D05JMy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10949359"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cp04YA"&gt;Micro Center retail stores aren’t too common to find in the US, but if you have one near you, you can get the best price on Apple’s new AirPods Pro that offer MagSafe charging. These launched at $249.99, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/643985/apple-airpods-pro-active-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds-with-magsafe-white"&gt;but they’re all the way down to $159.99&lt;/a&gt;. You can reserve a set online at the store closest to you, but you’ll need to actually make the trek to a Micro Center store to pick them up. That might be worth it to some, but don’t fret if it’s a no-go with you. We’re likely to see this deal at other retailers in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Fn5wft"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10934767"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UcMN6Y"&gt;The Microsoft 365 Family plan (one-year, auto-renewing, up to six people) — which gives you access to apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, as well as 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage for each person, and more — is selling for its normal $99.99 cost, but it comes with a complimentary $50 gift card. You’ll receive a digital code for Microsoft 365 Family, but the $50 Amazon gift card will be delivered by mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LBWIAP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10949368"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7NPcy6"&gt;In the latest round of “deals I should have had the patience to wait a few more weeks for,” &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei V&lt;/em&gt; for the Nintendo Switch is down to $34.99 from its normal $59.99 price. This game is often compared to &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s not an unfounded comparison, given that the franchise was spun out of &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niJ5Uj"&gt;You’ll find some similarities, primarily in the turn-based combat, the foes you’re up against, and the fact that they’re both long-lasting RPG adventures. Though, &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei&lt;/em&gt; has a reputation for being more difficult and brooding than &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt;. They’re each great in their own ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h3UEPU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10949375"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Armies, aliens, automobiles, the legendary mascot of the Xbox, and more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GFHxPA"&gt;Getting a new gaming PC is a bit like opening Pandora’s Box when it comes to deciding what to play. With frequent releases on Steam, a never-ending flow of free games on the Epic Games Store, a plethora of indie arthouse games on &lt;a href="http://itch.io"&gt;itch.io&lt;/a&gt;, and countless other launchers and storefronts to install and choose from, it can feel like the Netflix effect of paralysis by choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6gOx5"&gt;So if you got yourself a new PC for the holiday, or even earlier, this list of excellent games released this year is a primer on what to consider. Some may be no-brainers because they are the biggest releases of the last few months, but others should not be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IQNqTf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft rebrands Xbox Game Pass for PC to just PC Game Pass","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22827140/microsoft-pc-game-pass-naming-rebrand"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dnp1IP"&gt;Many titles featured here can be downloaded and played via a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%2Fpc-games&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22803171%2Fgaming-pc-computer-best-games-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PC Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; subscription, the PC version of Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass, while subscribers to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22803171%2Fgaming-pc-computer-best-games-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; get access to games on both Xbox and PC platforms. Whether you prefer to buy each title individually or subscribe to gain access to many, here are our top games with which to initiate your new gaming PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="lpYJYT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/riUhAOaGM7EavFnk8UI7wLk6GRc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23066588/HaloInfinite_Campaign01_3840x2160_WM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite is the sixth installment in the mainline Master Chief saga.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7FtYW"&gt;This may be the most obvious first choice, as it’s arguably the biggest game release of the holidays, but &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s &lt;/em&gt;open world&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;promises to be both a technological test of PC hardware and a compelling title for some throwback solo campaign fun. Combine that with free-to-play online multiplayer that launched early, and &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;is back, baby! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzBI0f"&gt;Now, there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22821522/halo-infinite-campaign-levels-replay-mission-select-343-industries-microsoft"&gt;some oversights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791487/halo-infinite-campaign-co-op-season-2-may-2022-forge"&gt;key features missing at launch&lt;/a&gt;, but there is still a lot to enjoy with &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; in its current form. It hopefully only gets better from here as they eventually expand it with campaign co-op and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816491/halo-infinite-multiplayer-deathmatch-slayer-dedicated-playlist"&gt;continue to grow the multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="mXwXk4"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HeNTbL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ilyRfFzOxJ7w-U4eXC6JQ2Ou9K8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22983830/ForzaHorizon5_Launch_Preview_06_16x9_WM.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5 takes the open-world racer to the lush backdrop of Mexico.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YBXiKW"&gt;What happens when you mix together a ton of cars, Playground Games’ open-world arcade racing franchise, and the beautiful landscape of Mexico? You get the best racing game of 2021, complete with AI Drivatars based on your friends list to challenge you. Part of the fun of &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5 &lt;/em&gt;is you can play it however you want. Looking to embrace its hardcore motorsports side? There are cars and courses for that. Want to take it off-road in the mud and the muck? That’s here, too. Prefer to take it easy and just enjoy driving around? The rewind feature makes it easy to undo any careless errors that could cost you a race. &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5 &lt;/em&gt;makes for a great pick-up-and-play experience, and there’s a lot to experience among all the cars and environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sd8zMC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Forza Horizon 5 is the perfect portable Xbox game","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22762183/forza-horizon-5-perfect-portable-xbox-game-series-x-s-pc-steam"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="ujow7l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911194" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="n123m2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AZGU1D"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inscryption&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENjZLMU-vOM3c2vLD_xEw-5zwRA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22976467/2021_10_27__7_.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inscryption mixes horror tones with a roguelike card game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LmkkLG"&gt;It doesn’t have to be spooky season for you to get into one of the top indie hits of the year. &lt;em&gt;Inscryption &lt;/em&gt;is a horror-themed deck-building card game with a blend of roguelike loop progression. The real trick, though, is how the game keeps changing things on you as the story progresses. We’re not going to get into spoilers here but be prepared for some unexpected turns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4qsXp"&gt;Even if you’re scarcely a fan of card games or escape rooms — even if you just played a couple of games of &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering &lt;/em&gt;as a kid or did one escape room with friends at their peak a few years ago — you should try out &lt;em&gt;Inscryption.&lt;/em&gt; It may not put your PC’s graphics to the test, but if you have a good monitor with quality black levels, you can really immerse yourself in the creepy aesthetic as you play cards and sacrifice little monsters to battle your eery AI opponent hiding in the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="il2ieu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inscryption is part card game, part horror, and all-consuming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22757407/inscryption-review-pc-steam-devolver-digital"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="FNIDfX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911206" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TtCPC3"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qx9cB9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/20RUMuvIuxd5V2ymzgjdtuwqL-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071311/back4blood_thumbnail_05_en_18feb21.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Turtle Rock Studios/Warner Bros. Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood features four-player online co-op with card-based power-ups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dk72TY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood &lt;/em&gt;is the spiritual successor to the &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead &lt;/em&gt;franchise of four-player co-op zombie shooters. It not only carries a similarly styled title but also maintains some of the original &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead&lt;/em&gt; developers of Turtle Rock Studios. Now, &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt; merges the classic, co-operative FPS action of &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead &lt;/em&gt;with a modern take on power-ups based around a card system. The cards make each session feel a bit different, keeping you on your toes as you mow down hordes of zombies and have to adapt to what fate draws you. Aside from the cards, the weapons and quip-filled characters are the stars of the show. Get yourself three friends to team up with and blast zombie after zombie until you’ve had your fill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rMI3Dz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911258" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9qGP21"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zMIjgw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oW8AwG7MYgxc9murgnGf7F5WIog=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22432857/aoe4_campaign_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV is the latest installment for the RTS series that first started in 1997.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xCZV09"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires &lt;/em&gt;series is old enough to be past its college life and struggling through a middling job while living in a crummy apartment, but &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV &lt;/em&gt;is a captivating new sequel that feels just like its roots. Anyone who has played a classic RTS before will be right at home here, though judging by conversations in &lt;em&gt;The Verge S&lt;/em&gt;lack channels, that home is a very addictive one. &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV &lt;/em&gt;expertly scratches that itch for base building, troop placement, and massive battles. The campaigns are quite dense, but be sure to try playing as the Mongols for a new twist on the old formula — with hit-and-run tactics and mobility being the new keys to the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pZTWMm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The team behind Age of Empires IV wants you to learn history while playing the game","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22375911/age-of-empires-4-history-lesson-documentary-footage-music-languages"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="Rjudy3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911271" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="sLTouM"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NGJkHL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death’s Door&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gkJZFKban6KfuQCebNRG7zaHzb8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071321/ss_dd9b5a2e40d3d512d1c978a5dfda5999c458a517.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acid Nerve/Devolver Digital&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death’s Door is an isometric souls-like action RPG with highly stylized artwork.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gUeM6Y"&gt;There is no prettier game from 2021 than &lt;em&gt;Death’s Door. &lt;/em&gt;It’s enough of a joy just to look at, with a lush world that’s beautifully animated, but the gameplay feels part-&lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt;, part-&lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt;, and all-satisfying when in action. The Nintendo Switch release just came out last month, but playing it on a PC to ensure the visuals are as juiced up as possible does wonders to make this lovely virtual space as immersive and captivating as can be. Don’t sleep on this indie hit. It’s a great way to spend a dozen or so hours of your time, and come on — the protagonist crow is just &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; dang cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vkV74z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911277" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="2B32MV"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5iIxGo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hot Wheels: Unleashed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iRPMrz0XV7HwdTcplFkYBdbp15g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071342/hotwheelsunleashedsteam.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Milestone S.r.l.&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hot Wheels Unleashed supersizes the stunt toy racers with a sense of speed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nR6e0o"&gt;Imagine you’re a kid again and given an unlimited budget to build and race the zaniest Hot Wheels track you could possibly imagine. Now, even better, you’re an adult, and instead of tying up all your money and floor space in plastic tracks and 1:64 scale die-cast metal cars, you can play &lt;em&gt;Hot Wheels: Unleashed.&lt;/em&gt; But before you write this off as a kids’ video game, you must see the dedication the developers at Milestone put into all these toy car models. There are 60 cars for you to collect and race, with each one lovingly rendered down to its tiny toy details, with visible vehicle damage that looks a whole lot like the way actual Hot Wheels develop wear and tear. Add those visual stylings to the high-speed racing with split-screen support, and you have a fun arcade racer that looks and plays great on a high-end PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MOiS99"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911302" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="dV6a1b"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Lr8Tfd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aliens: Fireteam Elite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z2Zxo96oYZuhR5KYR1Q-EFk8SiY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071353/Aliens_Fireteamelitesteam.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Cold Iron Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien: Fireteam Elite is a co-op third-person shooter pitting players against the iconic xenomorphs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LnKuyH"&gt;If a game like &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt; sounds appealing for its co-op chops, but you feel that zombies are a bit tired, check out &lt;em&gt;Aliens: Fireteam Elite. &lt;/em&gt;This is a three-player, third-person shooter pitting you against the xenomorphs of the storied &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt; franchise lore. There’s a touch of RPG passive buffs to choose in your class loadouts, but in the end, it’s alien-shooting fun with friends. Keep your comms open and your tactics tight because these acid-blooded monsters like to swarm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XzYNhg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911305" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="LPOWbO"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="z64Chc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychonauts 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LPfMy7N2dLlfehhBNYXcnxPiy9M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071362/5dd4d822_32ae_40e1_866c_b018d7a3db57.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Double Fine Productions/Xbox Game Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychonauts 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the original Xbox title from 2005.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="scfyZW"&gt;Few games have had such critical acclaim and fan anticipation for a sequel as the original &lt;em&gt;Psychonauts&lt;/em&gt;. Now, 16 years later, the classic Double Fine action-adventure game finally gets its follow-up. Just like the original, &lt;em&gt;Psychonauts 2 &lt;/em&gt;is brimming with charm, excellent voice acting, and fun writing that, while lighthearted, also tackles some deeply personal themes. It feels a bit like an older game, for better and worse, but with a fantastical-level design that is supremely unique. &lt;em&gt;Psychonauts 2 &lt;/em&gt;takes you on a journey of joyous platforming and thought-provoking empathy. Don’t pass this one up, especially if you already have a subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VuIPjE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911364" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fnULgB"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CNDXmK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boomerang X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_NxWPrBw8usIxNAFLuCmtnaAg1M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071371/EoZqGlAXMAEDA6O.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DANG!/Devolver Digital&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boomerang X is a single-player first-person arena action game focusing on movement and speed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bDP9WA"&gt;Few games exhibit a sense of speed and agility quite like &lt;em&gt;Boomerang X.&lt;/em&gt; The first-person action game is all about maintaining momentum as you fly around arenas by way of your character’s thrown boomerang. Throw it at enemies to slice them up, then vault towards it for aerial combos reminiscent of the visceral mid-air stunts of old &lt;em&gt;Quake&lt;/em&gt; rocket jumps. The visual style and lighting of &lt;em&gt;Boomerang X &lt;/em&gt;ensure that each arena is fun to explore, and the enemies keep it fresh and challenging. While &lt;em&gt;Boomerang X &lt;/em&gt;is also available on Nintendo Switch, I believe playing it with a mouse and keyboard is the better experience. You get more pinpoint control, and it truly feels like a shooter of a bygone era with very fresh ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Umurangi Generation is a post-apocalyptic first-person photography game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CGnxjt"&gt;OK, so I cheated a little. &lt;em&gt;Umurangi Generation &lt;/em&gt;first&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;came out in 2020, not 2021. But double-check that headline and do the math — consider this just an added bonus because I cannot pass up any opportunity to recommend &lt;em&gt;Umurangi Generation &lt;/em&gt;and its &lt;em&gt;Macro &lt;/em&gt;DLC to anyone. The Nintendo Switch version did come out in 2021, but while it does feature new tilt controls, I believe it’s worth playing this excellent indie darling on a PC for the best representation of its awesome visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATEN5j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Umurangi Generation &lt;/em&gt;is a first-person photography game that drips with style and weaves an excellent narrative through environmental storytelling. Enjoy its vibrant aesthetic, expansive photographic camera controls, and fantastic soundtrack by ThorHighHeels — all while the sense of dread sets in from its post-apocalyptic world. Remember, even if you don’t want to watch the world burn, you don’t have a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
