    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qCJ8dI"&gt;Two new reports from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/google-video-game-unit-stadia-struggled-to-be-googley-enough"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-stadia-games-entertainment-collapse/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have shed light on some of Google’s failures in building its Stadia cloud gaming service. The reports come just a few weeks after Google announced it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;shutting down&lt;/a&gt; its in-house Stadia game development studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9phj6A"&gt;One key issue, according to &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, is that Google may not have put as much investment in its internal studios as its much-hyped plans for Stadia may have suggested. Stadia chief Phil Harrison announced Google’s Stadia Games and Entertainment studios at the Game Developers Conference in 2019, when Google made its first big splash with Stadia. However, according to &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, “it would be months until Google would actually hire the bulk of” the studio’s developers&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Google’s goal was to hire 2,000 people over the course of five years to make Stadia games, &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jA9pH2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stadia employees said the tech felt like a beta&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0330AM"&gt;When Stadia first launched, my colleague Sean Hollister said it was “still just a beta” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel"&gt;right in the headline&lt;/a&gt;. And apparently, Stadia developers agreed: “Stadia employees shared the concern that the technology felt like a beta at launch,” according to &lt;em&gt;Wired. &lt;/em&gt;Although Stadia worked — in that it could stream games from the cloud to a PC or phone — it was still missing many features that were shown off in its pre-launch marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzOAmF"&gt;Two sources also told &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; that Stadia “did not meet internal expectations in 2020.” That’s backed up by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, which reported Google missed Stadia targets for “sales of controllers and monthly active users by hundreds of thousands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXRICs"&gt;If you’ve been following Stadia, that may not be all that surprising — my colleague Tom Warren found Stadia to be a lonely place &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21252200/google-stadia-cross-play-games-lonely-venue"&gt;back in May&lt;/a&gt; — but it seems &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/19/21572301/cyberpunk-2077-google-stadia-free-premiere-kit-preorder-deal"&gt;even&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558820/youtube-premium-subscribers-free-stadia-premiere-edition-bundle-deals"&gt;promotions&lt;/a&gt; for free Stadia Premiere kits weren’t enough to help Google meet its goals for Stadia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEILEH"&gt;Google also attempted to attract users to Stadia by making deals with publishers for ports of tentpole games like &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;in the tens of millions of dollars&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; reports &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1365376842765651970"&gt;according to Jason Schreier&lt;/a&gt;, the author of the &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; story, Google apparently spent tens of millions &lt;em&gt;per port&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SsbQIK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just to reiterate the absurdity of this thing: Sources say Google spent tens of millions of dollars -- the budgets of some major games -- PER Stadia port. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Publishers like Ubisoft and Take-Two were raking it in&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1365376842765651970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nnfJ1x"&gt;I highly encourage you to read both &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-stadia-games-entertainment-collapse/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/google-video-game-unit-stadia-struggled-to-be-googley-enough"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports about Stadia’s struggles. For now, Stadia will continue to exist as a platform, even though Google won’t be making games for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JNXwIa"&gt;In a blog about the studio closures, Harrison also said that Google has an “increased focus on using our technology platform for industry partners,” which could suggest that Google may offer Stadia as a white-label cloud gaming service to other companies. But with studio closures and these two reports, it’s hard not to feel that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option"&gt;writing’s on the wall for Google Stadia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Texans with disabilities left vulnerable after deep freeze</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ebLPqX4qLRK1TJLmOf9B8LBnZs=/0x54:1280x907/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68881650/JPEG_image_5EB6C756773A_1_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Volunteers with the Living Hope Wheelchair Association distributed water and supplies to people after Texas’ deep freeze.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Living Hope Wheelchair Association&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LFzirL"&gt;Disaster response plans often fail to include people with disabilities, and the deadly deep freeze that swept across Texas and much of the mainland US last week was no exception. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WP2d89"&gt;“A lot of people in our community, they’re like, ‘I’m so damn tired that I have to be resilient. This isn’t our fault,’” says Tomás Aguilar, disaster recovery coordinator for the &lt;a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/the-work-is-all-of-us/"&gt;Living Hope Wheelchair Association in Houston&lt;/a&gt;, a group that provides services to immigrants with disabilities. “No, we don’t need a cheerleader. We need water.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S0R4xX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We don’t need a cheerleader. We need water.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OIDtFT"&gt;The winter storms that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287130/texas-natural-gas-production-power-outages-frozen"&gt;froze up power&lt;/a&gt; and water systems last week left a humanitarian disaster in its wake. First, people were left in the brutal cold without power or heat. Then came the shortage of food supplies and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299302/texas-freeze-well-water-frozen-pipes-contamination"&gt;clean drinking water&lt;/a&gt;. As has happened before, the crises hit people with disabilities and &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/02/18/texas-snowstorm-endangers-people-chronic-illnesses-disabilities/6799170002/"&gt;chronic illnesses&lt;/a&gt; especially hard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qROL4z"&gt;In one harrowing example, more than 100 residents of an Austin retirement community went two days without power and little food after its generator failed on February 15th. Staff at the high-rise facility for low-income people who are older or disabled ran up and down 16 flights of stairs to check in on residents and ration out food, the &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/17/texas-power-outage-100-stranded/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Texas Tribune reported&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Losing power can be especially isolating and dangerous for people who use electric wheelchairs or who rely on electronic medical devices like feeding tube pumps. When emergency responders arrived on February 17th, they had to carry residents out who wanted to be evacuated.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x01Iyv"&gt;As Texans’ food and water dwindled across the state because of storm-related disruptions, Aguilar says people who use wheelchairs had an even harder time getting supplies than people without disabilities. People with spinal cord injuries can have a more difficult time regulating their body temperature, making it difficult for them to brave the cold to line up at grocery stores or food banks. People who rely on paratransit services to get around can have a harder time lining up for supplies, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGe8De"&gt;“Are you going to get in line with the hundreds of cars in line already with that paratransit service? They’re not going to do that,” Aguilar says. His group has been filling five-gallon jugs with water from the organization’s sink to bring to people without water.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="9Bvu7E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These kinds of struggles aren’t new&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SQp6bO"&gt;These kinds of struggles aren’t new. During Hurricane Harvey in 2017, people with disabilities were &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/08/22/did-state-registry-help-people-disabilities-during-harvey/"&gt;left waiting&lt;/a&gt; in floodwaters for emergency responders who could accommodate their wheelchairs. One photo of people sitting in waist-deep water in an assisted living facility in Dickinson, Texas, &lt;a href="https://www.galvnews.com/news/free/article_e1ffff8e-435d-5c78-ab46-57d6bc7dc6a5.html"&gt;went viral&lt;/a&gt; after Harvey.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgootN"&gt;These problems are also not exclusive to Texas. Nearly a decade ago, after Hurricane Sandy, some New Yorkers with disabilities were left stranded in their homes. &lt;a href="https://grist.org/article/5-years-after-sandy-this-woman-still-worries-about-being-left-behind-because-of-her-disability/"&gt;One woman&lt;/a&gt; spent six days in her apartment without power, heat, or running water. She spent much of that time in bed after her electric wheelchair ran out of juice. A bus actually arrived to evacuate people at her public housing building at one point, but she couldn’t get to it — and even if she had, it wasn’t equipped to accommodate a wheelchair. After surviving the storm, she became a staunch advocate for more inclusive disaster response programs. But five years later, her building still hadn’t installed one of the simple fixes she pushed for: an evacuation chair that allows people to get down stairs even when the power is out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBwzrM"&gt;It is unacceptable that so many years later, similar stories keep playing out. The blackout could have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288292/texas-grid-upgrade-disaster-planning-power-outage-energy-crisis"&gt;prevented by investing in making the grid&lt;/a&gt; — not people — more resilient. Similarly, the struggles that people with disabilities faced during the crisis could also have been avoided by some simple changes to planning and infrastructure. Back-up generators and &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/mopd/resources/considerations-for-purchasing-an-evacuation-devise-for-use-in-your-building.page"&gt;evacuation chairs&lt;/a&gt; could be installed in buildings where people with disabilities live. Emergency shelters could make sure to incorporate accessible bathrooms into their design and provide access to &lt;a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/A-fight-to-survive-Deep-freeze-imperiled-15966710.php"&gt;medical treatments like dialysis&lt;/a&gt;. And emergency response vehicles should be made more accessible so that people can get on them with their wheelchairs or other mobility aids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="knjDqY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;All it takes to find solutions is more room at decision-making tables for people with disabilities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i0dJdV"&gt;All it takes to find those solutions is more room at decision-making tables for people with disabilities. Plenty of groups similar to Aguilar’s are pushing for change. There’s the Partnership for Inclusive Disaster Strategies, which has a &lt;a href="https://disasterstrategies.org/"&gt;disaster hotline&lt;/a&gt;. There are also &lt;a href="https://www.ada.gov/emerprepguideprt.pdf"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; from the Department of Justice on how to ensure emergency preparedness and response programs comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h6uuEX"&gt;“Vulnerable communities, the elderly, folks with disabilities — when everyone gets hit, they always get hit harder,” Aguilar says. “But it’s totally preventable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Krb7Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXNvrH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to import your passwords to Apple’s iCloud Keychain via Safari</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OsVjsU6G0bj8eULNx5anaZKbU_U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68881473/acastro_200207_3900_Safari_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6H1EGD"&gt;If you’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295354/lastpass-export-delete-bitwarden-1password-zoho"&gt;moving from LastPass&lt;/a&gt; (or another password manager you’re dissatisfied with), you may be tempted to simply go with the password manager that comes with your browser or operating system. It’s certainly an easy solution, and a reasonable one, depending on your point of view. Until recently, third-party password managers were known to be more secure, but Apple and Google have been working to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21299007/google-password-checkup-security"&gt;make their built-in password managers more secure&lt;/a&gt;, while Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178026/microsoft-authenticator-autofill-feature-password-manager"&gt;adding one to its authenticator app&lt;/a&gt;. So it could be a viable choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIrfb8"&gt;One way, however, that these built-in password managers don’t stand up to their independent competitors is how tricky it can be to get preexisting passwords into their systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUIylU"&gt;If you tend to hang out in the Apple ecosystem, that means using Safari for your passwords and passing them to your other devices using Apple’s iCloud Keychain. Here’s how to move your password data into iCloud Keychain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3iaobb"&gt;Make sure you have Keychain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNYrDD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204085"&gt;iCloud Keychain&lt;/a&gt; is how Apple syncs your information across devices — not just passwords, but also credit card info, Wi-Fi passwords, etc. If you haven’t used it, you may want to check to make sure it’s been set up and turned on. (If you plan to use your passwords on your mobile iOS device as well, you might want to check it there, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GU1kSS"&gt;Using a macOS device:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zZK5R8"&gt;Go to your System Preferences app by clicking on the Apple icon in the upper-left corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jNZy3y"&gt;If you have macOS Mojave or earlier, click iCloud. Otherwise, select Apple ID &amp;gt; iCloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TLKOau"&gt;Go down the list of apps, and make sure that Keychain is checked &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Make sure you have iCloud Keychain." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tNQ8XHABWmxZWhs-w0blzpKxbkc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331105/Screen_Shot_2021_02_25_at_10.36.30_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make sure you have iCloud Keychain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jV8VG5"&gt;Using an iOS device:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="De2zIJ"&gt;Go to Settings and tap on your name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bRyrHO"&gt;Tap on iCloud and scroll down to Keychain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="800PQp"&gt;If Keychain is Off, tap on the entry and then toggle it on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Kb9IsI"&gt;Import your password data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xIrUC1"&gt;In order to get your data into Keychain, you need to import it into Safari on your Mac. Simple, right? Well, not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UA0cnx"&gt;Unfortunately, unlike most password managers, you can’t import passwords from a CSV file into Safari. You can, however, import passwords from either &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;. So if you’ve got a CSV file from another password manager and you don’t have either of those browsers on your machine, you’ll have to install one of them first and upload your passwords into it. (You can find instructions for importing passwords into Chrome &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/96816?hl=en"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and Firefox &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/import-login-data-file"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01WRVq"&gt;Once your passwords have been imported into one of the other browsers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="j5DCbg"&gt;Close the other browser &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zVLYAs"&gt;Open Safari, go to File &amp;gt; Import From, and choose Chrome or Firefox. You can import Bookmarks, History, Passwords, or any combination thereof by checking the appropriate boxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lkiN5Eirfi3wWaQhNw9rrpOWui8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331032/Screen_Shot_2021_02_25_at_12.13.11_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rZkMJ0"&gt;One note: I had a series of mishaps trying to import from Firefox into Safari. Safari would invariably crash, even after I made a series of tweaks to Firefox. I finally gave up and tried it with Chrome, and the import worked immediately. Your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ophEl"&gt;You can check to see if the import worked by going to Safari’s top menu and selecting Safari &amp;gt; Preferences &amp;gt; Passwords. (You’ll have to enter your user password to access the password list.) You should see your passwords listed there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zEbW2"&gt;Once you’ve imported your passwords into Safari, they should be automatically picked up by iCloud Keychain and useable across all your approved devices. You can check by typing and clicking on “Keychain Access” using Spotlight Search. That should bring up your Keychain app; you can click on iCloud in the top-left column and “Passwords” in the bottom left to see your imported passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You should find your passwords in Keychain Access (for obvious reasons, some data has been grayed out)." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Shn_5X1oR9y7TNc1-nnx92oReE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331082/Screen_Shot_2021_02_26_at_11.41.24_AM__1_.png"&gt;

  &lt;p id="PZkbd2"&gt;Henrik Fisker has abandoned his electric vehicle startup’s effort to create a solid-state battery, the Fisker Inc. founder told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a recent interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtjU4I"&gt;“It’s the kind of technology where, when you feel like you’re 90 percent there, you’re almost there, until you realize the last 10 percent is much more difficult than the first 90,” he said. “So we have completely dropped solid-state batteries at this point in time because we just don’t see it materializing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hhH4X3"&gt;Fisker spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in late January, though a lot has happened since then — most notably, the startup announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298878/foxconn-fisker-ev-electric-vehicle-wisconsin-deal-fsr-suv"&gt;a partnership with iPhone-maker Foxconn&lt;/a&gt;. The two companies plan to make an electric vehicle that Fisker says will cost much less than the $37,500 base price tag of its first EV, the Ocean SUV. Fisker &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/foxconn-to-build-cars-for-electric-vehicle-startup-fisker-11614169530?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;told&lt;em&gt; The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the vehicle may even be built at Foxconn’s troublesome Wisconsin facility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iTgHVd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We just don’t see it materializing.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RJQzU2"&gt;Fisker’s decision to axe the solid-state program comes after his startup spent its first few years working to develop the technology. In 2018, he said the company had solved some of the problems related to making solid-state batteries, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/16/17695866/henrik-fisker-solid-state-batteries-electric-cars"&gt;that it was just a few months away from a final design&lt;/a&gt;. By early 2019, though, the startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/18/18270350/henrik-fisker-electric-suv-karma-emotion-delayed"&gt;postponed a planned sports car that was based on the solid-state technology&lt;/a&gt; and pivoted to the Ocean, which uses a more common lithium-ion battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKaCCe"&gt;Around that time, Fisker Inc. settled a trade secret lawsuit with Volkswagen-backed battery startup QuantumScape in 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/21355123/fisker-quantumscape-lawsuit-trade-secret-solid-state-batteries-fsr-qs"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; this week. QuantumScape discovered one of its employees brought thousands of documents with her to a new job at Fisker Inc. in late 2018 and early 2019, though the EV startup argued that it never used the information and swiftly fired the researcher. Fisker Inc. ultimately paid $750,000 to settle the case. The man who ran the project is also no longer with the company and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/21355123/fisker-quantumscape-lawsuit-trade-secret-solid-state-batteries-fsr-qs"&gt;is suing Fisker Inc. over his departure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1Gxo1"&gt;Solid-state batteries haven’t been much of a focus during Fisker’s many media appearances in the time since he unveiled the Ocean. But he’s never been more clear. “I think personally, they’re at least seven years out, if not more, in terms of any sort of high-volume format,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xyYau9"&gt;Fisker Inc.’s trouble with solid-state batteries hasn’t stopped its momentum. It was one of the first EV startups to ride the wave of special purpose acquisition company (or SPAC) mergers into becoming publicly traded — and it raised &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/27/2115142/0/en/SPARTAN-AND-FISKER-EXPECT-CASH-TO-EXCEED-1-0-BILLION-FOLLOWING-TRANSACTION-CLOSING.html"&gt;around $1 billion in cash&lt;/a&gt; in the process. It struck a deal with leading automotive supplier Magna to build the Ocean. And while a deal to use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349464/fisker-volkswagen-vw-ev-platform-deal-spaq-spac-spartan"&gt;Volkswagen’s electric vehicle platform has fallen through&lt;/a&gt;, Fisker Inc. shared this week that it’s still in talks with the German automaker on a parts supply agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Ntncr"&gt;Deals like those are crucial for Fisker Inc.’s survival, which is trying to make it as a truly asset-light automaker. The startup plans to outsource nearly everything with its cars and will instead focus on design and customer relations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qU2ggd"&gt;In the interview, Fisker spoke about his reasoning behind that business model, as well as why merging with a SPAC was an easy decision, before explaining why he walked away from solid-state batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mo32ho"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly condensed and edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICS6da"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was it that drew you to wanting to go through one of these mergers, and what did you like about it as a tool to bring Fisker to the public markets &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etgRvd"&gt;Basically, I’m pretty much one of the few people [taking an EV startup public via SPAC], maybe the only one, who’s started a car company before. And that was, of course, in the early days. But one of the big hindrances in the path toward your first production vehicle and getting revenue is financing. And you know if you remember both Fisker [Automotive, Fisker’s first startup] and Tesla back in the day had many private financing rounds, and there was always delays. So we decided really to wait for the right moment where we could get enough money in one go to finance our entire program all the way to production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qM3L40"&gt;So when the SPAC opportunity emerged and we saw we could raise over a billion dollars in cash, which was enough to get our vehicle on the road, this was just the perfect opportunity because now I don’t have to worry about going out and raising money every three months, and how the markets will look, if there’s going to be delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqZciN"&gt;So we are on time, on budget on our vehicle, and that’s because we have already raised all the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gw0eNE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was there ever sort of commiseration or conversations among the people in the industry that you’re in, particularly executives at EV startups trying to make a name for themselves, about the difficulty, or the process in general, of trying to raise money? And how that changed so quickly with this SPAC stuff? I would imagine that it must have felt like a very strange moment but a very great opportunity at the same time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPQEZq"&gt;Yeah, talking to just a few people in the industry, I think everybody’s aware that what’s unique about the automotive industry is that you need several hundred million dollars every time you move a certain milestone. It’s just very, very difficult to convince private investors to go through all of these milestones, all hundreds of millions. And I think in the meantime, what SPACs have really done is replaced Silicon Valley as a funding tool for capital-intensive industries like automotive, EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="fntdBH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What SPACs have really done is replaced Silicon Valley as a funding tool”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qEH9xG"&gt;So I think when this opportunity happened, it was just a clear decision right from the go. We didn’t have any doubt. We were obviously one of the early ones that came out, but now there’s been a ton of other SPACs and EV companies [merging]. Obviously, it doesn’t change the fact that you still have to develop and deliver a vehicle, and you still have to be as tight with the money as you can because in the automotive industry, you can burn through hundreds of millions very fast. Those fundamentals are changing, but if you start out with a billion dollars, it’s a lot better than starting out with maybe $50 or $100 million in private funding because that doesn’t get you very far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLrSBY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’d imagine one way you try to prevent burning through that money really fast is by architecting this asset-light business model that you have. And one thing I’m really curious about, because I know I’ve spoken to you a little bit about it before, is: what was the reception as you started trying to find the right SPAC to merge with, and then also working with additional follow-on investors? What were their reactions to that business model? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRPEYO"&gt;Well, I think that was really what attracted a lot of the investors. Specifically, I think we have maybe slightly more sophisticated investors than some other SPACs. You know if you TK613 outside the car industry, it’s very easy to say “Why don’t you just do that?” I have people on Twitter saying, “Why don’t you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.” Most people don’t understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don’t understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bdmiqc"&gt;What our business plan is really based on is the philosophy that the automotive industry has not fundamentally changed its way of doing business for the last 100 years. And we took this opportunity to say, “Okay, it’s not just about making an electric car.” You want to look at two other fundamentals. One is, what if we were to create an automotive company today from scratch and think about what’s the right business model rather than just following the old one. That was one. And the second part was how would we truly interact with the customer, and what is the customer’s expectation, and what does the future customer look like? How would we create the real commercial side of it as the vehicle gets delivered to the customer even before? So that became that whole digital model, which started before COVID and has now accelerated during COVID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ra6DFd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In the automotive industry, you can burn through hundreds of millions very fast”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aOkQlw"&gt;And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that’s going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there’s nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn’t have any brand value anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I451vm"&gt;So therefore, we’ve decided to follow this way of looking for partners for platform sharing, and we’re not only looking for one partner; we’re talking to many different groups because we’re looking at making different vehicles. So we are not necessarily just going to have one partner. And of course, we announced our first partner, which is the world’s third-largest supplier, which is Magna. We’re co-developing a platform with them that is being used also by another OEM, so we immediately have the volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lOMDE"&gt;And we also decided to have Magna manufacture our vehicle because we didn’t feel like taking a risk and going through what other people are calling “manufacturing hell,” as you know. And I think it’s very, maybe a little bit ignorant if you think you can build a factory in the desert, hire people, develop the car, and build a brand-new vehicle, and think you’re going to build it as good as Volkswagen or Toyota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="ybf4mh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We didn’t feel like taking a risk and going through what other people are calling ‘manufacturing hell’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XEfJx1"&gt;So we did that deal with Magna, which has already built Toyotas and BMWs, so we know we’re going to get a high-quality car right out of the gate, so we took that risk out. And I think our investors really appreciate that because they’ve seen other EV companies fail when they got to that point, or they’re seeing them spend much more money than they thought, so I think that fundamental de-risking really attracted our investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksBBrS"&gt;And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we’re going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don’t have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2ZB79"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the trade-offs of this business model? Is there something you just have to give up in the name of going after this partnership / asset-light business model that you could have if you tried to do more of it yourself? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bcXpJa"&gt;I don’t think at this point as a startup there is any trade-off. Now obviously, we will look different in five or seven years from now when we have revenue and we have several vehicles on the road. At that point, we can decide to do more of the stuff for ourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3DJNF"&gt;But it’s just like asking a 10-year-old kid “What is the trade-off of living at home versus getting your own apartment?” Well, if you don’t have any money for your own apartment, and you’re not a certain age, you probably can’t even get the apartment, and you’re not going to be able to pay for it. So we’re kind of taking the approach that, as a startup, we are in growth mode and we have no revenue, so therefore we are taking what we believe is the absolute correct approach to get our first vehicle to market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLyuOp"&gt;Let’s see what happens after that. We have a whole bunch of plans that we are maybe not ready to discuss right now. But for sure we’re going to evolve as a business. And certain things are going to change and adapt to the conditions of the market, the conditions of where we are as a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="To1woV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You spoke about the deal with Magna, and it sounds like you are having, or are at least happy with conversations with other potential partners on the platform side of things. What happened with the talks with Volkswagen in the middle of last year? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RRHQK"&gt;Well, you know we’re constantly in talks with many different partners, and we don’t really want to comment on any of these talks until they materialize. And there’s a common understanding between the partners. So at this point, I don’t want to comment on any potential talks that we have with any partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAC6IR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One thing I think is interesting about SPAC mergers is that, while they’re a great tool for going public faster, one quirk about them is they’re not regulated in quite the same way as if you were just going public in the traditional way, and one of the consequences of that is that startups have a little bit more freedom in their projections. They can tell what they think is probably a better story to investors than if they were going [public] the more traditional route. I’m curious, do you feel you were overly optimistic in the pitch you were making to investors? Or do you feel like what you presented is a really reasonable case for your business moving forward? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQmOh5"&gt;My view is that when you present a projection that is two or three years out, you have a group of people who are trying to make the absolutely best projection, and it is at the end of the day a projection. I don’t think there’s any difference, at least for Fisker — I have no idea what other SPACs and other companies are doing, and I know there’s been some exciting stories out there about some other SPACs — but I’d say from Fisker’s point of view, and what we’re doing in our company, there would be no difference whether we would do a normal IPO or a SPAC or a private financing. We are making the same projections, and those are projections, at this point, we stand by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SD41NU"&gt;Of course, you never know what’s going to happen in the future. Nobody could have predicted COVID. There were a lot of established car companies that were going to launch a whole bunch of cars last year and were all postponed, and had projected they were going to launch these cars and sell a certain amount of cars. So I don’t think it matters what type of company you are. Everybody can run into certain unforeseen things that you simply cannot plan for. But our projections were not different whether we would have done a normal IPO, private financing, or what we’re doing here as a SPAC. And by the way, now we are public, and we are now set to the same standards of any other public company, no matter how they became public.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Henrik Fisker stands in front of the EMotion luxury sports car — which was supposed to use solid-state batteries — &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/9/16867184/fisker-emotion-electric-luxury-car-lidar-autonomous-ces-2018" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jpPjmX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things I know you were working on in the early days of the company, and especially when you were working on the sports car, was trying to get solid-state batteries into the vehicle. And I know that when you turned your attention to the Ocean that was something that changed as far as a company priority. When you talk about these subsequent vehicles you have planned now and potential different platform partners, is solid-state technology what you are considering? And if so, is it coming from the same technological path that you were already on, or is it something you would have to start anew in those vehicles? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONtHwf"&gt;So we spent a lot of time, several years, doing research in solid-state batteries. And it’s kind of a technology where when you feel like you’re 90 percent there, you’re almost there, until you realize the last 10 percent is much more difficult than the first 90. But you don’t really know that until you get up to the 90 percent. So as we got toward the end of this — or let’s put it, as we got close to understanding fully this technology, we realized that it was much more difficult than we had predicted and expected in the beginning as we were very excited about some of the early things we were doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="udgLPx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Solid-state batteries are still very, very far out”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w8zHEL"&gt;But we eventually came to the conclusion, I think it was probably end of 2019, beginning of ‘20, I forget exactly, that solid-state batteries are still very, very far out, they’re not around the corner. I think personally, they’re at least seven years out, if not more, in terms of any sort of high-volume format. Because you need to ... once you have a breakthrough in that technology, you need probably three years to set up high-volume manufacturing, and then you need another three years to do durability testing. So even if somebody invented it today, it would be at least probably six years out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcGtDV"&gt;So we have completely dropped solid-state batteries at this point in time because we just don’t see it materializing. Would we do something in the future? If we do, it would be something completely new, and we obviously have a battery team that’s looking at the current technology that’s here. But the solid-state battery that we worked on, that just doesn't have a future at this point in time in the near future. And I don’t see us continuing with that particular development at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fbX5Zw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know there was a lawsuit that was settled with QuantumScape, and I know settlements usually preclude talking about any of that, but is there anything you can say as to whether whatever dispute you may have had with that company was something that played into this walkaway from solid-state batteries? Or was it really just a technological decision?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbPrYJ"&gt;So as you just mentioned, a settlement precludes you from speaking about it. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eG6iI7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about something that you probably would like to talk about. One of the things I thought was pretty funny in the S-1 you filed with the SEC is that it says outright that you want to really be an engaging presence on Twitter, and you want to make potential customers feel that they’re hearing from you and your voice — as opposed to how like, Mary Barra uses it at GM. And I’m wondering how you see yourself as a person who is running this company who is also engaging with potential customers in this particular way? Because Elon Musk aside, it’s not something we really see all that often.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6IDUy"&gt;Yeah, I love this personal interaction. I think it’s something unique. And it gives me the opportunity to answer people directly from my heart because I run the company, and they get the real answer. I think there’s sort of a great dual conversation. I can obviously not answer everybody’s question, but for instance, we went a step further, and we have this sort of program for referrals. And what we did was we said the two people with the most leads, I’ll do a half-hour zoom with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YUclVi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You get hammered on Twitter, people don’t like you. But hey, that’s life.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JKVrdq"&gt;And the interesting thing was the number two guy was a guy from Kentucky, just a really nice person that I would never ever have met. And there was no preselection or anything. He just happened to have the most referrals, which surprised me as well because I would have thought it would’ve been somebody from California because that’s where we have most of the reservations from. But the long story short was he had all of these questions and interesting things to talk about that I would never have heard from anybody unless you just truly sit down and talk with a real customer. And I think that’s an advantage we have that I would never give up. Because normal car companies, they have to go through the dealers and do all kinds of other things where they never really get to talk to the customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8R5kv"&gt;There’s some good with it. Of course, you also get the bad. You get hammered on Twitter, people don’t like you. But hey, that’s life, and I think there’s more of an upside than a downside. And I really like to be able to interact with the people and get their straightforward questions, and I give them straightforward answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dXKogN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Henrik Fisker explains how he plans to make a ‘sustainable’ electric SUV","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21161568/henrik-fisker-interview-ocean-ev-sustainability-geneva-motor-show"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="99JE8y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things I remember talking to you &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21161568/henrik-fisker-interview-ocean-ev-sustainability-geneva-motor-show"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;at length about at CES last year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is how you’re approaching this goal of wanting to make the car really sustainable. I’m curious what the progress has been on that. Has anything changed in how you’re approaching those goals of using particular materials for different parts of the car that you view as sustainable? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GhRBTJ"&gt;So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that’s closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that’s on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we’re really thinking about now as we’re nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We’ve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything — supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself — in terms of the type of materials there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="nEmhoZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think the sustainability aspect, I believe after COVID, is going to be even more powerful”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AcJcXO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The last thing I want to ask you about is, going back to the business goals and your optimism for where the company is going, one of the things I noticed in the language presenting the business in your financial filings is that Fisker believes the Ocean is going to be a “primary alternative” to the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y. What is it that makes you confident you can find the kind of audience to exploit that midrange market that doesn’t have a lot of competition right now? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lSv7C"&gt;I think you answered part of it yourself by saying there really isn’t any alternative. I mean Tesla made a great car, and what makes us confident that we can be an alternative for when somebody gets out of a gasoline car and into an electric car is, first of all, we have a completely different design. We haven’t designed a “me too” crossover hatchback like the other EV companies have done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sIclsK"&gt;That’s number one. And we already have a lot of our customers in our surveys saying they picked our vehicle first because of the design, because we haven't released a lot of technical information. But we also believe we will have some technical advancements, which we obviously don’t want to announce for competitive reasons yet, that will set us apart not only from Tesla but from our other competitors. And then finally, we have some other features in software and hardware like our California Mode, which no other competitor has, where all the windows roll down at the push of one button, which is both kind of fun and a utility feature. And then finally, when you look at our base price, we think we’re really competitive in that base price, so we think we can attract a lot of first-time EV buyers because of that base price as well. And on the high end, I think the sustainability aspect, I believe after COVID, is going to be even more powerful as a brand pillar for us. Because people care about the environment, they care about buying sustainable products, they just haven’t had the choice or they’ve had to buy a product they didn’t like. If you now have the choice to buy a cool vehicle that you actually like and is also super sustainable, I think that’s an added point in our direction.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ta-Nehisi Coates is writing a new Superman film produced by J.J. Abrams</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F1d7vJ"&gt;Celebrated author and essayist Ta-Nehisi Coates is writing a new Superman film that will be produced by J.J. Abrams, &lt;a href="https://shadowandact.com/ta-nehisi-coates-superman-dc-warner-bros-film"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow and Act &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The project has no release date or director attached yet, and there’s still no word on whether Henry Cavill will reprise his role. &lt;em&gt;Shadow and Act &lt;/em&gt;suggests a search for a new actor to play Kal-El / Clark Kent / Superman has yet to begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQZtbY"&gt;Coates is perhaps best known for his books &lt;em&gt;Between the World and Me &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Beautiful Struggle&lt;/em&gt;, but he also has comics experience, writing popular runs on both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/4/11360078/black-panther-marvel-comics-ta-nehisi-coates-brian-stelfreeze"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/02/we-who-love-america/553991/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Coates is also working on several other in-development film and television projects, including &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fbooks%2Fpage-turner%2Ftelling-the-story-of-civil-rights-a-conversation-in-baltimore&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F26%2F22303272%2Fsuperman-film-ta-nehisi-coates-new-actor-warner-abrams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a television series for HBO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.avclub.com/ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-and-ta-nehisi-coates-a-1823225233"&gt;a feature film adaption&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2014%2F07%2F21%2Fwrong-answer&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F26%2F22303272%2Fsuperman-film-ta-nehisi-coates-new-actor-warner-abrams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;article about Atlanta teachers&lt;/a&gt;, to be directed by Ryan Coogler and starring Michael B. Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UlEz0L"&gt;It’s unknown at this point if this new Superman will be DC and Warner Media’s main version of the character going forward or more of an experimental side project like &lt;em&gt;Joker&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21377631/the-batman-teaser-trailer-robert-pattinson-matt-reeves-dc-fandome"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but recasting the role opens up all sorts of exciting possibilities. Jordan himself &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/dc-comics-superman-michael-b-jordan-green-lantern-aquaman-birds-of-prey-1203415757/"&gt;reportedly met with Abrams&lt;/a&gt; about a new version of the character, which, given his work in &lt;em&gt;Black Panther, &lt;/em&gt;could bode well for the new Man of Steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxE7t5"&gt;However things shake out, it seems like J.J. Abrams’ time as Warner Media producing guru (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20862868/warnermedia-jj-abrams-movies-hbo-tv-streaming-bad-robot-productions"&gt;sealed to the tune of $250 million&lt;/a&gt;) is moving in some interesting directions: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21224271/justice-league-dark-jj-abrams-hbo-max-warnermedia-shining-berlanti-dc-comics"&gt;a Justice League Dark series&lt;/a&gt;, a new Superman, and a generally different future after years of Zack Snyder grimness. &lt;/p&gt;

You can find more information on the retailer's restock &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303165/sony-playstation-5-ps5-digital-edition-best-buy-restock"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPqddq"&gt;Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; is available now. Due to the pandemic and high demand for the PS5, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550842/sony-playstation-5-ps5-launch-day-in-store-purchases"&gt;retailers such as Best Buy and Target will only sell the console online&lt;/a&gt; for the foreseeable future. So, if you were planning to camp outside your local Target hoping to buy the console today, there will be no walk-in purchases available this year. But, you can order one online and request an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="7M35PW"&gt;If you are torn between which PS5 console to buy, no need to worry. The biggest difference to note is that the PS5 Digital Edition is smaller than the PS5 standard, costs $399, and it does not include a Blu-ray disc drive. The PS5 standard is $100 more, is a bit bulkier than the digital edition, and includes a disc drive, allowing you to play game discs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 is back in stock at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qcv6_nbCnmXLGMpyuKUVJu9atxc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68880681/vpavic_4278_20201030_0292.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TjxoNx"&gt;Sony’s latest gaming console, the PS5, is one of many gaming gadgets that are pretty hard to find in stock right now due to mostly online-only sales. If you are trying to get your hands on one, Best Buy has restocked the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733405666949444883" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733405679402492025" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5 digital edition&lt;/a&gt; right now, while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eanvXa"&gt;Similar to today’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22303116/xbox-series-x-s-restock"&gt;Xbox Series X / Series S restocks&lt;/a&gt;, the retailer is releasing small waves of PS5 stock right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YgwrHO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Rd70W"&gt;After you secure your PS5, you should consider picking up a few items that will help you get the most out of your next-gen console. I strongly suggest buying &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a one-year membership to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt; and purchasing &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723570939328512577" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an extra DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt;. A one-year membership to PS Plus also gives you access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a digital compilation featuring popular games released on the PS4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xtdOUI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="6gezA1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T6eSnW"&gt;If you want to expand your SSD storage, sadly there is no way to do that just yet. But Sony is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;reportedly expanding the options for more SSD storage&lt;/a&gt; sometime this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SBR5ek"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony will reportedly enable PS5 SSD expansion this summer","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"},{"title":"Best Buy has stock available for the Xbox Series X and S right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22303116/xbox-series-x-s-restock"},{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>As WandaVision nears its end, episode 8 looks through the past</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6M3KazKZjjc7ZxYhinJUlwWUFf8=/271x0:1714x962/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68880625/Screen_Shot_2021_02_26_at_10.59.07_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xX5r56"&gt;The path to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267989/wandavision-5th-episode-recap-sitcom-horror-disney-plus-streaming-crossover-multiverse"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;hasn’t been an easy one for Kevin Feige and the Marvel Studios team. Well, at least the path to Wanda Maximoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXPGFI"&gt;Wanda Maximoff, one of the most powerful characters both in the MCU and the comics, found herself the child of divorced parents. There was &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/OJDgN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt; on one side that wanted to use the character in its Marvel Cinematic Universe films, and 20th Century Fox on the other that technically owned her rights. Marvel’s team found a way to make the character work, but something always felt off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUIwQI"&gt;Following Disney’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273142/disney-fox-acquistion-final-hulu-marvel-streaming-21st-century"&gt;acquisition of 21st Century Fox&lt;/a&gt;, and everything becoming one giant family, things have changed — and so much of how this can benefit the MCU became clear in &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s penultimate episode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sL3Tbq"&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;We’re seven weeks and eight episodes into this, friends. You know what’s about to happen. Don’t want to be spoiled? Stop reading here.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="f0CHJx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A portrait of grief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lOjCFn"&gt;It almost feels stupid to talk about theories of what’s to come. This episode was the most poignant, beautiful breakdown of the unbelievable grief Wanda Maximoff has experienced throughout her life. Agatha, who was introduced at the end of last week’s episode as the witch masquerading as Wanda’s neighbor Agnes, brings Wanda on a journey through the past using a series of portals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSCND2"&gt;We see as Wanda watched her parents die by the hands of a Stark Industries missile in Sokovia, while trapped under the bed with her twin brother Pietro, the only family she had left. It then moves to the Hydra facility where Wanda and Pietro volunteered for the organization. Her powers, seemingly present from when she was a young child, allow her to touch the mind stone trapped within the scepter seen with Loki in &lt;em&gt;The Avengers&lt;/em&gt; without immediately dying. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rNhrWgLKLUjb6wmcX-rDXYVBOfA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330956/Screen_Shot_2021_02_26_at_11.15.22_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rUWR8k"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/22/8464479/avengers-age-of-ultron-review"&gt;post-&lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron &lt;/em&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;, Wanda is once again dealing with more grief after Pietro was gunned down in Sokovia after trying to help the Avengers. In one heartbreaking scene, where Vision is trying to help Wanda through the grieving process, we’re treated to an intimate conversation between the two, wherein Vision tells Wanda, “What is grief if not love persevering?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3DoKl"&gt;The final bit of Wanda’s memory focuses on Wanda trying to get Vision’s body back after &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, she walks in on Director Hayward and his S.W.O.R.D. team dismantling Vision’s body, after he’s declared the “most dangerous sentient weapon ever made.” It’s all too much for Wanda, who drives to the empty lot where Vision purchased a deed for their home “to grow old in.” Wanda’s grief finally reaches a breaking point, causing her magic to explode, taking over the town of WestView and introducing the fictional reality she’s in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbU0jx"&gt;So much of &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;thus far has focused on Wanda’s grief presenting itself in small ways. Her grief is spoken about — by Darcy, Monica, Pietro, and even Vision — but Wanda rarely showed it. The penultimate episode finally allowed it to take center stage. It’s vital for the finale for audiences to truly understand how desperate and full of grief Wanda is, to properly set up whatever is going to happen next, and this episode finally allowed us to do so. It’s a beautiful episode of television and, if they can stick the landing, it may make &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; one of my favorite pieces of the MCU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C5m79B"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome, Scarlet Witch &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="p5w7m3"&gt;That said, there are some things to explore a little further, starting with a beautiful retcon of a retcon... kind of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilP0gM"&gt;When Marvel Studios first introduced Wanda and Pietro, there were a couple of rules. They couldn’t use the word mutant (that’s why both were referred to as enhanced beings), and since they couldn’t exist as Magneto’s children (that’s Fox territory), they were retconned, including in the comics &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/26/22302817/wandavision-scarlet-witch-powers-chaos-magic"&gt;leading up to &lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron&lt;/em&gt;’s release&lt;/a&gt;. It was always a sore point for Marvel fans, but the community understood the licensing battles were complicated. Post-Fox acquisition, everything changed, and the end of this &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;episode finally introduced Wanda as the Scarlet Witch. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TBFotij2AB1Lvm1a3jk_GJNJvms=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330964/Screen_Shot_2021_02_26_at_11.16.44_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2jRJ7h"&gt;Wanda and Pietro’s powers were retconned within the Marvel Cinematic Universe as something that was enhanced by Hydra. Neither realized they had any special abilities, but genetic testing conducted in part using the scepter unlocked extraordinary abilities in both of them. &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;takes it one step further, allowing Agatha to point out to Wanda that she apparently had abilities inside her since birth that she was using even as a child. For example, when Wanda and Pietro’s home exploded after a Stark missile went off, and they were stuck under the bed, Agatha remarked that Wanda was likely using a probability hex to ensure they remained safe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGpodg"&gt;In the comics, Wanda’s powers allow her to control probability via her hexes — the same word for her powers is also the shape of the fictional city she’s made for herself, yes. As long as whatever she was trying to control was in her line of sight, Wanda could control the probability of what would happen. In the episode, when Wanda is staring at the non-detonated Stark missile that landed in her living room, it’s simply a case of “good luck” created by Wanda that stopped it from ever going off. At least, that’s what happened according to Agatha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="677ZAd"&gt;Wanda’s powers are increasingly important for one theory that’s floated around for a while — &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;isn’t setting up Mephisto, the Marvel devil that has become the most popular theory for the big bad reveal in the finale, but Dormammu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="49R4Ow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dormam-who?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7c5WFb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange &lt;/em&gt;fans will recognize the name Dormammu as the metaphysical villain that Strange had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/28/13447594/doctor-strange-review-marvel-benedict-cumberbatch"&gt;defeat in his film back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meDuOQ"&gt;Well, Dormammu also has a pretty special connection to Wanda Maximoff. She, alongside a number of Avengers and Defenders, came together to try to stop Dormammu from putting together the pieces of an ancient artifact known as the Evil Eye, which would allow Earth to be brought into a dark dimension. Who does Dormammu enlist to help achieve this goal? Everyone’s favorite god of mischief, Loki, whose story is about to continue in his own series this June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="30QnUP"&gt;The theory found new ground thanks to the color of Agatha’s magic. It’s not red or orange like Wanda’s and Doctor Strange’s: it’s purple. That’s the same color as Dormammu. It’s not exactly like magic is color-coded in the MCU (although it might be going forward), but if Agatha and Dormammu are representations of evil — despite Agatha being a mentor to Wanda in the comics — using a certain color of magic to display their evilness could be one method.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tmg420e-NmYa5xIKLtdDVGawV70=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330966/dormammu.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s636IS"&gt;Now, look — Dormammu seems like a bit of a stretch. The last time we saw the nefarious being, they had signed a pact with Strange to never return to Earth and we really haven’t heard anything since. At the same time, we do know that &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;leads into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21059975/doctor-strange-scott-derrickson-multiverse-madness-disney-plus-marvel-loki-wandavision"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and messing around with evil villains from different worlds certainly seems to be where Phase 4 of the MCU is headed between &lt;em&gt;Multiverse of Madness &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Eternals&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47ijop"&gt;Dormammu is also, quite literally, at one point the Lord of Chaos. Agatha revealed to Wanda this week that she wields chaos magic. It’s an incredibly rare form of magic and makes her more powerful than anyone realized. This is also why people believe she’ll be revealed as a Nexus being, an anchor within the multiverse whose existence is key to Doctor Strange. She’s crucial in maintaining the stability of all mankind on Earth. As my &lt;em&gt;Polygon &lt;/em&gt;colleague Susana Polo wrote about the history of Wanda’s chaos magic in the comics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pcWMG3"&gt;Eventually, other writers gave Wanda’s brand of magic a specific source: The God-of-Chaos-turned-ancient-demon-turned-Lovecraft-style -creepy-force-of-darkness-locked-away-in-an-alternate-dimension Chthon. Chthon’s place of power was Mount Wundagore, a fictional place in Eastern Europe where Wanda just happened to have been born. That’s probably not going to make it into &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, but it does put Wanda among the Marvel Universe’s foremost wielders of Chaos Magic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="kStShy"&gt;Just as unlikely as Chthon being introduced into the MCU via &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;is Dormammu, quite honestly. There are too many questions about other characters and plotlines set up, including Billy and Tommy, Wanda’s kids. They have a closer connection to Agatha and Mephisto, and how much is &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;supposed to set up for an entire phase? It feels like a lot to cram into one final episode! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HF9Sri"&gt;So, let’s focus on the one character we know will play out next episode and examine just how heartbreaking it’s likely going to be — White Vision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lj1bTn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is White Vision? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="12mPCx"&gt;Everyone knows who Vision is, but in the comics, there’s a version of the character that actually was used as a sentient weapon — and he lost everything that made him the lovable synthezoid in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KuzHylVmnBYI-3ITQpYhXUryTrw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330969/Screen_Shot_2021_02_26_at_11.18.21_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3aj9xq"&gt;White Vision entered the comics in 1989 as part of John Byrne’s &lt;em&gt;Vision Quest&lt;/em&gt; series from a West Coast Avengers run. The run found Vision’s body being dismantled by a government group. Once his body was dismantled, he lost the color in his skin. Although Hank Pym figured out a way to revive Vision, he remained a ghost white version of himself. More importantly, reviving Vision meant that the synthezoid also lost connection to Wanda and their sons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SrXwqF"&gt;In the MCU, Vision’s colorless body is also a reference to his death post-Thanos. There’s already a logical explanation for why Vision would look white, but the post-credits scene acknowledges that White Vision is created using the same energy that Wanda is using to keep her fictional town going. He’s only resurrected through her chaos magic, and it’s likely only her chaos magic that can destroy him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g5pF8RpDH0uA2yxbF6wDVPvNkGM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330979/whitevision1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;An example of White Vision.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_tBezrLIEduX9OiLvzLTQKitA9k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330982/whitevision2.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pUHCRf"&gt;The post-credits scene in this week’s &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;sets up a finale where Wanda might have to fight White Vision. It’s a little poetic, and absolutely heartbreaking. In order to protect her family, she has to acknowledge that Vision is actually dead and defeat him in the process. I assume she’ll have a little help from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22291176/wandavision-episode-7-explainer-agatha-harkness-agnes-monica-rambeau"&gt;Monica Rambeau’s Spectrum (perhaps!)&lt;/a&gt; along the way, perhaps, but that brings up another important question: what happened to Monica? We didn’t see her at all in this episode, but we know she was found by Pietro after trying to help Wanda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HA6vpC"&gt;Everything will finally be answered next week as &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;comes to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="SQNYsH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 26th, 2021 12:05PM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Best Buy still has both consoles in stock, but the retailer is releasing small waves of inventory every few minutes, so if you’re unable to buy one immediately, it’s worth trying again in a few minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WF9r2H"&gt;Best Buy has restocked both of Microsoft’s next-gen consoles the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733401816553757879" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733401816553757879" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Series S&lt;/a&gt;. Like some other gaming gadgets released late last year, these consoles are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;extremely difficult&lt;/a&gt; to buy, but if you move quickly, you have another chance to buy one right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZpQOHY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cfRAwj"&gt;Whether you buy the digital-only Series S or the more powerful Xbox Series X which includes a disc drive, you may want to consider picking up a few accessories that will help you get the most out of your new gadget, such as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF26MXW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an extra controller&lt;/a&gt; if you are playing a game with a local co-op with a friend or family member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v4Zgyt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gpa4v9"&gt;As far as storage goes, both consoles have rather limited storage: 512GB on the Series S, 1TB on the X. If you plan to download some older games that do not take full advantage of the next-gen hardware and don’t want to deplete your limited SSD storage, you can grab an external hard drive. You can buy an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SSD expansion card that only comes in 1TB&lt;/a&gt;, and it is very expensive, costing $220. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SE84Lx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Watch 2020’s hurricane season unfold in a mesmerizing four-minute timelapse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n-PK7trOXmYal2C8cQz5OHUINGc=/0x0:996x664/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68880581/Feb_26_2021_11_37_59.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wfdGiS"&gt;This week, NASA released a grim four-minute timelapse of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, a mesmerizing display of last year’s record-breaking string of tropical commotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5B5CY5"&gt;2020’s season “smashed records with an unprecedented 30 named storms, marking the fifth year in a row with above-average hurricane activity,” NASA said in a blog accompanying the video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5rTj5z"&gt;The agency’s &lt;a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4884#30824"&gt;Scientific Visualization Studio&lt;/a&gt; used a complex &lt;a href="https://gpm.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/document_files/IMERG_ATBD_V5.2_0.pdf"&gt;algorithm&lt;/a&gt; to process and merge hordes of data from an array of weather satellites in orbit, combining it with estimates and observations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center and National Hurricane Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9PsRc"&gt;The product is a fascinating four-minute and 26-second look at last year’s hurricane activity, unfolding in a colorful display of wispy cyclone formations tumbling across the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eL0XGE"&gt;“The bar has been raised,” Brian McNoldy, a senior researcher at the University of Miami’s Marine and Atmospheric Science school, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BMcNoldy/status/1362500180797501450?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; last week. “When we mention the average number of named storms, hurricanes, &amp;amp; major hurricanes, we’re typically referring to a recent 30-year ‘climate normal’. We’ve been using 1981-2010, but now we have 1991-2020, and the counts have increased by 12-19%.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H90zxR"&gt;The total cost of 2020’s climate events was $95 billion, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/events/US/2020"&gt;data from NOAA&lt;/a&gt;, killing 262 people. There were 13 severe storms, seven tropical cyclones, one drought, and one wildfire event, according to NOAA. Last year’s Atlantic hurricane season was the fifth costliest on record, causing roughly $60 billion in economic damage, according to &lt;a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/hurricane/record-breaking-2020-hurricane-season-caused-60-billion-to-65-billion-in-economic-damage/858788"&gt;a report from AccuWeather&lt;/a&gt;. The most expensive season on record was in 2017, hitting $306.2 billion in costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9o544E"&gt;“Climate normals are updated each decade to keep up with a changing climate,” McNoldy said. “What was normal 50 years ago isn’t normal now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TPQrR"&gt;The Atlantic hurricane season officially starts each year on June 1st and ends on November 30th, though storms can — and do — occur outside of the official season. June 1st, 2021, is less than 100 days away.&lt;/p&gt;
