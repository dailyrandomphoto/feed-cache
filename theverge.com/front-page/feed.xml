    <title>What’s on your desk, Andrew Marino? </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A cornucopia of audio tech spread across two desks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Cpe9jO"&gt;Podcasting can be a fun and incredibly creative field — but also a very demanding one. Your skill set not only has to include familiarity with a variety of audio hardware and software, but you also need imagination, a good feel for what will sound good to your audience, and a very sensitive ear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uX3ME"&gt;Andrew Marino is &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s senior audio director, and is responsible for producing almost everything you hear in our podcasts. We asked him to show us his desks — both of them — and tell us a bit about them, and about himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPsPrE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your background, and what do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DD0QUt"&gt;Hello! I am an audio engineer / creator living in Brooklyn, NY. My background is mostly in audio / visual technology, whether that is making music, podcasting, video producing, or playing with fun media formats. That is not so coincidentally what I do at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YowNY"&gt;Most of my job is producing, editing, mixing, and recording audio for &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; podcasts and videos, and I try to write on the site when I can! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NxyuP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have two — count &lt;/strong&gt;’&lt;strong&gt;em, two — separate workspaces. Where are they and what are they for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="53PQhA"&gt;Yes! I am very lucky to have two workspaces. The smaller desk is in my living room, and the larger corner one is in my bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRqq1g"&gt;The living room has been where I’ve set up a desktop for the past five years in my apartment, but while working from home the past year, I decided to separate my work into two spaces: the one in the living room for most &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; stuff during the week, and then the other for personal projects like my Etsy store, Twitch stream, personal blog, or podcast. Or sometimes I’ll work there when I need some kind of change of scenery. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A corner desk in the bedroom for personal audio projects." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q6fPAktcqdfQ9Nsg5PdRbAynlzU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722120/amarino_210710_4666_0001_2_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A corner desk in the bedroom for personal audio projects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6xpNk2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s start with your personal desk in the bedroom. It looks like it’s got a complete sound setup. How did you decide where and how to set it up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qk2He"&gt;I wouldn’t say it’s &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; — you may notice I don’t have any studio monitors at either desk. I work on headphones in my apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnbPhu"&gt;I’ve had that corner desk for a long time, and I really didn’t want to throw it out when I got a new desk (the one in the living room). I also was trying to set up a separate space for Twitch or my Etsy shop where I didn’t have to make a mess and move stuff around all the time for different projects, like I have to with my &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnmZ7G"&gt;There’s also something nice about moving to another room to work on a different project, and that has helped a lot with productivity and creativity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dCczoG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmAXmz"&gt;This was a desk someone in my hometown was getting rid of many years ago — I still keep it around because of the L shape. I like to have a lot of space for different projects and tools I’m using so I can access them quickly. My &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleagues may see a pattern here with my desk in our office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IohHNW"&gt;I also took a shelf from another old desk and screwed it onto this one — that’s where I put my cassette decks or can mount some other gear if I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIc45k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a desk chair for that one?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ynz25l"&gt;Oh, yeah, I do. It’s a 50 dollar computer chair I got from Ikea. It’s comfy enough, but I wouldn’t really recommend it because the material of the chair comes off very easily, so there was black plasticky stuff on my floor all the time. I had to put pillowcases on the top and bottom of it. It’s ugly so I didn’t include it in the photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="viQ09x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, let’s go for the gold: could you tell us about the tech you’re using there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJMdNA"&gt;All right. The essentials of this setup are a &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacbook-pro%2F&amp;amp;subid1=Verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; (a 2014 or a 2020 model, depending on if I’m using my personal or work computer), a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dell-UltraSharp-U2414H-Screen-Monitor/dp/B00GTV05XG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;24-inch U2414H Dell monitor&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sweetwater.com%2Fstore%2Fdetail%2FRodecasterPro--rode-rodecaster-pro-podcast-production-studio&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577580%2Fwhats-on-your-desk-andrew-marino" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rodecaster Pro mixer / audio interface&lt;/a&gt;, and the traditional Apple keyboard and mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xeM994"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10654100"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eXozA8"&gt;The Rodecaster Pro is the cool gadget I’d like to point out here. It’s a consumer audio mixer by Rode built for podcasting and live audio, with the ability to mix and record up to four microphones, device audio, and sound banks. I prefer to use it for live mixing rather than recording — it makes it really easy to mix multiple microphones and sound sources into one signal for streaming for live video before it even hits the computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGZKGh"&gt;Everything else are tools for different projects: an old Panasonic VHS-C video camera for a streaming webcam, a few cassette decks for making mixtapes, arts and crafts materials, and several recording devices (a &lt;a href="https://www.sounddevices.com/product/mixpre-6-ii/"&gt;Sound Devices Mix-Pre 6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zoom-H4N-Digital-Multitrack-Recorder/dp/B01DPOXS8I?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom H4n&lt;/a&gt;, a PreSonus FireStudio, and some lavalier microphones) for recording in the field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="This Panasonic camera now serves as a webcam." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/APt8OV5q_xpxvKHX-9tDJjcH9es=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717395/amarino_210712_4666_0023.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Panasonic camera now serves as a webcam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The feed from the Panasonic." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/arRRVVZX0vjcL7WqEWoBfpiYF68=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721504/feed_from_camera.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The feed from the Panasonic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ApyPxy"&gt;The big bin under my desk is completely blank cassette tapes for my online store. I have been putting my podcasts on cassettes and also make custom designs and labels for mixtapes. The other bin with drawers is all arts and crafts and office supplies — markers, stickers, paper, shipping supplies, stamps, paper glue, device cables, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BwHgSg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Um — tape cassettes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jG9uyo"&gt;Honestly, it’s more aesthetic than anything (ha ha). It’s also easy and cheap to make duplications and personalize a physical piece of media. You see it a lot in DIY music spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Two screens: a 24-inch monitor and a MacBook Pro." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rw7FDwsQjIySbbLg1fYGmYq2Fd0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717390/amarino_210711_4666_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two screens: a 24-inch monitor and a MacBook Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Some tape desks, including one from Crayola." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IPdQVK9dX-jbjqHVfiFdx6ifpwI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717387/amarino_210711_4666_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some tape desks, including one from Crayola.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6A9QQs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love the photo of the hippo above your desk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93AOoe"&gt;That article (which is actually in an old Wharfedale picture-frame speaker) is about the oldest hippopotamus in America, named Lucifer. My grandma sent me &lt;a href="https://www.tampabay.com/hernando/lucifer-americas-oldest-hippo-confronts-his-age-in-homosassa-springs-20190214/"&gt;that article&lt;/a&gt; a couple years ago because I used to visit him as a kid. I recently did a little story about him &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5wMHySfoXwLzEmLIQ1R2Gu?si=89035e5b073d4e52&amp;amp;nd=1"&gt;on my personal podcast&lt;/a&gt; that I’m proud of, so it is sort of a memento to that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y17T8W"&gt;That little orange thing on the edge of the desk is a vintage tabletop vacuum that I found very pleasantly designed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IEsEH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see that you’re set up with some sound-absorbing material.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTeEHp"&gt;Oh yeah, it’s not set up very well, and I’m kind of embarrassed by it. But I could not stand the low-end reverberation of my voice in that corner, so I had to add something pretty simple to dampen the sound bouncing off those walls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ4J4y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love the toys. I was especially drawn to the Crayola toy. What is that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqY9Va"&gt;It’s a tape player! It was a gift from a friend. I use it half for testing out cassette tapes and half to just look at. There is a crayon-shaped microphone you can record with. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The living room desk is for Verge work." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jcikLnR4PYggUctKYxFsbIapsCs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717393/amarino_210712_4666_0019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The living room desk is for Verge work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B6S1fy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s pass on to the smaller desk. Can you tell us about the desk and the pink chair?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpxYOA"&gt;This is where I do most of my work for &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and this is where you will see me sitting on our work Zoom calls 90 percent of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpTwK1"&gt;This was also a desk that someone was giving away. It’s a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fp%2FHusky-46-in-Adjustable-Height-Work-Table-HOLT46XDB12%2F301809931&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577580%2Fwhats-on-your-desk-andrew-marino" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Husky adjustable work table&lt;/a&gt; and it works great as a standing computer desk. I’d recommend this if you’re looking for an affordable option for a standing desk. It has a very slow hand crank to adjust height, but I eventually got used to it and my arms are more buff now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEV9Hi"&gt;The chair is a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fkarljan-chair-turquoise-kabusa-turquoise-40497060%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577580%2Fwhats-on-your-desk-andrew-marino" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Karljan&lt;/a&gt; from Ikea, and good for the price! I initially bought this as a kitchen chair, but moved it over in the living room once I got the second desk. In general, I try not to sit for too long during the day, so I guess I don’t care too much about chairs. Maybe that’s just because I don’t own a “good” chair. This one’s cute, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUidz8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the device you have between the keyboard and the monitor? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LA0rA"&gt;It’s an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Akai-Professional-MPK-Performance-Ready-8-Assignable/dp/B00IJ6QAO2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Akai MPK mini MIDI controller&lt;/a&gt; I use for music production, mostly in &lt;a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/"&gt;Ableton Live&lt;/a&gt;, a digital audio workstation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWfz6D"&gt;Once in a while I will make something for &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; podcasts or videos with it. Other times it is on the carpet next to me when the desk gets too full. I’ve been working on the desk space issue forever. I’m still trying to figure out how to keep a minimalist desk in my living room, but it keeps growing. I’m a maximalist, I guess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lAFrBs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10654118"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zKkOBb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about the other tech on this desk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYAR7D"&gt;Again, I switch MacBooks back and forth between desks, so the classic MacBook Pro for all my work is here too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3YeO28"&gt;For the other gear, I’ve got a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Focusrite-Scarlett-Audio-Interface-Tools/dp/B07QR73T66?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Focusrite Scarlett 2i2&lt;/a&gt; USB audio interface, which I use mostly to plug in a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-MKE600-Camcorder-Shotgun-Microphone/dp/B00B0YPAYQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser MKE 600 shotgun mic&lt;/a&gt; for Zoom calls, or for the rare occasion I need to record myself at work. Our podcast hosts have been using the Scarlett for recording at home this past year. This Sennheiser model has been the clearest, most directional, and most non-bulky option for voice chat I’ve used (you will also see this mic at my other desk), and I’ve used a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of microphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bw5hV8"&gt;My main screen is a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-32MP58HQ-P-32-Inch-Monitor-Screen/dp/B01BV1X9DG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32-inch LG 32MP58HQ-P LED monitor&lt;/a&gt;, which is big but I love it. I was trying to mimic an iMac-size screen initially, then went a little bigger. Editing a podcast on a screen this big makes it so much easier to navigate through a project. I have the monitor stacked on a book right now to put it at eye level, but I think I’m going to have to find a way to raise it up a bit more. I actually loved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22395531/remote-work-desk-setup-from-home-office-tech"&gt;Dan’s monitor arm from his version of this desk chat&lt;/a&gt;, I might have to get one myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IV1TgR"&gt;I use the MacBook as a second monitor for my mixer window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tlg8xp"&gt;I keep my external &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746376143951711557" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG Ultra HD Blu-ray drive&lt;/a&gt; on this desk to burn or read discs. This is an overspill gadget from my bedroom desk because it is kind of delicate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPTDtx"&gt;Depending on the computer, I have some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22278012/dongle-quiz-tech-gadgets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dongles&lt;/a&gt;. For the 2014 MacBook Pro, I just use an&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-4-Port-Macbook-Surface-Notebook/dp/B00XMD7KPU?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker 4-port USB-A dock&lt;/a&gt; for various devices I’m plugging in. For the 2020 MacBook Pro, I’m using a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Satechi-Aluminum-Multi-Port-Adapter-Pass-Through/dp/B075FW7H5J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Satechi USB-C dock&lt;/a&gt; that gets everything I need into my computer — except a Thunderbolt 2 cable for my hard drives and video interfaces, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMMEL2AM%2FA%2Fthunderbolt-3-usb-c-to-thunderbolt-2-adapter&amp;amp;subid1=Verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which I have to use another dongle&lt;/a&gt; for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QxkM9P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10654127"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5IaikH"&gt;I’ve been using the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fwebcams%2Fc270-hd-webcam.960-000694.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577580%2Fwhats-on-your-desk-andrew-marino" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech C270&lt;/a&gt; as my Zoom webcam, because it was the only one available at the time I needed it last year. It is in 720p and 4:3 aspect ratio, which is kind of charming at times but it looks like I’m using a mini DVD camera for my meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lLgBE"&gt;Then, once in a while, I bring in my Magnavox MWR20V6 VCR / DVD combo from the bedroom when I need to digitize something or convert media formats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPyKLj"&gt;The orange things on the corner of my desk are my &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1388898-REG%2Flacie_stfr5000800_rugged_5tb_portable_hdd.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577580%2Fwhats-on-your-desk-andrew-marino" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LaCie external hard drives&lt;/a&gt;, where I keep all the digital projects I’m currently working on, and some archival projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cad3aW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, there’s no way I’m not asking you about that cat on the wall.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvplcc"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fb-toys-interactive-cat-piano-meowsic%2F-%2FA-12026417&amp;amp;subid1=Verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cat piano&lt;/a&gt;!! I got this at Target about seven or eight years ago because it was so wacky and you can play cat meows on it with the keys. I added a quarter-inch TRS analog output on it so I can record it directly, but it is mostly decoration these days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7g6Qbm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love the Star Wars mug. And the green skull ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgAgOw"&gt;Oh, thanks! Yeah, you gotta have a mug with tools in it. That Star Wars mug was a gift my great-grandma’s neighbor gave me as a kid after my great-grandma died. I always thought it was a weird thing to give a grieving child, so it has taken on some meaning after all these years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EeBsnk"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ebros-Vegetable-Sprouting-Halloween-Decorative/dp/B084KRC4GD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;broccoli skull&lt;/a&gt; is something I bought at Wayfair a couple months ago because it was also a weird thing! Why broccoli? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTgju4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything else about your workspace that we haven’t covered?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2qnLN"&gt;I would like to note that I don’t take cable management too seriously, and it is sometimes overrated, especially when you are moving gear around a lot! I tried to keep these images authentic and not over-tidy my setup for this piece. Also, I am currently working on an art project to make unruly cables look good in your home — more on that at a later time. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The second-gen Google Nest Hub&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xVmnTU"&gt;Though we’re hitting the sleepy, dog-days of summer and there aren’t any big sale events on the horizon, there are still plenty of great deals out there if you know where to look. This week we found bargains on bundles of Google’s Nest Hub and Nest Thermostat, HyperX’s excellent gaming headset, the best Chromebook you can get right now, and Amazon’s kids-focused Fire HD tablets. Check them out below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="3Fu3wO"&gt;
&lt;p id="xXdCYa"&gt;For a limited time, you can pick up a Google Nest Hub (second-gen) and a budget-friendly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21725036/google-nest-thermostat-2020-review"&gt;Nest Thermostat&lt;/a&gt; for $167 through &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/324687194939/&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/7/13/22574503/google-nest-hub-best-buy-philips-hue-smart-bulbs-amazon-fire-deal-sale&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22338544__t_w__r_theverge.com/good-deals_" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BuyDig’s official storefront&lt;/a&gt; on eBay. If you prefer a smart speaker over a thermostat, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/313593807202/&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/7/13/22574503/google-nest-hub-best-buy-philips-hue-smart-bulbs-amazon-fire-deal-sale&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22338544__t_w__r_theverge.com/good-deals_" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BuyDig is also offering&lt;/a&gt; the same Hub model with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Google Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt; for $140, more than $100 off what they would cost if you were to purchase them separately. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tGsXGk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10649377"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vDnaD3"&gt;If you’re new to the whole gaming thing, you might want to consider picking up a capable headset before jumping into competitive play. Thankfully, everything in HyperX’s headset lineup is consistently reliable, with the Cloud Alpha S being a solid choice for those looking for clean sound, comfort, and a subtle look that should mesh well with just about anything. Right now, the jet black model is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-Cloud-Alpha-Adjustable-Leatherette/dp/B081D8TPZZ/?tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22339428%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $90&lt;/a&gt;, nearly matching the best price we’ve seen on the wired headset. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21191577/hyperx-cloud-alpha-s-gaming-headset-black-pc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b0DwPw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10650572"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A9PdCE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746320001237385626#donotlink?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22341856%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fgood-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Currently discounted at Best Buy to $619&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 Chromebook Spin 713 from Acer packs in 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i5, which is more than enough processing power for most people. Moreover, it boasts a great keyboard and a brilliant 3:2 screen, along with two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports and enough battery life for a full day in the classroom — virtual or otherwise. It’s the best Chromebook you can get right now. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Kb8AeX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10652856"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gSogHf"&gt;The top-tier 10-inch Fire HD 10 Kids tablet, which was just updated earlier this year, includes a bigger, better-quality screen, faster performance and more RAM, and up to 12 hours of battery life with USB-C charging. Normally $200, but this week’s sale &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-Kids-tablet/dp/B08F62DV1Z?tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22337565%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;brings it down to $130&lt;/a&gt;. Check out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22578620/amazon-fire-hd-10-plus-productivity-bundle-kids-pro-2021-tablet-review-which-to-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;review of the full Fire HD 10 2021 lineup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHDk2T"&gt;If you want something smaller or a little cheaper, the Fire HD 8 Kids is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Kids-Edition-tablet/dp/B07WDDT3G5?tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22337565%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $90&lt;/a&gt;, while the base model &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H8WS1FT?tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22337565%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire 7 Kids is down to $60&lt;/a&gt;. All versions come with a kid-friendly case, two-year damage protection, and a year subscription to Amazon’s Kids Plus content service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IXut3u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10648113"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp tests encrypted cloud backups on Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4D_0vcmx2y-57dd4SbfdElHCGF8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69593890/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OFGgCM"&gt;When you’re using WhatsApp your messages are encrypted end-to-end, which means prying eyes can’t easily see what’s in them as they travel back and forth. However, if you keep a backup stored in the cloud, authorities can use a search warrant to have Google Drive or iCloud hand over access to the data. But &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; has reported previously that WhatsApp is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319136/whatsapp-cloud-backups-icloud-google-drive-password-encryption-security"&gt;working on the technology to independently encrypt your backups in the cloud&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-21-15-5-whats-new/"&gt;says that in the most recent beta update on Android&lt;/a&gt; (2.21.15.5), the system has been enabled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="h9idD6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What 2020 means for encryption","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21158030/encryption-explainer-guide-law-enforcement-apple-fbi"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JguQDj"&gt;Opting in should keep your chat history and media securely backed up, with the significant caveat that if you forget your passcode / lose the 64-digit recovery key, then they’ll be locked away permanently — even WhatsApp can’t help you get in. If you’re OK with being on your own in that respect, then all you need to do is get in the beta test group or wait for this to be available to everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uevkWP"&gt;The Facebook-owned service is also testing a version of the software that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577594/whatsapp-multi-device-e2e-facebook"&gt;works across multiple devices&lt;/a&gt;, maintaining end-to-end encryption whether or not you have a phone involved. If you’re in the beta, check your version carefully, as posts on social media suggest the closed encryption tests are expanding to include more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tey6lO"&gt;

    <title>Amazon just got Fakespot booted off Apple’s iOS App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UQcC_ha6Fx5vGHwYUEVWTyuCXug=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69593254/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0005.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="erAuS3"&gt;Fakespot, known for its web browser extensions that try to weed out fake product reviews, suddenly no longer has an iPhone or iPad app — because Amazon sent Apple a takedown request, both Amazon and Fakespot confirm, and Apple decided to remove the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C03rj2"&gt;The giant retailer says it was concerned about how a new update to the Fakespot app was “wrapping” its website without permission, and how that could be theoretically exploited to steal Amazon customer data. Fakespot founder Saoud Khalifah told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Apple abruptly removed the app today without any explanation. Apple confirms it removed the app, but disputes the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUUrCW"&gt;The new Fakespot app launched &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/06/03/2241643/0/en/Fakespot-Rolls-Out-the-Fakespot-Secure-Shopping-App-The-Best-Way-to-Shop-Amazon-on-Mobile-Devices.html"&gt;just over a month ago&lt;/a&gt;, and I can confirm it let you log in to Amazon, browse, and buy items with Fakespot’s overlay on top. I downloaded and tried it a few weeks ago to see if it could help spot fake reviews on some new purchases, but I didn’t come to a conclusion on whether it actually helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WVCgFi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thank you to all of our users for making this new iOS app a reality. Together we will put an end to eCommerce fraud. We have more amazing products coming soon that will make secure shopping the gold standard for eCommerce.  &lt;a href="https://t.co/UyUnsOydzK"&gt;https://t.co/UyUnsOydzK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fakespot (@FakespotTweets) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FakespotTweets/status/1407028418970107904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OocBqg"&gt;But in mid-June, says Fakespot’s founder, Amazon initiated a takedown notice. And just hours ago, says Khalifah, Apple finally delivered a blunt three-line email about how it regretted that the situation couldn’t be resolved amicably and that Fakespot has now been removed from the App Store. “We just dedicated months of resources and time and money into this app,” says Khalifah. “Apple hasn’t even given us the ability to solve this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S39GGY"&gt;Hours after we published this story, Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that’s not exactly true:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZHS71"&gt;“This was a dispute over intellectual property rights initiated by Amazon on June 8 and within hours we ensured both parties were in contact with one another, explaining the issue and steps for the developer to take to keep their app on the store and giving them ample time to resolve the issue. On June 29, we again reached out to Fakespot weeks before removing their app from the App Store.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fawnoh"&gt;Over the phone, Khalifah clarified that Apple did mention on June 29th that it “may be forced to pull” Fakespot from the App Store, but insists Apple never provided any other guidance, and that it was largely just conversation between Amazon and Fakespot where each argued their side before Apple yanked the app. “I’m shocked Apple decided to side with Amazon without any proof,” says Khalifah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHyiLM"&gt;Amazon tells us it believes Fakespot violated Apple guideline 5.2.2, which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5.2.2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.2.2 Third-Party Sites/Services:&lt;/strong&gt; If your app uses, accesses, monetizes access to, or displays content from a third-party service, ensure that you are specifically permitted to do so under the service’s terms of use. Authorization must be provided upon request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HjJdjn"&gt;Amazon also tells us that Fakespot injects code into its website, opening up an attack vector and putting customer data (including email, addresses, credit card info, and your browser history) at risk, though it says it doesn’t actually know if Fakespot is using this information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5y16tw"&gt;“The app in question provides customers with misleading information about our sellers and their products, harms our sellers’ businesses, and creates potential security risks. We appreciate Apple’s review of this app against its Appstore guidelines,” reads a statement from Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dt4S80"&gt;But while Fakespot admits the app injects code to display its own scores, he categorically denies there’s any vulnerability and points out that apps which include a web browser view are common — including coupon apps that Amazon seems to “have no problem with wrapping around a webview browser.” Amazon did, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21059083/amazon-honey-browser-extension-security-risk-paypal-acquisition-competition"&gt;try to warn against browser coupon extension Honey&lt;/a&gt; by suggesting it was a security risk last January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Hbchv"&gt;Regardless of why, it’s a blow to one of the major outspoken critics of Amazon’s review system, as Fakespot is regularly cited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21423429/amazon-top-reviewers-uk-fraud"&gt;in reports about review fraud on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon even bought search ads against the “Fakespot” keyword in the App Store to reduce the app’s potential impact:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MGBOFMyACbWIRhRXF1Rd0BqSYa4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722632/fakespot_amazon.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LLUezm"&gt;“Amazon is willing to bully little companies like ours that showcase the cracks in their company,” Khalifah says, suggesting Amazon must have realized people were choosing their app over the Amazon app. He says Fakespot racked up 150,000 installs from the iOS App Store, without spending any money on marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOgAwM"&gt;Amazon says it regularly audits companies that try to call out fake reviews and claims that Fakespot’s ratings are mostly wrong: “We regularly review products where Fakespot rated a product’s reviews as untrustworthy and their findings were wrong more than 80% of the time. They simply do not have the information we have—such as reviewer, seller and product history—to accurately determine the authenticity of a review.” Amazon suggests that it does a much better job of finding fake reviews itself by analyzing 30 million of them each week, though that clearly hasn’t stopped the fake and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567530/amazon-choetech-removed-pulled-aukey-mpow"&gt;incentivized review problems&lt;/a&gt; yet — something we’re still investigating at &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2X4ttr"&gt;Amazon wouldn’t say if it’s contacted Google about the Android version of the app, but that app hasn’t been updated since 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7YXLU"&gt;Fakespot’s founder says the company is weighing its legal options now because it believes mobile is the future of shopping. “We’re seeing percentages of 60/40 now hovering in mobile’s favor,” Khalifah tells me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bcq3yp"&gt;“We will explore all the options we have available,” says Khalifah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emh2i5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:09PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added mention of browser coupon extension Honey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBVnSf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 10:39PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Apple statement and Fakespot’s reply.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden says platforms like Facebook are ‘killing people’ with COVID-19 misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Departs The White House For Camp David" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tI38IyhzdtHhRUAe4wKbPnyozm4=/0x0:3632x2421/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69592932/1329088137.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rF7AsO"&gt;The White House escalated its fight against vaccine misinformation on Friday, with President Biden directly criticizing Facebook and other platforms for allowing vaccine misinformation to spread — and consequently raising the ongoing death toll from the deadly pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzNs4V"&gt;Asked for a message to platforms like Facebook, Biden replied, “They’re killing people ... the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated, and they’re killing people.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for clarification of the president’s comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQsODb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1416111364419035141"&gt;The full exchange&lt;/a&gt; is embedded below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kdgYYD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Reporter: "What's your message to platforms like Facebook?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Biden: "They're killing people." &lt;a href="https://t.co/jrAvQpG7i0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jrAvQpG7i0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— The Hill (@thehill) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1416111364419035141?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hnOPxo"&gt;The statements come after a coordinated campaign from the White House pressuring Facebook and other platforms to act more aggressively to counter misinformation about coronavirus vaccines. On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578431/white-house-surgeon-general-facebook-youtube-twitter-covid-19-misinformation-vaccines"&gt;a report from Surgeon General Vivek Murthy&lt;/a&gt; called on platforms to institute stricter penalties against accounts that share misinformation. Speaking to the press corps, he specifically called out algorithmic recommendation engines like the Facebook News Feed for contributing to misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6yfIf"&gt;“They’ve designed product features, such as ‘Like’ buttons, that reward us for sharing emotionally charged content, not accurate content,” Murthy told reporters. “And their algorithms tend to give us more of what we click on, pulling us deeper and deeper into a well of misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZdvux"&gt;Reached for comment, a Facebook representative defended the platform’s record of fighting vaccine misinformation. “We will not be distracted by accusations which aren’t supported by the facts,” said a Facebook spokesperson. “The fact is that more than 2 billion people have viewed authoritative information about COVID-19 and vaccines on Facebook, which is more than any other place on the internet. More than 3.3 million Americans have also used our vaccine finder tool to find out where and how to get a vaccine.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOC0vp"&gt;“The facts show that Facebook is helping save lives,” the spokesperson continued. “Period.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pA02bE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1416092992306393091"&gt;A number of Republicans&lt;/a&gt; have objected to the White House push, seeing it as an unconstitutional effort by the government to bring about private-sector speech restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8d4kW"&gt;“The White House is colluding with Facebook to censor Americans,” said Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22561157/ken-buck-antitrust-apple-amazon-facebook-google-cicilline-jim-jordan"&gt;an outspoken supporter&lt;/a&gt; of antitrust action against Facebook. “This is an attack on the First Amendment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6G72nZ"&gt;Vaccines to protect against COVID-19 are widely available in the US, but vaccination rates have slowed in recent months. As a result, both case numbers and deaths linked to COVID-19 have risen in recent weeks as new variants of the contagion reach the unvaccinated population. All available COVID-19 vaccines have been through a stringent testing process, which has found that they are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/safety-of-vaccines.html"&gt;safe and effective&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exrgxe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 5:16PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included comment from Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump supporters charged in plot to bomb Facebook and Twitter headquarters, among other targets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vs7scbGD-gT_pESAz_Xxa5GsOOY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69592856/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="prgizl"&gt;Two California residents have been indicted for allegedly planning to firebomb the offices of California’s Democratic governor in Sacramento after the 2020 election, and had also discussed bombing Facebook and Twitter, &lt;a href="https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs2191/f/Ian%20Benjamin%20Rogers%20Criminal%20Complaint.pdf"&gt;federal court records&lt;/a&gt; show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZZcdt"&gt;The pair, who were indicted on conspiracy charges as well as illegal possession of firearms and explosives, were part of an &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/capitol-riot-three-percenters-militia-conspiracy-indictment/"&gt;anti-government militia&lt;/a&gt; with a strong pro-Trump agenda called the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248640/amazon-amazonsmile-oath-keepers-three-percenters-ban"&gt;Three Percenters&lt;/a&gt;. The conspirators’ texts alluded that their planned actions would send a message to tech companies like Facebook and Twitter days after they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;banned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Trump&lt;/a&gt; from their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EW73NT"&gt;Texts recovered by the FBI indicated that the two men believed President Trump won the 2020 election, and that they wanted to go to “war” to keep him in office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McghVq"&gt;The first man arrested, Ian Benjamin Rogers, had been &lt;a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/01/18/napa-businessman-arrested-after-deputies-discover-assault-rifles-and-explosives/"&gt;caught on January 15th&lt;/a&gt;, just days after allegedly texting with the other conspirator about plans for the bombing. The FBI found nearly 50 firearms, some illegal, and five pipe bombs in a search of Rogers’ home and business after the arrest. The second conspirator, Jarrod Copeland, was arrested on July 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WurP8O"&gt;While allegedly planning to bomb Democratic buildings, the two men also allegedly discussed attacks against Facebook and Twitter headquarters, a motive that the FBI considers in its lawsuit against Rogers to be retaliation for the platforms banning Trump days earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPYxax"&gt;“We can attack Twitter and democrats easy right now burn they’re [sic] shit down,” Rogers wrote, according to the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIRsEm"&gt;The records also show that he texted “I’m thinking sac office first target,” which the FBI believes is an allusion to California Governor Gavin Newsom’s office. “Then maybe bird and face offices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSzFYt"&gt;“Bird” and “face” offices are fairly clear stand-ins for Twitter and Facebook, as Twitter’s logo is a bird and both companies had recently banned Trump from their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lnm8IH"&gt;“Sad it’s come to this but I’m not going down without a fight,” Rogers allegedly texted. “These commies need to be told what’s up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWQu7k"&gt;FBI chief Christopher Wray &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/fbi-chris-wray-testify-capitol-riot-9a5539af34b15338bb5c4923907eeb67"&gt;issued a warning&lt;/a&gt; in early March that domestic terrorism is a growing threat in the United States, as exemplified by the attack on the Capitol on January 6th. In the wake of that attack, the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies have prioritized prosecutions against domestic groups plotting violent attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q7Z5ur"&gt;Rogers and Copeland were &lt;a href="https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs2191/f/Ian%20Benjamin%20Rogers%20and%20Jarrod%20Copeland%20Indictment.pdf"&gt;indicted&lt;/a&gt; on July 7th and face charges of conspiracy to destroy by fire or explosive a building used in or affecting interstate commerce. Rogers also faces charges for the illegal possession of firearms and explosives, and Copeland has been charged with destroying evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdwHvn"&gt;“Firebombing your perceived political opponents is illegal and does not nurture the sort of open and vigorous debate that created and supports our constitutional democracy,” U.S. Attorney Stephanie Hinds said, according to &lt;a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/07/16/bay-area-men-ian-benjamin-rogers-jarrod-copeland-indicted-planning-firebomb-democratic-headquarters-sacramento/"&gt;CBS’ Bay Area affiliate&lt;/a&gt;, in the understatement of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford made a premium gas fragrance for EV owners who miss the smell of fossil fuels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kBEz0pKxjDuDp_xgMMFV_FqCQ9Y=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69592699/Ford_Mach_Eau_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My face when I sniff gas...perfume.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Ford, Christopher Ison&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z5XK2r"&gt;So you just dropped a cool $59,000 on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403756/ford-gt-performance-mustang-mach-e-electric-suv-range-specs"&gt;a Ford Mustang Mach-E GT&lt;/a&gt;, your own sporty slice of our electric future, made by a company that only knows how to build them tough (Ford Tough, to be precise). What happens when you go to plug in your new car and you miss that telltale whiff of chemical-y gasoline smell wafting from its insides? &lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/07/14/ford-mach-eau.html"&gt;According to Ford&lt;/a&gt;, you substitute it with a “premium fragrance” inspired by gasoline called “Mach-Eau.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7ae6s"&gt;Mach-Eau — the name does not get better the more I type it — was born from a survey conducted by Ford Europe that found that 1 in 5 drivers will miss the “smell of petrol most” when they switch to an electric car. Naturally, wanting to push more &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265570/mustang-mach-e-review-electric-ford-ev-photos-video"&gt;Mach-Es&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;F-150 Lightnings&lt;/a&gt; into the world, Ford settled on an olfactory solution. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/07/15/ford-petrol-scent-for-electric-cars-barrier-ev-adoption/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Electrek &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, Mach-Eau isn’t for sale, but Ford’s offered a pretty vivid description for anyone who didn’t get to smell the fragrance when it debuted at the Goodwood Festival of Speed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-1SHuI6j22XmLFCYymT0NUwVPe4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722394/Ford_Mach_Eau_3.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ford designed an elegant container for the Mach-Eau.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nje0Vu"&gt;Ford and Olfiction, Ford’s fragrance partner on Mach-Eau, says aside from reminding you of gasoline, the fragrance contains notes reminiscent of almondy benzaldehyde, a smell associated with car interiors, and para-Cresol, which provides the rubber smell of tires. Those were further blended with blue ginger, lavender, geranium, and sandalwood for additional smoky, metallic, and rubbery notes. The company also included an “animal element” to give the “impression of horses.” Lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEaAcU"&gt;As someone who’s dabbled in liking the smell of gasoline, I appreciate the sentiment. You don’t have to be on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meNbh90DZJ0"&gt;an episode of &lt;em&gt;My Strange Addiction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to admit that there are strong memories tied to fuel smells that are hard to avoid. Would I buy a gasoline fragrance if Ford was brave enough to sell it, though? Only for the bit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to change your iPhone’s text size for a specific app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eTnXvK4Xy-tlW_cO9ot1wSwK5Tw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69592681/cgartenberg_210629_4653_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vtitae"&gt;Sometimes you want the text in your app to be smaller, so you can fit more content on a single screen. Sometimes you want it to be bigger, especially if you’ve been putting off buying those reading glasses. But until recently, if you had an iPhone, you had to pick a single text size as a standard for all your apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2h7Pgx"&gt;Not anymore. In iOS 15, you can adjust the text size separately for each of your apps. So you can, for example, keep the text small for your email, but make it a bit larger in Twitter — or vice versa. (Thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OmarShahine/status/1416015722174636033?s=20"&gt;@OmarShahine&lt;/a&gt; for the info.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BTHoFE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;One of the best hidden new iOS 15 features is per app font sizes. I like to use the smallest dynamic size system wide but bump up Outlook by one side since I read so much email. &lt;a href="https://t.co/aL8TxOIXVA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aL8TxOIXVA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Omar Shahine   (@OmarShahine) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OmarShahine/status/1416015722174636033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CUdOGB"&gt;If you’ve got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22524845/ios-15-how-to-install"&gt;the public beta of iOS 15 installed&lt;/a&gt;, here’s how you can adjust the text size for each app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3cDHH"&gt;First, you need to make sure the “Text Size” option is in your iOS Control Center:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Zb85Lz"&gt;Swipe from the upper-right corner to get to your Control Center. Check to see if “Text Size” is there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Q0DBBc"&gt;If it isn’t, then quit Control Center and go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Control Center.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f3J3dO"&gt;Under the “More Controls” subhead, find “Text Size” and tap the plus sign on the left to add it to your included controls. This will add it to your Control Center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To add Text Size, go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Control Center." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pi_CZZK0lWy_Z0gRc8_4uYmFjTU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722289/IMG_ACABE3FA7DC3_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Control Center,” then find “Text Size” and tap the green plus sign.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Text Size will now be part of the included controls." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QKlHTFYFkBpR78OLt5s9WUBYIAE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722291/IMG_AEE5CFDB6AF2_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Text Size” will now be part of the included controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5tfcoG"&gt;Once that’s done, it’s simple to tweak the text size for each app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="oQxLaT"&gt;Open the app that you want to configure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DcG7Nb"&gt;Swipe from the upper-right corner to get to Control Center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you need to switch text size, swipe from the upper-right corner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap the double-A “Text Size” icon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Hxmd6X"&gt;Tap the “Text Size” icon (the one with the small and large A’s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="o9wtKb"&gt;At the bottom of the screen, you’ll see a toggle on the left for that specific app (for example, the left side of the toggle will say “Twitter Only,” and the right side will say “All Apps.”) Move the toggle to the left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wAo1FX"&gt;Once that’s done, use the main control in the center of the screen to set the text size for that app, and then tap anywhere on the screen to get back to the Control Center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The toggle at the bottom lets you switch text size for a single app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now you’ve changed the text size just for that app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="4jwEe9"&gt;Swipe up to get rid of the Control Center and you’ll return to your app. You should see the difference in the text size immediately — but that difference will not be reflected in other apps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jWTBAd"&gt;And, of course, if you want to switch back to a standard text size, just go back to the Control Center, select “Text Size,” and move the bottom toggle to “All Apps.” But be aware that you’ll be resetting all your apps to that text size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEjOQy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virginia will invest $700 million to bring broadband to every household in the state</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ilr2qoq9DNkDc8RiOwyN5JQhywQ=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69592583/acastro_170711_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3NLwbZ"&gt;On Friday, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) announced that the state plans to invest $700 million in American Rescue Plan funding to reach universal broadband connectivity by 2024. This new investment shaves four years off of the governor’s original plan to connect every household to high-speed broadband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYnmuI"&gt;The pandemic dramatically affected the ways in which people work and attend school — pushing many office-holders to renew efforts to ensure citizens are able to get online. According to Northam, more than 233,000 homes and businesses in Virginia are without broadband access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OvFKTn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Not just a luxury for some, but an essential utility for all”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yck6MG"&gt;“It’s time to close the digital divide in our Commonwealth and treat Internet service like the 21st century necessity that it is — not just a luxury for some, but an essential utility for all,” Northam said in a news release Friday. “The pandemic has reinforced how important high-quality broadband is for the health, education, and economic opportunity, and we cannot afford to leave any community behind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDSFJC"&gt;The Virginia General Assembly is set to meet for a special session on August 2nd to plot a path forward for spending the funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F00cMU"&gt;At a press conference announcing the investment Friday, Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) lauded the funding and promised that Virginia lawmakers were working alongside the governor’s office to produce future-proof connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQvtAm"&gt;“When we talk about broadband, let’s make clear we’re working under the governor’s leadership, not to some slow speed like 25 down and three up, but much higher speeds,” Warner said Friday. “So you actually can see somebody on a Zoom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxg9sz"&gt;In a July report, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) called on the Federal Communications Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568454/broadband-minimum-speeds-small-businesses"&gt;to rethink its current minimum broadband standard&lt;/a&gt; of 25Mbps download and 3Mbps upload speeds. The GAO said that most businesses in 2021 cannot run their operations effectively at such slow speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tXwsO"&gt;In March, President Joe Biden signed the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/American-Rescue-Plan-Fact-Sheet.pdf"&gt;American Rescue Plan&lt;/a&gt;, providing billions in COVID-19 relief for states. Virginia received more than &lt;a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2021/may/headline-895119-en.html"&gt;$4 billion in relief&lt;/a&gt;, the pool of money that will be used to support universal broadband connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YN5Jb"&gt;“This will be fiber, satellite, maybe wireless,” Warner said Friday. “This is the kind of future we all have imagined for quite awhile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kD1utN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CsHrEJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There’s enough Steam Deck demand to take Steam’s store down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Steam Deck multiplayer" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lwXKK_4AfiIyY6ReZQITDz05_44=/490x0:4417x2618/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69592427/Steam_Deck_multiplayer.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Steam Deck multiplayer | Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bTvlDO"&gt;Valve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;officially revealed&lt;/a&gt; its handheld PC gaming machine only a day ago, but that was apparently enough to spread the word — when the Steam Deck went up for preorder today at 1PM ET, the demand from gamers knocked Steam for a loop as the store produced error after error. Seemingly every step produced another pitfall: two-factor authentication if you weren’t signed in, some signed-in accounts had to sign in once again, credit card checks, even a wonky response from a system that pegged long-established Steam accounts as being “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xenolon/status/1416085213407551491"&gt;too new&lt;/a&gt;” to participate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zahv1t"&gt;Other parts of Steam got flaky during the crush of preorder interest, too. The entire Steam store, Steam’s community pages, and the age gate that lets you view mature-rated titles didn’t always work this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxPnYW"&gt;Two &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editors managed to get through the reservation process and put $5 in their Steam Wallet to reserve a Steam Deck, eventually, with a little luck and a lot of refreshing. Another made it through later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Steam Deck “servers busy” message" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fs_9CrQuSAci7jK9MGjDv9HAz20=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722268/steam_deck_busy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Richard Lawler&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Steam Deck “servers busy” message.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A typical Steam Deck ordering error." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0UmX40ND9kio-Cn7_nfT3NyDw4I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722259/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sean Hollister&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A typical Steam Deck ordering error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iClUoY"&gt;The reservation system opted to lock out people with new or unused accounts for the first 48 hours, so it’s hard to know if the problems were caused by demand from real people who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578902/video-game-handhelds-steam-deck-switch-playdate-analogue-pocket"&gt;won’t let handhelds go&lt;/a&gt;, or if bot operators found some way around the block. One &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor confirmed that his credit card company wasn’t blocking the transaction, even after receiving Steam error messages suggesting that was the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Expected order availability showing Q1 2022." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KH42PgbwRWgBorruxpHbI7qXYBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722790/stem_0avail.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Richard Lawler&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expected order availability showing Q1 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mhmgzH"&gt;Later in the day, people who got their reservations notched have noticed the Steam store page is updated. For those I’ve checked with, it shows “your expected availability” marked for early 2022. Does that mean that Valve expects day one supply to be extremely limited? We’ll find out more about the production plans as the Steam Dock’s launch date grows closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLb6SQ"&gt;On the customer end, it seemed just as difficult, if not more, than obtaining recent high-demand items like a PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22565905/nintendo-switch-oled-model-preorder-price-availability-where-to-buy"&gt;Switch OLED&lt;/a&gt;. The mess didn’t rise nearly to the level of issues &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/10/29/21539965/nvidia-rtx-3070-preorders-sold-out-micro-center-best-buy-newegg"&gt;we’ve seen trying to obtain a new graphics card&lt;/a&gt;, but if anyone figures out how to mine cryptocurrency on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578917/valve-steam-deck-nintendo-switch-xbox-series-x-ps5-spec-comparison"&gt;Zen 2 chip inside&lt;/a&gt;, then that could change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ASFpys"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you have questions about the Steam Deck reservation process, including regional availability, there's a reservation FAQ at &lt;a href="https://t.co/6Ln0KvIGlw"&gt;https://t.co/6Ln0KvIGlw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To learn more about Steam Deck, visit &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZOTx3KUCVK"&gt;https://t.co/ZOTx3KUCVK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steam (@Steam) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Steam/status/1416081471584956417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q1iLEY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 16th, 5:30PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about expected order availability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UPbs5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:49PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that another Verge editor made it through the process later in the day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
