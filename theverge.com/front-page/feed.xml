      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yKnWjjihFouz25rXFO4APrG8nfA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68880047/Switch_NewPokemonSnap_screen_01.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wGMKT5"&gt;During today’s Pokémon Presents presentation&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the company unveiled new gameplay footage for &lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294077/pokemon-snap-nintendo-switch-new-n64"&gt;long-awaited sequel&lt;/a&gt; to the N64 classic. The new footage showed off the lush and colorful settings that you will explore across the Lental region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkQmrM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap &lt;/em&gt;will have players assuming the role of a pokémon&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;photographer who will collaborate with the region’s pokémon expert, Professor Mirror, and his assistant Rita to observe pokémon in their natural habitats. Gameplay remains similar to its predecessor but introduces some new mechanics, such as a photo-sharing feature that will allow you to share your photos online, plus a ranking system so you can compete with other players across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhMPM1"&gt;The new footage is just one of many announcements presented. The Pokémon&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Company also announced it was working on a few projects focused on the fourth generation of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;titles, this includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302858/pokemon-diamond-pearl-remake-nintendo-switch"&gt;remakes for the original DS titles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt;: an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302841/pokemon-legends-arceus-open-world-rpg-nintendo-switch"&gt;open-world RPG set in the Sinnoh region&lt;/a&gt; that takes place long before the other &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omcZWq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt; will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230643/pokemon-snap-nintendo-switch-release-date"&gt;release on April 30th&lt;/a&gt; exclusively on Nintendo Switch. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What will changing Section 230 mean for the internet?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fyxJEPR5QSlfGsiXkpeezHabhjk=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68880015/VRG_ILLO_4450__002.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A virtual symposium on the internet’s most important law&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="5vBku1"&gt;Section 230, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268421/cda-section-230-25th-anniversary-reform-stakes-big-tech-internet"&gt;turned 25 years old this month&lt;/a&gt;, has played a central role in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation"&gt;shaping the internet&lt;/a&gt;. Over the past year, Congress has introduced several proposals to change the law — some of them drastic — but the bills have often focused on a handful of very large tech companies like Facebook and Google. In reality, Section 230 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18700605/section-230-internet-law-twenty-six-words-that-created-the-internet-jeff-kosseff-interview"&gt;created a lot of the web as we know it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="JsLnTB"&gt;On Monday, March 1st, we’re &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/thevergelive/thevergearticle"&gt;holding an event&lt;/a&gt; on Section 230 and the future of tech regulation. After a keynote from Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), I’ll be sitting down with Wikimedia Foundation general counsel Amanda Keton, Vimeo general counsel Michael Cheah, and writer and strategist Sydette Harry to discuss how changing Section 230 could change the web. For a broader sense of its impact, however, I also spoke to a range of companies, nonprofits, legal experts, and others with a stake in preserving or reforming the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oVMtpq"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="R4fYwk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laurent Crenshaw, head of policy at Patreon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ulUIBO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Patreon is an online funding platform for artists, musicians, streamers, and other creatives. Founded in 2013, it supports over 200,000 creators with more than 6 million patrons. Its users include podcaster Joe Budden, musician Amanda Palmer, and news host Philip DeFranco.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="5zUKTM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10347701"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MM6Pjc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does Section 230 impact Patreon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npmI3i"&gt;Section 230 matters to Patreon every single day because we are a platform that has hundreds of thousands of creators, that has millions of patrons that are communicating with each other and the creators, and creators that are creating new works on a daily basis. If we had to proactively take steps to identify and monitor, validate, and verify that content prior to posting, it would be incredibly difficult for that platform to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQdC1V"&gt;Even little tweaks, like when they talk about removing language around “otherwise objectionable” content, which really is what gives platforms the ability to have their own moderation guidelines — it’s just incredibly concerning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpGhtp"&gt;Because otherwise, we’re talking about a scenario where platforms are encouraged to not have any type of content moderation, while at the same time still potentially facing liability, or to have much more litigation directed at them without the protection that Section 230 provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AuFWlS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s say Section 230 gets repealed completely. What would the next year look like for Patreon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2pwoH"&gt;We would do everything within our power to continue to be a platform that funds creators. But at the same time, I think we would have to reassess how we go about deciding who we can fund through the platform, if suddenly we have to consider whether or not we’ll be liable for any content we’re directly funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8wDer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about more moderate options in bills like the PACT Act, which would do things like require publishing transparent moderation guidelines?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yL4sGC"&gt;Transparency reports are not the most controversial thing in the world. It’s something that we’re looking at doing in the future as well. Some of the items that are being proposed, like call centers, I think sound better on paper than necessarily in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLZ4eD"&gt;But at the end of the day, I think that honestly, any lawmaker proposals that are being considered need to make sure that they aren’t basically solving problems that are targeted towards larger companies, and at the same time, that they don’t throw the baby out bathwater in regards to creating a whole new sort of regulatory model — an approach that is overly burdensome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="jnmk9r"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aDHjZS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carrie Goldberg, author and victims’ rights attorney&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="X3MEwN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carrie Goldberg represents victims of online harassment, stalking, blackmail, and other crimes. She is the author of &lt;/em&gt;Nobody’s Victim: Fighting Psychos, Stalkers, Pervs, and Trolls&lt;em&gt;, and she represented Grindr user Matthew Herrick in a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tylerkingkade/grindr-herrick-lawsuit-230-online-stalking"&gt;&lt;em&gt;high-profile lawsuit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; that was ultimately dismissed on Section 230 grounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3Xel8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the core effect that you see Section 230 having online?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKGyvA"&gt;It emboldens platforms to give zero fucks about users. Since users can’t hold platforms liable for harms caused, platforms have no incentive to invest in design and operations to reduce or mitigate injuries. And I’m not talking about harms like being called a bitch on Twitter. I’m talking about child abuse victims’ rapes being on porn sites, 1,200 men arriving at your home for a gangbang because somebody is impersonating you on Grindr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7FDYey"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you harm your users, you should be sued, no matter how big or small.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0ydsyB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be your proposed changes to the law?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3R80FI"&gt;First choice is to completely abolish Section 230. Our current civil legal system already has barriers to entry to prevent frivolous suits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ct6JqQ"&gt;Second choice is eliminate the immunity for platforms that are solely in the business of being malicious, instances where a platform is put on notice of a harming user, and all causes of action alleging unlawful activity on platforms — especially dissemination of child sexual abuse material, child sexual exploitation, revenge porn, deepfakes, stalking, known rapists and abusers using dating apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxyuuT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think of some of the more common proposed changes to Section 230, like Facebook’s suggestion that sites should be required to release transparency reports?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRpcXQ"&gt;Facebook’s suggestion that it be required to release transparency reports is not a change to Section 230. Obviously, any proposal set forth by a platform should be regarded with side-eye. I want to throw up any time somebody suggests transparency as a fix. Transparency means nothing if nobody has the right to do anything about all the atrocities these companies are being transparent about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3WO4F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the criticisms of Section 230 reforms is that sites like Facebook can afford to effectively litigate around them, while smaller forums without the same resources will be disproportionately affected. Is that a reasonable fear? If it is, do you see a way to mitigate it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ErMWk"&gt;If you harm your users, you should be sued, no matter how big or small. The solution for small platforms is to honor the people using your product and make it safe. In no other industry is liability for harms based on the size of the business. My law firm of 13 employees can be sued just as easily for harms we cause as a law firm with 2000 employees. My solution is to honor and cherish my clients and not harm them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5ZNrY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If lawmakers did something like entirely repeal Section 230, how do you practically think the internet would change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cOaoVl"&gt;It would improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="paj7Us"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AWMAYU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Katie Jordan, director of public policy and technology for the Internet Society&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SS2c4Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Internet Society is a nonprofit founded in 1992 by internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn. It supports efforts to increase internet access worldwide, construct community networks in unconnected areas, and maintain openness and security online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJRNel"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the Internet Society’s position on changing Section 230?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sbpc0v"&gt;I think it’s a great goal to prevent misinformation and hate speech online, but I’m really not convinced that Section 230 is the right way to do that. The risks of change, or of unintended consequences, are significant. And I don’t know if we’re having a large enough conversation about what those risks are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cY2U2T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What sort of risks are you worried about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOZjKx"&gt;When the Internet Society approaches intermediary liability protection, we look at the whole stack. Section 230 is not just about platforms like Facebook, Google, and Amazon. It’s also about the underlying infrastructure and the intermediaries that move content and data from one place to another, whether it’s cloud providers, domain name registries, email servers, things like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJan4Q"&gt;If cloud providers get wrapped up in this conversation about pulling back intermediary liability protection, then by default, they’re going to have to reduce privacy and security practices because they’ll have to look at the content they’re storing for you, to know if they’re breaking the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="u3gHP1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Section 230 is not just about platforms like Facebook, Google, and Amazon.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eRvBSa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does that translate to actual pieces of legislation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNs6QA"&gt;The more specific we can be about the goal, the better the legislation will be. So if we’re very clear that there is a problem on social media platforms with misinformation, disinformation, and hate speech, then our goal can be to fix those things. But a lot of the legislation we’ve seen is so broad that it would be very difficult to limit it to just those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DClFBs"&gt;I think it would be fairly easy to say, there is a public concern with a handful of platforms dealing with speech in a way that maybe is not in society’s best interest. Let’s start there and see what we can fix. Because my fear is that if we don’t look very closely at the target, the unintended consequences of this will be so far-reaching that it will do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="KBxyOT"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QfTDxl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yiota Souras, senior vice president of general counsel for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xCImOp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NCMEC is a government-funded nonprofit organization fighting the abduction, abuse, and exploitation of children. Among other work with victims and law enforcement, it operates the CyberTipline, a system for reporting child exploitation on the internet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kc53o9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does Section 230 affect your work at NCMEC?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66q5xi"&gt;Section 230 denies victims the ability to bring a lawsuit if they have been exploited in certain ways through or on a particular platform. And because social media companies have that immunity, it reduces the potential that companies will do the most they can to make sure child exploitation content is not posted, not distributed, and is taken down right away, because there is really no legal incentive or for them to take those extra steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="LWRptZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There is no legal requirement for them to use any kind of detection or screening”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bg3XnF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Companies do have a lot of non-legal incentives, though, and many of them already put a lot of resources toward this problem. What kind of steps do you think adding legal liability would make them take?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1i2pR6"&gt;There are a lot of companies, especially some of the very large companies, that engage in really tremendous voluntary measures. But there are a lot of companies that don’t, and there is no legal requirement for them to use any kind of detection or screening. I think the fact that there are some companies that are trying as hard as they can and devoting immense resources and are prioritizing this is great. But they’re just a handful of the companies out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M0V1Ij"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s been one carveout already, FOSTA-SESTA, which removed liability protections for trafficking and sex work-related material. What has been the impact of that for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1htcK7"&gt;There have been a lot of ramifications. Backpage.com was taken down before FOSTA-SESTA, and what we’ve seen is that there has been no other central marketplace that’s come up and said “we’re Backpage 2.0.” It’s not normalized in the same way anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5g91bI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you think the value has been as a deterrent?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vhd9Cz"&gt;Right. And there have been some criminal and some civil cases that have moved forward representing victims against websites — some that involve a lot of claims, including FOSTA-SESTA. And they’re still working their way through court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="qM3fK4"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yJoiEa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maxine Doogan, president of the Erotic Service Providers Legal Education and Research Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="n8af9r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ESPLERP is a legal advocacy group supporting decriminalization and legal protection for sex workers. It was one of several organizations to oppose FOSTA-SESTA on the grounds that it &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackinghustling.org/erased-the-impact-of-fosta-sesta-2020/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;penalized consensual sex work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4ABQ6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s been the impact of FOSTA-SESTA on sex workers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pG0rM"&gt;It’s been a disaster. We lost a whole bunch of our sites, a whole bunch of our advertising. Now we have sites that are charging us huge amounts of money in bitcoin. I think Congress is very conscious of the position that they’re forcing us into, which is that, you know, a bunch of people have lost their jobs. A bunch of people have been forced back onto the streets. A bunch of people have been forced to work together in order to maintain their indoor location because the rents are so high — you could afford it before FOSTA-SESTA, now you can’t because you have less access to advertising. So now you have to share space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zJQJCp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A bunch of people have lost their jobs. A bunch of people have been forced back onto the streets.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnK0p7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think of newer efforts to change Section 230?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PY0a2a"&gt;They’re missing the point, and they’re missing the bigger issues that society has refused to address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPY3Ic"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kinds of issues should lawmakers be focusing on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="reRnQc"&gt;They need an anti-discrimination law for all erotic service providers — we are discriminated against regardless of our legal or illegal status in housing, child custody, and access to education. Financial institutions are being allowed to systematically discriminate against us in access to them. They need to be providing us with some actual rights with their legislation, instead of continuing to strip our rights away from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zzqJ1Y"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="q7oDMk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Al Smith, communications strategist for the Tor Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nG4kFf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tor Project is the nonprofit behind Tor, an open-source encryption tool for remaining anonymous online. Tor is used by journalists communicating with whistleblowers, human rights activists living under repressive governments, and millions of others worldwide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yb4ZVn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does Section 230 mean for the Tor Project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYiPzm"&gt;Tor relies on Section 230. Without it, the organization would be vulnerable to lawsuits brought by anyone who believes that a Tor user harmed them. For instance, because of Section 230, if someone uses Tor to protect their identity in order to criticize or report about a governmental official (something journalists and activists often do), Tor cannot be sued for facilitating or aiding and abetting or otherwise. Tor is a small nonprofit, and even a suit that was not meritorious could easily sink it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yQBYoQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Tremendous collateral damage to important parts of the internet”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uaCa7u"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think of some of the most common proposals for changing Section 230?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWvnCr"&gt;Overall, these proposals seem to be based on anger at Facebook and Google and a few other tech giants. A huge variety of tools are protected by Section 230, and most of the proposals for changing it will cause tremendous collateral damage to important parts of the internet like Wikimedia, the Internet Archive, and Tor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzMfGB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are a few specific proposals on the table, including rules that require services to remove illegal content. How would those affect you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1BSgH"&gt;Because Tor does not host content, and because of the nature of the tool, it is impossible to know every single person and organization that uses its free, open-source technology. Tor could not comply with any “removal” requirements put forth by some proposals that change Section 230.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rRqVTx"&gt;Any such law must differentiate between tools that store and host content and those that do not — Tor is the latter. Often these proposals are aimed at forcing tools like Tor to weaken or eliminate their use of encryption (e.g., EARN IT Act), and that would be extremely dangerous for all Tor (and all internet) users who need strong encryption to stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PIehQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since Tor is a global service, how much does Section 230 matter for people using it outside the US?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8tl1c"&gt;Section 230 is hugely important for people using Tor outside the United States. Many of our users outside of the US rely on Tor because, in order to stay safe and fight for a better world, they require encryption and security — human rights defenders, political dissidents, journalists, whistleblowers, domestic violence survivors looking to escape, and more. Any effort to “reform” Section 230 that makes Tor less secure or provides an opportunity for litigation against it for what its users do could be catastrophic for users around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9l7Kbk"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Wqj2SN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mary Anne Franks, president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5WB8Fm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mary Anne Franks is a professor at the University of Miami School of Law as well as the president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, an organization that combats civil rights abuses online. She also drafted the first model criminal statute banning nonconsensual pornography or “revenge porn” online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfoKMU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has Section 230’s impact been on the internet? What would the internet look like if it had never been passed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsnJ2w"&gt;The internet with Section 230 is like an auto industry with no safety regulations or a restaurant industry with no hygiene standards. Imagining an internet without Section 230 requires imagining what kinds of industry standards would have developed over the last 20 years if tech companies had not been assured that they could act as recklessly as they wanted without fear of liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IReqfY"&gt;How might companies have designed their platforms and services differently if they knew they could be held responsible for failing to take reasonable steps to avoid foreseeable harms? How much less likely would it be that the internet would be controlled by a tiny number of multibillion-dollar corporations wielding power without responsibility?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TAt0rb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How might companies have designed their platforms and services differently if they knew they could be held responsible?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zDewMA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How deep should this responsibility go? Should infrastructure providers like Cloudflare, web hosts, and domain registrars be responsible for their customers’ content, or for the content their customers allow?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpevqC"&gt;These kinds of questions are impossible to answer in advance because they are so contingent on the facts of particular situations, and Section 230 keeps them from getting to courts where they can be worked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6a1Usi"&gt;In addition to very (some, like me, would say, overly) robust First Amendment protections, there are lots of challenges to holding a third party responsible for the conduct of someone else. If Section 230 were repealed tomorrow, it wouldn’t mean that Cloudflare or Facebook or any online intermediary would suddenly become liable for user behavior. It would simply mean that at least some of the time, online intermediaries would have to show up to court and explain why they aren’t liable, and sometimes they would lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1e7oxL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of content that people complain about, like misinformation, seems like a First Amendment question rather than a Section 230 question.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3YW2G"&gt;The First Amendment is not a fixed rule, and what it protects in 2021 is very different from what it protected in 1996 or 1896 or 1789. It is not, despite many Americans’ passionate belief to the contrary, a clear, consistent, or principled doctrine. It has chiefly served to protect powerful groups’ right to speak freely, even and especially when that speech chills the speech of less powerful groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FimL2J"&gt;The Section 230 debate is so fraught in part because the public has been trained to believe that everything they do online is speech, and that none of this speech can be regulated. But people use the internet for a vast array of activities, from buying toilet paper to making hotel reservations to watching movies, and it has been used by intermediaries to avoid liability for many things that would not qualify as protected speech under the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2lyY2"&gt;That problem could be addressed by replacing the word “information” in Section c(1) with “speech,” making it clear that the law’s protections cannot extend beyond protected speech. That by itself won’t solve all the problems with Section 230, but it would be a way to rein in some of its worst excesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="FgVphe"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1IXfdr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca Tushnet, co-founder of the Organization for Transformative Works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8XlU3M"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rebecca Tushnet is a professor at Harvard Law School. She is also a co-founder of the Organization for Transformative Works, a nonprofit that supports fanworks through projects like the Archive Of Our Own (AO3), a Hugo Award-winning archive hosting more than 7 million fanworks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DG6DVR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is Section 230 important for the Archive Of Our Own?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfEatj"&gt;Section 230 shapes what happens every day — it allows us to moderate with confidence that, if we make one mistake, the hundreds of times we remove content that violates our policies won’t be held against us. 230 is vital in allowing our volunteers who handle abuse complaints to make reasonable decisions without having a lawyer review every ticket they see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="C2romj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The question that I have is, what do you want the world to look like?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QKQKDK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some lawmakers want to require sites to remove illegal content within 24 hours. How would that affect AO3?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MWLQGN"&gt;That seems both not very troubling and completely unresponsive to the things that everyone is complaining about. There is only one site of any note of which I am aware — Ripoff Report — that refuses on 230 grounds to remove content that a court has found illegal (and even it wiggles on that, I believe). Most sites respond to court orders voluntarily, enough so that there’s a real problem of forged court orders used to remove content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BbkGn"&gt;I think this is a big gap in understanding: even most awful, abusive messages on their own are not illegal. If one person sends a stream of abusive messages, maybe that’s harassment, but if 100 different people send one message, none of them are actually liable for criminal harassment unless we change the criminal law. And there are reasons we might do that, but we definitely haven’t yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcx9qS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there legal changes that could push Facebook or Google to moderate better, but wouldn’t catch smaller operations like AO3 in the crossfire?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cnuoyk"&gt;I think we’re increasingly seeing really interesting discussions around using antitrust law. So antitrust remedies don’t necessarily have to include breaking somebody up. They can include saying, “Okay, this is how you have to behave.” I have to say, though, I have some — not a great deal, but some — sympathy for Facebook. Because remember the scale they’re dealing with. So even if they’re right 99.9999 percent of the time, the one time that they screw up is going to be bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8Dq9I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a counterargument that if a site is designed to scale in a way that makes tragedies inevitable, you should just say it’s sort of “unsafe at any speed.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jg4hpE"&gt;The question that I have is, what do you want the world to look like? Because let’s be realistic about this: a site that does not make billions of dollars a year in advertising will not have 100,000 people doing content moderation. If you want a full-time staff moderating all content, then you need to figure out how that will be paid for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GOWFpu"&gt;If what you’re saying is, we don’t want this volume of speech online — that is a thing to say, but I think it has real consequences for lots of good stuff, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="1HJCLu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior reporter Ashley Carman returns to the show to discuss Spotify’s big event this week announcing its plans for helping podcasters and artists make money, Twitter’s new substantial product features like the all-new Super Follow, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Apple Fitness Plus review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Legends: Arceus is an open-world RPG coming to the Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ey6yJBUgJNM67fcF9v1lyFlcV10=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68879860/1.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kk6snD"&gt;At a special live-streamed event today, The Pokémon Company revealed something fans having been waiting a long time for: an open-world &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; adventure. The next major entry in the franchise will be called &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt;, and it looks to be a huge evolution of the long-running RPG formula. The developers describe it as a “pre-make,” which offers “a new challenge and a new frontier for the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ysI3SG"&gt;The story takes place in the Sinnoh region, at a period that appears to be long before other &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; games, and will include a number of iconic monsters like Piplup, with your choice of starters including Rowlet, Oshawott, and Cyndaquil. It’s expected to launch worldwide on the Switch in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rgwn94"&gt;Here’s the basic premise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Ov1hbH"&gt;As trainers explore the natural expanses in &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt;, they’ll encounter pokémon that call these grand vistas home. To catch wild pokémon, players can study the pokémon’s behaviors, sneak up to them, then throw poké balls. Players can also battle wild Pokémon with their ally pokémon. By throwing the poké ball holding their ally pokémon near a wild pokémon, players will seamlessly enter battle. This new gameplay angle is intended to provide trainers with an immersive experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="i1Y6NO"&gt;At the same event, the company also revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302858/pokemon-diamond-pearl-remake-nintendo-switch"&gt;upcoming remakes of classics &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pearl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which will also be coming to the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KNUFtH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;First came Sinnoh remakes. Then came Sinnoh pre-makes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introducing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonLegendsArceus?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PokemonLegendsArceus&lt;/a&gt;, a new challenge and a new frontier for the Pokémon world. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Kgm8Y1UPjm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Kgm8Y1UPjm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Pokémon (@Pokemon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/1365321297190940673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LSo5S0"&gt;The last major &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; release was &lt;em&gt;Sword&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shield&lt;/em&gt; on the Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962722/pokemon-sword-shield-review-nintendo-switch-launch-date"&gt;which debuted in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and was followed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304196/pokemon-sword-and-shield-isle-of-armor-expansion-review"&gt;several expansions&lt;/a&gt;. Those games also introduced an open-world-like region called the Wild Area, hinting at this next evolution. Also on the way is a &lt;em&gt;League of Legends-&lt;/em&gt;style multiplayer game, called &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286163/pokemon-unite-moba-nintendo-beta-test-canada"&gt;going into open beta in March&lt;/a&gt; (in Canada, at least), as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230643/pokemon-snap-nintendo-switch-release-date"&gt;a new version of the beloved &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTdEcB"&gt;Today’s announcement comes as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297819/pokemon-25th-anniversary-nintendo-game-boy-pikachu"&gt;a 25th anniversary celebration for the franchise&lt;/a&gt;. Outside of new games, The Pokémon Company is also hosting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278179/post-malone-pokemon-concert-25th-anniversary"&gt;a virtual concert on February 27th&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/2/25/22300982/post-malone-pokemon-25th-anniversary-hootie-blowfish-cover"&gt;headlined by Post Malone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Diamond and Pearl are getting remakes for Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nUoxJ5a5JrkLrEIGmosyqsDv9bY=/341x0:2213x1248/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68879844/Screen_Shot_2021_02_26_at_10.21.49_AM.5.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F18cCr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Diamond &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Pearl &lt;/em&gt;will be remade for Nintendo Switch. The Pokémon Company announced the news today during a special Pokémon Presents broadcast. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Brilliant Diamond &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Shining Pearl &lt;/em&gt;will launch in late 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjXf7M"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diamond &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Pearl &lt;/em&gt;launched in 2006 for Nintendo DS. The game introduced the Sinnoh region, home to pokémon such as Bidoof, Luxio, Drifloon, and Arceus. The updated versions have a cute, chibified look, though both are “faithful remakes” of the originals. A trailer released alongside the news today teases familiar locations and faces in the Switch version, as well as some quality of life upgrades.  &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Home&lt;/em&gt; developer Ilca is working on both games alongside longtime Game Freak director Junichi Masuda . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YbUYq9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BjCwUk06ZSk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9JIuKa"&gt;There’ve been rumors of &lt;em&gt;Diamond &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Pearl &lt;/em&gt;remakes online for the past few weeks. This year marks the games’ 15th anniversary, alongside &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;’s overall &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297819/pokemon-25th-anniversary-nintendo-game-boy-pikachu"&gt;25th anniversary&lt;/a&gt;. The company has been celebrating with virtual concerts featuring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228760/pokemon-25th-anniversary-katy-perry"&gt;Katy Perry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/2/25/22300982/post-malone-pokemon-25th-anniversary-hootie-blowfish-cover"&gt;Post Malone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXRUy6"&gt;The Pokémon Company also announced an open-world RPG, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302841/pokemon-legends-arceus-open-world-rpg-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for Switch today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Final Fantasy VII Remake with a free PS5 upgrade is $30</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jpxq5C"&gt;Yesterday, Square Enix announced that it plans to release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;an enhanced version of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; for PS5&lt;/a&gt;, and there is a free next-gen upgrade available if you own the game digitally or physically. You can purchase a physical copy of the game &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZS80PC2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;right now for $30 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Note that if you plan to take advantage of this deal, you will need to own a PS5 with a disc drive to claim your free PS5 copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p85hOB"&gt;Although the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302776/finalfantasy-7-remake-free-playstation-plus-march-2021"&gt;will be free on PlayStation Plus beginning March 2nd&lt;/a&gt;, Sony confirmed that the PS Plus version &lt;strong&gt;will not be eligible&lt;/strong&gt; to receive a free upgrade. So, you’ll either need to buy the next-gen version, which &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-CUSA07211_00-FFVIIREMAKE00000"&gt;starts at $70&lt;/a&gt;, or buy the PS4 version, the latter of which I think is the better deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FqnB95"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546364"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="utCSDe"&gt;While on the topic of next-gen, if you are in the market for a new TV that takes advantage of next-gen, LG’s CX OLED line is one of the best options at the moment. Right now, the 65-inch model is on sale at a couple of places, most notably Newegg, where you can &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Flg-oled-cx-65%2Fp%2F16C-000P-004G1%3FDescription%3Dlg%2520cx%26cm_re%3Dlg_cx-_-16C-000P-004G1-_-Product%26quicklink%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy it for $1,997 and also receive a free $200 Newegg gift card&lt;/a&gt;. The TV is also on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0817H41YN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $1,950&lt;/a&gt; (when you apply a coupon), but it does not come with a $200 gift card.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Mj3iDj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9534696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kBOkeV"&gt;Last November, AMD released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506447/amd-zen-3-ryzen-5000-processors-gaming-cpu-price-release-date"&gt;new line of desktop CPUs&lt;/a&gt;. The Ryzen 5000 line includes the first chips from the company that carry its next-gen Zen 3 architecture. Like most highly anticipated gadgets released at the tail end of 2020, these processors at first were a bit difficult to find. But, if you are looking to buy the midrange $449 Ryzen 7 5800X, it’s available now at &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/AMD/Computers/Electronic_Components/Microprocessors/1411790"&gt;Antonline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1598376-REG%2Famd_100_100000063wof_ryzen_7_5800x_3_8.html%2FSID%2F00fa3612783911ebaccaee7b3f3e8d1f0INT#donotlink"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733394688089718680" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h44wiH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10363165"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="49lvgp"&gt;Lastly, Amazon is currently running a promotion where you can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fpromotion%2FABW7BWU3Q6D6Y&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F2%2F26%2F22302827%2Ffinal-fantasy-vii-remake-ps5-upgrade-lg-cx-4k-tv-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $40 when you purchase two eligible Surface accessories&lt;/a&gt;. Some items eligible for the promotion include the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074GYX6VR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Pen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071DTNNL7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Arc mouse&lt;/a&gt;, a nice pairing if you’re picking up a new Surface device at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC authorizes $50 discounts for low-income households’ internet bills</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KCFxylpy-QyTrXtZhcZyuedGuzM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68879514/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H0iuzF"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330663/DOC_370324A1.docx"&gt;voted unanimously on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; to adopt a program that provides emergency discounts of up to $50 per month toward broadband internet service for low-income households. The Emergency Broadband Benefit Program also provides up to $75 per month for households on Native American land and a one-time discount of up to $100 on a tablet or computer for those who qualify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFKkfn"&gt;The $3.2 billion for the program was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22193133/us-coronavirus-covid-relief-stimulus-package-broadband-huawei-zte"&gt;approved by Congress in December&lt;/a&gt; as part of a $900 billion coronavirus relief package. The subsidies are available to households that already participate in an internet provider’s low-income or pandemic relief program, subscribers to its Lifeline program, households with children receiving free or reduced-price meals at school, Pell Grant recipients, people on Medicaid or receiving SNAP benefits, and others who have lost their jobs over the past year, the commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjbr7b"&gt;The FCC still has to set up a program to approve applicants for the program and to bring internet service providers on board, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/technology/fcc-broadband-low-income-subsidy.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABZxRp"&gt;The lack of consistent internet service across the US has been in the spotlight during the pandemic, as students in low-income areas struggled to participate in virtual classes. The FCC said last year that &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-20-50A1.pdf"&gt;at least 18 million people&lt;/a&gt; in the US still don’t have reliable home internet connections, but the number is widely believed to be much higher; the FCC considers a ZIP code to have broadband if only one home in a census block actually has internet service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0Vi24"&gt;“This is a program that will help those at risk of digital disconnection,” FCC acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement Thursday. “It will help those sitting in cars in parking lots just to catch a Wi-Fi signal to go online for work. It will help those lingering outside the library with a laptop just to get a wireless signal for remote learning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKzwjm"&gt;Rosenworcel said the program will be available within 60 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sETPoR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Citizen will now tell you why helicopters are flying overhead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dg0Ls92cl9wDGbVm9I8ons2kZME=/341x0:4391x2700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68879285/Helicopter_Media_Asset.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Citizen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="drPv0m"&gt;Citizen, the app that turns everyone into a crime reporter, now wants to track helicopters. The company announced today that it’s introducing helicopter tracking to the app, which will explain to users why there are flying vehicles overhead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRQDYd"&gt;The team tells The Verge it employs a 24/7 group to review 911 communications, and now they’ll review data about police helicopters, too. Like any other info on Citizen, users can add their own videos and comments about the incident while Citizen verifies it on its end. When possible, the team will include a “related incident” for a helicopter spotting that’ll better explain the situation. That way, if the helicopter pertains to a missing person report, for example, that report will be linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CT9Ckb"&gt;The helicopter tool is the latest in Citizen’s arsenal in its attempt to become the place where people get all their local crime info. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it introduced an in-app contact tracing tool, and the company says it’s seen over 7 million signups since its launch in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0I3el"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best noise-canceling headphones to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of Sony’s 1000XM4 noise-canceling headphones on someone’s head." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VzENdS38TVENxg-3frszRkv9t0M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67126629/IMG_0625-1.0.7.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Get some peace and quiet with the best noise-canceling headphones for a variety of uses&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lvXWQl"&gt;Forget about taking them on a plane: noise-canceling headphones have done a better job proving their worth now — during all these months many of us have spent working at home — than ever before. They’re an essential piece of kit for finding some peace and quiet when you’re in a shared living space. And when you venture outside, they’ve only gotten more impressive at hushing those distractions, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLU1nQ"&gt;No matter how you’re using them, the criteria for picking the best noise-canceling headphones haven’t changed: the most important measures are comfort, how well they can eliminate outside noise, sound quality, battery life, and whether they support multipoint pairing so you can connect to two audio sources at once. The right headphones for you will differ based on which of those things you prioritize, but our overall pick for the best noise-canceling headphones is&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They offer a good mix of sound quality, everyday durability, and great noise cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XtIOrp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4dlNC4"&gt;But if you’re looking for something a bit different, there are still plenty of options. If you’re an iPhone owner and will only settle for the best, the AirPods Max live up to their price. But Sennheiser and Shure also sell some tremendous ANC headphones if sound quality is your main focus. Trying to find the best headphones for Zoom life? Microsoft and Bose both have strong contenders. And if you’re after something a little more stylish, Marshall’s headphones just might surprise you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="pNy3BT"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones in 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9ToLHX"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A photo of Sony’s WH-1000XM4, the best noise-canceling headphones for most people, resting on a table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nfnb67pDrZK7noQDhl7_IliL-CM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21699857/IMG_0620-1.0.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s 1000XM4 headphones remain the overall best noise-canceling headphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FIBBVA"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="e21VnC"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for most people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="49SoTG"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 might look identical to the previous 1000XM3s, but the company has made slight design tweaks for added comfort on those days when you find yourself wearing the M4s for hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjKN0Y"&gt;Noise cancellation has been further improved from the performance of the M3s, putting Sony neck and neck with Bose in overall effectiveness of silencing your surroundings. Sound quality is basically identical to the previous headphones — it’s still punchy, full, and very enjoyable — as is the marathon 30-hour battery life. But Sony addressed two of the biggest issues with the M3s this time around: the 1000XM4s have improved voice microphone performance, and they can now connect to two devices simultaneously, so you can stay clued into what’s happening on your phone when you’re working away on your laptop or tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iloOp"&gt;Sony also has a really unique trick for convenience: the optional “speak to chat” function will automatically pause your music and pipe in ambient audio when the headphones detect you’ve started talking, which is handy when you’re grabbing a coffee. And unlike their predecessors, the 1000XM4s can tell when they’ve been removed from your ears for auto-pause. They still cost the same hefty $350, but you’re getting more for your money with the 1000XM4s than before. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max don’t come cheap, but they’re the best noise-canceling headphones for sound quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TSER3c"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;2. Apple AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="b7jGRn"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for sound quality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="AXEBd8"&gt;There was definitely some sticker shock when Apple introduced a $549 set of noise-canceling headphones. The AirPods Max cost significantly more money than any of our other recommendations. But Apple’s build quality is on another level: these trade the plastic you’ll find in many noise-canceling headphones for steel and aluminum, and the ear cups are a breathable mesh fabric. They’re hefty headphones, there’s no denying that. But aside from Apple refusing to include a headphone cable in the box, there’s nothing about the AirPods Max that feels cheap. And I appreciate the simplicity of using the digital crown for controls instead of relying on hit-or-miss gestures like taps and swipes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KK007J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2d4O3y"&gt;The most important part is that the AirPods Max deliver the best audio quality you can get from high-end Bluetooth headphones. They have an immersive, wide soundstage, fantastic dynamics, and you’ll find yourself hopping around your music library just to hear what they bring out in your favorite songs. Apple’s noise cancellation is right up there with Sony and Bose, and no one does transparency mode better; at times, it can make you think you’re not wearing headphones at all. Extra features like Spatial Audio (surround sound for movies and TV shows) and automatic switching between Apple gadgets help make it a bit easier to swallow that daunting price.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVlWWZ"&gt;But the AirPods Max do have faults. The carrying case is abysmal, battery life is only average for the category, and just like regular AirPods, they’re designed with Apple’s ecosystem in mind. It gets much harder to justify dropping $550 on them if you live outside the iPhone and Mac universe.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shure’s first noise-canceling headphones offer fantastic build quality and support for codecs like apt-X HD and LDAC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VlEuiu"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 3&lt;/a&gt; and Shure Aonic 50&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yj00sX"&gt;The best sounding noise-canceling headphones if you’re not an Apple user&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rqLSMi"&gt;If you prioritize enjoying your music over drowning out the world, then both Sennheiser and Shure have fantastic options with superb sound quality and adequate noise cancellation. Sennheiser’s Momentum Wireless have detailed, bass-rich, and vibrant sound combined with sublime comfort. The same can be said for the newer Shure Aonic 50 headphones, which support advanced codecs like apt-X HD and LDAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hSuEdn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SGZqkd"&gt;If you’re a stickler for audio quality, both headphones can be used wired with either a 3.5mm headphone jack or over USB-C. They each outdo Bose and other more mainstream picks in terms of build quality and materials. That premium feel does demand a bit more, with both of these selling for the same $400 price tag. Their noise-canceling isn’t on par with the best, but you still get convenient software features like ambient passthrough and customizable EQ on top of the brilliant sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y9HzOw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361649"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Headphones 2 have intuitive dial controls and are a joy to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="i7fV4Q"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for multitasking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="GtniNJ"&gt;With the Surface Headphones 2, Microsoft retained the brilliant turning-dial control scheme of the first-generation pair and made noticeable improvements to sound quality and battery life. After you’ve gotten used to adjusting volume or noise cancellation levels simply by twisting the dial around each ear cup, you’ll never want to go back to hunting for button nubs again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dI25d6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361699"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PsR02w"&gt;The Surface Headphones 2 are also an excellent pick for productivity, as their multipoint pairing works seamlessly when a call comes in on your phone while you’re at work on your PC. Something about the way Microsoft handles simultaneous Bluetooth connections seems more reliable and consistent than what everyone else is doing. It’s rare that I encounter any bugs when connected to two devices at once. It’s hard to oversell this benefit during work-at-home life, and you get the convenience for much less cash than the Sony or Bose headphones. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose’s Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are excellent for all your Zoom and voice call needs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0FRbZM"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OJVxE6"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for voice calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="tdSxzI"&gt;Bose is the brand synonymous with noise-canceling headphones, and the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are another example of why that reputation is well-earned. They have satisfactory sound, excellent voice call quality, and great noise cancellation effectiveness. It’s really a flip of the coin between these and Sony’s 1000XM3 headphones in the eyes of many. Sony ekes out superior battery life and more lively, impactful sound, but Bose’s support for multipoint pairing with two devices at once is a big plus. The Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are comfortable to wear for long stretches of time, even if they aren’t as feather-light as the company’s less expensive QC35 II headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2PK7eH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9TYQUm"&gt;When it comes time to join a Zoom meeting or call someone, you’ll be heard loud and clear by whoever’s on the other end, which can’t be said for all wireless headphones on this list. Bose’s microphone setup on the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 is second to none, though Jabra also fares well here. Battery life is where Bose trails its competitors, with the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 rated at up to 20 hours — short of the 30 hours you can reach with Sony or other picks below. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Solo Pro headphones have an on-ear design and work best with Apple devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VroSfn"&gt;The best on-ear noise-canceling headphones&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ldtIVc"&gt;The Beats Solo Pro headphones rest on your ears instead of completely covering them, which some people might prefer. A popular choice at the gym, the Solo Pros have sweat resistance and a strong clamping force on your head so that they’ll stay put during a workout or run. As with most modern Beats headphones and earbuds, the Solo Pros are tuned to drive your day with some oomph to the bass, though they’re more well-balanced than Beats of old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sQrctH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361735"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jadUXW"&gt;If you use an iPhone, the Solo Pros can take advantage of Apple ecosystem features like audio sharing and the same seamless setup / pairing process as AirPods. They’ll also be getting the new spatial audio feature coming in iOS 14, which will let you get a surround sound-like experience when watching movies on your iOS device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0phvUS"&gt;They’re not as great at noise cancellation as Bose or Sony, but the on-ear design and a snug fit help the Solo Pros offer good passive noise isolation even when NC is switched off. (You can hit up to 40 hours of battery life if you keep noise cancellation off.)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Marshall Monitor II ANC headphones have a stylish design that ties into the company’s history.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mtvtN5"&gt;7. Marshall Monitor II ANC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DO2V4l"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for style&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="F7quUY"&gt;Marshall’s wireless headphones have proven surprisingly popular, and the company’s most expensive pair is also its best yet. The Monitor II ANC headphones are priced at $320, which puts them on the same playing field as Bose, Sony, and other tech companies that have been making premium noise-canceling cans for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ht7uR3"&gt;Marshall doesn’t quite match them in sound quality or NC effectiveness; the Monitor IIs have warm, textured sound and perform decently at cutting down on ambient noise. But they definitely stand out from the pack in looks, with a design that speaks to the company’s heritage. The headphones fold up for easy carrying, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/24/18018074/marshall-joystick-headphone-button-control-audio-bluetooth-wireless"&gt;Marshall’s signature gold joystick&lt;/a&gt; makes the Monitor IIs simple to control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f6QyVt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361724"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wFNLUi"&gt;They can also last up to 30 hours with NC enabled or up to a staggering 45 hours if you’re already someplace quiet and can do without the feature. That impressive longevity beats our primary picks. A lack of AAC codec support at this price stings, but I’ve enjoyed the Monitor IIs every time I’ve put them on. They’re more than just an amp brand stamped onto an average pair of headphones. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Monster Hunter Rise was made for the Switch, and it’s coming to PC, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jSwzjOtxkmWvGCzSdMJQ4-FYTMA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68879194/MHRise_Multiplayer_Tigrex_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KTXHM8"&gt;Capcom finds itself in an interesting position with &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt;, its new title for the Nintendo Switch. 2018’s &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter World&lt;/em&gt; was a huge triumph, bringing the series to a Western audience accustomed to home consoles and PCs and becoming one of the company’s bestselling games ever. But in doing so, it had to abandon some of the biggest factors behind &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt;’s Japanese success: portability and local multiplayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwc6Tg"&gt;Since Capcom started work on &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter World&lt;/em&gt;, though, the Switch has become a global hit, and on paper it sounds like it should be a perfect system for the series. It’s much more capable than the PSP and 3DS hardware that made &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; a social phenomenon in Japan, while offering the flexibility to let you play on your TV or on the go. That’s where &lt;em&gt;Rise &lt;/em&gt;comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ShULlt"&gt;“We think that by releasing this on a portable console we’ve made it a lot more accessible, a lot more easy to pick up and play,” producer Ryōzō Tsujimoto tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s also obviously easier to play with people in your immediate environment. So it’s very well suited for playing at home with your family, and you can pick it up and play whenever you want — you can do a couple of quick quests before going to sleep. So yeah, we think it might bring back some people [who didn’t play &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;] because of just how easy to access it is, how easy to pick up it is.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5iOIa480QmgNzdRRwG1Kx9odT0s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330479/MHRise_Multiplayer_Mizutsune_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KUlBdJ"&gt;But the Switch presents technical challenges for &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; compared to &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;, which used more powerful PS4 and Xbox One hardware as a development baseline. Earlier &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; games took place in small, numbered areas separated by loading screens, while &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt; had complex multilevel stages that you could seamlessly explore. &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; manages to split the difference — you wouldn’t mistake the environmental complexity for that of &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;, but the graphical fidelity is impressive for the Switch and there aren’t any loading times once you’re in a level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4l54rt"&gt;“In the very early stages of development, we were still kind of toying around the idea of keeping the same map system from the older games, with separate areas divided by loading screens,” says director Yasunori Ichinose. “But over the course of development, as we saw how &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt; was doing, we basically got the request to make all of the environments open like in &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;. So it wasn’t something that we planned from the start, but it’s something that we are definitely happy we did.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7eUEX"&gt;The stages also have a much greater degree of verticality compared to earlier games — Ichinose says that’s what the “Rise” in the title refers to — and the ability to zip around the environments with the new Wirebug or ride on the back of a canine Palamute companion offers further options for traversal. In fact, Ichinose says, that’s why Capcom decided to put the monsters’ locations on the map from the start of every quest, rather than force hunters to track them down from scratch — in &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt;, figuring out how to get to the monsters could be a challenge in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bmkjuh21KaIoA0T3jya1DdPb-UA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330480/MHRise_Multiplayer_Barioth_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xopD8W"&gt;Still, I wondered whether Capcom had weighed the risk of losing some of its fans who jumped on board with &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt; and might be expecting another technical leap forward. Could the move to Switch have an effect on &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt;’s popularity in the West? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhTnUA"&gt;“We’re not particularly worried about that,” Tsujimoto says. “I mean, every time that we make a &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; game, we make sure that it is a good, proper new &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; game. It’s not that we’re less invested in our portable entries or anything like that. It’s just that &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; is a game that just happens to be on a portable console, and so we’ve optimized it for that. But it doesn’t really change anything from a gameplay perspective — it’s still very much &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt;, so the fans will still enjoy it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="embHQ5"&gt;Besides, as Tsujimoto confirmed at the end of our interview, &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; is actually coming to PC as well, with Capcom targeting a release date sometime in early 2022. That should be a good option for anyone who’s reluctant to give up &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;’s smooth frame rates on modern hardware. If you’re planning to play on Switch, though, there’s just one month to go — &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; will be released worldwide on March 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
